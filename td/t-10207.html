<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">balzamaor</div><div class="date">2nd June 2003, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all:<br />
<br />
I new in Baan IV and Oracle.<br />
<br />
I would like to know, how can I acces to a table that is not in Baan ? .<br />
<br />
I mean, I want to read, insert, delete and update records in a table from Baan. This table already exist in an application that is not Baan. <br />
So,  How can I connect this table to Baan ? or Maybe, Does it exist some API to connect to a different database ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leenaa</div><div class="date">2nd June 2003, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Exist In which  Application ?????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">balzamaor</div><div class="date">2nd June 2003, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Why it's important the external application ?. <br />
( It is not a comercial applications. )<br />
<br />
The table is oracle too.    I know that we can connect from an external application with Baan vía OpenWorld, or update the Baan database vía SQL.<br />
<br />
But, How can we do this (update other database) from Baan to an external application ?.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd June 2003, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">In theory this is possible, but I do not recall anyone getting it working.  At one point our Oracle DBA set up a view into another database.  Then in Baan we created the table using the tools sessions.  We were able to read the table, BUT every time we went to create RDD for other tables we got errors from this table.  So we stopped it.  <br />
<br />
The typical method for doing something like this is to use interface programs and files.  One program pushes the data from Baan and another updates the external application.<br />

<br />
Until now, with db.link and view, we have the same.  We can read the table, and we can update and delete records that has been inserted from Baan. But we can't  update the records inserted outside Baan.<br />
<br />
Of course, we've got several interfaces with the thypical method. <br />
But I'm sure I will improve this interfaces, if I can do this integration. <br />
The clearest advantange is that I can manage (read and update) on line information of another application from Baan. <br />
<br />
I know a little bit about OpenWorld ( in theory ) and I only read information in order to integrate an external application with Baan, but in the other way ??.<br />
A real EAI is in two ways, isn`t it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd June 2003, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only read a little about Openworld, so I probably know less than you on this topic.  I would expect there should be a way to share a table between Baan and some external application, but I do not know it.  I would think if you built the tables in Baan and then attached another application to those tables, you should be able to write directly to them.  I have not done this myself.<br />

Please complete your user profile with regards to the Baan software version, Database software and OS version. This will help other members when diagnosing your problem. <br />
<br />
Refer to the links on the board -<br />
<br />
stored procedure oracle (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6448&amp;highlight=oracle) <br />

I mean, I want to read, insert, delete and update records in a table from Baan. This table already exist in an application that is not Baan. <br />
We have used to read and delete (purge tables) from the Oracle data dictionary. I have never tried to use the updates and inserts. I would prefer BaaN tools to handle the referential integrity counters/hash columns etc based on the L1/L2 drivers.<br />
<br />
As Mark, suggested the better way is to maintain the table in BaaN and keep the Oracle-DD in sync with the BaaN Table definition.</div></div><hr />

With a db.link and a view we can, from Baan, read,insert,update and delete records in another database.<br />
