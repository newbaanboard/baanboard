  <br />
For my client I need to extract modified and new records <br />
from Baan tables. (Both transactional and master data tables)<br />
<br />
Audit is not an option as the tables (PO) are heavily used.<br />
<br />
Is there any other method to extract incremental data without affecting the performance. <br />
<br />
Environment : Baan 5b<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time</div></div><hr />

<br />
I focus on sys admin and DBA types of activities with our clients but here is what I have seen to address this problem:<br />
<br />
1.  Use database triggers (some performance overhead, added complexity for upgrades and DBA activity).<br />
<br />
2.  Use audit (performance issues for Baan -- easy to administer).<br />
<br />
3.  Modify the Baan session to maintain a log of updated records (easy to do for one session, a pain if the table hasmany update points).<br />
<br />
4.  Use a point in time comparison table where updated records are replayed into the second instance (common for data warehouse environments that must push period based data into the system).  <br />
<br />
5.  Use a third party replication product (cost issues, easier to manage than triggers, lower performance hit than audit).<br />
<br />
6.  Live with the problem<br />
<br />
Just a few quick thoughts...<br />

<br />
be it PUR or SLS or INV or RPL  transactions, BaaN maintains a history line.<br />
<br />
Eg:  <br />
P.O order Header / Line tables are tdpur040/041<br />
<br />
BaaN maintains tdpur050/051 as a history/image of pur040/041 <br />
<br />
it has records marked with record type 1 / 2/ 3 to indicate new orders / deleted orders / invoiced orders<br />
<br />
This might help as this history is robust bcos only history information is extracted for BaaN BIS even.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Commandeur</div><div class="date">29th November 2001, 00:07</div></div><div class="posttext">With baanERP you have Data Access Layers  (DAL) for most of tables. It is the most reliable way (after DB trigers) to track tables transactions.<br />
<br />
The problem is that you need sources to do that.<br />
<br />
I did use a product named Qkey on baan IV that allow to add scripts for events. With that tool you can add log, audit, field content checking, ... without baan sources.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this product still exist for Baan V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">29th November 2001, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">One can use the DAL hooks to create history tables. The main drawback is if db.update/db.insert is used instead of dal.update/dal.new this will fail.<br />
<br />
As for QKEY, baanboard is hosting an opensource development of a similar product. See this thread http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=355</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan Tools</div><div class="date">1st December 2001, 03:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. I choose to use the PO history to see if there is a modification.<br />
<br />
Vamsi do u have the qkey like tool?</div></div><hr />

Yes!  QKEY supports both Baan IV and Baan V; it has for some time now.  The 3.x version includes support for DLLs as well as 4GL sessions and expanded set of directives to make it easier to call arbitrary parent events/functions.  The DLL support is more useful in Baan V where you have DALs -- thus you can add additional validations or methods (or add code before/after a method defined in the parent) in a DAL.<br />
