<br />
We can get the dates with no problem using an array.  When we try to populate the date buckets however, the forecast information is printed vertically instead of horizontally under the dates.  A simple array doesn't seem to work and we are left with multiple if/case statements instead.  How can we create an array to populate as follows:<br />
<br />
9/13     9/20   9/27<br />
155       204    373<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st September 2009, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this for a form or for a report <br />
<br />
What I did for a report was basically to create 2 arrays.  Each array was initialized to spaces before entering the loops.  The reason the arrays were characters was because in some cases they would run a variety of time frames - they could pick months or weeks and the number of buckets.  In this case I would first get the date range and then sum the hours - like this(not exactly, but something like it)<br />
<br />
startdate = initial date (from form)<br />
enddate = startdate + weeks or months depending on what user selected.<br />
for i = 1 to numcount (how many weeks or months)<br />
select sum(tisfc010.prtm):totalhrs<br />
from tisfc010.prtm<br />
where tisfc001.cwoc = some cost center<br />
and  tisfc010.prdt &gt;= startdate and tisfc010 &lt;= enddate<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
rptdate(i) = string value of date<br />
rpthrs(i) = str$(totalhrs)<br />
rprt_send()<br />
<br />
The actual code was more complicated than that, but that is the basic of what I did.  Then on the report I would have workcenter and the dates in the header(each workcenter had its own page).  Then hours (actual, production, capactity - a bunch of different calculations) went down the page.  <br />
<br />
It should work for either a report or a form.  On a form you just have to get the calculations in the correct even.  I would not do something like this with a form with scrollbars - it could be done, but would require a lot of coding.</div></div><hr />

We have no problem populating the dates across the header.  The problem comes in when we want to populate the forecast fields for those dates.  Our dates are each incremented by 7.  The results we get from our queries still give us forecast(1) for all dates on line 1 and forecast(2) for all dates on line 2, etc.  <br />

Thanks for trying.<br />

In the for loop on the select you would use whatever index you wanted to narrow down the records you want in each bucket.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you, thank you, thank you!  This code does just what we needed.  I think what we missed was adding up the total forecast for each 7-day period.<br />
<br />
This was very much appreciated.<br />
