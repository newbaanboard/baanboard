<br />
I have created a custom session.   I am receiving Baan Standard error &quot;message ttstps0108&quot; as the users tab through the entry form.<br />
<br />
The  table field on the form is calculated and uses the &quot;tcamnt&quot; domain and allows the user to change the form field rather than use the calculated amount. I am not using the domain format but my own set as ZZ9VD99.<br />
<br />
The data that is displayed is correct and all the user has to do is add a zero to the end of the entry and everything<br />
goes through and is saved and re-displayed correctly.  And going back to that entry, the user can type anything into it without that message reappearing.<br />
<br />
I have noted that others on Baan board have received this message but the circumstances appear to be different. -  Do you know what it means ?<br />
<br />
What can I do to solve my problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th October 2003, 23:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that is a generic domain / formatting error.<br />
<br />
Can you say - what is the exact calculated value with decimals that you calculate and return?  Your format of ZZ9VD99 requires 2 places after the decimal, so if you return 12.0 or anything with just 1 decimal, there may be a formatting error upon display.. ?  This would explain why it is solved if they add a 0 on the end.   Also, whatever the user types is automatically converted to the display format, so no formatting errors will occur then, that may not be true of your calculated value.  Also, you mention the error number - do you get a text for the error and what is the syntax of that..?</div></div><hr />

It was a formatting error.  The data calculated out to<br />
4 decimal places and I only provided two.<br />
<br />
As Soon as I rounded the result of my calculations, the<br />
error messages went away.</div></div><hr />

I write here another case about the problem.<br />
I have &quot;message ttstps0108&quot; from the well known tiitm0101m000, because a field (tiitm001.abcc) is defined for a set of values &quot;ABCabc&quot; and a new value is recently added (D) and used into tiitm001. <br />
The maintain session returns ttstp0108 after a tab-on-input on form, because the domain restriction works as a check input event.</div></div><hr />
