<br />
I'm looking for advise on copying data between companies in Baan. <br />
<br />
The script I'm working with (which copies item data) selects the data from the source company into variables, then updates or inserts with the contents of these variables. This works fine, but the code is very long as there is a single variable for each field of the table. I'm looking for some way to shorten this.<br />
<br />
I know it is possible in some dbs to store an entire row in an array or other structure and insert that. Is there an equivalent to this in Baan?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I would search on &quot;_compnr&quot; and start checking the various posts.  Not really sure of a good answer.  Also if you post your code someone might see other solutions.</div></div><hr />
