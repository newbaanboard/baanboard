       if week.prior.yn = tgyenox.yes then<br />
		brp1 = brp.open(&quot;rtimjrc43701000&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 1)		endif<br />
<br />
and selected the device as PS , i didnt get any file created hence tried in the other way<br />
          if week.prior.yn = tgyenox.yes then<br />
               brp1 = brp.open(&quot;rtimjrc43701000&quot;, &quot;POSTSCRIPT&quot;, 1)<br />
          endif<br />

Hello,<br />
your profile says you're on Unix (Solaris). The postscript file has to built in $HOME, and transfered by server.to.client, or stored in an SAMBA Share.<br />
