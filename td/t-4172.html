The definition type for that has to be in your Sytem. Normaly this files are in a folder &quot;barcode&quot;. The path to this folder has to be declared in your printerdriver. Often the last line.<br />
Use the field help in &quot;maintain report fields&quot; to find out about the rules how the barcodefiles on your system have to be named. Normaly tehy are named: type01, type02, type03...... Then you have to enter for the barcode type in &quot;maintain report fields&quot; a &quot;2&quot; if you would like to print a &quot;type02&quot;<br />
<br />
IÂ´m talking about a UNIX System.<br />
<br />
Maybe a easier was is to use bwprint an select a Barcode font.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klixy23</div><div class="date">22nd May 2002, 14:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I made some tests with the barcode option of bwprint. I used the Quick Guide 1310 &quot;Barcode Printing &amp; BWprint&quot;. It works with a little testing script and with only one barcode field. So I was happy, then it is very simple to use bwprint to print barcodes.<br />
I created a own session to print more complex labels. In the Quick Guide the author recommend an aspect ratio of &quot;3&quot; an I configured bwprint with different values. The result is, that barcodes with fewer characters are stretched up to the most length barcode and then all barcodes are stretched.<br />
<br />
I attach a file to make this effect more understanding. (Sorry for german labels.)<br />
<br />
I also try to reduce the length of the report layout field, but no effect.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to stretch the barcodes proportionally?</div></div><hr />
