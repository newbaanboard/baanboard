<br />
We've been using Baan since about 1997 - and learn new things every day.<br />
Today - one of our college Interns showed me a Hardcopy of a report that they said the generated out of Baan.<br />
<br />
It was supposed to be showing all Tables/Column used by a Session.<br />
It didn't look like a &quot;Where Used&quot; report that I'd normally see - no report header / no column headers.<br />
<br />
She said that she had generated it several months ago - and found it useful - and couldn't remember how she did it....<br />
<br />
I was kinda stumped......   Looked thru several of the Reports from the Session area - and not finding anything that looks similar.   <br />
I've considred that the report could have been produced by something that we had built on our own....<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that the session your looking for name is ttadv4430m000<br />
You can fibd it under Application Development &gt; Domains and Tables &gt; Reports.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

However this is not the Report output that I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
As it was described to me - the report is based on a Baan Sesssion - and lists all the Tables/Columns used by that Session.<br />
<br />
The ttaadv4430 is more based on a Table and what other Baan components reference that table......  <br />
<br />
What strikes me....is that the output they've shown me has no Report Headers or Column Headers - which makes me think that it could be a HomeGrown Session that was developed by one of our employees....<br />
<br />
The sample output they've given me is based on one of our own HomeGrown Baan Sessions - so it uses Non-Standard Baan Tables....<br />
<br />
Geez....I'm not sure I'm going to have any luck - I may have to just keep looking thru our VRC's to see if any session name looks like it may be it....<br />
<br />
We've customized Baan quite a bit - and created our own sessions and table to accomodate what Baan Standard didn't for our business needs.<br />
<br />
Thanks again - much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the session I mentioned  (form 1 - screenshot attached) you can specify a session and see all the tables/fields that where used in it. In Form 2 you can choose to see tables/fields that were used in that session by choosing 1/2 in the Detail Level<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

After some digging around - I finally found what they were looking for.<br />
<br />
Report is generated from sub-session:<br />
ttadv2832s000:Print Used Components<br />
<br />
This is found on Form 2 of the ttadv2130m000:Maintain Program Scripts session - using the Component Button - it displays the session.<br />
<br />
Output from this session ( for tiitm0501m000:Display item Data) is:<br />

Thanks to those who tried to point me in the right direction - just had to keep digging - I did point out BAANBOARD to these two interns so they'd have someplace to look for answers to general or specific questions.<br />

Thanks again,<br />

<br />
I went through the session u suggested and took the same example of item display session .. i.e tiitm0501m000.<br />
I selected on the components in the program script and with all the option enabled i took the print of it...<br />
<br />
i could only see the main table name.<br />
it didnt display the field names and other details .<br />
<br />
what could be the problem?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Raviraj</div></div><hr />

??? Not sure why you didn't get at least similar outptu to what I did.<br />
What exactly did it display for you?  Post part of the output.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it makes any difference - but I found 2 ways to get to the same output (extrememly similar - not sure if it's worth mentioning as different) But here it is:<br />
<br />
Path #1:<br />
Start at ttadv2100m000:Maintain Sessions /ttaadv321s000:Maintain Program Scripts Libraries - on Form 2 click &quot;Components&quot; button - brings up ttadv232s000:Print Used Components.<br />
<br />
<br />
Path #2.<br />
Start at ttadv2130m000:Maintain Program Scripts / Form 2 - Click on &quot;Components&quot; button - brings up ttadv232s000:Print Used Components.<br />
<br />
I also found the same &quot;Components&quot; button is available from session ttadv2131m000:Maintain Libraries<br />
<br />
On the ttadv232s000 session there are a number of check boxes &quot;Functions, Domains, Tables, Table Fields, Messages, Questions, Sessions, Menus, Charts, Libraries ) - which I assume controls what componensts associated with the code (script or library) the report will contain....  You say that you had all these check boxes checked?   <br />
<br />
? If you're not getting the same output from the session - and you're doing all this...I'm not sure why.</div></div><hr />
