<br />
I have a standard script which has been customized by us in our customized vrc i.e in B50C c cust vrc, now I physically removed this script from O/S Level, which means only objects remains in B50C c cust vrc and tools entry remains in ttadv2530m000 in B50C c cust.<br />
<br />
Now my current vrc is B50C c cust and when I select this record in ttadv2530m000 and try to edit it, as expected it gave a message that it could not find the script, but when I try to compile this Record by clicking the Compile option, it got successfully compiled to my surprise, where as ideally it should have thrown standard error that it cannot be compiled since my cust vrc doesnÂ’t have the source code at backend, so our observation is that it read script which was present in B50U c stnd vrc.<br />
<br />
We have recently moved to sp19 from sp10, so is it some new functionality of BaaN service pack i.e. some new parameter is introduced, or is it a bug :( ??<br />
<br />
Note : I am NOT using session ttadv2230m000 for compilation. I am using ttadvcompmenu which is called via ttadv2530m000 for compilation.<br />
<br />
Please advice. Also Refer to the attached VRC derivation structure.:confused: <br />
