<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">6th December 2004, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The captioned include file contains exactly the following two lines:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
        table   ttcmcs002<br />
<br />
        extern  string  fd.tcmcs002(4000)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only session that uses this include is:<br />
<br />
tfgld1109s000 - Maintain Non-Singular Tax Codes by Line<br />
<br />
In the program script of this session, I do not see any use of the field fd.tcmcs002. And these are not the only ones - there are the following includes with just two similar lines in them: itfgld801, itfgld206, itfgld205, etc.<br />
<br />
What am I missing here? Why would there be even a need for such include files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">6th December 2004, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about that one in particular.  That style of include, though, is used when they want to declare a set of variables/tables, and they are going to use that declaration in several places.  They make it re-usable.<br />
<br />
If, by chance, after they set that up, it turns out that they don't use it somewhere else, or they just made it that way for future use, who knows.  Just a programming thing, maybe something that is done one way, that once done, there is no reason to go back and change it, even though there is other ways to do the same thing that may be less confusing.  Some variables declared, then either never used or not used anymore.  Some of those functions are carried over from Triton even, this may just be the last remaining call to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you say was indeed what I was thinking of also, but the code was so 'official' looking, I thought maybe there is some substance to it.</div></div><hr />
