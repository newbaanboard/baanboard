 <br />
the function server2client() is located in ottdllbw. That means, you need a running BW client to use this function.<br />
 <br />

Yes. I am aware of it. Was just confirming about what you mean about ION &quot;file&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if its just a file transfer try this:-<br />
<br />
long ret<br />
exec_dll_function( &quot;ottdllbw&quot; , &quot;server2client&quot; , ret,&quot;D:\temp.txt&quot;, &quot;\\bgl005\d$\test\temp.txt&quot;, 0 )<br />
<br />
Make sure users have full right permission to the folder.</div></div><hr />

Make sure users have full right permission to the folder.<br />
<br />
<br />
unfortunatly it does not work too.<br />
<br />
i think it would be problem of permissions rights too.<br />
<br />
but for me it is not so clear which permissions?<br />
<br />
user of ION(service is running) has permission on this shared folder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are on Windows, give Full Rights to Everyone for this folder and try again. Generally, the bsp user should have full rights to the folder. But, its always better to put everyone in the list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) What is the value that ret= server2client returns?<br />
2) Does the local directory exist on this client?</div></div><hr />
