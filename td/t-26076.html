<br />
How can we use Baan Exchange Scheme to populate sale order data from a text file, which has several columns that data is not used for upload? <br />
<br />
Is it possible to use Exchange Scheme to read and populate only the required columns from a text file? How? Additional Script required? <br />
<br />
This one will be a dialy upload so we do not want to manually delete unused columns every time. <br />
<br />
Please advise. I'm really appreciate all answers. <br />
<br />
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you~ :D</div></div><hr />

You can only load those fields that are mandatory.  Other fields can just be skipped on the exchange scheme.  You can also skip columns that have not information not related to the table - just use a dummy field and do not include in the table relations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? IMHO EDI is a better way to do this. With exchange you would need a lot of programming in the conditions because you have to populate many tables for sales orders.<br />

I have been reading some posting. I found that it's not easy to use Exchange Scheme for complicated task. Unfortunately, I kinda have no choice. It's not my choice.  :(   <br />
<br />
I'm sorry. I'm really new to all this. What is IMHO EDI? <br />
<br />
Have you heard of EXOSTAR? The text file will be exported from this software.  The exported file always has the same number of columns. If no information, it's blank. Unfortunately, most of them are blank. For a sales order, there are 5 rows (number of column per rows, range from 2 columns to 89 columns. In one file, it may have multiple sales orders. Therefore, we try not to manual delete anything from the file. We prefer the computer to do most of the work, if possible.  <br />
<br />
Yes, I know there are a lot of tables to update. I just got a list of possible affected tables from Baan support. It's a long list!!!!! <br />
<br />
Please advise. If I really have to do it from Exchange Scheme, is it possible? Also, like I said I'm new...could you explain how to write a script for Exchange scheme? What is 3gl and 4 gl? Do you have any document reference? <br />
<br />
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!! <br />
<br />

Sorry, but its a bad choice<br />
<br />
<br />
What is IMHO EDI?  <br />
In My Honorable Opinion; EDI is Electronic Data Interchange: <br />
<br />
EDI is the Baan standard way to enter sales order electronical. It's similar to exchange (and from another view completely different). EDI uses a standard file format for input, but you can modify this format. You will find EDI at Distribution -&gt; EDI in the menu  (and some help about EDI in the online helptexts)..<br />
For my opinion it is very difficult to use exchange for order entry (much too complicate)<br />
<br />
Have you heard of EXOSTAR?  No, we are using SEEBURGER converter and EDI/OpenWorld (meanwhile nearly only OpenWorld)<br />
<br />
We prefer the computer to do most of the work, if possible.<br />
We do also  :D<br />
<br />
If I really have to do it from Exchange Scheme, is it possible? Also, like I said I'm new...could you explain how to write a script for Exchange scheme? What is 3gl and 4 gl? Do you have any document reference?  <br />
<br />
Possible: Maybe, but... . For 3gl (third generation language) and 4gl (forth generation language) better took a look at the manual (programmers help) or the wiki at this forum. There you can find a good  explanation.<br />

The conditon needs to be in the field in which you want to have the combined values. <br />
