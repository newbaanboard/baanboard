Hello,<br />
do you compile with options ?<br />
(-w)<br />
<br />
Try to compile in debugmode.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Flacy</div><div class="date">7th October 2010, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to figure out where I can set my compile options.  I have tried compiling into debug mode (by pressing the Maintain Program Scripts &quot;Debug&quot; button instead of the &quot;Compile&quot; button).  Normally pressing the Debug button would compile then display source code so I may set breakpoints and such.  For this script, the Debug button only invokes the Display Browser with the same information and result as the Compile button.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th October 2010, 19:29</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several places you can set compile flags - on the script on inside the session. Just make sure none of those are set any where. If necessary - restore the old code and make sure it compiles.  If so - then you know it is something in the new script.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you have all the access you need for compiling this session - that includes the object directory.  Not familiar with windows.  So double check this - maybe even go manually delete the object(of course making a copy first). The directory is based off the package VRC - so on our test system for tibom0101m000 I would CD to $BSE/appl*/ti*dev/otibom.  There I could see the compiled object, delete it and make sure I can compile.</div></div><hr />

I did try to compile using the programmer's signon though and it gave the same results.  I tried a compile using the supreme Baan password but got the error &quot;package of script unequal to current package.&quot;    <br />
<br />
As a director doing the work of a programmer no longer here I am way over my head on this stuff.  I don't think I'll be deleting any objects in the Baan directories anytime soon.  <br />
<br />
Thanks, Mark, for your ideas.  I have one question.  What would I look for in script to ID a compile flag?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th October 2010, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Something like &quot;#pragma nowarnings&quot;. I never use these myself, but I know there are others.  I think another is nodebug.  I am not sure this is the case here.  If you were on with the supreme baan password (assuming bsp) - you should really only have to set your package VRC correctly.  You can do this from the special menu on maintain scripts or sessions.  The package VRC you are in should match the package VRC you are compiling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Flacy</div><div class="date">7th October 2010, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, thank you so much for your help, you too, bdittmar.  I did as you recommended, Mark, and located a really old copy of the source and it compiles.  Whoopee!  <br />
<br />
Now I will need to compare the two versions for differences, incorporate the needed changes (step by step, compiling a lot along the way) and breath easy knowing I have a fall back for a clean compile.<br />
<br />
I wish I did have a small briefcase full hundred dollar bills.  The way I feel right now, I'd probably split it with you.  Thanks again.<br />
