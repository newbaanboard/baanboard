<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">30th September 2016, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">You will have to try for it. Include the other table field on Maintain Session. Select the table field in before.program using query.extend and then try to update it....<br />
<br />
But i dont think it will allow like that. Its beyond the framework...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th September 2016, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you can create a session with multiple tables on it.  For 4c4 what you do is first create it with the primary table.  Then in all the events needed you add code - to read, update, insert on the second table.  Is not easy, but it is possible.  You just have to figure out the events you use and how to get the variables out there.  It is more complicated if you are planning a multi-occurrence  type session.  <br />
<br />
This is basically how we use Qkey - instead of modifying baan tables we create what we call extension tables.  For example we have Purchase Order Header table of tdpur040 and an extension table of like tdxxx940(example only).  We then go into maintain the session script and modify(using qkey) the main.table.io section. We can add code in the after.read section to read the record from the second table.  Then in the after.rewrite, after.write, or after.delete we add in code to update our extension table.</div></div><hr />
