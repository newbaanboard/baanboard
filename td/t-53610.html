When you customized this report, did you by any chance change the id of the report to a different one? <br />
If so, <br />
a) you would need to go to Maintain Sessions {ttadv2100m000}, <br />
b) look up session tdsls4404m000 (Print Sales Invoices) and then click on the Reports button. <br />
c) if (as suspected) you have renamed the report id, then you would need to put this new id in place of the old one. Usually its on Position no. 1.<br />
 <br />

Note: If you had earlier customized the Print Sales Invoices session to your Custom VRC then the above steps need to be carried out for that (customized) session instead of the Standard VRC...</div></div><hr />

Be aware that reports like sales invoices are quitte difficult to understand. <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">15th September 2008, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor does provide training on reporting. Normally the these are split up into a basic and an advanced training. Basic training provides information on how a Baan report is setup, layout, labels etc. The advanced training normally provides knowledge about reportscripting.<br />
I would request Infor where you can get some training locally, they should now. As far as I know there are no books about Baan reporting.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
NB: If you're can't find anything you could hire me :D</div></div><hr />
