Now, the client requires to modify the report ID. The report ID is not in the report's content but in the report's title bar(As the attachment picture, I mark the target)! <br />
<br />
I say no word!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">12th June 2008, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Modify it to what?<br />
<br />
The print screen you posted is taken from BWprint, the marked area is the name of the file that is opened. So I guess if you rename this file to &quot;User Defined&quot;, the title also will change.<br />

What's the mean of &quot;rename the file to 'User Defined'&quot;. Where can modify this, in session, in report?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">12th June 2008, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant to rename the BWprint file to what ever the user want. for example I want to rename it to &quot;george&quot;. Check the screen shot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">12th June 2008, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah!! The client just want to change the title bar. The problem is how to change it to 'george' like you said. What I marked, it is a preview file's title bar, not the file's name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">12th June 2008, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did is only renamed the file from rtivxw040111000.bpf to george.bpf. That's all!<br />
<br />
You can program a simple device to do that for you. All you have to do is copy the bpf file to the local (using server2client) and then open it (using app_start). Here is an example of the simple program I wrote for you: <br />
<br />
#pragma used dll ottdllbw<br />
function main()<br />
{<br />
<br />
string my.filename(100)<br />
<br />
my.filename = &quot;C:\george.bpf&quot; | change this to whatever you want.<br />
<br />
server2client(argv$(1),my.filename,0)<br />
app_start(my.filename,&quot;C:&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<br />
}<br />
All you have to do now is to print the report to the device that will activate this script!<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">12th June 2008, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">En, I had copy the above script. Then creat a file &quot;george.bpf&quot; in Dick C. The result is , open two files, one is &quot;george.bpf&quot; like you said. But the file is empty. The other is system default, the file which the client wants to change.<br />
<br />
And I thought the solution what the client want is not this. Just like to find out the field which store 'rtivxw040111000', then modify its value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
program in such a way the document should be read from the local file of the required document when the session is runned and print it on the report you will get it.<br />
<br />
second option is you can use flexform tool to the baan report and can extract any type of report.<br />
