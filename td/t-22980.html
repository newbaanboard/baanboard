<br />
I face currently a very strange problem that i actually do not understand.<br />
<br />
Environment Baan 5c sp 10, AS400.<br />
<br />
There are two person who use the same baan login and system login. One user has worktop installed the other has not. If both start the same baan session the one who has worktop installed gets an old object for the session. Also when he uses the menu browser from the same pc. The other person logged in at the same time with the same user, only working with menu browser, no worktop installed, gets the correct object for the session.<br />
<br />
I compiled the session, i converted to runtime, but nothing chages the situation.<br />
<br />
I fell/think it has something to do with the worktop, but I have no idea where to turn a wheel to resolve the prolbem<br />
<br />
any idea or already faced the same problem?<br />
<br />
thank you for your assistance<br />

Is that an object in an other VRC or one that is not suppost to exist anymore?<br />
<br />
Try deleting the object in all VRC's and than recompile the source.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The session was installed with script tdsls9000. Then made a new script with tdsls9000.1 and connected it to the same session tdsls9000m000.<br />
<br />
The intresting thing is, that I have deleted the object osls90000 from the disk!! but still the object is loaded.<br />
It can not read it from a &quot;deeper&quot; VRC structure, because there is only one level. But why does it work for the user from one pc and for the same baan user from another pc?<br />
<br />
On the machine no development environment is installed. I imported it from the development system with ttiex1284m000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">malutz</div><div class="date">26th January 2005, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">try running ttstpsessinfo to see where the object is loaded from.<br />
You might even get different results from the normal installation and the worktop one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have found the reason.<br />
The program script was connected to a library which was not any more used in the script.<br />
The strange thing is, that on all pc's with worktop client this library was loaded and the program crashed because the library had references to some unknown domains.<br />
On pc's where only the menubrowser was installed the program just worked fine.<br />
The error happend regardles which OS System on the Server was running (Prod AS400, Test NT)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your hints<br />

<br />
I've had a similar problem with the worktop. After changing a menue all people with worktop saw the old one. The worktop is installed on a central server and the users only have a link to it. On the clients a menubrowser is installed also (worktop is just for testing it).<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
Log on the worktop and press F5 ... . It seems to me that the worktop caches some data. <br />
<br />
