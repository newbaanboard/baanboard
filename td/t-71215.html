<br />
I would like to know how can I bypass or automatically answer a question that is displayed in a standard session after save by using Extension (any method is acceptable actually).<br />
The problem is that every time a user uses this session and save there will be a question asking something and the user will always answer No (there are only Yes or No). So I want to make this process smoother for the user. How can I achieve this task?<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Thana</div></div><hr />

That will show a new checkbox under the question to skip the question the next time. It will use then the same answer as previous time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">16th July 2018, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Forgot to mention that there is also a system wide setting in the Tools Parameters (ttaad0100m000). After you switch it on there, the flag will be visible in the User Data Template.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">16th July 2018, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks JaapJD. It works like a charm. After I switched it on, turned on the flag, and then checked &quot;Do not show this message again.&quot;, the question never shows up again, which is what I was looking for.<br />
However, I now realize that what if I want to change my mind and want to answer 'Yes' this time. How do I, as a user, do to be able to make the system ask me again, and also be able to check &quot;Do not show this message again.&quot; too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">16th July 2018, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a Reset Questions under the Settings icon.</div></div><hr />

I am appreciated.<br />
The problem is solved now.</div></div><hr />
