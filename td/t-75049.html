<br />
I have a question. <br />
First: <br />
<br />
Because I need different informations from different baan sessions I wanted to write my own job. Beause I don't have access to this and I dont't have knowledge about this I'm writing queries with the module EasySQL, prininting this Queries in EXCEL and connect the different Queries with PowerQuery to get the informations needed. <br />
<br />
To get the right tables I need a &quot;MasterTable&quot; in which I can see the name (i.e. tisfc001) and the description (i.e. &quot;Head Prodution oder&quot;). <br />
<br />
Is there a table in BaaN which includes all tables used in BaaN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Descriptions should be in the labels table - ttadv140.  Different versions link those two tables differently.</div></div><hr />

1) assume session code to have the main table as well: ppmmmaxbcm000 has maintable ppmmmabc<br />
2) when that fails, just run the session and press Ctrl-Shift-8 and go to the Query tab, there you will see the query used to populate the screen<br />
3) In other cases (silent process sessions) you can always set up logging of the bshell to find out what the session is doing, but you will get lost in the logfile.</div></div><hr />

The solution with the table ttaadv420 doesnt't work for me. I get an error message 506. The table doens't exist. I will try it with the idea from ome luuk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">6th December 2022, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor LN is technically a RDBMS where not only the application data is stored in companies but the structure of the data itself is also stored in &quot;system&quot; tables. These are - however - located in the &quot;tools company 000&quot; so to query those tables you will need to &quot;switch company&quot; to 000.</div></div><hr />
