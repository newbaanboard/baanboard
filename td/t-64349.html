<br />
Can somebody please help me a syntax for a print condtion?<br />
<br />
I am printing a report label which currently has the following condition -<br />
<br />
tdsls040.comp = xxx and tdsls040.cuno = &quot;A12345&quot;<br />
<br />
I want to add two more customers to the logic and I'm not quite sure on what the syntax should be. Is the following correct?<br />
<br />
tdsls040.comp = xxx and (tdsls040.cuno = &quot;A12345&quot; or tdsls040.cuno = &quot;B12345&quot; or tdsls040.cuno = &quot;C12345&quot;)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">23rd July 2013, 11:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes,<br />
<br />
It works the same way. Make sure that if there are any spaces after the code, you need to put it in you condintion like if cuno = &quot;A112&quot; then you need to add cuno = &quot;A112  &quot;.<br />
<br />
Here's a simple query:-<br />
<br />
select<br />
       tdsls400.ofbp,         | Sold-to Business Partner<br />
       tdsls400.orno          | Sales Order<br />
 <br />
from<br />
       tdsls400               | Sales Orders<br />
where  (tdsls400.ofbp = &quot;CN0000162&quot; or tdsls400.ofbp = &quot;CN0000017&quot; or <br />
tdsls400.ofbp = &quot;CN0000338&quot;)<br />
<br />
And, if you are using it in print expression, make sure if you set the used fields in report input fields.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What if I wanted to move this logic to the report script?<br />
<br />
My thinking is that the syntax will be too long to fit in the print condtion box. Therefore I thought I could set a variable in the report script that would determine if this report field is printed. I have tried the following in the before.program section but I think it must be wrong as it is not working.<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
<br />
	swiss = &quot;n&quot;<br />
<br />
	select tdsls040.comp, tdsls040.cuno<br />
	from tdsls040<br />
	where tdsls040.orno = :tdsls040.orno<br />
	selectdo<br />
	endselect<br />
		<br />
              If tdsls040.comp = 203 and tdsls040.cuno = &quot;E34000&quot;<br />
	then swiss = &quot;y&quot;<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
I have dropped a form field on my report for the &quot;print&quot; variable above and printed a report which meets the logic above but the &quot;print&quot; is displayed as &quot;n&quot;<br />
<br />
My coding skills are very basic and I don't very often have to do it so I'm sorry for these simple questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamsi_gujjula</div><div class="date">23rd July 2013, 12:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Will it fit in the print expression.... i  doubt<br />
<br />
it should be handled in report script using a flag (if it does not fit in the print expression)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamsi_gujjula</div><div class="date">23rd July 2013, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">pjohns<br />
<br />
nobody is good they  just  get used to it..:P<br />
<br />
anyway i dont think before.program is a good layout  i would suggest just before the layout where these fields are printing</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you trying to do with this loop?<br />
<br />
select tdsls040.comp, tdsls040.cuno<br />
	from tdsls040<br />
	where tdsls040.orno = :tdsls040.orno | you are comparing its own orno which will cause problems<br />
	selectdo<br />
<br />
	endselect<br />
Â If tdsls040.comp = 203 and tdsls040.cuno = &quot;E34000&quot;<br />
	then swiss = &quot;y&quot;<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, it can be like this:-<br />
<br />
<br />
long flag<br />
flag = 0<br />
swiss = &quot;n&quot;<br />
select tdsls040.comp, tdsls040.cuno<br />
	from tdsls040<br />
	where tdsls040.orno = :tdsls040.orno | you are comparing its own orno which will cause problems<br />
	and    tdsls040.comp = 203 and tdsls040.cuno = &quot;E34000&quot;  <br />
        selectdo<br />
                        flag = 1<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
if flag = 1 then<br />
   swiss = &quot;y&quot;<br />
else<br />
   swiss = &quot;n&quot;<br />
endif<br />
<br />
My second question is, is this in the program script of report script?<br />
<br />
If its in program script, you should put it in <br />
<br />
choice.print.data:<br />
<br />
after.choice:<br />
<br />
<br />
If its in report script:-<br />
<br />
You can use in:-<br />
<br />
layout_name: | e.g. detail.1:<br />
<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not sure what are you trying to do. Please post the snapshots of the form and the program and report scripts. That will be helpful to analyse the problem in better way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd July 2013, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually your code looks correct to me for going into a print condition.  The quest I have is it just a report field or is it a whole layout?  If it does not fit then yes it can go in the report script. The key will be figuring out where to put it in the script.  Not exactly sure if you are just trying to print a field or a whole layout.  I am usually turning off and on whole layouts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">23rd July 2013, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for everyones help.<br />
<br />
I now have it working by setting a flag from within the report script in the before.layout section Then using the flag for my report field print condition.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />
