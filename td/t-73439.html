<br />
My questions may sound stupid here, but I want to know this information for some analysis-purpose-calculations.<br />
Is formula for Amount in Baan not Price * Quanity? Do we need to consider Unit factor as well? If yes then how?What is the exact formula?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

So for example, we would buy in boxes and store in each,  Purchase units and inventory units were different.  So if you were looking at PO's if you want the each price you used the conversion factor.  Not sure what we did when we converted to oracle - but all my reporting was based off the standard cost price.</div></div><hr />
