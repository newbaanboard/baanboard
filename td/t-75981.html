<br />
I have a request to reference an IDM document (A.PDF) attached in a purchase requisition (tdpur2600m000) in a purchase order (tdpur4100m900) converted from a purchase requisition.<br />
<br />
In my opinion,<br />
I thought of copying the A.PDF and creating a B.PDF and assigning it to the IDM attribute for the purchase order (and then using the API to do this), etc.<br />
Is there a smarter solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abattoir</div><div class="date">13th October 2023, 02:05</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a good solution… just curious… how do you plan to copy the A.pdf to B.pdf and at what instant? Maybe it can be done at the time of generating PO from PR, that you add the necessary attribute to the A.pdf with the PO#.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RT0001</div><div class="date">13th October 2023, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi abattoir,<br />
Thanks for your comment.<br />
Sorry for the poor English as I am using machine translation.<br />
<br />
We are considering to implement copying from A.pdf to B.pdf with IDM's API.<br />
　IDM item copy POST IDM/api/items/copy/{pid}　<br />
　Update IDM item attributes PUT IDM/api/items/{pid}<br />
　<br />
1) Receive RequisitionBOD sent out when generating PO from PR (conversion) with ION's activation policy (LN‗Requision).<br />
2)Trigger the LN‗Requision to launch a workflow that executes the IDM Item Copy API.<br />
3)Copy item and update item attribute in the workflow API matters<br />
<br />
I am thinking of having RequisitionBOD extended with BOD extension (AddValue) to have the information needed to copy &quot;B.pdf&quot;,<br />
As advised, we could have it in the A.pdf at the time of PO generation.<br />
In that case, I would need to extend the InContext message that is passed from the LN session to the IDM document.<br />
I have no experience in that area and would like to learn it.<br />
<br />
More to the point, by making full use of InContext messages, would it be possible to reference multiple IDM documents from an LN session?<br />
We are also thinking about this.<br />
The value stored in EntityType of an IDM document uploaded from an LN is passed from the LN session.<br />
　PR:InforRequisition, PO:InforPurchaseOrder...<br />
If we can extend that message and send PR's InContext message from PO's session, we can refer to PR's IDM document as well...?<br />
My imagination is expanding due to my inexperience.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

All of your proposals will work, especially the last one to use in context message from PO’s session to reference PR’s IDM documents.</div></div><hr />
