I am working on Baan IVc4. My requirement is to fetch data based on standard audit trail functionality of baan.<br />
<br />
Suppose when i do any changes in customer session (update, delete or create new), then function should retrive data that this changes has been done. It should take date range in input and return customer code that has been changed. <br />
<br />
Actually i want to keep maintain history of customer based on standatd Audit functionality. Allthough i can do it by customizing but requirement is to read audit trail record and maintain history in seperate table.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
From the little bit that I know of, in my opinion, you may be better off writing your own customizations, especially since you want to keep a permanent history of changes. But that is just my way of thinking.<br />
<br />
One the other hand, you can just use the standard BAAN reports to produce the ouput you desire as far as the history goes:<br />
- ttaad4461m000 - Print Range of Audit Files<br />
- ttaad4463m000 - Print Range of Audit Files (multi-line) - this one lets us choose which columns of the audited table to print<br />
The above sessions are in BAAN IVc3 - may be different for your installation.</div></div><hr />

Then you can use the output to import in excel or acess and analyse. Export can be done based on start and enddate and only from last export date. In some cases i export the data and import it in a new table based on the original but without any references. Add some fields like date and kind of transaction. Then you can very easily print all your data<br />
