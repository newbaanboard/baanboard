<br />
There is something new in Erp-Ln FP5 about adding a new session/menu in Specific menu without need to customization.<br />
<br />
I need to add a new session in a Specific menu of a standard session, but I don't want to customize anything:<br />
- I don't want to customize the standard session to add my session in form command<br />
- and I don't want to customize the standard menu to put in it my satelite session with standard session or something like that...<br />
<br />
Please advise<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Smart Links<br />
The main differences between WebTop and WorkTop are described below:<br />
Smart Links in WebTop enable you to quickly zoom to a related session from an overview session. Your system administrator can define your smart links for you. Smart links come in two types: <br />
On field level: You can start a smart link on field-level points from a particular table field of an overview session to a particular record in a details session. The details session with the particular record selected starts when you activate the smart link. The smart link is visable on the table field.<br />
On column level: A smart link on column level points from a particular column of an overview session to an overview session. The overview session starts when you activate the smart link. The smart link is visable on the column header.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
I analyzed your sugestion with Smart links (seems to be a good idea) but the problem is that smart links are available only for Webtop 8.4.2 and older versions. I have installed Web 8.5 :(<br />
___________<br />
Note<br />
The functionality described in this section applies only to Web UI 8.4.2 and older versions.<br />
From Web UI 8.5, Web UI users can define their own Auto Complete parameters. For details, refer to the Web UI online help.<br />
___________<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th May 2010, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">in Baan IV there is choice field on which user can zoom to a new session. If that's not filled already and is a choice available , u can zoom to a session defined by u for zoom choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There still is the normal option to do it: Customize the session, add a form command. That's the technique that is available, you stay on support, so please use it.<br />
<br />
Everything else could only be a hack, doing more harm then good in the long run. I cannot imagine a single possible reason why that should not be possible. Every reason I can think of boils down to wrong IT management strategy, so change the strategy.<br />

<br />
But customizing a standard session?!<br />
In Ln Fp5-Fp6 Webtop are and will be a lot o solutions/patches for installing (bugs or something like that). And it's possible that one of the patch update my standard customized session. The update of the session will not be available because of my customization in higher VRC.<br />
That's why I'm trying to avoid the customization of standard software components.<br />
Usually, in Baan IV I'll do it, because the environment is constant, with no patches.<br />
Am I wrong? Is this a wrong IT management strategy? Please advise.<br />
Thank you<br />
Simona</div></div><hr />

what you are saying is true, customizing a standard session means that you cannot simply install a patch on it. <br />
Anyway, I've never seen, in almost 20 years of Baan projects, a 'standard' installation of Baan.<br />
If the level of customization isn't so heavy, you can easily 'merge' new patches every time, simply comparing the different levels of software components and redoing the changes you made. If the customization level is heavy, obviously this takes more time and resources, but it can be done on periodically basis.<br />
There aren't differences between Baan IV and Infor LN from this point of view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
alternatively, you can use the SOA platform like INFOR myday and then create the customization on the 3rd party.<br />
<br />
then you don't need to worry about the the updates, the only thing that you need to modify is the xml message template.<br />
<br />
the myday is free, but the resources is pretty huge.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I will keep this in mind. We intend to install MyDay in one or two months.<br />
