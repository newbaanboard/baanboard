Hi,<br />
<br />
I tried it and it works for me without any problem. May be the CRDD for table tcmcs045 was not done or was not done properly or may be you get the solution from the above thread.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure if I am going right way, it can be a problem with session too. Have you written any script like a UE Dll, where you are using the CDF?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done the CRDD properly,for ur ref. i have attached the screen shot.<br />
in GTM i checked the standard table tcmcs045, the new CDF is showing properly there .One thing i want to know the table is in standard VRC,is it necessary to copy it to custom VRC, for adding the CDF</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">24th July 2013, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">No, there is no need to copy the table in your VRC. But, yes, do copy the session in the customized VRC. <br />
<br />
Have you done that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanhp</div><div class="date">24th July 2013, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes already i have done that.I have copied the standard session to current vrc and then added the new CDF to form by editing the form .<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any solution/patch or parameter i need to check<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Also check if all the following things are done:-<br />
<br />
- CDF must be enabled for setting the Parameters Customer Defined Field (ttadv4590m000) session.<br />
- The Authorization Management System (AMS) setting must permit this user to run the session Customer Defined Fields (ttadv4591m000). This zoom session is only reachable through the menu session ttadv4191m000.<br />
<br />
Check this solution in tt package:-1173589<br />
<br />
Try removing the CDF and recreating it. Also check if it is removed from table ttadv491 table.</div></div><hr />

Is there is any way to assign length to  data type while defining cdf in ttadv4591m000?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, there are some pre-defined data types which you can use like string, integer, numeric, date, checkbox.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsaenz</div><div class="date">5th April 2014, 20:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I added some fields to tcibd001<br />
<br />
they show up in gtm as<br />
tcibd001.cdf_dsa2<br />
tcibd001.cdf_dsb2<br />
tcibd001.cdf_letr<br />
<br />
When I run WEB UI it shows up automatically in a tab &quot;Configurable Fields&quot;.<br />
<br />
When I try to add the fields in another area it won't allow me.  Give me a message that says it looks like a database field but isn't.<br />
<br />
how should the fields be named to add them to a form in a specific area or tab?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">5th April 2014, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">You cannot add CDFs to a form.  They are added by the system and are not available in menu browser/worktop.  By default, the CDFs are placed in a separate tab called &quot;configurable fields&quot; in alphabetical order by field name.  If in 10.2.0+, you can use the personalize feature of WebUI to move the fields from the configurable fields tab to any other tab in your form.  The configurable fields tab will go away once all fields are moved out.  Once you are happy with the locations, you can copy your personalizations to the company or DEM role level so all who are in the company or role have these new form locations as a default.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I finally figured it out and was playing with that when your e-mail came in.  I am able to move it around and put in another tab.  The weird thing is it is sometimes very finicky.  I was able to place the field in the Items Tab I but could not place it in the Items Tab II.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your help and quick response.  <br />
<br />
I'll continue playing with this until I get the results I like.</div></div><hr />
