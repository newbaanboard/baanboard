<br />
Is possible to block the actions of the keyboard and mouse events on a baan session??<br />
<br />
What i am trying to ask is if i can block the capture of a field or to press a button but not using the attr.input in the field or the choice.again in the button.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attention.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.<br />

I do know you can set-up a button - without putting it on the form, set a control sequence(like alt-a) and get it to activate another session.  Maybe if you provided more details someone will have a better idea.</div></div><hr />

Back to the Q - Why do you need it ? your posting does not give sufficient information about the requirement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although your objective is not very clear, but still let me try to answer your questions if I can make it out what do you want to know, as far as I know,to do anything with Baan, to enter into the Baan, Session is the only gateway, either its a 3GL session without any UI or a 4GL session with UI, so if you are talking about passing a parameter to a Baan session without using any type of session/baan component and doing some transaction inside Baa, I think its not possible..., rather what you can do is, you can open/execute a Baan session, you can execute jobs without opening Baan, but yes it consumes licenses...<br />
<br />
If this is what you wanted to know, its OK else please elaborate your doubt...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Regards,<br />
Dilip</div></div><hr />
