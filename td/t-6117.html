<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arajasek</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
            I was trying to get distinct records from main table in a display session. And so Iwas tryin it out in a query extension. Problem is I could get the required records, But Iam not able to skip the duplicate records. <br />
           <br />
             Let me explain this with an example. Lets assume that we have 2 tables Emp and dept. <br />
<br />
Here is the structure of the tables ...<br />
<br />
             Emp table  --&gt; Enum, Ename, Esal                                <br />
             Dept table --&gt; Dnum, Dname<br />
<br />
So this way I have 100 records in employee table and just 4 records in dept table which means we just have 4 departments. Now my problem is to fetch just 4 records from employee table thru a query extension on Emp table... since main table for this dsiplay session is employee table.<br />
<br />
I hope I was clear in explainin the situation. <br />
<br />
Kindly help me out to solve this problem.</div></div><hr />

If it is then multiple employees can belong to each of the departments. So which four employees do you want to show on the display session? Post the query extension for us to understand a little better.</div></div><hr />

Now i want to view only those business partners who have an entry in the table tdpur400. But the problem is that there are multiple records in the table tdpur400 with a single business partner and i'm not able to use the query.extend to return distinct records. As a result i have duplicate Business partner records. Is there any way to solve this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can have code in before.display.object or main.table.io section, where u can write a query on tdpur400 with set specification to select just one record.<br />
and then if record not found u can skip current read on the main table.<br />
<br />
Or<br />
u can use IN clause with query.extension <br />
for eg:<br />
query.extension = &quot; where tccom100.bpid in (select tdpur400.bpid from tdpur400  where tdpur400.otbp = :tccom100.bpid as set with 1 rows) &quot;</div></div><hr />
