I so understood that search of the file which name is completely not known, in a certain folder at a local disk in BAAN does not work. I want to load into the temporary table or the massif, a name of all files which are in a certain folder on a local disk. Somebody knows as it it is possible to realize? <br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the client OS is windows, and the file types are text files you can do this:-<br />
<br />
dir *.txt /a-d /b<br />
<br />
In this way, you can also store the file names in an output file like:-<br />
<br />
dir *.txt /a-d /b &gt;C:\Test\output.txt<br />
<br />
i.e. use app_start() or start.application.local() to run the above command.<br />
<br />
Now, you can use seq.* function to read and process the files.</div></div><hr />

That is the user does not choose a way. The way is already known. It for example, D:\BAAN\245. 245 it is the planner by the production order. Folders on the planner can be a little and files in these folders can be a little.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The piece of code I gave will work for a single folder. And there is no need for any manual intervention. In the same way you will need to use dir command as well to check the number of subfolders present. I am assuming you are familiar with Baan programming and are aware of commands like app_start(), client2server, seq.* functions etc.<br />
