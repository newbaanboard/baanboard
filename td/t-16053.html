I was trying to improve Performance, by changing the program.<br />
<br />
I tried to reduce the time taken by a select, by reducing the number of calls  to  the  function(in which this select is present). After further analysis i found that , i got a big improvement in the select i targeted(as number of times the select is executed is reduced)<br />
<br />
But the  next select, on some other table started  taking more time compared to earlier...<br />
<br />
I observed this kind of problem, in 3 cases.<br />
<br />
Does this points to some other problem ??<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rams</div></div><hr />

<br />
this behaviour sounds very strange to me. Could you please add the source so we can have a detailled look why this is happening.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

Intially, the program was taking longer time on select of tccom122.<br />
I commented the select,as there is no use of that select for me..and Baan is not using this tccom122.rtyp, any more(they are using some other field instead of this).<br />
After this i observed that  more time is taken &quot;tdint.dlltfacp.insert.update.order.line.data&quot;.<br />
In this function also i removed some part of the code..and the next function is observed to be taking more time and so on...<br />
<br />
select	tccom122.rtyp					|EURO<br />
from	tccom122<br />
where	tccom122._index1 = {:tdpur400.ifbp}<br />
as set with 1 rows<br />
endselect						|EURO<br />
	<br />
<br />
if not tdint.dlltfacp.insert.update.order.line.data(tcmcs065.comp,<br />
							tfacp.otyp.purchase,<br />
							tdpur401.orno,<br />
							tdpur401.pono,<br />
							tdpur401.sqnb,<br />
