<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">7th June 2002, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Session ticst0402m000:<br />
<br />
Has anybody modified this session's report to breakout man and machine hours in the Operating Cost section of the report?<br />
<br />
We don't have source code and I have a request to break out the hours and costs by man and machine.  I can't see where the session script is pulling its information.  <br />
<br />
<br />
There is another session- Print Actual Costs by Production Order that I could easily alter the report to read from the ticst002 table to get the info but that table lists info by Production order (like the report).  The report I need to modify looks at things within a specific tme period.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th June 2002, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">You could run bic_info on the session to get a idea of what tables are used.  Maybe ttstpsessinfo also. About the best I can come up with since we are in the same boat as you - no source code. Below is a snippet of what I got using bic_info:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;select         ticpr300.*, ticpr300.cpcp:cp.comp, ticpr010.*<br />
        from    ticpr300<br />
<br />
        where   ticpr300._index1 = {:item.code, &quot;&quot;, :copr.indt}<br />
        and     ticpr300.cpcp refers to ticpr010<br />
        and     (ticpr010.cref = tccref.chg.material or<br />
                 ticpr010.cref = tccref.chg.operation)<br />
        order by ticpr300._index1<br />
        &quot;<br />
&quot;cp.comp&quot;<br />
&quot;select         tfgld410.*, tfgld410.cpcp:cp.comp<br />
        from    tfgld410<br />
        where   tfgld410._index2 = {:curr.compnr,&quot;&quot;, tctror.prd,<br />
                            :tisfc001.pdno, 0, tcfitr.surcharge}<br />
        and     tfgld410.line = 0<br />
        order by tfgld410._index2<br />
        &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Other tables included ticst001 and ticst002. Good Luck!<br />
