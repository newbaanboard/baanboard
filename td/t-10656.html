<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aihbikers</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wanting to know how to change the delivery address information on a PO to include our phone number and fax.<br />
<br />
Currently on the report, tdpur440101000, the layout's print expressions for the lines are &quot;del.addr(1,1)&quot;, &quot;del.addr(1,2)&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
I know that it is all polling from the Addresses table (tccom4130s000) but how do you get it to display other information on tabs other than the General tab? :confused: <br />
<br />
We are using BaaN 5.0C.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 01:34</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan 5.0c, you can use the Address Format session (tccom4535m000) to get different fields on your address line.  I have not played with it, but I assume it works :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aihbikers</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, We've tried that and it doesn't seem to help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, well, I played some, and it seems to work.   Where was your problem?  I was able to put the fax number onto the Purchase Order Ack and other docs.  In mine I put the fax number right next to the customer name.  I did:<br />
<br />
1.  Copy the standard and create a new address format in Adress Formats session - tccom4535m000.  This took some playing to get it how I wanted, but it definately worked here.<br />
2.  Attach the new address format to the address that is printing in Maintain Addresses - tccom4530m000.<br />
<br />
Print.  Any report is using the new format now.  That may not be what you want...maybe someone else can tell us if you can make that purchase order ack. specific or if the format goes to all  docs that the address is on..not sure from there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aihbikers</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, you were right. It works now. I looked over the session again and noticed that one of the flags was a 0 when it should have been a 1. <br />

Thank you for your help. :)</div></div><hr />
