I just have a general inquiry about LN and Reporting Services.  <br />
We're just starting to explore the functionality of using Reporting Services with LN FP6.<br />
<br />
I'm curious to know what other users think of it.  <br />
What are some of the benefits to using Reporting Services with LN instead of using a standard report in LN?<br />
We do a little customization to standard reports, but what's the benefit of making the small changes in LN as opposed to exporting it to reporting services and making changes there?<br />
What are any other benefits?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input.<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reporting Services is a new addition to ERP LN which transforms the way we have been using ERP Reporting Tool...<br />
<br />
Adavantages of Reporting Services over 4 GL Reports :<br />
<br />
▪ Add various chart types to your reports, such as pie charts, line charts,  and bar charts.<br />
▪ Attach a dialog to a graph, where users can enter selection criteria.<br />
▪ Create crosstab reports that show data in two dimensions, such as sales per quarter<br />
▪ The Reports can easily by converted to PDF Format.<br />
<br />
More info &amp; features abt it can be extractacted from U8883 US Document....<br />
<br />
Hope it helps<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
