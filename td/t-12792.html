<br />
I would like to display data from a table(say tdsls400 - Sales Orders) from two different companies(say 100 and 200) at a time in a single session.<br />
<br />
Can we do this? and how?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">2nd September 2003, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">You may write following statement in before.program<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbabu1</div><div class="date">2nd September 2003, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hope, it doesn't work when we have other table fields on the form(Other than main table fields)...<br />
<br />
Will it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">2nd September 2003, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Will probably depend on the way these extra fields are retrieved.  If they are retrieved by the standard program, it will probably not work.  But please test it and let us know! If you fetch these fields yourself, add &quot;where x._compnr=y._compnr&quot; to the query, where x is the referenced table and y the main table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbabu1</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 06:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried this and it didn't work. <br />
<br />
I have also tried one more thing...I have kept only the main table fields on the form(i.e,. removed all reference table fields)...even then it gives me the following error...<br />
<br />
Fatal error : Error 314 (bdb_errno 314) on unknown sql statement</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dorleta</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">* Company Numbers<br />
<br />
    The company number which is used during the execution of a BAAN<br />
    4GL query is the current value of the company number. The company<br />
    number is:<br />
    -  the default company number ( defined in the session &quot;Maintain<br />
    User Data&quot; )<br />
    -  a company number specified by the compnr.check<br />
    function<br />
<br />
    To be able to use different company numbers, a new field is introduced,<br />
    called &lt;table&gt;._compnr. This field specifies the actual company<br />
    number of the table. When this field is undefined, the current company<br />
    number is taken. 'Undefined' is denoted by the value -1.<br />
<br />
    When a record is selected with 'select &lt;table&gt;.*', the field<br />
    &lt;table&gt;._compnr in the record contains the company number<br />
    belonging to that table. Inserting a record in a table with a specific<br />
    company number, the field &lt;table&gt;._compnr has to be filled with the<br />
    corresponding company number. The function db.insert() will take care<br />
    of this and writes the record in the correct (physical) table. There are<br />
    no special file pointers (for example by using db.bind) necessary.<br />
<br />
    Example:<br />
    The record where the field ttadv100._compnr = 000 belongs to the<br />
    (physical) table ttadv100000<br />
    The record where the field ttadv100._compnr = 200 belongs to the<br />
    (physical) table ttadv100200<br />
<br />
    The field &lt;table&gt;._compnr can be used in the WHERE clause of an<br />
    BAAN SQL statement. In this case it is used as a search condition,<br />
    like follows:<br />
<br />
    SELECT  ttadv100.*<br />
    FROM    ttadv100<br />
    WHERE   ttadv100._compnr = 200 AND ttadv100.cpac = 'tt'<br />
<br />
    This query lists all records from table ttadv100200 where<br />
    ttadv100.cpac has the value 'tt'.<br />
<br />
    The field &lt;table&gt;._compnr can be used in the following cases:<br />
    -  &lt;table&gt;._compnr = &lt;number&gt; or &lt;number&gt; = &lt;table&gt;._compnr<br />
    where &lt;number&gt; specifies an integer number. The value of &lt;number&gt;<br />
    is taken as the company number.<br />
<br />
    -  &lt;table&gt;._compnr = &lt;string&gt;<br />
<br />
    where &lt;string&gt; specifies a list of company numbers, separated<br />
    by a ','. This construction can be used to check a condition for a<br />
    range of company numbers.<br />
<br />
    Example:<br />
    SELECT ttadv100.*<br />
    WHERE ttadv100._compnr = &quot;200,300&quot; AND &lt;condition&gt;<br />
<br />
    This query will result in a list of records from the table ttadv100<br />
    with company numbers 200 and 300, which are true with respect<br />
    to &lt;condition&gt;. A company number must be specified by a 3-<br />
    digit number. The string may contain only digits and commas. (So,<br />
    specification of 'company number is 0 or 23' is defined by<br />
    '&lt;table&gt;._compnr = &quot;000,023&quot;)<br />
<br />
    -  &lt;table&gt;._compnr IN &lt;set specification&gt;<br />
    where &lt;set specification&gt; is a:<br />
    - set of constants<br />
    - subquery<br />
    Sets should not contain duplicate values.<br />
    See SQL syntax, IN operator.<br />
<br />
    Notice the following rules for combining conditions on the field<br />
    &lt;table&gt;._compnr:<br />
    -  A list of AND conditions may contain only 1 condition including<br />
    &lt;table&gt;._compnr<br />
    So, the following construction is allowed:<br />
    WHERE &lt;table&gt;._compnr = 100 AND &lt;condition&gt;<br />
    while<br />
    WHERE &lt;table&gt;._compnr = 100 AND &lt;table&gt;._compnr = 200<br />
    is not allowed<br />
<br />
    -  In a list of OR conditions, each condition must have a condition on<br />
    &lt;table&gt;._compnr, or none of them<br />
    Concluding:<br />
<br />
    WHERE (&lt;table&gt;._compnr = 100 OR &lt;table&gt;._compnr = 200)<br />
    AND &lt;condition&gt;<br />
<br />
    is a legal construction, as contrasted with:<br />
<br />
    WHERE (&lt;table&gt;._compnr = 100 OR &lt;other_field&gt; = &lt;value&gt;)<br />
    AND &lt;condition&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep!  All true.  But what about the default query in a type 1/2/3 session?  Can that be modified with these fields as well?  Because that's the original question!<br />
<br />
Suresh, I see you're working on Oracle.  Any errors in the log files?  And have you tried:<br />
<br />
query.etension=&quot;tdsls400._compnr=100 or tdsls400._compnr=200&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Though Baan documentation is bit vague on this , I think it's not possible due to non-unique nature of primary index values (when both companies are used) returned. A maintain session typically needs SQL handle to point to a single record only. Also try displaying the company number on form (probably it may help). Also tell us if display session  works. <br />
<br />
Baan help talks only of db.insert() and SQL fetch queries.<br />
<br />
It does not talk of db.update() function and 'for update' select queries. If anybody has experience on db.update , please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbabu1</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 07:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep...I have tried that too....but did not work. I got the same error &quot;Error 314 (bdb_errno 304) on unknown sql statement&quot;<br />
<br />
I have checked almost all the log files...but no additional information than the above.:mad: <br />
<br />
And one more thing I would like to share with you all, that it is impossible to achieve this by using query extensions. Because, when we go through the documentaion on Baan SQL...it says<br />
<br />
* In a list of OR conditions, none of the conditions may contain a condition on &lt;table&gt;._compnr. <br />
<br />
Without 'OR' condition on company number we can not get the data from two different tables...Its is my opinion. If anybody has different opinion...please share.<br />
<br />
Have you anybody tried to achieve this in different ways? If so...please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isimeon</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 08:56</div></div><div class="posttext">See the session whwmd2540m000. It uses temporary table to display Inventory by Item, Company and Warehouse. The temporary table is whwmd240. In BAAN IV the session is tdinv0515m000 and the table - tdinv015. Before display current set, records are copied from diferent company to temporary table. The temporary table is main table for session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbabu1</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 11:14</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah...you are right...we can also do it that way. But for that we should have a temporary table created in advance and the session must be created with that table as the main table.<br />
<br />
I would like to know whether we can display the data, from two companies, in an existing session? Is that possible?<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isimeon</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">If that was possible, would not BAAN developers did it? I have no success in BAAN IV.</div></div><hr />
