<br />
I have a form filter as Year and Period, now on the basis of this I would like to find the start and End Date for the period, can anybody tell me which is the standard dll which takes year/period as input and gives me Start and End date ?<br />
<br />
or any session which might be using this sort of functionality. I am on <br />
BaaN V c.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
Otherwise goto query in the programs or dll and for description use LIKE and put .*Period.* and it will give you all dll's or includes.<br />
<br />
This is the fastest and easiest way.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well i could able to find the function, its itfgld0009<br />
<br />
itfgld0012 will not server the purpose because i am passing year and period as input where as itfgld0012 takes date as input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greasedman</div><div class="date">9th February 2005, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Otherwise, you colud use simply standard function date.to.num like following:<br />
<br />
	<br />
first.year.day = date.to.num(yrno, 1, 1)<br />
last.year.day = (date.to.num((yrno + 1), 1, 1) - 1)<br />
first.month.day = date.to.num(yrno, period, 1)<br />
<br />
if period = 12 then<br />
	last.month.day = (date.to.num((yrno + 1), 1, 1) - 1)<br />
else<br />
        last.month.day = (date.to.num(yrno, (period + 1), 1) - 1)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
<br />
then use those variables to check the date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">3rd August 2011, 19:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know where / if these functions were renamed or moved elsewhere in LN?  Specifically looking for functions tfgld0001 (get company parameters), tfgld0002 (get group parameters), tfgld0006 (get dimension description), tfgld0007 (check if period is open), tfgld001 (get companies per group company), and tfgld0012 (get period and year from date).  These are used in a Baan V script that I am upgrading to LN.<br />
<br />
Would rather use something that is present before writing the functions in LN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">3rd August 2011, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">In LN, a lot of includes were rewritten as DLLs.<br />
By example the include tcmcs0095 &quot;read parameters&quot; became tcmcsdll0095. <br />
In some cases, the name is almost the same, in other case not, because some functions were included in one bigger DLL with a different code, so the better way to do is to check the DLLs of tfgld module...</div></div><hr />
