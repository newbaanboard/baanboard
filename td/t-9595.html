The rtf-document will be opened in MS Word, because of the extension rtf is aasigned to this application.<br />
<br />
I have solved my problem  temporary  by changing the file access mode (file.chmod).  But in this case, I've to be very alert in the further processes.  Not all actions can be executed with read-only mode.<br />

It appears you can not force a user to open a document as read-only in word.  But you can create a macro in the normal.dot file that you run at startup.  In this macro you could recommend read-only - but this only a recommendation.  Not sure if that helps.<br />
<br />
Mark<br />
<br />
Sample macro run with the /m switch:<br />
<br />
Sub Macro1()<br />
    With ActiveDocument<br />
        .ReadOnlyRecommended = True<br />
        .Password = &quot;&quot;<br />
        .WritePassword = &quot;&quot;<br />
        .RemovePersonalInformation = False<br />
    End With<br />
End Sub</div></div><hr />

Even if they do change, maybe you could create a pdf file on the fly.  But how you would do this is beyond me today.</div></div><hr />

I have played with the app_start a bit.  One thing I keep running into - ever had luck sending an email thru outlook with it?   I can bring up outlook, and have the file as an attachment, but I don't know how to automate the outlook open command to pass the recipient and tell it to autosend, if that is possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th April 2003, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">~NP I agree with Lisa. :)  I like the winword viewer - never new about that.  Maybe he can use that in the earlier processes when he needs the document read only.  Then in the places where he needs it read/write he can use word itself.<br />
<br />
Also Lisa maybe you could start a new thread on outlook.  That is a little different than the original request in this thread.<br />

<br />
server2client() <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Syntax <br />
long server2client( string source, string dest, boolean text.mode [, boolean progress.window] [, boolean read.only] ) <br />
Arguments<br />
source <br />
 The source file name, on the server. <br />
 <br />
dest <br />
 The destination file name, on the client. When this is an empty string, this function will show the file save-as dialog through which the user can select an existing file or enter the name of a new file on the client. The function get.local.filename() can be used afterwards to retrieve the actual filename on the client to which the file was copied. The dest parameter may include the string ${BSE_TMP} which indicates the ${BSE}\tmp directory in case of Baan Windows or Windows temp directory in case of Webtop.<br />
 <br />
text.mode <br />
 This argument specifies whether the file is to be copied in text or binary mode: <br />
<br />
true text mode<br />
false binary mode <br />
 <br />
progress.window <br />
 Use this optional argument to specify whether a progress indicator must be displayed to indicate the progress of the copy action: <br />
<br />
true progress indicator is displayed<br />
false progress indicator is not displayed <br />
 <br />
read.only <br />
 When creating a file on the client side, this attribute can be used to set the file attributes to readonly mode after the file has been transferred. <br />
<br />
true file is set to readonly mode<br />
false file remains in read/write mode</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veerle</div><div class="date">21st March 2006, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the LN-remark, it seems very simple and interesting to use.  At the moment we are working in Reger 5.2 (and the LN-tools  on our test server).  What's your experience with LN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">21st March 2006, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">LN Tools are interesting there are new features, options. The Tools upgrade took us few months because we test porting sets and patches very intensively and have dedicated test systems. We were bringing in new application servers in the current environments and expanding servers. We worked with BaaN/SSA support very closely to resolve issues. We have Master Application Server model with multiple application servers and ran in mixed mode of Reger and Gemini Tools at the same time with user acceptance test and upgrading each application server, building batch servers etc, to reduce the risk and User GUI impacts. <br />
In short, it was an intensive project but we like the benefits with this version where BaaN/SSA can provide us more support, patches, upgrades. You have to study the differences between the tools versions very carefully. There are some presentations planned for the Tools differences, new options at the SSAU (User Conference, this April in Texas). I will be there and hope to see meet some of the people from BaaN Board. :)</div></div><hr />

SSA ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide<br />
app_start() <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Syntax<br />
long app_start( string commandline, string directory, string stdin, string stdout, string stderr ) <br />
Description <br />
Deprecated. This function is only supported for Baan Windows and its usage is therefore deprecated. Instead you should use function: start.application.local(). <br />
<br />
SSA ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide<br />
start.application.local() <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Syntax <br />
boolean start.application.local( string commandline, boolean waitFlag, ref long exitCode, [const string verb] ) <br />
Description <br />
This starts the client application specified in the commandline argument.<br />
<br />
Arguments<br />
commandline <br />
 This specifies the command that starts the application. If commandline does not include a directory path, Windows searches for the executable file in the following directories, in the order shown below: <br />
<br />
The Windows system directory. <br />
The Windows directory. <br />
The directories listed in the PATH environment variable. <br />
<br />
This argument may also contain the full pathname of a local document. In this case the application associated with this document extension will be started. <br />
<br />
The commandline parameter may one or more times include the string ${BSE_TMP} which indicates the ${BSE}\tmp directory in case of Baan Windows or Windows temp directory in case of Webtop. <br />
 <br />
waitFlag 	Indicates whether the application must wait for the local application to exit.<br />
 <br />
exitCode 	Exit code of local application. Only contains a valid exit code when the waitFlag attribute was true<br />
 <br />
verb 		When the commandline argument contains a document pathname, the optional verb argument may contain the action to be performed on this document. The default action is &quot;open&quot;. Another useful verb is: &quot;print&quot;. In case this argument is supplied, the waitFlag argument will be ignored and the execution will always by asynchronous.<br />
<br />
Return values <br />
true 		Application started successfully.<br />
false 		Application failed to start.<br />
<br />
Context 	ttdllbw library function.</div></div><hr />
