<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">21st July 2006, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I am creating a new session which has a field to store an existing oubound run number.  In the form field I have a zoom to session tdilc4010s000 and the return field is then tdilc410.runn.  However the tdilc4010s000 session will either display Outbound run numbers or Inbound run numbers depending on which session it is run from (Generating Outbound or Inbound).  I imagine this is part of an extended query.  So when I run the session it always shows inbound which I assume is the default since that session is not being told which value for tdilc410.kofr it is to show (tdilc.kofr.inbound or tdilc.kofr.outbound).  I tried the following but had no luck:<br />
<br />
field.tdosd900.runn:<br />
before.field:<br />
	export(&quot;tdilc410.kofr&quot;, tdilc.kofr.outbound)<br />
I also tried:<br />
	export(&quot;tdilc410.kofr&quot;, 2)<br />
<br />
My guess is that the variable reference I'm exporting isn't correct.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas or suggestions on how I can get tdilc4010s000 to display the outbound run numbers when I zoom out on my field?  I would rather not have to create my own session to zoom out to.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

Is that prog.zoom commonly used throughout Baan or is it hit and miss?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
in the flow of a BaaN field, before.field is executed in before init.form.<br />
Your variable may work from before.input on.<br />
<br />
Please refer to this threat : Flow of a field !<br />
