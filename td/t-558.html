A very good product is Connectwar for Baan from EpicData. It is a middle ware that is connected to Baan IV or Baan ERP via DDC or BOI (only ERP). The product comes with some examples of barcoded transactions (like stock movement between warehouses and location). It seems it really improve the time you need to do some transactions.<br />
<br />
We are currently implementing this product on BaanERP. It seems that the Openworld (BOI) version is not really finished but the DDC version seems to work well.<br />
<br />
About print barcode I think this subject was already traited in a thread. You can also print barcode using an external tool that revamp your reports (like optio).</div></div><hr />

There are a couple middleware solutions for use with DDC's and BOI's out there, Connectware is good from EpicData.  My company RMCis puts out rmc3, which is targeted at smaller companies.   The ddc can streamline processes from the shop floor, generally running on bar code readers such as Symbol or Intermec, instead of through the standard Baan sessions.  You will need one of these solutions if you need to modify or streamline the company's procedures.<br />
<br />
RMCis (and I'm sure EpicData) has standard Maintain Receipts software ready to run with the Baan DDC for any version.  This code is based off the standard Baan Maintain Receipts script.  You can make your own if you have source code by running the Function Server Generator session inside of Baan, but that produces code that almost works, and you need to understand function server coding to make it fully functional.<br />
<br />
However, if you just want to print bar codes, you can use the bwprint options that come with Baan to do so.  There are instructions on the Baan web sit on how to create a bar code font that you use for the fields you want to print in bar code format.  As metioned above, you can also try 3rd part solutions for pretty reporting - like Optio or Streamserve.<br />
<br />
For input, you can use a wand to input bar code information into the normal Baan Maintain Receipts session.  Several existing wands plug into your computer to read bar codes, like a keyboard/mouse or serial port add in.  When you scan the bar codes using the wand, the information comes into the Baan session screens as a number or whatever the bar code says.  This requires no special processing in Baan, just the right wand setup.<br />
<br />
So, it depends on the exact needs of the company how far you need to go. <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
