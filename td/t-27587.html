<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steveauckly</div><div class="date">13th July 2006, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there any known issues with using stpapi.* functions to control a session that we have RMCgen'ed?  More specifically, any issues after installing service pack 19 or 20?  We just put these two service packs in our test system and now the stpapi.put.field functions don't seem to be sending the values to the session at all.  It does work on sessions that have not been extended with RMCgen.<br />
<br />
When going through it in debugger, it looks like the rest of the functions work.  The session starts, the cont.process gets done, but the field values are zeroes and blanks.  They are not being initialized after being set, it is like they have never been passed.  This is not a new session either, it worked before loading the two service packs mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Any clues or help would be appreciated.  I have a case opened with SSA Global, but I'm not optimistic they'll help much as this is a heavily customized session.</div></div><hr />

Last time something happened like this I had our admin call Qkey and they solved it in just a few minutes with a patch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th July 2006, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Good - they will probably solve it much quicker than Baan.  I think when we went to SP19 for A&amp;D we had to upgrade Qkey.  In 2-4 weeks we will be upgrading to SP20 and Oracle 9i.  A double whammy.</div></div><hr />

It was not an issue with RMCgen at all, but thanks to Ed at RMCis for his help anyway.  The solution from SSA is 208768.</div></div><hr />
