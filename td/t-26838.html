<br />
we are integrating baan with an external java web e-commerce. We need to insert the web orders into the &quot;ttdsls900&quot; table.<br />
<br />
We first approach was to insert in the table a new row with an &quot;INSERT&quot; SQL sentence. That doesn't work because we don't know what to put into the &quot;hash&quot; columns.<br />
<br />
Then, we are trying to make a DLL as a bridge beetween Java and the baan's DLL. The idea is that our dll we'll call the baan's dll. But have a lot of questions:<br />
<br />
- What DLLs baan exposes, and how we can to use them ? <br />
- Exists documentation?<br />
<br />
Anyone have an example?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance !!!<br />
<br />
Dani.</div></div><hr />

I have used a product developed from Fullscope tha will let you call a Baan DLL from outside application. The ERP adapter itself is in Java and one can do lot of fun stuff with it. Also they have a product - session automator, its like AFS. So one can create a BAAN DLL, pass all the parameter, then use session automator to create sales orders. Call the ERP adapter from an external applications and here is your solution ready that will use the same customization code that you have developed for Baan. Its pretty neat.<br />

Anyway we are looking for an open source solution. Following the forum I interpret that it's possible, but I'm not able to find the solution. Maybe exists one manner to calculate the &quot;hash&quot; values, or another secret way...<br />
<br />
I would appreciate that if someone know that NOT exists any &quot;free&quot; way to make this tell me please; and we'll think to use a propietary solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

    To call BAAN 4GL functions in a C-program the BAAN functions must<br />
    be converted to a C-like format. These functions must be declared with<br />
    the keyword EXTERN and usually they are located in a library (so called<br />
    Dynamic Link Library (DLL)).<br />
<br />
    Conversion of a BAAN library to a C-library can be realized with the<br />
    program bic_cstub.<br />
<br />
    SYNOPSIS<br />
<br />
    bic_cstub6.1 [-s] [-a] -d &lt;library&gt; -o &lt;object&gt;<br />
<br />
    DESCRIPTION<br />
<br />
    The program bic_cstub converts a BAAN library with external functions<br />
    to a C-source. After conversion the external functions can be called in<br />
    a C-program. The BAAN 4GL functions keeps the same name, except the<br />
    following rules:<br />
    -  dots ('.') in function names will be converted into underlines ('_')<br />
    -  dollar signs ('$') in function names will be removed<br />
<br />
    Options:<br />
<br />
         -s :   the generated C-source only handles single byte characters<br />
         -a :   an ANSI-C source will be generated<br />
         -d :   specifies the BAAN library which must be converted<br />
         -o :   specifies the name of the C-source; the destination<br />
                of the converted library<br />
<br />
<br />
    If the -s option is not specified, string arguments in a BAAN 4GL<br />
    function will be converted to a string in TSS (BAAN Super<br />
    Set) format. The BAAN Super Set contains both multibyte and<br />
    single byte characters.<br />
<br />
    By default, function arguments in BAAN are passed by value.<br />
    When an argument has to be passed by reference it is prefixed by the<br />
    keyword 'ref'. In the generated C-function all reference arguments are<br />
    pointers. So, when a BAAN 4GL function has two arguments of type long,<br />
    one passed by reference and one passed by value, the first argument of<br />
    the generated C-function will be of type pointer to long and the second<br />
    will be of type long.<br />
<br />
    Refer to chapter Demo aplicación for more information about the<br />
    usage of this program.</div></div><hr />
