The task is to skipp (= not show to the user) all records that has a key not present with specific attribute in another table.<br />
1. Do it on tiedm010 Eitems. I make a 'after.get.object' in the DAL, make the evaluation, return DALHOOKERROR if the record is not to be shown. Works fine. This form is of type 2.<br />
2. ..on tiedm100, revisions. This form is of type 3, the eitem in the head and the revisions on lines. I do the same program changes. And it works, i.e. the revisions that should not show do not show. BUT ... ALL eitems show in the header when I scroll, also the ones that were 'skipped' (I see no revisions for them ofcourse).<br />
The customer does not want to see these.</div></div><hr />

main.table.io: <br />
read.view: <br />
        evaluation - skip.io(&quot;&quot;).<br />
<br />
According to the manual: &quot;read.view&quot; lives and the other subsections for main.table.io should be replaced by DAL-pgming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">22nd August 2006, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">You should not use skip.io, rather use the query.extend.where functions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">22nd August 2006, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm Maria, I tried the q.ext.wh but didn't get what I wanted. It is surely faster so I would very much like to use it but I found it weak. Pls correct me if I am wrong. <br />
<br />
Let us invent a simple example which is similar to what I was doing: <br />
Assume we have a session with the item table (tcibd001) as main table.<br />
I want to skip all items (tcibd001.item) that are not tibom010.mitm in a BOM with at least one record with tibom010.cwar = &quot;ABC123&quot;.<br />
How do I program that with query.extend.where? And if I also use query.extend.select/from; without getting extra occurences of the wanted tcibd001-records.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">23rd August 2006, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">It certainly worked with the 'exists' in q.ext.where. Thankyou.</div></div><hr />
