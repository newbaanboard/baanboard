<br />
I'm not a guru in BaaN's world, and I need to create a new session with a some fields showing calculated values (amounts) taking information from several tables.<br />
<br />
First of all I created a table with the fields I needed, and created the session, but as I realised that it wasn't necessary to load anything in a table, just show the information at the running-time, I decided to delete the table definition and it's reference in the session definition.<br />
<br />
Now, every time I try to run the session, a 509 error appears in the event viewer of the server.<br />
<br />
Â¿Is there any way to create a new main session with no reference to a table?<br />
<br />
Thank you so much.</div></div><hr />

As per you query it seems that you want to create a session with some field as refernce field from other table.<br />
<br />
For this you can use Refernce when you create table from ttadv4520m000 and use ref mode Mendatory unless empty or if you don't want to give refence at the table creation time you can use it from Program script check.<br />
<br />
Now About Error 509, It seems that you have deleted the table and trying to run the session with main table as that table. so create that table again do CRDD properly.<br />
<br />
The another solu given by &quot;Ravi&quot; will work if you want to sipmly update some values without storing it.<br />
<br />
If now also you are facing problem let me know.</div></div><hr />

I tried to generate a session of type &quot;Update&quot; directly without main table and system didn't let me do it, but I used one table to generate it.<br />
<br />
After that, I deleted fields of that &quot;main table&quot; from the form to avoid a compilation error, and finally deleted the reference to the table in the definition of the new session.<br />
<br />
Now I can run it wothout problems.<br />
<br />
Thank you to both, I had done it some time but I don't remember what kind of session it was. I thought that could be possible with any type of session, but it's checked that it isn't.<br />
<br />
Every day we learn something else...<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />
