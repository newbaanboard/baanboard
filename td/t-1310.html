<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Punitha</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing help texts for customized reports and I am searching for all commands that I can embed in the help texts.<br />
Currently I am aware of the following:<br />
Using links: Example: %SEtdsls1812s000<br />
Using just the title: %SE@tdsls1812s000<br />
Hyperlinks: %GO(X,xxxx), %MK(Y,yyyy)<br />
Commenting: |#<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me of other commands that you might be aware of?<br />
Also, I am having difficulty in creating popup help texts?  Again, can someone help me out here?<br />
<br />
Also, I have seen &quot;%GBa&quot;, &quot;%GBb&quot; etc. in standard Baan help texts?  Can someone tell me how these are created/used?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the best thing about this forum is not that we can get some answers, but that we can share our ideas, experience, etc.  It is very important for any member that has a problem to be able to find the answers to his problems in the old threads. It is useful to so a search, using certain strings, etc. I have learned a lot of things in this way, since Baan does not have a good documentation. <br />
<br />
 The idea: If somebody has the same problem with you, he/she will search this forum for &quot;help text&quot;. He will find this thread. Will he get any answer? No....  He will only find that you have managed to do it. But  the question is : HOW ???<br />
<br />
 So, it may be useful for others to describe how you did it. I know that time is a problem for everybody, but this should be like a way to &quot;reward&quot; the other members.  <br />
<br />
 Since we can get so much help at this forum, (how much time would it take to discover all these by ourselves, without any help ?) , I think we should always find some time to share with others what we have managed to do, and how.<br />
<br />
 Special thanks to all moderators of these boards, especially to Patrick, Victor,  Han,  Mark, ~Vamsi and James. They all spent so much time helping others.... <br />
<br />
  Thanks again !!!</div></div><hr />

I think the best thing about this forum is not that we can get some answers, but that we can share our ideas, experience, etc.  ....etc.<br />
<br />
Hear, hear, Stefan.<br />
<br />
I'll drink to that.<br />
<br />
(of course I would drink to anything but that's a different thread all together)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Punitha</div><div class="date">12th March 2002, 00:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize to everyone.  I agree that the forum should also serve to share experiences.<br />
<br />
Pls. find attached a text file that contains syntaxes that can be used when creating help texts.  I got it from &quot;Knowledge Quest&quot;.   Also,  I have added some examples for two of the frequently used commands.</div></div><hr />
