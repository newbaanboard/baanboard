We are setting up a multi currency environment for one of our subsidiaries which will run on a different Bshell. Our main company is on a different Bshell. We are planning to have whole bunch of sessions which will run in the main company and will have to fetch data from the different Bshell of our subsidiary company. We are planning to make use of openworld components for this purpose and would like to know more about how think is working in your companies. And specifically about the 'xget' function. I would appreciate if any of you working in a similar environment can provide some info. Thanks much.<br />
