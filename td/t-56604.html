<br />
The On case statement showed me some weird results in baan.<br />
Can anybody throw light on it!<br />
<br />
I had written On case statement as<br />
<br />
                     on case temp.str<br />
                     case tmp.str1:<br />
                                hold = 1<br />
                                break<br />
                     case tmp.str2:<br />
                                 hold = 2<br />
                                break<br />
                    endcase<br />
<br />
Now if my tmp.str1 and tmp.str2 are equall i.e. say tmp.str1 = tmp.str2 = &quot;ABC&quot;<br />
If input temp.str = &quot;ABC&quot;<br />
then the cursor directly goes to second case i.e it returns hold = 2<br />
<br />
Currenctly for this reason i had replaced this &quot;On case&quot; with &quot;IF&quot; statement and its working fine.<br />
Just want to know y its not going to first case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th August 2009, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">On case statement may prepare internally array of constants and then may be searching binary mode (in which first written constant does not come first ). And due to that reason only it's claimed to faster that if-the-else iterations . U may try with 3 values also . My guess in that case also it will be 2nd only . As long as it gives consistent results in all cases (like in ur case), it can not be said to weird behavior . <br />
<br />
Do some good testing and give feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th August 2009, 22:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I read somewhere that the case statement would always execute the last statement that it matches. I also believe the case statement was set-up for unique values - never tried something like this.  A good test would to be like hitest recommended is to add a third choice where it matches it also.  That would give you a better test.</div></div><hr />

I would try to avoid this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
    Thanks for ur inputs but when i tried more cases it went to the last.<br />
Hence what mark is saying is right in Baan the On case statemnt searches from the last, atleast in case of Simialr data.</div></div><hr />
