I have attached a snapshot of a form that I just designed and the last field description should be &quot;Records Failed&quot; but it ends up being &quot;Record       s Failed&quot;  (bunch of spaces between the 'd' and the 's' in the work 'Records').<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

I never really took the time to investigate and solve the problem - it was just easier to create a lable or find one that was suitable.<br />

As for the attachments what I do is a screenshot, then I open photoshop, paste it in and save it as a jpg.  Then you can just attach the jpg.  Then when the message is display the jpg appears. That works for me.<br />
