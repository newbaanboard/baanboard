<br />
You can make an exchange scheme to export tu tables (use multiline text for the scripts). On another system you can make a same scheme to import the tu tables. Done that many times in the past, works perfect..<br />

If tu runtime dictionaries and program objects are present (not deleted by any sys admin) and u include the package tu in your package combination , this will be available to you once u process the changes in your package combination (ttaad1121m000).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanForever</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">To ex/import Exchangeschems you must ex/import module tuxch ONLY - not whole package tu. Condition scrips are in texts, that's why you have to copy them manualy through the external text editor(like notepad) by copy/past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">You could also create a company strictly for holding master copies of Exchange Schemes so you can dump and load the entire company between computer systems as well as use Baan session to copy specific Exchange Scheme from one company to another (this will also take care of the text issue as well).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanForever</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 09:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Brendan you are not absolutely right. I shall try to explain. (excuse for my English:)) Text has &quot; text number &quot; and if you will try to load the text from the company in another and there already present this text number(for example adhered to a item, etc), that is two variants. You or rewrite existing, or will not load condition script. Depending on parameters of import. Be care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">This problem can be solved by using multiline export/import for the text parts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanForever</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">kbartelds, i don't understand what do you mean?<br />
Can you explain more detailed? What is the &quot;multiline export/import&quot;. How can you safety import text in different company?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">In maintain ascii file formats (tuxch0103s000), you can define the layout of the ascii file. There are 3 kinds of field: alphanumeric, numeric and multi line text. In case of multiline text the export scheme does not export the text number, but reads the actual textlines from tttxt010 (for all languages) to be put in the ascii file.<br />
<br />
On subsequent import scheme (tuxch0122s000, form 3) the baan text field can be filled with the textnumber (field textnumber = yes) or a new textnumber can be created (field textnumber = no).<br />
<br />
This, in combination with tuxch0112m000 (maintain ranges) gives you the possibility to use exchange to select exchange schemes to be exported (with scripts as text), so all relevant tu tables. On another system the same exchange scheme can be created to import the tu ascii files, including the conditionscripts, without overwriting existing textlines in tttxt tables.<br />
<br />
I have done this many times: develloping exchange scheme and take it to the customers system, no problem!<br />
<br />
Of course it is possible to have a seperate company in which exchange schemes are located. But if you want to transfer schemes from one system to another, the text might become a problem again, so use exchange scheme for it, that's why it is there for.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanForever</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I have understood. You suggest to transfer Exchange Scheme using new Exchange Scheme. May be it will easier, but it is disputable :). In this case you have to create these new Shemes in both systems by hands. If you have many scripts and frequently copy Schemes between 2 systems it is justified. But more often it is not necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, actually, to create such a scheme doesn't take more then 5 minutes, schemes can be generated based on the tu tablestructure.<br />
