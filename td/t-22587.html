<br />
we use SSA Baan ERP LN 6.1 and need to separate the adress line (street, number) from the line with P.O.-Box and City by an empty line. In earlier Baan versions it was always necessary to do this by programming.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Is there any solution to do this by programming in LN?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
Stephan</div></div><hr />

Hi Stephan,<br />
in Versions V there was no need to program, because the concept of adressformats was introduced. Don't know LN but it should be the same. Have a look at sessions tccom4535m000 and tccom4135s000.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
thanks for your help. Your post was very usefull. I made an entry on second form &quot;Kommunikation&quot; of session &quot;tccom4135s000&quot;. I used the last free individual field, left field description empty and set line (to 6), sequence (to 1), priority (to 1) and space (to 1). The last field (space) is very important. If you leave it zero it doesn't work. But if you put at least 1 into this field, one empty line will be printed.<br />
