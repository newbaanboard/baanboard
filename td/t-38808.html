I am creating a report to compare BOM between two companies and the following SQL is working fine. But I want the company number to be taken from the form which the user inputs. Can someone help me modify the query?<br />

<br />
This cannot be written as an embedded sql or possibly using the wherebind it can be achieved but not sure. As Mark pointed out I have to use dynamic sql. Mark, I do not know dynamic sql and thought someone will write for me and I can use ctrl C ctrl V technology. I will wait for a few more days for any patrons and if there is no other way, I'll take a plunge into dynamic sql.<br />

srikarthy<br />
<br />
I think this is wrong . Have u tested this .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srikarthy</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried but I couldn't write it in normal embedded SQL. When I tried to <br />
maintain the structure  tibom010._compnr = &quot;100,905&quot; with <br />
tibom010._compnr = :company2, :company3 I was getting error. Then I tried with <br />
tibom010._compnr = :company2 or tibom010._compnr = :company3 it compiled but while running, I got Error 304 (general SQL error) on select.<br />
If I use just where tibom010._compnr = :company2 it was working. <br />
<br />
Then I tried using wherebind but here again I could use only one company but I think I have the option to change the company variable.<br />
<br />
select	tibom010.*<br />
	from	tibom010<br />
	where tibom010._compnr = :1<br />
	and tibom010.mitm between :mitm.f and :mitm.t<br />
	wherebind(1, company2)<br />
|	order by tibom010._index1<br />
	selectdo<br />
		rprt_send()<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
Again, here if I use the order by, I am getting error.<br />
<br />
Then I tried with dynamic sql based on Mark's links as below.<br />
<br />
sql = sql.parse(&quot;select tibom010.* from tibom010 where tibom010.mitm between :mitm.f and :mitm.t and &quot; &amp; <br />
			&quot;tibom010._compnr = :1 order by tibom010._index1&quot;)<br />
	sql.where.bind(sql, 1, company2)<br />
<br />
	sql.exec(sql)<br />
	while ( true )<br />
	message(str$(sql))<br />
	sql.fetch(sql)<br />
	if eendfile = true then<br />
	sql.break(sql)<br />
	endif<br />
	rprt_send()<br />
	endwhile<br />
	sql.close(sql)<br />
<br />
This was working too but was indefintely looping and I didn't explore further. Again here I can change the variable company2. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK order by clause will not work when compnr is used . This is due to the way the indices stored and the way the database drivers work . <br />
<br />
So to answer ur query , merging records of 2 companies in 1 SQL in merged order is not possible . If u just printing , why dont u sort the same in report only . <br />
<br />
I think the same problem with dynamic sql.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is another example - should help on breaking out of the query:<br />

				tipgc001.ccot = prj.grp<br />
				tiitm001.dsca = item.dsca<br />
				rprt_send()<br />

					update.standard.item()<br />

				break<br />
			default:<br />
				found = false<br />
		endcase<br />
	endwhile<br />
<br />
<br />
I would expect the very first code you posted to look something like this:<br />
<br />
	sql.code = sql.code &amp; &quot;select   tibom010.* &quot;<br />
	sql.code = sql.code &amp; &quot;from     tibom010 &quot;<br />
	sql.code = sql.code &amp; &quot;where    tibom010._index1 inrange {&quot; &amp; chr$(34) &amp; mitm.f &amp; chr$(34)  &amp; &quot;}&quot; &amp;<br />
							    &quot; and {&quot;&amp; chr$(34) &amp; mitm.t &amp; chr$(34) &amp; &quot;} &quot;<br />
	sql.code = sql.code &amp; &quot;and      tibom010._compnr = &quot; &amp; chr$(34) &amp;&quot;100&quot; &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; &quot;905&quot; &amp; chr$(34) &amp; &quot; &quot;<br />
	sql.code = sql.code &amp; &quot;order by tibom010._index1&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
You could always replace &quot;100&quot; and &quot;905&quot; with string variables from your user.  Also note I do not use wherebind - based off the first query.  Mainly because your user input mitm.f and mitm.t.  So use the actual input data. So if your first query works for you then something like the above should also work and allow you to have the company numbers as input fields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srikarthy</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Hitesh, I have come to know now that merging records of 2 companies is not possible. But when I didn't use variables, the following query gave me more or less what I wanted. I can say it was giving a bit of merged one. This type of query is in the Baan document as an example and may be it works only that way. <br />
<br />
select tibom010.*<br />
from tibom010<br />
where tibom010.mitm between :mitm.f and :mitm.t<br />
and tibom010._compnr = &quot;100,905&quot;<br />
order by tibom010._index1<br />
selectdo<br />
rprt_send()<br />
endselect<br />

The result in the report detail section was <br />
<br />
100 manuf1:<br />
               component1<br />
               component2<br />
905 manuf1:<br />
               component1<br />
               component2<br />
<br />
100 manuf2:<br />
               component3<br />
               component4<br />

905 manuf2:<br />
               component3<br />
               component6<br />
             <br />
I brought in the after layout they are side by side and then suppressed the identical ones so that only the difference appears in the report. This was after considerable effort. Now I will try in the dynamic sql to change the company after a change in manufactured item and see whether somehow I can fit the program script for my report script. Otherwise I'll just use fixed companies. Once again, thanks for the quick response.<br />

U can still use variables for company numbers (not usiing &quot;100,905&quot; or in  specification) using OR condition  like<br />
<br />
select tibom010.*<br />
from tibom010<br />
where tibom010.mitm between :mitm.f and :mitm.t<br />
and (tibom010._compnr = :company1 OR<br />
tibom010._compnr = :company2) <br />
order by tibom010._index1<br />
selectdo<br />
    rprt_send()<br />
endselect</div></div><hr />

Hi Hitesh,<br />
<br />
Brilliant. It is working. I was missing the brackets. It compiled without brackets and thought Baan was wrong when I got the SQL error while running. So it seems a successful compilation doesn't mean the code is correct. I must not forget to use brackets whenever there is &quot;and&quot; &quot;or&quot; mix up. Thanks very much. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
If you want to select records from more than one company, then it depends on the version whether the driver allows those constructions I see here.<br />
<br />
In LN it is no longer allowed to join on the ._compnr variable or to use the &quot;or&quot; construction with it. A table can only be read in one company at a time. <br />
<br />
In LN you can however use the UNION ALL command. This command does not work with a query extend, so you can not use it to show data of multiple companies in one session, however it can perfectly work as a query to get data on a report. Here a short part from the programmer's manual:<br />
The following example joins the names of all employees in companies 000 and 001 having a salary bigger than 40000. The result is sorted by company.<br />
<br />
SELECT _compnr, firstnme, lastname<br />
FROM dbtst120<br />
WHERE salary &gt; 40000<br />
   AND _compnr = 000<br />
<br />
UNION ALL<br />
<br />
SELECT _compnr, firstnme, lastname<br />
FROM dbtst120<br />
WHERE salary &gt; 40000<br />
   AND _compnr = 001<br />
<br />
ORDER BY _compnr<br />
Note that in this case it is possible to sort by name, since both SELECT statements share the column name for the first column.<br />
<br />
