<br />
I am Trying to create a File from Baan. I am using the operations seq.open, seq.puts and seq.close operations but the file is not getting created.<br />
<br />
My Code is as below<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
        file.name = num.to.date$(date.num(),3)<br />
        file.pointer = seq.open(file.name,&quot;w+&quot;,form.path)<br />
        update.desc = enum.descr$(&quot;tcyesno&quot;,form.update)<br />
        file.input = &quot; Update = &quot; &amp; update.desc &amp; &quot;, &quot; &amp; str$(date.num()) &amp;<br />
                        &quot; &quot; &amp; str$(time.num()) &amp; &quot;, &quot;<br />
        ret.val = seq.puts(file.input, file.pointer)<br />
        file.input = &quot;Installation,Sales Order,Line&quot;<br />
        ret.val = seq.puts(file.input, file.pointer)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have used seq.close later in the Codes too. All the Return values are good.<br />
<br />
Anybody with some Clue?<br />
<br />

Hello,<br />
are you sure, the RETURN value of :<br />
<br />
file.pointer = seq.open(file.name,&quot;w+&quot;,form.path)<br />
<br />
is OK ?<br />
<br />
To check, try to create the file in users HOME .<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wonderkid</div><div class="date">1st November 2012, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">- since u have given only the filename... the file must b created in home dir..<br />
<br />
- check the permission of the folder wer u r creating the file...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">1st November 2012, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">What are your default date separators?  num.to.date$ mode = 3 will provide a date with separators.  You will probably have a problem if the separator is a &quot;/&quot;.  Might want to try with mode = 0 to get the date without separators.  <br />
<br />
Also, check for your file pointer &gt; 0 right after 'seq.open' and only perform file operations when &gt; 0.<br />
<br />
You probably don't need &quot;w+&quot; for openmode if you don't intend to read the file.  If you are adding entries at the end of an existing file, you should use &quot;a&quot; for the openmode instead (&quot;at&quot; if the file is created for windows OS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">2nd November 2012, 06:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually when i gave the file name along with the whole path it made a difference.Otherwise the file was getting created in my Default Home Directory..<br />
<br />
Needless to say the Return values were quite correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your Replies.</div></div><hr />
