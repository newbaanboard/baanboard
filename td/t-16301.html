<br />
I have a little problem. In the session &quot;Contact By Business Partner&quot;, few of contacts of some business partners have role &quot;Buy-From&quot;, but when I check in the table Buy-From-business-Partner (tccom120) for those business partners, information is not correct. <br />
<br />
There are 2 case, <br />
one is: no record for that business partner in table tccom120, <br />
second is: records is exists but the contact field (ccnt) is empty. <br />
<br />
In some cases only one records is exists but it supposed that more then one records should exists as in the session more then one contacts has role Buy-From.<br />
<br />
what could be the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
