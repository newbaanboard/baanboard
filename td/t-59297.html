 <br />
Occurrences are buffered; they get flushed to disk / database when you leave the session, press the save button, or when you insert some records and you reach the end of the screen (maybe some more events).<br />
 <br />
Here is a code snipped (untested); to keep it simple I made one assumption: Add a field &quot;flag&quot; to your table.<br />
 <br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
  double total<br />
 <br />
main.table.io:<br />
after.read:<br />
  &lt;table&gt;.flag = 0<br />
before.write:<br />
   &lt;table&gt;.flag = 1<br />
before.rewrite:<br />
   &lt;table&gt;.flag = 1<br />
 <br />
functions:<br />
 <br />
function check.occurances()<br />
{<br />
  long i<br />
 <br />
  total = 0.0<br />
 <br />
  | calculate the sums &quot;on the screen&quot;<br />
  for i = 1 to fattr.occurnr<br />
    do.occ.without.update( check.occ, i )<br />
  endfor<br />
 <br />
  | add the sums already written to db<br />
  on.main.table( check.db )<br />
}<br />
 <br />
function check.occ()<br />
{<br />
  if &lt;table&gt;.flag = 0 then<br />
    total = total + &lt;table.field&gt;<br />
  endif<br />
}<br />
 <br />
function check.db()<br />
{<br />
  select ...<br />
  from &lt;table&gt;<br />
  where ...<br />
  and &lt;table&gt;.flag = 1<br />
  selectdo<br />
    ....<br />
    total = total + &lt;table.field&gt;<br />
  endselect<br />
}<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th September 2010, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Well on the last field of input you could always do a check.input.  So lets say you had item and 3 percentage fields(field1, field2, field3).  On field3 you could do a check.input to make sure field1,2,3 add to 100 - if not give a message and do a input.again.  That would be one check.<br />
<br />
Then if they want to randomly change percentages on the form and hit the save button.  Maybe a check.all.input would work in choice.update.db section.  Not really sure about that.  <br />
<br />
The key is knowing figuring out which events get fired depending on what button the user hits.  To debug this what I will do is add in all of the sections I can think off - put a different message in each section. Then I pretend to be a &quot;user&quot; and do things randomly to document which messages I get when.  Now the one thing I have learned is there is no stopping a user from turning off his desktop if it is not going their way. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">30th September 2010, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">The main problem is, I don't know which of the 5 fields the last ist. Depending on the amount of records in another table (1 - 5) not everytime all 5 fields need to be filled.<br />
Also, when users changing field and leaving the check has to be done.<br />
So, I supposed the easiest way should be do the check after leaving the occurence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">30th September 2010, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm. &quot;After leaving the occurence&quot; means when.field.changes (or check.input) of that input field. This event will fire for each occurrence.<br />
 <br />
Btw. I've been thinking some time about your problem. Let's say you have 100 occurances each with a quantity of 1; so its okay. Now, while writing to the database the user closes the baan client (network error, what so ever). This will give &quot;corrupted&quot; data, right? So you must write all data within one transaction´and you can't use the standard function.<br />

<br />
Gunther - he would have 1 record with upto 5 fields that add up to 100.<br />
<br />
Alex - do you know how many fields there are? I mean is that passed back or can it be determined?  Then you can do a generic check on that by use for loop to add the 1 to 5 fields. Then check it against 100 - if they don't equal then pop up the message. <br />
<br />
Can you post a screen print of the session?</div></div><hr />

I have faced on such requirement, check was required on amount. <br />
Session was developed with Multi-occ form for maintaining Payment Schedule for project element. And session should not allow user to exceed the amount at header.<br />
<br />
So code was written to validate total payment amount entered on each line.<br />
Check applies in case if users is Inserting line, Updating Existing Line, Updating newly inserted (not saved) lines.<br />
<br />
Check if it helps you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
field.ttmmm213.amnt:<br />
before.input:<br />
	tmp.amnt = ttmmm213.amnt<br />
check.input:<br />
	if choice &lt;&gt; update.db then<br />
		if (tot.amnt + ttmmm213.amnt - tmp.amnt) &gt; element.amnt then<br />
			message(&quot;Total amount should not exceeed the amount of element.&quot;)<br />
			set.input.error(&quot;&quot;)<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
after.input:<br />
	tot.amnt = tot.amnt - tmp.amnt + ttmmm213.amnt<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">4th October 2010, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I attached a screenshot. How many rows are used is defined in another table. I read this table on session start to get the headlines over the rows. So I know how many will be used.<br />
I'll try the suggestion of sameer.don. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
