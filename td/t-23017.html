Is this going to be a one time thing?  or will  you need to do this often?  What table do you want to load?  There are several options - exchange scheme, API function Server, or just a plain old 4gl sessions.  You can search the board for exchange schemes, go to the AFS/DDC/OLE forum for information on API function servers, and you could probably use client2server to use to move a file from the client to the server to load in baan.  You could also search on FTP to see what others have done for situations like this.<br />

Good Luck!<br />

....Well what table do u want to update Jatin....??<br />
If its just straight forward updates withlut much conditions to be checked then you can go for exchange schemes which<br />
can be made in no time. If you want to automate sessions or use the<br />
application logic for the validation of you data then AFS is the best choice<br />
as mark said. Do let me know if you need help on any of those two.</div></div><hr />
