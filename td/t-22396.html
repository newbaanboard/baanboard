You can always go to the report and add the two fields there.  Just add a new field to the report and add tdsls045.amnt + tdsls045.ldam as the print expression.<br />
<br />
If you need development documentation then use the wiki attached to this board along with the tools help.  This should get you started.  Just keep in mind the wiki is Baan V commands, but most are available in Baan IV.<br />
