<br />
I have to do a report for tracking incoming lots.<br />
Any item that is received is given a lot and i have to know if the qty received is still in stock or not.<br />
<br />
I can get the exisiting stock of lots from tdltc001.stoc<br />
<br />
But have been stumped as to how to get the lot stock if the lot is issued to different production orders and the manufactured item from those production order may be in stock or still  futher issued to other production order.<br />
<br />
Any hints/ideas ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th March 2005, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you could use outbound data to track which production orders it has been issued to.  You could then check to see if this part is in stores or been issued to a next higher.  The problem is that if you build 12 of part x and use 3 lots to supply inventory to the 12.  There is nothing in Baan to track which part got which lot.<br />
