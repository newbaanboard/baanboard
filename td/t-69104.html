<br />
I have created a display session tfgld1510m000. This session mimics sub session tfgld1510s000 (Display batches by finalization run number)<br />
<br />
Main table used for this session is tfgld100 and primary index is Index 5, which consists of Year, Finalization run number and batch.<br />
I have taken first two fields in the header part.<br />
<br />
Now the problem is whenever I am clicking on next group or previous group, the data is not refreshed on form. For this I have to click on Refresh from Edit menu.<br />
<br />
Can anybody guide me what could be the issue ?<br />
<br />
Screen shot of form attached.<br />

Assuming you created your own script for the new session - you could probably use the subsession script, but I am not too familiar with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">20th July 2016, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">It is indeed related to script type, as Mark says. Assuming that the session was generated from scratch as with a Form Type 3, it should already have the Program Script type as Type 1/2/3 with M. Table.<br />
<br />
If the script type is not so, change it to that and recompile.<br />
<br />
For good measure, do a Create Runtime DD of the session itself, EXIT out completely from BAAN, and restart.<br />
<br />
(Unless there is some programmatic change which is preventing the session from behaving as it should.)</div></div><hr />
