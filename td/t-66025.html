<br />
Entering long digit and meaningless text into PO lines text editor is very risky, therefore, is there any way to use copy(from wordpad/pdf) and paste the words to PO lines text editor?<br />
<br />
How to make the setting.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the special characters often cause issues. I guess the user has to manually edit it when he copies the text. Also, they can use the option of Attachment using ODM functionality. Not sure if its present in your version. But for LN, it works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th April 2014, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We use notepad for out PO text.  And if they cut and paste from word then you can run into the same problem as bhushan has mentioned.  But if they use straight plain text files it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">10th April 2014, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We use notepad as well but it is a problem if you use multiple languages as you lose the ability to change language or copy between languages.<br />
<br />
With Webui text editor you can copy and paste from external applications to/from baan ( and keep all of the language functionality)</div></div><hr />

The SCK is one of the information provided by other application and user need to enter the SCK in the PO lines. Currently BaanIVc not allow to copy and paste to text editor in PO lines.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th April 2014, 06:23</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me you could identify the external editor - like webui or notepad.  Then setup up the text as maintain text with external editor(tttxt1116m000).  What I can remember is where you sent up the external editor.  Then when you open the purchase order text you have it in notepad or what ever you want to use - then cut and paste works.  You just have to make sure it is plain text.  Try it on a test environment to make sure the text prints correct.</div></div><hr />
