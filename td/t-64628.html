I know in 4c4 I can mark records and process them one at a time.  Of course I am not sure that sel.num.selected is available - never used it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">23rd September 2013, 19:37</div></div><div class="posttext">There has been this new version (Infor ERP LN 6.1) and the update (TIV 1075) where they figured out that once a marked record is scrolled off the screen, it should still be marked. So they introduced new functionality and documented it in the ERP LN Tools Manual under &quot;Improved Record selection Cookbook&quot; (quotes can be found on the forum). Yet, once the record is being processed - even with a call to make.current() does not make the marked line the current record buffer, this is either the first or the last record on screen...</div></div><hr />

<br />
With my code:<br />
choice.mark.occur:<br />
after.choice:<br />
	if sel.num.selected() &gt; 0 then<br />
		do.selection(true, one.repair.one.marked.line)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
function one.repair.one.marked.line()<br />
{<br />
	if actual.occ = 6 then<br />
		process.this.record()<br />
	else<br />
		wrong.record.selected()<br />
	endif<br />
}<br />
Multi occ screen with session in debug.<br />
Click on a line somewhere in the middle (actual.occ: 6)<br />
Only function wrong.record.selected() is executed, because actual.occ = filled.occ<br />
Actually, I obviously make the error thinking the do.selection() should also modify the internal 4GL variable actual.occ, which is not the case.<br />
<br />
My problem however is that I notice that the current record-buffer within the function one.repair.one.marked.line() appears to be the record of the last filled occurrence instead of the selected record (keyfields, other tablefields).<br />
<br />
My actual code looks more like:<br />
function one.repair.one.marked.line()<br />
{<br />
	if selection.key1 = whinh215._index1 then<br />
		process.this.record()<br />
	else<br />
		if filled.occ.key1 = whinh215._index1 then<br />
			appears.last.record()<br />
		else<br />
			if first.record.key1 = whinh215._index1 then<br />
				appears.first.record()<br />
			else<br />
				other.wrong.record()<br />
			endif<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
How can I ensure that the record buffer is filled with the actual selected record(s)? I assume &quot;the tools&quot; should take care of that, not me as a programmer. But maybe I overlook something...:confused:</div></div><hr />

Some of us don't get to play with ln. :)<br />
<br />
Now I get it - scrolling a marked record off the screen and it still shows as marked.  I can only do marked records on current screen - that would be great.</div></div><hr />

(shown by the Help-About-System Information session in the BW interface - rightclick on the icon in the systray). Might be over 1075 voor BaanIV?</div></div><hr />

In this something you get by looking at the baan bwc client - not sure where this right click might be.  Remember we are still on 4c4.</div></div><hr />

I see you posting many times that you are soon going to acquire LN. So, you better start preparing a to-do list ;)<br />
<br />
I am sure you are going to have a lot of playing with LN tools. :)</div></div><hr />

If we are lucky with the budgets then maybe in 2015.  We are looking at doing a database upgrade and SP in 2014.  At least that is what I was told, but you never know.</div></div><hr />

Alas this did not do the trick. What I would like to have: right after marking a line and as soon as certain conditions are met ('lack of data' in the data-setup) sessions pop up to add the data needed, for the items on the marked line.<br />
<br />
The problems started when I added a different sort order based on a non-index field in a reference table instead of using the &quot;normal, index based&quot; sort order. I created an incident (in order to have a defect created) with a reproduction scenario (plain new stripped session) . See what happens. I'll keep you posted.</div></div><hr />

I don't quite get what you meant but if you think the problem has something to do with the TIV 1808 you can always chose a lower TIV in maintain script session form and recompile. I had a problem with fixed/based variables and chosing a lower TIV (in my case 1000) resolved it.</div></div><hr />

It is not a lasting solution to create an object that uses the backward compatability when the newer tools cause the error. You only buy time to have Infor solve the issue toolswise.</div></div><hr />
