I have developped a baan set of macros that is a developer's delight, and I am making it available for free.<br />
<br />
Here is what it can do.<br />
reformat a declaritive (put keywords into proper columns)<br />
<br />
assure that function definitions begin in column 1.<br />
<br />
automatically indent by 8 after an event keyword (ex, when.field.changes).<br />
<br />
Automatically indent for all other statements (for, if, while, repeat, select, on case, etc).<br />
<br />
keyword highlighting (bold), strings are in green, and comments in red.<br />
<br />
Keyword matching, even with nested keywords. For example, match an if with it's endif, or an else with it's if and it's endif, for all code where there are loop type statements (including select ... endselect).<br />
<br />
Reminder. It works only if you have the multi-edit editor. I don't make the editor available, but I would email the baan support files to those requesting a copy.</div></div><hr />

Just make sure you include the appropriate dis-claimer.  Most of what you mentioned is also available in the SciTE editor to post in that forum.  Check the SciTE post for an example.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">6th November 2004, 03:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used both. Wscite is a great editor, but I find Multiedit to be better, not because I know it better, but because I can do more with it.  <br />
<br />
Wscite has the baan support, and recognizes keywords and indentations. It has no keyword matching capabilities, which are important when there are nested language constructs. <br />
<br />
With Multiedit I can match nested ifs, on cases, while, repeat selects, and so forth, with any mix of nesting, to any practical depth, and with a simple command, I find the matching opener or closer.  Indenting is smart, in that it knows what it is the appropriate indent or exdent required. Wscite has some of it, but does not allow highlighting matching constructs.  Wscite has literal and regular expression searching. The next version of Multiedit will include these as well as Perl multi-line regular expression matching. <br />
<br />
I don't recall, but Multi-edit has a very deep undo capability. It can be made infinite (I set it up to allow undo of the last 100 changes).<br />
<br />
Both have keyword bolding.<br />
<br />
Let me suggest that you try each editor, and chose the one you like best. I have no ego trip with this. I have used wscite for smaller baan scripts, but not for 500 to 1000 line ones.</div></div><hr />
