I just can't understand it,<br />
<br />
you can maintain the texgroups (Only for Notepad) with tttxt1116m000.<br />
All othe textgroups are managed by BaaN editor.<br />
<br />
With tttxt1111m000 you can maintain the rigts by textgroup for users,<br />
read, use, maintain.<br />
<br />
If a user is set to &quot;read&quot; for a textgroup, he can't maintain the texts in this textgroup.<br />
<br />
