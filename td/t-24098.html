Is it  &quot;field value is out of range and does not agree with the domain definition.&quot; between 4c2 &amp; 4c4<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">6th June 2005, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">So how do you fix this error? :eek:<br />
<br />
I continue to receive <br />
<br />
F:/dict/ddb4c4whi4/dtccom/dtccom022 not matching with the dump<br />
<br />
There are several tables that generate this.  they do indeed have a different definition that the dump from c2 (in this case 022 in c4 has 2 additional fields).<br />
How can I tell the load to ignore that and just load the data in the fields that are there?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beginer</div><div class="date">7th June 2005, 08:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi ,<br />
<br />
In that case u need to append 2 blank fields in yr c2 dump to make it compatible with c4 dict.<br />
<br />

<br />
the correct method would be to use &quot;Change package combination for company&quot; - this session does exactly what needs to be done - bdbreconfig:<br />
Use the old DD to write dump files and use another DD to read these files into new tables.<br />
The fastest approach however is to do that manually with awk.<br />
1) check which files have changed<br />
2) write conversion 'scripts' in awk and modify the dumps this way.<br />
You should be careful and not rely on the errors you get now when you try to import the dumps - - - if the number of fields hasn't changed, but some fileds changed position, you won't get an error but still import rubbish.<br />
The above mentioned way assumes that you dump each table into a seperate file.<br />
example to add 2 empty fields to a sequential dump:<br />
awk -f awk1 ttccom022010.S &gt; new/ttccom022010.S<br />
---start of file awk1---<br />
BEGIN{FS=&quot;|&quot;;OFS=&quot;|&quot;}<br />
{print $0 &quot;||&quot;}<br />
---end of file awk1---<br />
assumptions made:<br />
1)you created a seq. dump with seperator &quot;|&quot; in company 010<br />
2)your sequential dump only contains data lines - newer porting sets add 2 lines which hold information when and with which version the dump was created.<br />
If this ist the case, use :<br />
---start of file awk1---<br />
BEGIN{FS=&quot;|&quot;;OFS=&quot;|&quot;}<br />
{if (NR&gt;2) $0=$0 &quot;||&quot;;print $0 }<br />
---end of file awk1---<br />
awk is available for NT too.<br />

<br />
To do it in the baan way:<br />
- create a new package combination derived from your c4 version.<br />
- add a new company to this new package combination<br />
- copy the old dict directory (c2) to this new dict directory.<br />
- (on nt you probably have to restart shm)<br />
- import the data<br />
<br />
Use the change package combination session to convert the old format to the new format.<br />

<br />
agreed. *g*<br />
<br />
But the keywords &quot;short time frame&quot; rang a bell .....<br />
One might not believe how much time can be saved if you 'convert' at least the larger tables with awk.<br />
When we moved from c2 to c4 even a long weekend (3 days because of a public holiday) would not have been sufficient due to some mandatory additional conversion runs. <br />
With some awk scripts we needed less than 24 hours :-)<br />
<br />

again, it's only a few tables.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) create a new package combination on c4 system<br />
2) copy the DD ($BSE/dict/NAMEOFc2PACKAGECOMB/) from the source system to the DD of the new Package Combination on OS level (the whole subdirectory to $BSE/dict/NAMEofc4PACKAGECOMB)<br />
3) create a company and assign it to this new PC<br />
4) Read in the dump into this company <br />
5) Run ttaad1101m000 ('change package combination by company') and change this company to c4 PC<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
identify the changes needed and alter the dump files. <br />
