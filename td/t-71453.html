That will provide the most flexibility for this type of functionality. I do not believe this is integrated with any data in BAAN so I do not see any advantage in developing this in BAAN. Except for academic reasons of learning BAAN 4GL development.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the first step will be to define the different tables and their fields and their inter-relationships. Example Material Master, Operations Master, etc. After that it should be possible to develop data maintenance and reporting sessions. But one has to remember, that it is going to be very rigid once it is developed and not very easy to keep changing on a whim.</div></div><hr />
