<br />
Use db.retry.point() to handle 201 errors. An attempt to update the record was failed and there is no retry point set and hence you get this error.<br />
<br />
201 EROWCHANGED - Row changed by other user<br />
Description: <br />
This error indicates that the record was changed after a delayed lock.  <br />
Solution: <br />
Reattempt to change the row.</div></div><hr />

    I had already set the db.retry.point(), but still it is giving this error message. The strange thing is that when I do the concurrent transaction from ERPLN through different login it is working fine. but when I do the same thing using BDE and SOAP it is failing. Not able to find out why this is happening. Is there any help I can get from anyone ???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remove db.retry mode if used in dal.* I guess this is your code - <br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=195032#poststop<br />
<br />
It will keep calling retry point.<br />
<br />
So, just set retry point, and use DAL without flags.</div></div><hr />

I had used the same code suggested by you and it is not working in concurrent transaction. it is giving 201 (Record changed after delayed lock) error.</div></div><hr />

If possible, post your complete code. That will help to understand the issue better.</div></div><hr />

I'm just working on the same problem using BDE and Soap with concurrent transactions? In LN everything is working fine. The error message is exactly the same.</div></div><hr />
