<br />
I have been recently been at one of the client side, and they have purchased 20 user licence for BaaN IV c4, when we followed up with baan for key validation, at that they told us to fill 19 users in X-Windows user and also use session ttiex3100m000 to specify Tools development licence.<br />
<br />
We did it and got the key from baan, and validated the server. everything worked fine.<br />
<br />
Now what i see is that when total no. of users r 19 , and i try to take another login , it says max. no of users reached...... <br />
<br />
my question is that why did baan tell us to fill 19 users in X-windows heavy user ..... since i am not able to utilise 20th licence ...........<br />
<br />
i ran all these logins having tools development authorisation from the server, till the time it said max. no of users reached, and then i cheked with licmon -u, and it showed me 19.<br />
<br />
Should i contact baan for this and again get the key for 20 users and re-validate the baan..... or is it computed this way only ...... that the last licence can't be utlilised.<br />
<br />
<br />
what is the concept behind this ???<br />

They short-changed you.  Normally they would give 19 BX and 1 BA licence, but it seems they forgot the 1 BA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanlover</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">What is OS they(ur client) are using ? If it is UNIX, try using ba6.1 from OS levev, after using all ur 19 users from BW mode. It should allow u to login if all the 20 users are there in Lic. If u r not able to use ba6.1 after all ur 19 BW users, u should contact baan for that.<br />

<br />
Well my clients r using Win 98, 98 , XP as O/s<br />
I have installed BaaN IV c4 on Win NT 4<br />
<br />
What does BA and BX represents ??? and what does this session do ttiex3100m000 ??<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">BA - ASCII user, not applicable in your situation, to connect to Baan with a telnet session<br />
BX - (X)Windows based user.  You should have 20 of those.<br />
<br />
With ttiex3100, you specify whether Tools Development is activated or not.  During patching this switches the development sessions on or off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My opinion is also that you should contact Baan.<br />
I work mainly with NT/W2K environments and if someone buys for example 10 licences they give him a validation key with 10 BX licences, not 9. <br />
<br />
The development licence is a different thing. It is a switch to activate some development sessions. If someone is doing development, it uses one of the BX licences.<br />
For example, you cannot have at the same time, 10 &quot;normal&quot; users plus 1 development user if your licence has only 10 BX.<br />

They're supposed to give you 1 more (1 light) and (20) heavy.. <br />
Although who knows check your license code report, Since light users are cheaper, and you have to have one, maybe you filled it out wrong when you purchased the licenses...<br />

<br />
It´s possible that in the licence session you insert less users and the licences daemon still works. If you write more than 20 users, the licences daemon will stop.<br />
<br />
If you try (in UNIX):<br />
$&gt; licmon6.1 -k<br />
$&gt; licd6.1<br />
<br />
If your system it´s windows it´s easier, restart the service of the licence after the changes.</div></div><hr />
