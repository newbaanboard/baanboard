<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to add to the contents of a variable in the &quot;initpr&quot;-initialization string. For example:<br />
<br />
<br />
test=spmhg15001,<br />
initpr=\EE\\\\$test\\plmhg10150\12\13\E&amp;l26a66F\E(10U\E&amp;k0H,<br />

We tried that, but found, that &quot;$test&quot; would not be resolved. Is there an other way?</div></div><hr />

We don't like to put the additional information in every Baan-Report. We think about using the printer drivers somehow. For example: add a variable to the &quot;initpr&quot;-string. We tried that already, but the variable was't resolved. In the datastream was only the name of the variable, which we add to &quot;initpr&quot;, not the content.<br />

initpr=\EE\\\\$test\\plmhg10150\12\13\E&amp;l26a66F\E(10U\E&amp;k0H,  <br />

Off course all proposals are welcome, also if the use an totaly other way to solve the problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">First a question: Why?<br />
<br />
Because you are on Unix, I think yes. You can use a type-file to do this.<br />
I don't see a reason why you don't write the init-String in a type file. You only have to place it as the first colomn/row in your report. You can also use two init-strings (the original and the special you need). The init does nothing else then setting some defaults to the printer. If you leave the first \EE (its a reset) in your string, you can overwrite the init with any values you like.<br />
<br />
In the type-file use &quot;\033&quot; for Escape (octal, why ever).<br />
<br />
echo &quot;\033E\033&amp;l26a66F\033(10U\033&amp;k0H \c&quot; would the same like the init (currently not sure about \c or /c, but it is important at the end of a line!).<br />

He does not want to have to modify every report on the system. I can not think of a good way to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
please avoid double postings!!!<br />
<br />
Anyway here my idea for the topic:<br />
<br />
Configure your printers in Baan to be of type direct, then instead of calling the lp command in the baan printer config, call a unix scripts (lets call it mylp). Now change the printer driver to contain a unique key for example <br />
%mylpkey% and in the mylp script first replace the key with whatever you like (using the sed command) and then call normally the printer command, ie. lp with the result.<br />
<br />
This should work, I think.<br />
<br />

We are doing similar things (barcoding, PDF, formular management) the same way. If you don't set the original init (or like Markus suggested use a &quot;special string&quot; for sed as init), you can create a new file with your init, just add the the baan output with cat and send the new file to the printer.<br />

<br />
we solved the problem in the way Markus suggested. All the more we use already scripts, to handle printerdata. <br />
<br />
mark_h: sorry I didn't try the ${test} because we tried already a script! But this is an interessting proposal an I will test it, if I have the possibilty. And sorry about the double postings, I don't remember how that happens. <br />
<br />
<br />
We did that, because of a special printer-server. This server needs the information from which user/client the report-data ist produced. Now we just send the contens of our &quot;PROCESS_SET_INFO&quot; and put it as first line in the printerdata. The printer-server will remove this additional information, process the rest and send it to the printer.</div></div><hr />
