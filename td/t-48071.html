<br />
I have tried setting spool.device in before.program section in the report script but it did not work. Is there a way to make it work?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you can re-actevate the wanted device from the report script, but first cancel the old device.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">12th February 2008, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I do not want to change the session script for some reasons and that is why I am looking into changing in report script. I believe standard spool.device variable is available in both program script and report script.<br />
<br />
So how do I cancel the old device and activate the new device, as you suggested?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">12th February 2008, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">To activate the device you want directly, use the brp.open() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_reports_brp_open) or the spool.open() function (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_spooling_spool_open). Then you do not need to go to the &quot;Select Device&quot; session at all. If you were willing to edit your session script you can use that too.<br />
<br />
However, we still need to cancel (kill) the old device. It is doable (you need to find the PID of the device session and kill it), but maybe there is a better way after all. I will let you know if I thought of something better.<br />
