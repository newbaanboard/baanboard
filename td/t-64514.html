The customer wants to have Outlook open automatically with the body text, and attached documents and then after his validation he just have to click on the send button.<br />
<br />
I have almost the solution when I am using the SMTP service, (ttcmf0130m000) but the e-mail is sent directly to the recipient, Outlook is not opened.<br />
the function display message cmf.setdisplay(message.ID, ttyeno.yes) is not working when I am using SMTP service. <br />
<br />
When I am using the OUTLOOK service, Outlook is opened for the prepared message. I am using the parameter cmf.ShowMessage = 1 in the cmf.sendtoperson function<br />
but the attached documents are renamed att1.txt att2.jpg. File extension are ok but the file name is changed. I am using MIME types text/plain and image/jpeg.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have done this before and could have a solution to this problem.<br />
Is there another way to prepare an email as a draft with recipient address, body, and attached documents filled ?</div></div><hr />

I think SMTP service is executed in the background without the UI mode. For UI mode, you have to use the Outlook  service. <br />
Without seeing your code, its hard to guess. One easy work-around is to email the sender, he can review it and then send it out to the recipient.<br />

You can use - cmf.setAttachmentFilename() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_emessage_connector_cmf_setattachmentfilename)</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your response<br />
Cf code in attachement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can use - cmf.setAttachmentFilename()<br />
<br />
This function is not working when I am using OUTLOOK service. The attachement file is always renamed att1.txt, att2.jpg.<br />
It works when I am using SMTP service.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use SMTP with Plain Text Unicode, sending it back to the user would be a easy alternative.</div></div><hr />
