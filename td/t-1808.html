<br />
I have to try to bring some garphics on a report. The special character is solid triangle, one with the peak up, once down. Does anybody have an idea how to solve this?<br />
At the moment I try to help me with a &quot;v&quot; and &quot;/\&quot;, but this sign's are not filled.<br />
<br />
Another idea is: If the printer (Unix) has somthing like symbol fonts, which have similar characters I could install a userfonts for that.<br />
<br />
Any better ideas are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
If I understood corectly, you want a special font in your report?<br />
You'll need a font editor; change two of your installed font characters to those triangles and that's it.<br />
If you want a logo there are several solutions. Check this board and www.baanfans.com (here was a very extensive discussion about this).<br />
Your ideea with changing printer font is also good, but it's dependent by printer type and driver.<br />
<br />
I'll search to see what the exact link are.<br />
Until then good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your support.<br />
Meanwhile I solved the problem with some &quot;pseudo-graphics&quot; as &quot;V&quot; (triangle with top down) or &quot;/\&quot;(slash-backslash) for top up.<br />
<br />
But anyway: Is it possible to use a fonteditor, if you have a Unix-System and just using the printer fonts?<br />

<br />
We found a way to print logo/graphics in Baan reports.<br />
<br />
Simply use a font editor to incorporate a logo/graphics.<br />
for sure you will need some partice but it's working !<br />
<br />
So <br />
   1. define the logo/graphics (simply, choose a jpeg or bmp...)<br />
   2. Use a font 'trace' utility like C_relTrace<br />
       to convert your logo to eps format<br />
   3. With C_relDraw, create the new font with your eps<br />
   4. In Baan when you print, use preview and change the<br />
       font of your choosen characters in your report.<br />
       (right click and change the font setting for your newly<br />
        created font.)<br />
<br />
For more detail, email me</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what's the situation in Unix case; in theory, depending on your printer it is possible to load new fonts in it.<br />
<br />
There is an other solution whith whitch you can print anything you want, but it's a little bit harder: make your report as a html file. In this case you must test a lot until you got an acceptable layout, but if you got a lot of graphics it's worth. The only real problem for this is that your report font will never match the browser font.<br />
<br />
I'll check my files to see if I still have those solutions; maybe you can use one of them.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can use TeX. Send your report as an ascii file, import it with TeX and put your arrows in it. How to do it?<br />
I'm sure there are a lot of Unix fans around here. (basicaly is similar to html coding but much more powerfull; but my knowledges about TeX are very .... :o )<br />
<br />
I'm not working with Unix printers, but in Linux, if my memory is not triking me, I think there is a font editor. <br />
<br />
The basic ideea is the one Bob Ino describe it.<br />
<br />
You are using an Xserver or only a terminal window?</div></div><hr />
