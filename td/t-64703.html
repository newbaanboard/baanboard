  I've developed a session which directly export data to excel. No layout(Report) has been developed for that. Data directly goes to excel. It is working fine in Worktop BUT not working in Webtop. <br />
            As I found that client2server and server2client is not working. If I export data to a fixed predefined path on server, it is working.<br />
            My requirement is to copy and open the excel on client system.<br />
            Can anyone help me out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please post your code, it will help people to identify the problem. Things you can check,<br />
<br />
1. Check if you have included #pragma used dll ottdllbw in your script.<br />
<br />
2. If you are using app_start() to open your file, replace it with start.application.local() function as app_start() is not supported for Webui.</div></div><hr />

           I've used #pragma used dll ottdllbw (As I mentioned my program is working in Worktop)<br />
           I've also used start.application.local(file.name, true, ret) to open the excel directly on client system</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try using <br />
<br />
ret1 = start.application.local  (file.name, FALSE,ret)<br />
<br />
I don't think it will make any difference. Again, it would be helpful if you add your code. Does the program transfer the file on client machine?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also check the Env. Variables on the server and the Build Version.<br />
<br />
