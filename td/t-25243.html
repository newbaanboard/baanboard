<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">itconsultant</div><div class="date">3rd October 2005, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I am on Baan 5 , am trying to select a contact code for a business partner such that a few characters of the first name of the contact code are known -(SH) and are always in upper case and business partner id is known.The data in the field tccom140.chrn may be in mixed case.<br />
I wrote the following sql, it compiles but does not give any result though there is data for this condition<br />
<br />
	select 	tccom140.ccnt, tccom140.chrn, tccom145.ccnt<br />
	from 	tccom140,tccom145 <br />
	where 	tccom145.ccnt = tccom140.ccnt <br />
	and 	tccom145.bpid = &quot;VF0000114&quot;<br />
	and :1 LIKE &quot;SH.*&quot;<br />
	wherebind(1, toupper$(tccom140.chrn))<br />
<br />
Is there a way to solve this problem ?<br />

If yes, it is easiest to use query.extend.where. Also, are the FIRST few charachters of the name known, or are any few charachters of the name (i.e. 2nd and 3rd) known -&gt; wildcards...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">itconsultant</div><div class="date">3rd October 2005, 11:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes,it is a display session , but i cant use query.extend as that would limit the number of records shown on screen, all records should b displayed on screen but the first record should be the one selected by the query i.e. a contact code having the first few characters as in the query.<br />
<br />
Yes, the first few characters of the first name (tccom140.chrn) of the contact code (tccom140.ccnt) are known.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">3rd October 2005, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I assume the known few charachters are available in a variable, let's say chrn.. So then all you do, is the following:<br />
             extern domain tcnama chrn, chrn.t<br />
<br />
	chrn = strip$(shiftl$(chrn)) <br />
	set.max(chrn.t)<br />
	chrn.t = chrn &amp; chrn.t<br />
<br />
and in the query you write<br />
<br />
            and tccom140.chrn inrange :chrn and :chrn.t<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
