<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mike_mayers</div><div class="date">7th November 2006, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">On a form type 1 that has multiple forms, when a record is inserted and the fields completed, the user wants the next insert to carry the common fields like name, city, state for example to the next inserted record. Some fields on from 1 carry over, form 2 fields do not.  Other fact is when form 1 is completed, the user has to click on form 2 to continue.  Any help will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I believe you can use this on the last field of each form.  I ran into problems with it(and I do not recall what they were using) and removed it from one program.  <br />
<br />
As for the defaults - is this a maintain table session?  You might want to check the table defaults and the form field defaults on the form.  I have not run into this exact problem - but on one session I did set some before.input sections to set values when the status was add.set.</div></div><hr />

If have the source , then only  can switch the form to another form .</div></div><hr />
