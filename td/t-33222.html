<br />
I habe now a session which uses tdpur401 as main table. Only for this session I have to restrict input for some fields.<br />
<br />
Because there is an existing DAL I have to use a property hook to check input. But due to the fact that tdpur401 is called from a lot of sessions, I have always to check which program the DAL calls. IMHO in that case a lot unnecessary code, which doesn't help to keep scripts readable.<br />
<br />
Isn't there still an other way, to check restrictions in the GUI-script?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried something like,<br />
<br />
field.xxxyyyzzz<br />
on.input:<br />
       if not valid_input() then<br />
               input.again()<br />
       endif<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it should work.<br />
<br />

<br />
thank you for that hint. I thougt about  realizing it that way. But at least I decided to do the validation in the DAL with check of the current prog-name, even if I dislike the &quot;complexity&quot; of this solution! <br />
<br />
Im always unsure, using the inputsections for validation. Isn't it possible to trick that kind of validation with consequent use of the mouse? I mean is it sure that the validation always run if one does an input to the field, and select another field with the mouse? Or is this only a problem in &quot;after.input&quot; ? <br />

My experience is that it doesn't work properly as the dal seems to be activated by the first program that uses is and it will always keep that program name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you for that hint! A typical thing one can lose sight of!!<br />
<br />
What do you mean with program name? The variable &quot;prog.name$&quot;?<br />
<br />
I did it that way: I declared an &quot;extern&quot; variable: &quot;session.name&quot; in GUI-Script and DAL. In the GUI-Script I assigned a value to that variable and in the DAL I checked it. Is it the same approach where you get problems with?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you check table fields and the table has a dal, then indeed the check.input sections for the table fields are ignored in the UI scripts. The check.input sections are only called for non-main table form fields.<br />
<br />
It depends on the type of DAL how the check has to be programmed. In DAL2if a table field cannot be empty, then that should be programmed in the is.mandatory() hook. The rest should be put in the is.valid() hook.<br />
<br />
If a check is depending on the UI script (or anything else) that is triggering the DAL, then the only thing which you can do is introduce a global variable in the DAL which indicates whether the DAL is called from that particular situation. So let's say we introduce in the DAL the following global variable:<br />
boolean g.triggered.from.my.ui<br />
<br />
Then introduce in the DAL 2 business methods with which you can put that global variable to true and one to false.<br />
<br />
function extern long tablexxx.dal.is.triggered.from.my.ui()<br />
{<br />
    DLLUsage<br />
    EndDLLUsage<br />
    g.triggered.from.my.ui = true<br />
<br />
    return(0)<br />
}<br />
<br />
and another function to put that global variable to false, although you are probably not going to use that one. Then in the UI do a dal.start.business.method(&quot;tablexxxx&quot;, &quot;tablexxx.dal.is.triggered.from.my.ui&quot;, long.ret) to put that variable to true. In the checks in the DAL etc. you can then depend the check on the global variable g.triggered.from.my.ui you introduced.<br />
<br />
I hope this is of some help. <br />

<br />
this is what I actually did. But I'm still a little unsure if the &quot;global variable&quot; in all instaces is treated right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used this method a couple of times and it is a good way to make your dal react differently to specific UI scripts. <br />

<br />
I also did some tests with that solution. I paid special attention how parallel instances of the DAL react. Everythings seems to be fine.<br />
<br />
So things seem to be fine. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your support</div></div><hr />
