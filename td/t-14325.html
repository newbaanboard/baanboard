<br />
One simple question, but i am in the dark about this;<br />
<br />
How can i modify a standard BaaN menu so i can put straight tekstlines in this.<br />
I have a menu with 20 sessions and i want to create 3 chapters (printing, display, maintenance) without making submenus.<br />
So it should look something like this.<br />
<br />
Printing<br />
  1. Printing salesorders<br />
  2. Printing salesorders by deliverydate<br />
Display<br />
  3. Display  salesorders<br />
  4. Display something else<br />
<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
I can put the tekst &quot;Printing&quot; in the menu but it just doesn't show.<br />
<br />
Much thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Simply in the 'menu-fields' (ttadv3561m000) for each 'label-only' field, leave empty the fields 'menu field type' and 'sess/men/PR/Qr' fields, unclick the field 'descr. linked', and enter your label (print, display etc).<br />
<br />
Compile, open a new Baan-shell and it works perfectly.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this works for you.<br />
<br />

<br />
To bad, but it doesn't work this way in BaanIV.<br />
I can't leave the field 'sess/men/PR/Qr' empty. I can make it a Shell-program but i have to fill &quot;selectcode' so it is handled as an normal program in the menu. <br />
<br />
thanks for your efford!<br />

From past experience, the maximum # of lines a menu can have is something like 20 or 21.  This is lines, not sessions, so if there are any blank lines in your menu, they would also be counted.  <br />
<br />
You also have to do a convert to runtime, exit Baan and log back in.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 You can select Session as the Menu Field Type and can tab through the  ''sess/men/PR/Qr&quot;. Un-check the Link Descr. and enter your description in the Label field.<br />
<br />
You need to enter a sequence no. though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">croezen</div><div class="date">24th March 2004, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks Suresh,<br />
It works fine, thanks.<br />
But i see it as a work-a-round because the disadvantace of this solution is that it looks like a menu item a not like a header of a group as i intended.<br />
But thanks anyway for your input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skosana</div><div class="date">24th March 2004, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">It is indeed a pretty confusing work around.... It thought submenus is a better way to go about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">25th March 2004, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">A good compromise would be to open a menu and have the Print / Maintain / Display sub menus auto expand for you.<br />
<br />
But.. I can not figure out how to do that.  There should be a way, that's what the main menu tccom00000000 does right?  But I can find no option that does that.   It may only do that if it is your start menu, in that case.. is it a process variable being sent to the menu to do that?   <br />
<br />
Sorry, more questions, but if anyone knows how to auto expand that may help.</div></div><hr />
