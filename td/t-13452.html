<br />
I know that I can use bic_info6.1 to get information about include files. My problem is that, doesn't matter which file, bic_info6.1 always returns this error:<br />
<br />
bic_info6.1 -e icom00070 or itccom0007 or 'itccom0007'<br />
icom00070: No such file or directory<br />
icom00070: Fatal Error: Can't open object 'icom00070' for reading<br />
<br />
Is there somebody outthere who can solve this problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks Peter.</div></div><hr />

The include files are in fact - only sources that are included in the main script at compile time.<br />
You cannot get info thru bic_info about sources....<br />
<br />
Try, by example, instead:<br />
<br />
bic_info6.1 otiitm0101<br />
<br />
to get info about the object of maintain items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But if you want information on an include file or program script, you can open it for reading. <br />
<br />
What you then need to know is that Baan allows you to work with different variants of scripts at the same time. The variants are rarely used, so most people only use variant 0 of the sources. <br />
<br />
When you want to view your intended include file, you should use a command line like this:<br />
<br />
view `explode6.1  itccom00070`<br />
note: use backquotes to first perform the explode6.1 command and use its output as input for view;<br />
note: add an extra 0 to take variant 0</div></div><hr />
