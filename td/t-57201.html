  <br />
I am working with  LN 6.1 FP3.  <br />
  <br />
I have a important question for you.  <br />
   <br />
Can I use the tt sessions for API sentences?  <br />
  <br />
The question is very important for me, because We have serious problems with patches generation, then We are evaluating the possibility to program sessions to make that this process is quicker.  <br />
  <br />
Somebody can help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th November 2009, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you can use API commands on tt sessions. The key is determining what fields to put and how the session reacts. I have not done any tools sessions this way, but I know it can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">12th November 2009, 04:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Only on some 'tt' sessions.  I tried to develop an API session to create tables from a text file created from a spreadsheet.  Couldn't get past the first form that accepts the table number, name, etc.  Afterward, modified the session to start adding fields to a table where the first form was already filled -- couldn't get this to work in API as well.  Ended up writing a session to fill the required 'tt' tables directly.<br />
<br />
I don't think Baan (Infor) views making 'tt' sessions API-friendly a priority.</div></div><hr />

If the Tools sessions are buggy then using API on top of the session is not going to fix the issue. You have open a case with Baan Support and get a defect, solution for your version.<br />
I don't think Baan (Infor) views making 'tt' sessions API-friendly a priority. <br />
I don't think they have to. Tools are proprietary to Baan/Infor. API is very low level interface and it not scalable to the new tools features and architecture. It is similar to asking Microsoft for command line exe's for all the msc's.<br />
Yes, I did use some API's against the TT sessions but also note that it needs a through testing during all the tools patches and upgrades. Not all tools changes are documented in the various patches, needs someone quite experienced with Tools as well as API to make the compatibility changes.</div></div><hr />
