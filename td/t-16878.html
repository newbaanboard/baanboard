<br />
Can somebody help on this if anybody has tried it earlier or can suggest me a way on following scenario for printing Barcode.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have developed a session in baan which takes input from user and save all values in a .txt file (comma seprated) and internally calls FTP and save file on Users local directory (pre-defined).<br />
<br />
Now we have designed a label (bar-coding) in Bar-tender 6.0 and have linked it with that txt file as data source. Now User opens that .btw(Bartender design file) and give print command which prints barcode labels as per design on a bar-code printer.<br />
<br />
Now i want to avoid this manual user intervention of opening bar tender label file and then giving print command.<br />
<br />
I want to do this activity from baan itself. I want to place a button (print) on the session which i have already created and want that if user press on this button. Labels should be printed on printer by calling the bar tender design file.<br />
<br />
is it possible? can somebody help me how i can call print command for a perticular file in baan.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
Sandy :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is better to save user input into BaaN table not in .txt file for that make a maintain session .<br />
<br />
For prinint the Barcode printing make a print session and give this command in report script , you will get the barcode printing on paper which is scanable. for size of barcode and fornt ( code 128 / code 39 ) you can refer the Baan manul which is avalable in Knowledgebase in BaaN( BGS).<br />

	 p.barcode = (chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp; &quot;*#A&quot; &amp; (tdclc835.item &amp;  str$(tdclc835.ldno)&amp;str$(tdclc835.pdno)))<br />

If so then you could use app_start to launch this .btw file.  Search on app_start.  I know you can launch bar tender from Baan with app_start, but since I do not know anything about bar-tender I do not know how you automatically launch the print function.<br />
