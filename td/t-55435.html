I have developed a generic command line untiltu that can used for integrating web based API. Its in Java. Anyone interested in knowing about it, can contact me.<br />
<br />
I am on Baan IV and we don't have what used to be called as Open world and hence the need to arrive at something that would let me integrate Baan to various website. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

May be an example can clarify.  Say, one need to charge a credit card from Baan. In this case, one has to submit a http request and get the response back from the credit card charging company. Our utiltiy takes two i/p - the value of the parameter that needs to be passed, and the XMLfile containing name of i/p parameter. and the o/p respons expected from the website.  It will then submit the request and then parse the response and write the resonse to a flat file, that can be read by Baan. I have used this also for getting rates quotes from LTL carriers in US. since, the program is quite generic, it can do pretty much anything that involves submitting Http request and getting respone back. <br />
