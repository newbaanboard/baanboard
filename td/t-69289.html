<br />
Im creating a SQL query and using a field which has time format of HH:MM:SS. When I run the report its displaying only HH:MM and via GTM I can see the actual time (including seconds), my questions are.<br />
<br />
1. How do I print time format with seconds in the report.<br />
2. Incase if I wanted to unlink the domain format and change the format with other time format which has seconds also. When I do this I can edit the format and change the format, when compiled, its again defaulting to original time format, so how can I change this.<br />

Thanks for your quick response, I'm just looking for domain change in SQL Query data. I'm not writing any code for this.<br />

So then what you can do is go into the report created and see if it lets you change the domain(or format) of the field on the report.  You can always put the report in debug mode and see how the data is read into the report - it should be like what you see in the database.  Then it is just a matter of changing the report format or domain.  You can look thru domains to see if there one that has  a print format that includes seconds.  Typically what I do is a quick search of domains to find something like I want - or usually setting the format to only include 2 places.  In 4c4 I can go into the report unlink it from the domain and then input a desired print format.  You can look at help for sprint$ or edit$ to get an idea of the print format you can use.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I did all these, unfortunately the domain format is not getting changed,Anyways we are writing a Bi-Web report to extract the data from DB.<br />
<br />
Thanks you for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">22nd September 2016, 07:18</div></div><div class="posttext">go to the Report Editor and then go to the specific field, then double click it it will lead to the display tab and then you can choose the print format.<br />
<br />
if you link it to domain, the field will come out printed as it is defined in the format or if you want it to define according to your wish you can define after you untick the field.</div></div><hr />
