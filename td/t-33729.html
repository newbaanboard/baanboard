<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - I believe I've exhausted the board looking for anyone else who's had this problem.  I have a report the prints the custom item text in a header layout.  There are some items that have alot of lines of text, a couple I'm looking at now have over 70.  My issue is that if it goes to more than one page it truncates the rest of the text.  This text prints until there are only enough lines left to print the footer, then on the next page it will print the last line of text that was read and that's it.  <br />
<br />
I would really like to fix this without changing too much code.  Hopefully someone else has had the problem and found a solution for it.<br />

Thanks - NikkiZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 22:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting - your header will be longer than the page length.  So it prints a page, does the eject and wants to print the header again.  I can see where the report write would get confused.  I would say you need to pull it out of the header and put it in another layout - maybe a detail layout that only gets printed once per item.  Or maybe in a before field layout - one that does not get printed at the start of a new page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the same thing.  It goes has a print condition of lattr.break  I'll mess around with some other layouts and see how it goes.  Thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe someone else will post another suggestion - I just can not think of anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - I just put it in a detail layout with a print flag that is set to zero in before.program and then I set it to 1 in after.layout of the detail.  Seems to work like a charm!!<br />

Thanks again as usual for your input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g√ºnther</div><div class="date">4th April 2007, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Just one thought: Wouldn't it be enough to limit the number of text lines that get printed (min/max of textlines)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">4th April 2007, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I looked at that and it is not an option because the text could have more lines than the length of one page.  Having it in the header confuses it because it is suppose to print the header at page break so I would start over really before printing all the lines.</div></div><hr />
