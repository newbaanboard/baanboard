<br />
We are developing a session that require a timer update.<br />
One way is to use the set.timer() function.<br />
<br />
The other way is to use a job.<br />
The request is to do it all from the same session.<br />
<br />
Can we do that? <br />
Can we control a job action from a customized session?<br />
<br />
We need be able to the following things :<br />
<br />
Insert job.<br />
Attach a session to that job.<br />
Activate the job.<br />
Cancel the job.<br />
Re-activate the job.   Etc'<br />
<br />
Thanks  <br />

<br />
As a generic session solution, try using AFS Coding (search for stpapi on this forum for a great manual link).  That technique allows you to mimic session actions inside of your custom script.  <br />
<br />
You should be able to do all the things mentioned by using stpapi commands against the job session.  There are occasional compatiblity issues if the session you are trying to call does something weird related to GUI or session killing, but most the times it works without a hitch.<br />
<br />
Requires fairly current Porting Set / Standard Program patches (specifically, ttstpapihand library should be current).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm familiar with using the AFS functionality and I use it allot.<br />
<br />
I was trying to avoid the use of ASF because of what you mentioned  &quot;Requires fairly current Porting Set / Standard Program patches (specifically, ttstpapihand library should be current).&quot;<br />
<br />
I dont know if the customer has the correct Porting set and dont want to force him to install it.<br />
<br />
So I was looking for a different solution <br />
<br />
Thanks any way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">5th August 2002, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">There are other methods that do not require a porting set upgrade.  The 'rush' program developed and posted on this board can be modified and used to call standard session sections without the porting set upgrade.  My company also has a product that was developed for our Baan IVb2 customers that is very similar to the stpapi generate library functionality that works with any version.<br />
<br />
So it is possible - generally using the #pragma include session and querying the object logic using bic_info.  <br />
<br />
Post back if you have questions using 'rush' - or contact me if you are interested in our library generator.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
