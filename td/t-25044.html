<br />
I have 2 different report (with many layout) which  i wanted to call as per input from the Form level. Report will be printed as per option selected at form. I don't wanted to show the option for report selection.  Rather I wanted to call from the Script.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th September 2005, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to give you a bit more clarification on what Hitesh mentioned correctly:<br />
<br />
When you link reports to a session, you can define which report group, and which number within each group. Now, when I have two or more reports, there are three options:<br />
1) You link them to the session all in the same report group, but with different numbers. In this case, when the user hits the 'print' button, he gets a submenu with a list of all the reports, in which he can select the desired one.<br />
2) Like Hitesh said, you make each one a different reportgroup, and in the script, depending on user's form selections, you set the variable reportgrp to the corresponding report group.<br />
3) You can have a full control over this, by using the functions brp.open/brp.open.language, in which you can specify exactly which report shall be printed (and when desired also the language)..<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />
