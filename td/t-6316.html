<br />
I have a little problem running session with multi reports;<br />
<br />
like &quot;Print Quotation&quot; or &quot;Sales Order Acknowledgement&quot; which<br />
<br />
produces 2/3 reports. I wrote a 4GL/3GL device... when I run the <br />
<br />
session it give me to select the device 1 after another and I select<br />
<br />
my device and then it begins to run the device (although 1 after <br />
<br />
another). but what I discovered that &quot;spool.report&quot; in both <br />
<br />
running device (the 1st and the 2nd) will be the same report <br />
<br />
name and it's for the last report selected (however the data<br />
<br />
is ok).  I have Baan4c.<br />
<br />
I need to know the right report name in each run; is there a <br />
<br />
solution for that?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the predefined variables for reports -<br />
<br />
<br />
string  report$  4GL -  Current report code.<br />
 <br />
long reportgrp  4 GL -  Current report group.<br />
 <br />
long  reportno    R<br />
 Reports are numbered (1..n) within a report group. <br />
This number indicates the sequence number within the report group.<br />
Note: The numbers (labeled &quot;No.&quot;) in the session &quot;Reports by Session&quot; <br />
only match with reportno if these numbers are consecutive. <br />
<br />
<br />
and for spool -<br />
<br />
<br />
string   spool.device(14)  Name of spooler device.<br />
 <br />
string   spool.report(20)  Report to be printed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then use, this function to get the description for more clarity -<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muheeb</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for replying..<br />
<br />
but this didn't help! <br />
<br />
&quot;report$&quot; is the same like &quot;spool.report&quot; variable..<br />
<br />
I got in report$ the wrong current report code in the situation<br />
<br />
I described before:<br />
<br />
there're 2 reports, 1 for each group (group 1 &amp; 2; both no. 1) <br />
<br />
I select the wanted device twice, and then see the device<br />
<br />
runs for the first report (but with wrong report code in report$<br />
<br />
- with the code of the 2nd report) and  after finishing it runs for <br />
<br />
the second report!<br />
<br />
Do you have BaanIVc? could you try it yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david7</div><div class="date">8th March 2008, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I think have the same problem.<br />
<br />
One print session is generating two reports. one after the other. I am getting the &quot;Select Device&quot; session twice one after the other. Then if I choose a display divce I will see the two reports.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when I run my customized device, &quot;spool.report&quot; gets the value of the second report in the two devices! I need to know both report code names.<br />
<br />
Is there a solution for this?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th March 2008, 02:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I understand - in your customized device can you read the report description from the temporary file and associate in with the report number(using one of the tools tables)?  Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Other than that is this a customized session or do you have source code?  Then you could probably store off the number and pass it to the report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">4th June 2008, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found a solution for this problem. I just went through it myself.<br />
<br />
The idea is to take the report name from the printer queue table!<br />
<br />
Use the following function in your device, and it will return the current report code even if there were two runs after each other:<br />
<br />
function string get.report.name()<br />
{<br />
   string rpac(2),rmod(3),repc(15)<br />
<br />
   get.var(parent,&quot;ttaad320.rpac&quot;,rpac)<br />
   get.var(parent,&quot;ttaad320.rmod&quot;,rmod)<br />
   get.var(parent,&quot;ttaad320.repc&quot;,repc)<br />
<br />
   return (rpac&amp;rmod&amp;repc)<br />
}<br />
I hope it helps,<br />
<br />
- George</div></div><hr />
