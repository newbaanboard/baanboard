<br />
The session menu/properties are picked up based on the session type and window type.<br />
<br />
also, you can disable the secondary tool bar options - <br />
Secondary toolbars overview and synopsis (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_secondary_toolbars_overview_and_synopsis) <br />
<br />
Buttons on secondary toolbars are automatically disabled or enabled when the corresponding form commands are disabled or enabled (see disable.commands()).<br />
<br />
<br />
But those commands might not be valid in BaaN-4 series.<br />
<br />
Can you post the screen shot of that particular tools session?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Disable.command does not work on 4c3. I was talking about the File,...Help menu and the toolbar with the buttons below it.  I just happened to notice one of the tools programs did not have these on there.  I was hoping there was something easy that I am missing - more curious than anything.  I will try to get a screen shot of the session tomorrow to show you all.<br />

It's the zoom type of session as mentioned above.   Usually for sub sessions as you captured, the type you have there is 'Modal Dialog'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it looks like Dennis had a good guess after all.  Thanks Lisa and everyone. Now to see how I can use this in some zoom sub-sessions I need to develop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Modal sub-sessions do not have the menu bar as Modal means the sub-session must be closed before continuing with the Main session.  Where a Modeless sub-session means that the user can continue in the main session without closing the sub-session -  I guess baan figures under this scenerio that the present sub-session shuold have the capabilities that are present in the menu bar, as the sub-session is some what independent of the main session.</div></div><hr />
