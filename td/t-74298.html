<br />
I'm developing an API call to purchase freight labels for our shipments though a third party provider. I'm able to purchase labels and print them through curl.upload.string() using POST method, but if I need to void a label, I'm required to send an API request with DELETE method. The command works when I use it in tools like Postman etc, but ERPLn's curl command doesn't seem to be supporting the 'Delete' method. <br />
<br />
DELETE  https://api.channeladvisor.com/v1/Fulfillments(FulfillmentID)/Label?unshipfulfillment=true<br />
<br />
Could you please help me out in finding how we can get this done in ERPLn.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Could you possibly post the code?  The provided URL by itself is not usable.<br />

2nd thought:<br />
<br />
The cURL functions are untrusted for cloud implementations, which is not your problem, and the http.* functions have been introduced as an recommended way to execute http requests.<br />
<br />
The http.* functions include http.delete(), which is what you are trying to do  The syntax is pretty simple so it might be worthwhile trying to use that function instead.<br />
<br />
The http.* functions internally still execute the cURL ones.  If there is an underlying problem there, you have a good reproduction to report to Infor support.<br />
<br />
Heads up:  The http.* functions had a bug (up to December 2021) that possibly caused a bshell core dump when they were used in the same process with the soap.* functions.  This was resolved by corrections to the tools.<br />

Thankyou for your input..I'm going to test these functions and see if they help. I'll keep the forum posted.<br />

<br />
We may not be able to use HTTP function currently in our system because our tools version is not supporting the TIV and related includes are not available.<br />
We are planning to have a LN upgrade later this year and probably that time these function will be available.<br />
<br />
We need to look out for some other way to handle this requirement for now.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I was finally able to make it work using shell:<br />
<br />
&quot;curl -X DELETE &quot; &amp;<br />
quoted.string(&quot;https://api.channeladvisor.com/v1/Fulfillments(1234567)/Label?unshipfulfillment=true&quot;) &amp;<br />
&quot; -H &quot; &amp; quoted.string(&quot;accept: application/json&quot;) &amp;<br />
&quot; -H &quot; &amp; quoted.string(&quot;Authorization: Bearer MCg9loyVJ4z1OyuF-*****&quot;)<br />
<br />
I have attached the code that finally worked and the one that is commented out was not working.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
