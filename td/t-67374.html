I am a new user in the realm of webservices.<br />
I have readed a lot of post that are referred to webservices and it sounds very interesting and powerful.<br />
Before to start I need to know what are the required hardware/software/licences. I mean, in some posts BaanOpenWorld product have been mentioned, but as far as I know, Infor have terminated their support for this product and I donÂ´t know if there is a newer product to cover this.<br />
Some posts refers that baan connector for webservices must be installed on a tomcat server and must be licenced. Is this correct?<br />
And last, there is a webservices reference programming manual to start from scratch?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Webservices are strong and quicker communication method to connect two applications. You have several options to build them - <br />
<br />
SOAP, REST, WCF - in multiple languages ranging from C#, .NET, JAVA etc.<br />
<br />
Once you build your webservice, you can then deploy it and use it in LN using SOAP function's available under bic_soap. If not, you can build your own client program to call the webservice. <br />
<br />
It depends on you on how to build it, and how to consume it. LN provides a way of consume SOAP based webservices which only requires the inbuilt functions.<br />
<br />
Here's an example (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=64167)<br />

I love Webservices personally! :)</div></div><hr />
