<br />
I'm trying to display the tdltc001.lsup field on the Pick List report by linking the tdltc001 table to tdilc401 using the following select statement. I can't get it to work and I think its down to how the join is being made.<br />
<br />
The report script compiles OK but nothing gets printed for this new field<br />
<br />
I confess to being very good at this so please bear with me.<br />
<br />
Does my syntax look correct?<br />
<br />
<br />
select tdltc001.lsup				<br />
	from tdltc001, tdilc401<br />
	where tdltc001.clot = :tdilc401.clot and tdltc001.item = :tdilc401.item<br />
	selectdo<br />
<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
	supp.lot = tdltc001.lsup<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
PJ</div></div><hr />

<br />
        select tdltc001.lsup				<br />
	from tdltc001<br />
	where tdltc001.clot = :tdilc401.clot and tdltc001.item = :tdilc401.item<br />
	selectdo<br />
	endselect<br />
	supp.lot = tdltc001.lsup<br />
<br />
<br />
Then exactly which field are you printing supp.lot or tdltc001.lsup?  Which layout are you trying to print it and in which layout is the query?  Now I am assuming you ran it in debug and the query actually found something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had a eureka moment when eating lunch.<br />
<br />
I needed to enter tdilc401.item and a report input field. It now works.<br />
<br />
I was trying to print the supp.loc field.</div></div><hr />

I think basically I just declare them as external in the script.</div></div><hr />
