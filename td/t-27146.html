(1) Export/Import using exchange schemes.<br />
(2) Export/Import using application function servers<br />
(3) designing your own session to read the exported records.<br />
Without knowing what you are trying to do it is hard to make a recommendation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">royal_buddy2000</div><div class="date">19th May 2006, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I am implementing BaaN in a company where I have to incorporate the data generated by PLC(Programming  logic control unit), which is in format of DBF files(this file can only be opened in excel) generated and stored in designated directory once in a day, and we are planning to pick this file in baan and insert it in to customised table to use it for further use. but problem is that it will be continous process and we dont want any human intervention in to this process. <br />
It means I want baan directly take this file and insert this in baan tables.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th May 2006, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">What you can actually do is create an excel macro which would pass variables to a Baan library which would insert the record into the Baan table.  Search this AFS/DDC/OLE: Function servers (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=59) for excel.  You should be able to find some examples of how this works.  You might want to also search this forum - I think just recently someone posted the sample spreadsheets.<br />
<br />
Personally I would rather write a Baan session which launches a macro and saves the file as a &quot;.csv&quot;.  Then you can process the file one record at a time in Baan.  What I typically do is have the users save their files as a &quot;.csv&quot; then they can run my sessions to process the file.  The only difference is you want it to be automatic - so I would then have the session launch a macro to automatically create the csv file and then load the baan table.  Then you could schedule it in batch to run once a day or as often as necessary.<br />
<br />
Way back in the old days I wrote some C code that would convert Dbase files to text files.  But that was 15-20 years ago.</div></div><hr />

In this example I call a baan library (DLL) that runs a function server.  In your case you could just pass the fields for the table you want to populate.  I never really used this in production, but just tested it.</div></div><hr />
