<br />
Can you please give me a more detailed explanation of how to use this code? I compile it, I run it, I get a very small file as a result ( I don't think it's a good one, but whatever, I'm just testing). I'm confused about the error message (see subjet); shoud I have a dll for the parent object? I assumed that the parent object is the session object. If I'm using the result file as a session script, when I'm compiling it it's not overwriting the original object file?<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

I moved this thread into the tools forum because I was not really sure which one of the threads in &quot;Code and Utilities&quot; you were having a problem with.  Which thread did you have problems with?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Yes, I saw that after I post the thread; It's regarding &quot;Extend BaaN code without sources&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Let me try to answer some of your questions.<br />
<br />
No the parent is not a DLL, it is just the parent object.  Let try an example:<br />
<br />
In VRC PATCH I have otisfc0101, so in my PROD VRC (build off patch) I would then put the file created from RUSH. I would compile the script in PROD. Then when I run the program I would be running the PROD version which actually runs the PATCH version with whatever changes I made in the script.  So you do not want to put this version where the other version is, it would compile over the object you planned on using.<br />
<br />
Does this help?  <br />
