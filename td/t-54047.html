When I am compiling there are No errors &amp; NO warnings.<br />
<br />
My doubt report is not modifying the contents in dynamic link library, my question how to update the contents under DLL.<br />
<br />
Any one having the same issue, reply to me what to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">19th October 2008, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Your question needs some more information to be analyzed, the clues you give are so vague that it's impossible for anyone to give you an answer.<br />
You have modiified the script or the report script? <br />
The DLL is linked to the script or the report script?<br />
If your doubt is about the DLL, why don't you debug the DLL and the session itself to investigate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">syhquadri</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I had modified the script for the report.<br />
DLL'S are link  to report, I dont have any help how to use debug the session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">You mean haven't the script for DLL or you never debug a script before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">syhquadri</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes your correct this is not for DLL script, this is for report script. Earlier I had not run the script under debugger mode, if you have any help on this reply to me the link.</div></div><hr />
