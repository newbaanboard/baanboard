<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klesch</div><div class="date">11th June 2018, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's say that there is a PDF file on the filesystem and we would like to attach it to particular Item as an ODM attachment, and we would like to do that programmatically. The idea is to emulate all things that happen when a user drags&amp;drops a file to the ODM square.<br />
<br />
What things have to be programmed? Which dmdocXXX tables have to be filled? In what way? Are there also some other tables or files that should be edited in the process? How should filename be encoded when the file is put into the vault? Etc.<br />
<br />
Is there some useful documentation around?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />
