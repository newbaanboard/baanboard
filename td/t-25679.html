<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">21st November 2005, 02:50</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: Hello,everyone! Now I have a session. I want to display item QC defect type in a form. Each item has many difference defect type, and each defect type has itself's defect quantity. I store them in two arraies. The length and field of defect array are unsureness. I hope when user insert a new QC record, the form can display all fields of the defect array.<br />
<br />
Now complexion: When the record already exeisted, all fields of the defect type can display in the first. But if the record not exeist, in the array, press TAB, it displays one record of defect array. Can't display all in the first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st November 2005, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend creating tables for something like this.  It sounds complicated and using arrays that you are going to display just cause more troubles.  I would create a tables and populate it with the records you want - this way you can just use a multi-occurance type session to display(and link) the records.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">22nd November 2005, 02:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,thanks!<br />
All the data had stored in difference tables. I want the form display reference information. But the defect type table  has no reference to main table. How can I do? Because I can't create or modify table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd November 2005, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not see how you can do this (even with arrays) if the defect table has no link to the main table.  I guess I do not understand what you are looking for - would it be possible to have a sub-session to display all of the defect information?</div></div><hr />
