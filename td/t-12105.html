<br />
My sessions runs in a job.<br />
<br />
This session runs every minute. However - there are situations (depending on the conditions) I would like to stop that session and later start the session again - without any user actions.<br />
<br />
In other words - would it be possible to start and stop a session (running as a job)  programmatically?<br />
<br />
Are there any functions in the tools environent one can use in a session which start and / or stops a job?<br />
<br />
Can the program / session start and stop itself (job)?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
A.</div></div><hr />

Your requirement is still not clear... can you please more in detail? If it takes 1 minute the process is completed and waits for the next execution. If its not completed then the job is still in running process. If there is any fatal error then the job cannot restart as its not in free status.<br />
<br />
But you can use the predefined variable - job.mode to build some logic to start/stop the session execution in a job mode<br />
<br />
	if not (api.mode or job.process or background) then<br />
		get.screen.defaults()<br />
		do.something()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
string 	job.device(14) 		4 <br />
 Default device used by job process.<br />
 <br />
long	job.device.requested	4<br />
 Indicates whether an output device must be specified when in job mode.<br />
 <br />
long	job.process		4R<br />
 Indicates if process is started by a job.<br />
 <br />
string	job.report(15)		4<br />
 Report code of report to be used when in job mode.<br />
 <br />
long	job.skip.date.question	4<br />
 Indicates if the question &quot;Consider the difference between entered date and system date?&quot; must be skipped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also check the 4-GL choice sections -<br />
<br />
24  create.job  Add session in job  1234  ----  1234  <br />
40  run.job  Run job of session  1234  1234  1234</div></div><hr />

<br />
Below my pseudo code: Session that runs in a job (every t1).<br />
<br />
<br />
[For each t1 (i.e. 30 seconds) do]<br />
   1. Check Baan table<br />
   2. If Table is Populated then<br />
   3.    [Stop this job - the session running under this job]<br />
   4.    Perform some action (execution of another DLL)<br />
   5.    [Start the job again]<br />
   6. Fi<br />
[Endfor]<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason I'm doing this is because the execution of the DLLs could take more than t1....<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this clearify my problem,<br />
A.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">If u r in unix , u may use cron function to start a session every 30 seconds.You may put command like ba6.1 session_code .<br />
<br />
Alternatively u may start the job in Baan and program ur periodic activity in while/endwhile loop . Use suspend(30000) function to wait for 30 seconds . When the table is populated , don't do anything (but dont stop the job). <br />
<br />
It's advisable to keep some conditions to stop the Baan job in the sections run.job (as suggested by Prashant) through front end itself . Further a condition must be written to stop the Baan job before the same job start next time in routine periodic cycle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently the development is being done in NT/Oracle, later in Unix.<br />
<br />
I will work out this problem, and keep you all updated about the results... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">An easier method for disabling re-entry would be:<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Try to create an application lock<br />
2. If  (already existing lock) then<br />
       exit<br />
3. Else<br />
       process<br />
4. Remove application lock<br />
<br />
<br />
This can then be started any way you like, Baan job or cron.<br />

<br />
I do the same exact thing but every 2 minutes.  I pause the job for cold backups and maint etc and It happens by itself.<br />
<br />
Create your job and on the job data screen set it to &quot;periodic&quot;<br />
Set the period for 1 minute<br />
use $BSE/etc/rc.startjob to fire your job ( you may need to modify the script but it is a simple script.  <br />
<br />
Now create something like this:<br />
<br />
while test -r /tmp/run_my_job<br />
do<br />
rc.startjob myjob_name<br />
<br />
   while test -r /tmp/pause_my_job<br />
   do<br />
   sleep 60<br />
   echo &quot;Waiting for restart&quot;<br />
   done<br />
<br />
   if test -r /tmp/end_my_job<br />
   then<br />
   exit 0<br />
   fi<br />
done<br />
<br />
The files in tmp are flags that you can use to send signal with.  When the script sees a certain file it takes a certain branch.  The baan job setting I gave you should cause the job to execute then exit baan and hand control back over to the script.<br />
<br />
Good LUCK!</div></div><hr />
