<br />
I have created a new domain which has a potential length on 255 characters.<br />
<br />
On the form when used, it scrolls the text because the box ins't long enough.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to have a text area or make the box more than one line so you do not have to scroll through the text?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if this would work for you, but what I did once was to put 3 80 character columns on the form. Then I just concatenated them for the table. I finally convinced the users to use text instead. I looked around for a method to do what you requested, but I never found a solution.  Of course I never looked real hard, the users really wanted to use text - they just didn't know it. :)<br />
<br />
Forgot to mention that when I read the records in I had to separate them into the 3 form fields. One of the things that helped convince the users to use text.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
In the BaaN-5 series, tools provide the text box/area.<br />
<br />
If you are on the BaaN-4 series. You can implement Mark's idea or another option would be to create a domain of 80, for that table field and use a depth of 3.<br />
<br />
So you need not code the concatenation logic during the saving of the records and its directly stored in the table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">outra9e</div><div class="date">5th August 2002, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had a look and the only depth that I can see is that on the details section when you look at a table in maintain table definitions session.<br />
<br />
Is this what you are talking about?  I understood that this was used for an array of entries for a table field, and so would that work for this instance?<br />
<br />
I cannot modify the depth of a field is there something that I need to do?<br />
<br />
