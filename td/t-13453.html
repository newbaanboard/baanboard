<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aihbikers</div><div class="date">31st October 2003, 00:29</div></div><div class="posttext">We are having a problem with our text authorizations for one text group.  We set up a group for our accounting department called Finance. We have created the text window, text group, default text group template, and text group authorization template.  For some reason now accounting has a problem when they try to access the text in a session, like ttacr3513m000, they recieve the error &quot;You have no read authorization for text group text&quot;. <br />
<br />
When I login as a superuser and select an accounting user from the employees session (tgbrg8135m000) and activate &quot;Start screen employee&quot;, then go to ttacr3513m000 and look at the text, it opens up without a problem.  <br />
<br />
Is there something else we need to look at beside the text management sessions above? We have other departments setup with text and everyone else works except for finance. Any help will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

They do not help because, like I mentioned above, all of that is set up. Do you have any other suggestions? They were working before, then they stopped. Could a patch have cause any problems?<br />

<br />
*** Nevermind, a co-worker was also working on the problem the same time I was and we figured out what happened. Thanks for the help. ***<br />

Solution: Added back text group Text to Finance text group authorization template.</div></div><hr />
