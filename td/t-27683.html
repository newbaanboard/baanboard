<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">25th July 2006, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I get this Read row error 850 intermittently when I run the session timrp1510m000. We have done a customization which updates table timrp010 (plus some other tables as well) basically moving some demand from one item to another item to take care of ECO related changes.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this doesnt happen all the time. It happens very rarely and if I keep on trying to run timrp1510m000, the error goes away. I know error 850 is due to some lock which doesnt allow read access, however, the program written to update timrp010 looks correct, with all the necessary db.retry.points and commits.<br />
<br />
Any help would be really appreciated.<br />

You should comment out the one inside the select statement.  Not sure this solves your problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with mark, remove the db.retry.point(). The entire program script, contains only one commit.transaction (rest all are commented) which too depends on some condition. I suspect the behaviour of update.eco.parameters()<br />
function. Assuming the abort.trasnsaction() function call is hit in function create.new.item() which will prevent the execution of commit.transaction() However the table tiitm999 would have been updated in function  update.eco.parameters()  with no commit following it. When the function is called again , it could have pose a problem.<br />
<br />
I think it would be easy if you debug thro your code, you will know the exact line of code which generates the error. Try &amp; find out the table which throws this error so that we can proceed in right direction.<br />
