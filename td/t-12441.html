<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">31st July 2003, 00:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to print text in a report.  The text file has two lines but the program is double spacing.  The text window is sized to 45 characters across and the report is sized to 50 characters and the data fits into these boundaries.  For example, the data says..<br />
            Today is nice.<br />
            The sun is out<br />
<br />
But when the data prints, the format on the paper is...<br />
            Today is nice.<br />
<br />
            The sun is out<br />
<br />
I have not been able to overcome the double spacing.  Can someone provide a clue.  What am I doing wrong?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st December 2009, 14:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Been thinking about this - seems to me I had this once, but it was not all text. Just text for a couple of items. I traced it to the text itself and some of the cutting and pasting the user was doing.  It also seems to me I had to save the text as plain text, then put the delete the old text, and create new text.<br />

What are you all using for the text editor? What size is the text window you are using? Have you tried making the text print the same size as the text(just curious not sure it will work). I am also curious if your text has a carriage return and then the report is adding a carriage return - making it double space. So if you text window is 45 - uses spaces to wrap to the second line and not a carriage return.  Just thought I would make a few suggestions to try.</div></div><hr />
