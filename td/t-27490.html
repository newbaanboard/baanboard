<br />
I am giving this task.<br />
<br />
Giving a BOM structure, try to find the total quantity required per item to build x unit (let say 2) of the parent. The depth of the structure can be more than 5. Any item, except the parent, can be appeared more than 1 time in the BOM structure. Total number of item can be more than 3000.<br />
<br />
With the quantity per item, try to find if this quantity can be found from the price list. If yes, retrieve the price.<br />
<br />
I am thinking first calculating the total quantity required per item and store it in the array. Later, try to go through the array and compare line by line with price list.<br />
<br />
However, I have difficulty in putting the 3000 item into the array. The difficult part is for every item in the BOM, I need to check if this item already in the array. If yes, add up the quantity. Else, create a new entry in the array.<br />
<br />
Your advice will be really helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd July 2006, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you can just read the bill sending the records to the report.  So you may send some items multiple times to the report for each quantity.  Have the report sort by item.  Then in the before.layout of the item you could check the price list.  Let the report calculate the totals for quantity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the suggestion. It works.<br />
<br />
I though the report is pre-sorted by the program script and not able to sort it again in the report script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th July 2006, 13:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Pre-sorting is preferred - but in a case like this (reading thru the BOM) it is not really feasible.  The sorting feature on a report can be slow.</div></div><hr />
