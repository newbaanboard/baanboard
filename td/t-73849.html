I have a layout in the Report Designer which is printed normally. However, the field is printed based on the language of the trading partner (in the default). But I want to print this field always in German, meaning the German text.<br />

How can I set the language code to Germany for the field &quot;tdnat400.txta&quot;? Domain of the field is &quot;tctxtn&quot;.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
set the language of report to GERMAN by using <br />
<br />
lattr.language$ R The language code of the report. <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
lattr.textlang$ R/W The language code for printing text. The default is the language code of the report.  <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
on textfield set the lang expression to the exprcted language code.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
