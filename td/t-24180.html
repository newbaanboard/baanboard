<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vahdani</div><div class="date">31st May 2005, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">In ERP LN there have been some changes (for the worse?) regarding multi language customization/development. As I understand it all development is now supposed to be done in english and then the new labels are to be copied to other languages and compiled (yes, in LN you compile the labels!). When editing report layout one only sees the english layout. You cannot know if any label is missing until you print the reports. This is a nuisance for us and as for our customers in germany, not everyone is well versed in english to make sense of the labels. <br />
<br />
Therefore My Questions: <br />
Is anyone else facing the same problem? <br />
If so has anyone found a workaround?<br />
Has anyone got a response from SSA on this issue?</div></div><hr />
