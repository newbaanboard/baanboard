I take it thatyou are importing from a flat file(.txt). Could you find out if there are any error events logged in the Application Part of the Event Viewer. Apart from that could you verify whats the size of the two fields(16,30) in your flat file. It would be more helpfull if you also mention what steps you taken in creating your import scheme...<br />
 <br />
Last but not least, what company are you running the session Import Data (Non-Regular) {tuxch0223m000} from? Is it from your dummy company or is it from your Live company? It would be best to change the value in the field [Overrule Batch Company] to &quot;Yes&quot; and put the dummy company number in the next field named [Company].<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">1st November 2007, 07:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Jay,<br />
   Clear the application event log. Keep it open. Do the import and then check the events that gets logged in the Event Viewer. The source will be &quot;baan&quot;. <br />
 <br />
The steps undertaken looks ok to me.<br />
 <br />
How did you create the flat file? <br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st November 2007, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Also make sure Main table relation Import has add records set to yes.  Then you might want to also put it in debug mode to see what is happening.  Is the exchange scheme showing records skipped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pieter van de L</div><div class="date">1st November 2007, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the times there are two possibility's<br />
1] You must fill the index of the table, if not then the records are read and inserted but the database transaction is not committed<br />
2]Are you using fixed fields then there could be the problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jayverma25</div><div class="date">2nd November 2007, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I have cleared the application event log. Kept it open &amp; run the session import data (Non reguler) . But No event is recorded &amp; no data is uploaded.<br />
<br />
Main table relation Import has add records is already set to yes.<br />
<br />
exchange scheme showing records skipped as Zero, Record read as 1370 &amp; Records processed as 1370.<br />
<br />
Flat File : - I have intially created excel file, then i have save it as csv comma delimited type, I have opened it in note pad &amp; replaced comma with pipe (|) (As In exchange schme , seperator is used as |)<br />
Then i have kept this text file in server. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd November 2007, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I do not see anything that you are missing.  Have you run it in debug mode to step throught it?  This way you can see what is loaded into the variables. You can also see which company and which table gets the insert. Do you have any condition scripts attached anywhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kathuria</div><div class="date">2nd November 2007, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />

Can you save your flat file using the fixed width setup instead of delimited one and then try and import. You would have to make the necessary changes in your import schemes before you do this. <br />
Note the following settings:<br />
Exchange for Multisites: No<br />
Based on Indicators: No<br />
Control character y/n: No<br />
Separator: (blank)<br />
Enclosing Character: (blank)<br />
 <br />
Last but not least, what service pack are you on? It should not matter as the table you are importing doesnt have a date field. One of the service packs or patch fixes a problem with date fields which shows 6 as the length instead of 8...<br />

You can also check if in field relations if the overwrite check box is selected for the fields you want to overwrite.</div></div><hr />
