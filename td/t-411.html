<br />
I was wondering if there is a possibility to cancel the execution of a program script (for example a report who's taking a very long time) by pressing escape key during the execution of the scipt.<br />
<br />
! I don't want to loose the lines allready processed by script !<br />
This mean I must be able to print the report with partial data on it.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Bogdan</div></div><hr />

you could write code into your program script, that<br />
asked the user every so many records, or so many minutes,<br />
'Stop now or keep going Yes / No'<br />
<br />
But that is fairly in-elegant.<br />

thank god you can't see some of the bad code I've written.</div></div><hr />

In BaanERP the concept you have outlined is used in creating &quot;Progress Indicators&quot;. This has multiple options:<br />
<br />
- pure text<br />
- progress bar (with or without text)<br />
- with stop / cancel buttons<br />
<br />
The downside of this is performance degradation. They infact had to write a session to disable the progress indicators as an after thought.<br />
<br />
I have seen in Baan IV dlls (back ported from BaanERP?) which seemed to house the progress indicator code... even though I have not seen any actual usage. Could someone validate this?</div></div><hr />

 Thanks for replys.<br />
<br />
Yes, you're wright: write more eficient code :) , but as far as I know BaaN is very limited in this direction at least from the point of view of final user (do you know docs for embeded BaaN functions ? do you know how to control a table's records in a BaaN script ?<br />
I'll give you the Fox or Paradox example (yes, yes, I know, it's like comparing a horse with a Ferrari :) ).<br />
<br />
OK, let's go back to reality. My problem is that I'm using tfgld410 (a HUGE table) with some silly indexes (I don't know who's using these indexes and I can't add new ones). For the moment I solve the problem; it's working so-so.<br />
<br />
But, let me reformulate my original thred: How can be done a deamon in BaaN ?<br />
<br />
Thank you again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm attempting to use the progress indicator in my Baan 5 script, but when compiling, I get the message 'Unresolved reference to function &quot;create.progress.indicator&quot;'.<br />
<br />
Obviously, there is a library missing which contains the code, but where can I find this library? Anyone? Thanks!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrMarco</div><div class="date">4th December 2001, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">It's OK. I've found the library I wanted!<br />
<br />
For anyone who's interested, in order to use the progress indicator, you need to include the line:<br />
<br />
#include &lt;bic_progress&gt;<br />
<br />
at the top of your program. This gives you access to the create.progress.indicator() function and associated routines.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />
