yes this is what I meant with &quot;formeditor&quot;. In ERP there is a special TAB with display settings. There is als a switch &quot;Input Length / Digits after Dec. point&quot; which looks IMO very interresting. But however. I didn't see any influence to my field. <br />
I always found that things on Baan IV easier. In ERP I'm somtimes a little confused, how field are displayed. Maybe this is also, that the field help, at least on our system, doesn't work anymore (that good), as it did in Baan IV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">12th June 2007, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">you can set the input length yourself. If you want for instance 6 positions before the decimal point, out of which one mandatory, and 2 positions after decimal point, both mandatory, then you write as input length after dec. 2, before decimal 6, and then you will see that the display format will automatically be changed to ZZZZZ9VD99, although you can also change that...<br />

I tried that already. The result is not that, I would like to have. <br />
Let's say I create a format like ZZZZ9VD9<br />
Then the DISPLAY is according to that pattern, but during input I'm able to enter, for example &quot;0.003&quot;. Afer input Baan shows &quot;0.0&quot; on the form, and in the table field I see &quot;0.003&quot;. <br />
I find this very confusing for the users. The only way to avoid this, seems for me at the moment, to write something in a &quot;check.input&quot; section or in a &quot;dal.property.hook&quot;. This is a little bit anoying, 'cause IMO this is a thing, one should be able fix within the properties of a form field.<br />

On my Baan 5.0B environment the behavious is different than what you describe. I can do the way I wrote in my earlier post, the only thing is, indeed Baan allows input of more than 2 decimals, however when inputing more than two, the system right away pops up with message &quot;value not allowed&quot;, and does not enable saving the record. So the only inputable value is with maximum 2 decimals...<br />

<br />
your behaviour would be net that bad for me. I couldn't imagine why there should be such a big difference to 50.c. Maybe I make a mistake somewhere?<br />
But it looks just to easy to make something wrong?<br />
