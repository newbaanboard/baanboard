<br />
I have little problem. I have created few tables in logistics company and want to get the data in the Financial company. How and where I should configure or tell the program that get the tables from the related logistic company. I don't want to use the &quot;._compnr&quot; in the SQL statement because the same programs are used for many combinations of Financial &amp; Logistics companies.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<br />
depending on the tables you will use from the logistic comp. it's also possible to link it with the session ttaad4120m000. there you can define the logical company (finance comp.) and the physical comp. where the table is filled.<br />
But then also new records created in the financial comp. will be in the logistic one.</div></div><hr />
