<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 01:09</div></div><div class="posttext">well, I have searched the board b4 posting but this is a typical issue.<br />
sorry for the long post, but this is strange.<br />
<br />
I have a maintain session with form type 3 with 3 key fields.<br />
The first key field is an order type and I have used the set.enum.values for<br />
restricting the order types to just 2 using the domain values.<br />
This is in the before.input section of the first key field.Everything works well when I insert new records and the drop down box allows the 2 order types option.<br />
<br />
However, when I  do a find, I see only one ( the default order type on the form at that time) in the drop down box.Even When I click it down , I can't see anything.However, if I type in the first letter of the other order type that shows up. set.enum.values is working as no other order type shows up by typing in the start letter.<br />
<br />
From what I have read on the board, before.field could be an option to try out,I have not tried that.I have tried coding the same under choice.def.find but it gets to before.input anyway.I guess, set.enum.values.for.field() is not available for BaanIV, correct?<br />
<br />
Any body here faced with similar behavior?</div></div><hr />
