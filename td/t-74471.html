we have a table extension (cisli220) and we would like to create a question with predefined answers (yes/No).<br />
How can this be done?<br />
<br />
Thank you a lot,<br />

<br />
DALs and Table Extensions cannot have any logic that requires user interaction.  While it might be possible to sneak it in, it is against the concept of those components.<br />
<br />
You can have conditional logic in the Table Extension, but if a user decision is needed, it needs to have been made beforehand when a user interface was present.<br />
<br />

Just catch the answer and send it to your extension script</div></div><hr />

<br />
While your suggestion is technically possible, as explained in my previous comment, it violates the concept of the DAL and Table Extension, e.g., there should not be any user interaction as the logic could be executed when there is none possible, e.g., from an integration.<br />
