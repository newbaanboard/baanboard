<br />
I have one customized PRINT Session, I have 1 variable on the report which basically contains the month_no. e.g. in case of July it will have value 7<br />
<br />
Now what i would like to display  is <br />
<br />
TOTAL FOR THE MONTH OF JULY         200<br />
instead of <br />
MONTH TOTAL  FOR 7                         200<br />
<br />
I did a little bit of home work also by doing the following<br />
in report script in a section.<br />
<br />
String str(15)<br />
str = sprintf$(&quot;%D (%H)&quot;,month_no)<br />
<br />
so in this case str returned me JULY<br />
<br />
now here goes my requirement, I would not like to write this code in Report script or Program script. I would like to specifiy it on the Field which i have taken on my report, for that i specified the following statement in PRINT FORMAT<br />
<br />
sprintf$(&quot;%D (%H)&quot;,month_no)<br />
<br />
but on compiling the report Baan gave me error that chr(37) not expected ....i don't have the exact retured error right now, but during compilation only i encountered errors. <br />
<br />
Please GURUS help me out, and tell me how can i do it without using program script or report script.<br />
<br />
I would like to specify this at REPORT DESIGN LAYOUT for that field(month_no).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks it solved my problem. :)<br />
but just tell me why i need to do all this <br />
format related thing in PRINT EXPRESSION rather than in PRINT FORMAT ?<br />
Is it because i am using sprintf$() ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gous99</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">As you can see, the field is called Print Expression, and that's why you can put more formatted expression here. <br />
<br />
For example, if you want to concatenate 2 fields you can put it in there, something like strip$(field1) &amp; field2, or a calculation,<br />
say on your report you have a field called price and a field called quantity, then you could create another field on your report and put in the Print Expression : price * quantity, and the result of it would be printed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">You should also be able to just put %D(%H) [notice no sprintf$] in the Print Format field in your print expression is a date.</div></div><hr />
