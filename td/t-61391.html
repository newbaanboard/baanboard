I'm trying to develop something in our development VRC to make sure that I don't give problems to users who are currently using the production VRC. <br />
<br />
I've set my VRC to the development VRC, copied my session and the session script to this VRC, and try to edit and run it. But it seems that still it uses the production VRC when I'm running it. I tried adding a message() call to the before.program part of the session script, and also tried compiling it in debug mode, but I don't get the message, and I don't get the debug window, so it's definitely using the production VRC. <br />
<br />
So then I'm wondering if I have misunderstood something fundamental about this. How do I get it to use the dev VRC when it's running it? I tried going to the sessions list (ttadv2500m000) and tried specifically choosing the one in the dev VRC and pressing execute, but still I have the same result. I also tried logging out and in again but no luck. I thought that as long as I had my package VRC set it would choose that VRC whenever it would run something. (As long as it existed in the given version. Otherwise it would choose the version one level higher up)<br />
<br />
Can anyone please give me a hint? Thank you.</div></div><hr />
