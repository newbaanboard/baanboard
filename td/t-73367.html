<br />
there are 2-3 sessions which are based on tdrma903 table.<br />
Normally these sessions take 30-40 seconds to open but from 15 days it is taking more than 5-6 mins to open.<br />
<br />
There were no changes were done for table or these sessions. <br />
We checked in dev and test server it takes max 20-25 seconds to open these sessions.<br />
<br />
sessions are of type display and maintain.<br />
<br />
we checked with DB team regarding update statistics and indexing but all is good.<br />
<br />
we have used call graph profile for one of the session and got the report which is attached here.<br />
session- tdrma9103m100<br />
<br />
Any help to find the root cause of the issue is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Take a backup of the table.Try reconfiguring table option in Infor.</div></div><hr />

If that did not work I would put it in debug mode and find exactly which query is causing the issue.  See if it could be improved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">22nd August 2020, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">[3]    100.0    0.000    0.220     0.001   258.254      1        std_main-ottstpstandard [3]<br />
<br />
<br />
From the profile it appears the maximum time is being taken by the ottstpstandard library routines.<br />
<br />
So, once you have eliminated the possibility of the table indexes being the issue by doing a rebuild of the indexes, next you can try a create RUNTIME DD on the SESSION. For some reasons that I cannot understand, the ottstpstandard sometimes 'misbehaves'.<br />
<br />
Sounds unintuitive but is based on experience of a couple of times it has helped in my case. The environment for which this 'hack' works is BAAN VI c3 on a HP UX platform, ORACLE backend DB. Hopefully it works for you too.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the only option may be to ask help from BAAN.</div></div><hr />
