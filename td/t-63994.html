We are printing 2 copies of a billing request which has multiple invoices in it but somehow it starts printing incorrectly in between. It prints the header of the second copy to first copy. Once it is started it starts printing in the same way for all invoices after that. If we reprint the same billing reuest it prints it perfectly fine for all invoices in it. What could be the reason? Even if you don't have a complete solution but please share your though as any thought on this can be helpful?<br />
<br />
we are using LN 6.1.<br />

Thanks,<br />

If I have a clue, suggestion or answer I will include them on the board and not in a PM.  So right now I do not have clue how this report works in relationship to your device setups - or even how LN works with printing.  About the only thing I can suggest is running it in debug to see what the report is doing when you get to the problem area.  Maybe you should see a formfeed somewhere along the way.  Maybe a layout just needs to have new page set - again this is based off my 4c4 knowledge and may not even be relevant.  Sometimes patience is needed for an answer - some people only visit the forum every few days.</div></div><hr />

I will suggest you to put your script in here. May be there is some problem with your script (UI or Report Script). <br />

Mark, LN works same as 4C4 in case of printing. Not much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th April 2013, 23:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Bhushan.  If that is the case the next thing I would ask is this windows printing or UNIX print queue.  We use UNIX print queues and I would look at the report layouts for new page, report setup(form 2) and maybe checking the form feed on the device itself(not sure how this works if you are doing windows printing).  Of course on 4c4 we only have report scripts. So as Bhushan mentioned posting more information might help someone think of a solution.</div></div><hr />
