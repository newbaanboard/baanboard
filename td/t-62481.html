<br />
I hope you can help me find out why changes I applied to a standard Baan table (tdltc001) do not take effect.  I added one field to this table, converted to runtime, exit Baan and log back on.  When checking GTM the new field is not there.  Any idea why?  The Convert to Runtime was executed wide open.  I also tried Create Runtime but it didn't help.  Note that the table was not reconfigured either.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback in advance!</div></div><hr />

           Please check the &quot;Reconfigure tables&quot; option and do &quot;Convert to run time data dictionary&quot;. I hope it'll work for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th June 2012, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Also when you convert to runtime - do that one table.  I know once there was something stuck in one of the other packages on our system that when you ran it wide open it would fail and then your table would not reconfigure.  Took a while be the administrator got it cleaned up with BaaN assistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">15th June 2012, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Kiran but I did that.  Just found out that shared memory service is not running; looking into that now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">15th June 2012, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, shared memory is running but it's &quot;not attached&quot;..... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">15th June 2012, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Check dict directory. Can you see your new field in file dtdltc001? Is maybe dtdltc001.new present?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">15th June 2012, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually in windows if table defs are loaded in memory ( one has to do in production environment), it is necessary to bring shared memory down and up. One cannot bring shred memory down if any user is attached to Baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">19th June 2012, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Shared memory was stopped and restarted, no change.  I couldn't find the file in the DD either but the name of the directory did not match the package combination; that certainly causes concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th June 2012, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be a directory for that package combination - at least in UNIX there is.  You might want to make sure you can create files in that directory.  I know our production environment even as a super user I cannot create RDD or compile.  I also know that at times we run into an issue where the DD just will not create - there is something our application admin can do to force it to create - I think it is adding or deleting something from a tools table.  I do not know this process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">20th June 2012, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Chechk in session Package Combinations (or in file $BSE/lib/fdpackage_comb) where is data dictionary for your package combination. There must exists subdirectory (or subfolder on Win OS) named dtdltc. Check this subdirectory. Is file dtdltc001 correct, does it contain description for the new field?<br />
What about logs (log.bdbreconfig, log.bshell, log.oracle8, ...) or event viewer? Are there any errors related to table tdltc001?</div></div><hr />
