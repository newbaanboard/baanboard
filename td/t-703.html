<br />
I have a Baan table that I created a while ago where I have a field tdsls945.dino which uses the tc.dino domain. This domain is a &quot;long&quot; type and I now want the tdsls945.dino field to use a new &quot;string&quot; domain that I have created. I have changed the field domain in Maintain Table Fields and then Converted the changed table def to runtime. I have gone into ttaad4500 and can see that the tdsls945.dino field has a type of string. When I go into my session and add a record into the dino field I get the attached BW Error message, I get the same error when saving the record. The record seems to save OK.<br />
<br />
Could it be that this particular field is linked to by &quot;Related Label&quot; in Maintain Table Defs to tdsls045.dino? <br />
<br />
I have attached the session script and error message.<br />
<br />
What do you think is causing this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I couldn't find the assignment statement or is that field not updated?<br />
<br />
I guess you compiled the program again after changing the domain/convert to runtime?<br />
<br />
If you are using NT it could be that the old dd is still in shm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO you forget to recreate runtime DD for forms used in your sessions, so in form object your field is still long, not string.<br />
You have also to recompile reports using changed field.</div></div><hr />

I dumped and create RT on form.<br />

But still the same problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your problem is the line where you say:<br />
 where tdsls045.dino=:tdsls945.dino<br />
 long----------^                      ^-----------string<br />
<br />
that shouldn't work, should it?<br />

If you run your session in debug mode I think it will give you a clearer view of where the programmay  be going wrong.</div></div><hr />
