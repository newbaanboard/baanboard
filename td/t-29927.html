<br />
I have a single occurance form based on a Main table. Here, when the user tries to modify the record I am putting an application lock to lock that particular order using sections : <br />
<br />
choice.modify.set<br />
before.choice:<br />
   put.lock()<br />
<br />
after.choice:<br />
   remove.lock()<br />
<br />
Now I have a different form i.e. multioccurance form which shows multiple orders on one screen. Here again I need to put an applicaiton lock to the order which the user is trying to modify.<br />
<br />
when i use the choice.modify.set -&gt; before.choice &amp; after.choice ..it does not work. I mean..<br />
<br />
If the form is displaying orders   1, 2, 3, 4 and if I click the second record the in the actual.occ field it still stores the 1st record. Hence the 1st order gets locked during the before.choice of modify.set choice.<br />
<br />
However during the after.choice part it correctly recognizes the 2nd record but it has not been locked.<br />
<br />
Basically, I need to put put a lock on the record which the user clicks. <br />
<br />
Any solution for this ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact I am doing it the way you have mentioned  &quot;do.occ(actual.occ, put.lock). &quot; <br />
<br />
But the issue here is during this stage i.e. choice.modify.set -&gt; before.choice the value of  actual.occ is 1 and not really the real actual occurance no. I think the variable gets assigned the value after that.<br />
<br />
If I first manually mark the line and then edit it the value of actual.occ is correct.<br />
<br />
I even tried to use the function mark.occ() but here again to mark the correct record I first need the correct value of actual.occ</div></div><hr />

You can check in the before.input section of each field to see if a lock is set, if not set the application lock.  At this point(so early in the morning) I do not see any method around this since you never know what field the user will click in and modify.  Then release the application lock in the after.choice of the modify set.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th January 2007, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not believe in baan 4 there is an on.choice section for choice.modify.set.  I do not know about 5 or ln.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">15th January 2007, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I would try to place the lock in after.choice of choice.mark.occur. It may be removed in the after.choice of choice.modify.set.</div></div><hr />
