<br />
I am looking for a sample script for display session using multiple table, I want use tdsls041,tipcs020,tipcs510,tipcs520,tipcs530,tisfc001, where project number is the key.<br />
I have created a display session with base table as tdsls041 as form 1 and all other tables are different forms like tipcs020 as form 2 etc.<br />
but not able to link them.<br />
<br />
Any light.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

So would suggest you to create some more sessions which are invoked from program based on project value . This is implemented in later versions of Baan as MMT (Multi-main table ) functionality with more user friendlieness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One think u can try . make a simple display session using the table tdsls041<br />
and delete the all field from &quot;form&quot; which is not required.<br />
Change the script according the requirement and put the extra field in the form. It will work.<br />
<br />
If u send the actual I will develop the session and send it to u.<br />

We want to use the following table and their fields,<br />
tdsls040,tccom001,tccom010,tiitm001,tipcs020,tipcs510,tipcs520,tipcs530,tisfc001,tcqms120,tcqms100,tcqms101,tcqms115,tcqms110,tdsls045,tcmcs039<br />
<br />
I want to create a display session which named as Sales Order tracking.<br />
<br />
the first form of display session speak about sales order (tdsls041),next form (2) speak about project (tipcs020) - link is project no, we are linking sales order with project, 3 form speak about PRP production order, 4th will speak PRP W/H order,5 th will speak PRP Purchase Order, 6th about SFC production, 7th about QA/QC and finaly 8 th will be Despatch.<br />
<br />
I have already made this tracking system as print session and it is perfectly fine. now I want to develop the same as display session. that is why looking for a sample script where any one has linked multiple table.<br />
<br />
I have already developed one display session With form type 2 (session has 8 form), for sales order (form1) and project (form2) is working fine without any script, for other tables it is not fetching data. <br />
may be my syntax is not correct.<br />
attaching my script code<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The simplest way is to program in the after read section of main table I/O  for all those tables. If you have any display problems, use in before.display for evey field the same functions to read data.<br />
<br />
All the choices will work without any additional effort. <br />
<br />
Good luck!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I too have the same problem in displaying the fields from the table other than the main table. I have parent, child relationship between the tables. I have generated display session on the master table with form type multiocc + view. I am displaying vendor code wise items. And the other table has all the billing details. So, for each item i have to show all the bills booked. <br />
<br />
In my session rather than displaying all the bills for one item, it is showing ony latest bill booked. Meaning, only one bill for one item is displayed on the form. I have kept select query for selecting all the bills in the after.read event of main.table.io section. But, no luck yet.<br />
<br />
Please, can anybody suggest me how can i display all the bills for each item.<br />
<br />
Reply as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th March 2008, 08:34</div></div><div class="posttext">U should use bills  transaction table as main table. There must be proper index on that table to support form view .<br />
<br />
Alternatively if u want to use the same order or view and use the same main table , u can do so by creating 2 interactive sessions which act in a syncronized manner . e.g. When u start tisfc0102m000 , it actually starts  2 sessions internally (see output of ps in ttstpshell) viz tisfc0102m000 and tisfc0506m000 . <br />
<br />
This too can have problems if number of  child items to show is more than one screen as there is no direct interaction with  child session. <br />
<br />
If u have less time then 1st alternative is the right approach . In later versions excellent MMT  sessions can be developed .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ankita</div><div class="date">19th March 2008, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hitesh,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the reply. I have to display items vendor code wise. So, i cant have my session on bill transaction table. <br />
<br />
According to what you told abt creating two interactive sessions. This you are telling for BAAn IV. Since, synchronized sessions are not possible in BAAN IV. <br />
<br />
So, can you please explain me solution in some detail.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th March 2008, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Syncronized sessions like tisfc0102m000 , tdsls4102s000 etc  are possible in B40 . But remember all of  the same just different view on same main table . So it may be good time and efforts  trying the functionality through syncronized  sessions .<br />
<br />
Instead u may re-engineer ur logic if possible  (say to see bill's in a subsession ). That would be much quick and recommended solution in a limited time frame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th March 2008, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Interactive sessions in baan work with one as main and another as child session . Main session receives all the events / commands and syncronizes the action with child by giving appropriate execute instruction to it . All interactive sessions u c in Baan IV  or are on same table  with different view of the table.<br />
<br />
U need interactive view of 2 different tables . So u need a good command translation mechanisms in these program .<br />
<br />
e.g Normal next/ previous / top/last works on main session . Group next/previous ..etc are communicated to child as it's own next /previous.... for same items. U need special command (user.0) to search records in child session. Baan standard search will work only maintable recors .<br />
<br />
There are good threads on interactive sessions  on this board ,and if all these looks complicated , I would  recommend u to re-engineer the functionality .</div></div><hr />
