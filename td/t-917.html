I was wondering as found the session &quot;tdsls4500m000&quot;. There was an other Session &quot;tdsls4500&quot;, with an Script &quot;tdsls4110&quot; Can somebody tell me, how the relation between this Sessions is? How is &quot;tdsls4500&quot; executet? Is it a kind of subprocess from &quot;tdsls4500m000&quot;?<br />
<br />
Thanx in Advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">In B50_b the session can be started via the run program option. Doing this will open the session &quot;Sales Orders&quot; (tdsls4500m000). In the bshell you can see that both session are running: tdsls4500 and tdsls4500m000.<br />
<br />
When running session tdsls4500m000 directly, in the bshell again these two sessions are running: tdsls4500 and tdsls4500m000.<br />
<br />
Script tdsls4110 is responsible for switching between the sessions &quot;Sales Orders&quot; and &quot;Sales Order Lines&quot;. When switching from one session to the other, always only one session is opened. The first one is being closed. <br />
<br />
This same behaviour applies when starting session &quot;Sales Order Lines&quot; (tdsls4501m000). Starting this session results in opening tdsls4501 and tdsls4501m000. The script for session tdsls4501 is also tdsls4110.<br />
<br />
In B50_c, both sessions (tdsls4500 and tdsls4501) are expired. As a result no session is closed when switching between Sales Order Lines and Sales Orders. This was done by BAAN Development to be able to work in a web-enabled environment.<br />
<br />
If you look at the PUR-module, here also identical sessions do exist: tdpur4500 and tdpur4501.<br />
<br />
So, the session indeed act as a kind of subprocess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">So within the source of both sessions there is no code which explicitly starts one of the sessions?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
