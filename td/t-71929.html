pdetail = 2<br />
r.2.s.detail()<br />

In a new report on another Baan server I want to use this command also but there I get error &quot;Unresolved reference to r.2.s.detail()&quot;.<br />

I believe that in the past the current command was a little bit different but I can't remeber what that was.<br />

Can anyone help me on this matter?<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th May 2019, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry - should have said comment out the r.2.s.detail() line.  Compile in debug - make sure that routine is still preset in the compiled report.  If not I am assuming you have a system where this report works - compile that one in debug mode.  And run both reports comparing the code.  My swag and I could be wrong is the layout numbers or something must have changed between servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just had a look at one of my reports. I see a function r.s.detail, which then calls r.s.detail.1 (maybe other number, maybe more Detail lines) according to the defined layouts. But I'm not sure if i've ever seen r.2.s.detail.<br />
<br />
Maybe you could use a standard method like: cope layout 1 to layout 2 and use print conditions?<br />
<br />
Or you could try my solution described here: <br />
