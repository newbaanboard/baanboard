<br />
I can manually run the job from the task scheduler on the Baan server and when I see the session startup I see that the last field on the form is blank.  It should have a value in it.  There are only four form fields, From/To cprj and From/To cwar.  <br />
<br />
When I did Make Job on the session I put Blank - ZZZZZZ for the cprj fields and 700 - 710 for cwar fields.  That is stored in tttaad503 and when I run the Print Sessions by Job with details it is in there.   <br />
<br />
After the job is done I look in Display Job History messages and my job is there with a No Data within Selection error.  This is not true.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas??<br />

(1) If it is a custom session make sure field order on form is correct.  It seems to me back in 4c3 we had this cause a problem on a job.  You also might want to put it in debug just see what it is being fed.  If it is a baan session I would report it to baan.<br />
(2)  I would do make a job again to a new sequence and print the job with session details to see if it does it again.  <br />
<br />
With the problems you are having with reports and this, it might be time for a tools update.  I know in the past we had jobs become corrupt and we never found out why.  I can't recall the last time this happened - I know it has been a couple of years.  Not much help, but it is all I recall.  <br />
<br />
Now on SP20 we had a job that ran the same session 6 times, with different parameters.  It test the 6th run would not work most times.  We reported it to SSA, but then it started working.  Baan did recommend we get the lastest tools patch, I have not heard any problems with it in production.  What fun!</div></div><hr />
