<br />
Other notable features include:<br />
<br />
1.In Baan IV standard items(tiitm001) and project specific items(tipcs021) were stored in <br />
separate tables. Now both types of items are stored in a single table <br />
2.In Baan IV, all item related master data (inventory, purchase, costing, sales &amp; purchase) were maintained in a single table. Now in ERPLn, the item master (tcibd001) contains only the basic information and rest of the data is separated function-wise and stored in separate tables.<br />
3.With introduction of warehousing module, now inter-company material transfer has become easier.<br />
4.In Baan IV, the planning engine for MPS/SIC and MRP were separate but in Ln, everything is combined under umbrella of EP (Enterprise Planning)<br />
5.In ERPLn, a new feature called ODM (document management) is added. Now user can even attach external documents like CAD drawings, Microsoft word files and lot more other types of files. Also it's revision can be tracked.<br />
<br />
Above are the functional changes. There are some technical enhancements also which helps the client mold the ERPLn functionality according to their requirement. One such functionality is DAL (Data access layer). Through DAL, client can program additional functionality like custom validation and lot more. In short, they can add one more layer of programming on top of standard session script.<br />
<br />
Another important inclusion is Infor Web based user interface. Now those clients who use ERPLn, have to choices, they can either use BW+ Worktop or Web based UI as it does not require setting up clients in user's local machine.<br />
<br />
That's all from my side. I hope there are many baanboard users who can contribute through mentioning new features.<br />
