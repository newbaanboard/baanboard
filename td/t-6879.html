I think if you use the field as Input type on form you would to use the event on.input: at the script and the attr.input = false.<br />
<br />
Other way (i'm not sure about it) is to change the table ttadv301 wich had some informations about the fields on a form and you would change the ttadv301.typf (type --&gt; Input -- Display -- Input Only -- Display Only ... ) of the field, once you must to refresh the field's form (refresh()).<br />
<br />
I hope it this help you!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
field.prt.cprj:<br />
before.input:							|#910.sn<br />
	if tiitm001.kitm = tckitm.purchase then<br />

I usually use the before.input section.<br />

At least not in my c3 version.<br />

Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">In the form, change the attribute from Display to Input.  Then in the code use logic similar to Mark's posting.<br />
<br />
<br />
field.prt.cprj:<br />
before.input:					<br />
	if tiitm001.kitm = tckitm.purchase then<br />
		attr.input = false<br />
		message(&quot;Project error message&quot;)<br />
	endif					<br />
<br />
Effectively when the user tries to modify this field, the message will be displayed and no input is permitted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Joy!<br />
<br />
I think she was looking to actually change the form field type from display to input in the code. I think she already new how to do what was suggested.  Is there a way to change the form field type in the code?  I have never seen a solution showing this, but that does not mean it is not possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 23:50</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a predefined variable attr.inpfld that may support this.  The manual says 1 = input field and 0 = display field.<br />
<br />
I have never used this but sounds like it may be worth trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 23:58</div></div><div class="posttext">My documentation says the variable is read only. I tried it on our 4c3 version and could not get it to work.  I guess it has something to do with the &quot;dumped&quot; version of the form.  If you changed that field I guess you have to dump the form again.<br />

<br />
and how can I make a dump for a Form in a code?<br />
is there any DLL that make that possible?<br />
and what its syntax?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 01:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - there is a dll for this.  I do not know the name or format of it, but I have seen it.  I will look for it when I return to work tomorrow.  If you want in the mean time you could just run bic_info on the DLL's - not sure which sub-directory it is in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muheeb</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 09:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for replying,<br />
<br />
I found the DLL &quot;ottdlldumpform&quot; that contain the function:<br />
dump.form(string path(150), ref long errorno)<br />
<br />
that what you saw? but this function don't take form codename, but<br />
the path of the form? i.e. $BSE/application/...?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - that is what I saw.  I am not sure if there is a function to use just the codename.  You can look at the ttadv3100m000 using bic_info and see what libraries it uses - this includes ottdlldumpform.  You should be able to build the path name to the form and then call this function.  It is not easy but is possible.<br />
<br />
Or if you want you can always use an API type function server to pull up the form and dump it that way.  I am not user which option is dump - user option 6 I think.  Just something else you can try.<br />

Muheeb,<br />
<br />
Why would you want to develop that ? There are many changes wrt Tools between versions and there are different kinds of Forms now -<br />
<br />
Static Forms, Dynamic Forms and Integration Sessions(Forms).<br />
<br />
Each kind of form would dump in different format and I found in Reger version  has a mix of all, althought most of them are Integration Sessions.</div></div><hr />

I have gone into the properties and the field type is &quot;input&quot;.  I have also toyed around with other things and I still have no luck. Can anyone be of assistance?</div></div><hr />
