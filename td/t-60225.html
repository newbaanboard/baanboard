I have a question regarding the function mark.occ.<br />
<br />
I'm using it in my program and it works great, like it should.<br />
The problem is the annoying message that pops up when the record is marked. The message is 'Record modified by other user; new values are displayed'. <br />
How do I get rid of this message? <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">15th March 2011, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">This happens in the test company while testing, and I'm 100% sure that no one else is accessing those records.  It's a custom table and session.<br />
<br />
I was hoping there might be parameters on the baan function that could be set differently to control the pop-up message.<br />

I guess it is possible that the main session is accessing the custom table as well, and that's what's causing the message to pop up. <br />
<br />
Does that sound like a reasonable explanation?<br />

<br />
did you by any chance use do.cc() function to examine the occurences to determine which one you want to mark?<br />
<br />
I had done this a few days ago and I was getting the exact same message about the record beying modified by other user. I changed to do.occ.without.update() and the message disappeared!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">15th March 2011, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I changed my function to use do.occ.without.update() and it works! <br />
<br />
Wow, that was easy.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion. :)<br />
