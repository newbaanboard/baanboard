it was set 2 for number of servers. I set it number 6 or 5 and I check the working time of session. There wasn't any change in timing. I wonder that what is wrong with it ?  or change is miliseconds ? <br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />

<br />
since you have 2 CPUs i would leave the booster off.<br />

1.- Put a support order to SSA describing your problem.<br />
2.- In the most of the cases, they will send you a object upgrade. This object have the name otfgld4201 o maybe the can send you a solution in a compressed form or in the format of PCM dependig if you have installed that tool.<br />
3.- Depending on the format of the solution your Baan Administrator will install following the indications from SSA global.<br />

Hope this help.</div></div><hr />
