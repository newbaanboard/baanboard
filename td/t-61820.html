<br />
I have worked with LN 6.1 FP3 and when we have to automate data entry and tfgld1101m000 / tfacr1110m000  have used AFS's funcionality. Now I tfgld1101m000 FP5 is MMT session and that the tfacr1110m000  main table (tfacr200) now has DAL2. So we respect the concept we have used DAL hoping the business logic is triggered but found that it does.<br />
<br />
Someone has already done this work with later versions to FP3?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">25th January 2012, 10:35</div></div><div class="posttext">These are complex sessions with complex DAL's, that is many type of sessions act on the same tables. Most probably the DALs will contain business methods which are required as prerequisite. Meaning that these BM must be called in order to indicate which kind of transaction will be created, only then the correct behavior can be expected when doing dal.new.object.<br />

<br />
ARijke, I can say you that with dal.new.object() sentence doesn't work on DAL2, this say us in the DAL documentation is that never we should use this instruction, the documentation too say me that we should use tfacrdll5200 library for this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rochus,<br />
I want to ask  a special favor, because you say me that you do it for AFS functionality, In FP5 tfgld1101m000 is now MMT session, so far as I know in this session type is not possible to do AFS, . the special favor is that if you can share your source code.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rochus</div><div class="date">25th January 2012, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">you can call first tfgld1101m000 (close it after save), <br />
after that call satellite sessions f.i. (tfacr1110s000) - from there it is no problem anymore ...</div></div><hr />
