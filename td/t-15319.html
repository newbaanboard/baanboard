<br />
I'm trying the below scenario on Baan Vc.<br />
<br />
I have a customized table with about 40 fields in it. I generated a  session of type Maintain and Window Type of &quot;List Window&quot;.<br />
Its a Main Session with a start command of &quot;7&quot;.<br />
The forms are of Type 3 (MultiOcc+View+Main).<br />
Since there are so many fields, the generated session resulted in about 12 form tabs being created. I went ahead and deleted the last 9 form tabs, since i dont need them.<br />
Made a few layout changes to the forms, and added a few fields to the form., both Table fields and form fields.<br />
<br />
The first session looks fine. <br />
The only problem is with the remaining forms... All the fields are disabled. <br />
The form properties show that its a 'input' type fields (Multi-occ &amp; Echo).<br />
<br />
There are no conditions in the program script to disable fields and the form fields are declared as extern. The Standard Commands has the right options ticked (New, modify recs... etc)<br />
<br />
What is causing this ? How can I resolve this ? How can I make data entry possible on forms 2-4. ?<br />
<br />
All help is appreciated. Thanks<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<br />
just to be sure: Did you dump the forms? (You may not need  to do this, if you have &quot;autodump&quot; enabled, i.e. ttadv0110m000 Maintain Developer Parameters by User, Mask &quot;General&quot;, Conversion to runtime after Change, Forms [x]).<br />

<br />
I'm not sure in Baan 5.0c, but check the standard form options of the forms, make sure that the 'list of forms', previous form, next form etc options are selected. In Bann5.0b not selecting those will result in not being able to move to different forms, but maybe in 5.0c it's different....???<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<br />
The first thing I did was to check whatever you suggested. :)<br />
<br />
If i remove form 1 and make say... form 3 as form 1 ... then the fields get enabled on the new form 1. The fields on the other forms still are disabled.<br />
The form properties of all the forms are same.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

Those type of sessions are in standard Baan only used for basic tables with codes and descriptions. For more complex tables always a read-only multi-occ with a synchronized edit dialog is used.</div></div><hr />
