There is a maintain session (form type 2). I maintain n records at one go. The records are not saved till the end, but you still can NOT maintain a duplicate record!! There is nothing in the program script. What is this functionality!?<br />
Refer session - tcmcs0145m000, and many other such sessions.<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st December 2002, 03:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Underlying each BAAN Session, there is concept called the 'Standard Program'. The basic functionality of Insert/ Delete/ etc. are handled by the combination of the Standard Program and the underlying database design.<br />
<br />
You can refer to what happens by looking up 'Flow of Standard Program' in the on-line help at the following link:<br />
<br />
Flow of Standard Program (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_4gl_features_flow_of_standard_program) <br />
<br />
<br />
So, in your example, the Standard Program invokes a check on the database to ensure that a duplicate cannot be entered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note, however, that you have no access to the 'code' of the standard program - it merges into your customized code when the compiler is invoked. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

I also thought, there must be some standard functionality of BaaN, which is called up to make such checks, as there is nothing in the program script for such sessions. But, just wondered whether there was something more than this!!<br />

This no longer happens -- as of Baan 4 and later.  The 'standard program' is a 3GL and/or DLLs in the tt package.  All 4GL scripts are DLLs now, so the &quot;merging&quot; happens at runtime.  In Triton 3 and earlier the compiler (possibly std_gen?) did merge in the 'standard program' code to form a standalone 3GL object.  This is an important difference as in the later case, code enhancers, such as QKEY (http://www.fullscope.com/qkey.htm), could not exist.</div></div><hr />
