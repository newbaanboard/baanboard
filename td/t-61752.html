<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camste</div><div class="date">11th January 2012, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a session where I add a toolbar with three icons. The problem in the desktop version is that when I open the session one of the icons (the bar code icon) is not entirely shown. Half of it &quot;falls outside&quot; of the toolbar.<br />
<br />
In the webtop however it doesn't load all of the images for these icons. Only one of the icons has an image, the other two have the typical &quot;broken image&quot; icon.<br />
<br />
The two icons that aren't loaded have been made by me and uploaded to the server, and added to Baan through the session ttadv2570m000. The first one was already stored.<br />
<br />
The call to create the toolbar:<br />
create.extra.toolbar(  &quot;exec.conf.order.line&quot;,&quot;whinh:approve&quot;<br />
                      ,&quot;exec.conf.full.order&quot;,&quot;cddev:approveall&quot;<br />
                      ,&quot;exec.start.scan&quot;,&quot;cddev:barcode&quot;<br />
                    )</div></div><hr />

<br />
the icons have to be a GIF file with 16x16px and import the files into the correct package and modules (it is there where your session is). It should be working.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

I faced this problem long before, but got it fixed by placing the icon files in a different path for webtop. You need to place the icons &quot;.gif&quot; files for webtop separately at the place where webtop was installed. Right now I don't remember the exact path, Once I will with my system I will let you know. As of now you can try searching the icon folders inside @webtop installation path.<br />

Ok, I changed them to 16x16, and now there's no overflow. They are still not shown in the webtop however.<br />
But why are the images not loaded in the webtop but only in the desktop? The images are loaded into the cddev module where my session also resides. (But it's still possible to use the icon from whinh in this session so it seems that it shouldn't matter if the file is in the same module.)</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I didn't reload the page before posting my answer (which I had started writing before lunch) so I didn't see your reply. Thank you. I had no idea about that. It seems a bit strange that you need the file in two different places. I'll try to search a bit and see what I can find then. But if you find out something please tell me. I'll appreciate it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to create a new folder for you any new packages or modules if it is not present for webtop.<br />
Following is the standard path:<br />
<br />
&quot;C:\Infor\ERPLN\ese\Webtop\web\erp\images\wh\inh&quot;. <br />
<br />
You need to check you webtop folder in your system then --&gt;web then --&gt; erp then images --&gt; then create a new folder &quot;cd&quot; for package if not exist then --&gt; create new folder &quot;dev&quot; for module if not exist and place you &quot;.gif&quot; file within last folder i.e., &quot;dev&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this will solve you problem :)<br />

I was able to find the folder with your help. :) The folder path wasn't exactly the same as yours, but I found the path webtop\web\erp\images\ within one of the folders on the server, and after creating the cd and dev folders and transferring the files it works. :)</div></div><hr />

Yes exactly in our system we had installed webtop @ C drive in above given path. Thanks for your feedback :)<br />
