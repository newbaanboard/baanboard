<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what happened but all text is no longer attached to ttadv3180m000.  The header information and reports are still there but the text containing the actual queries is gone.  Clicking on the text manager button returns the prompt to create/modify etc. text.  My hope is that the query text is still available somewhere and need only be reattached to the query headers.  Any help/suggestions?  Which text table contains the queries?  Any idea how/why this happened?<br />

The text table I find our queries in table tttxt010 in company 000.  Not sure how you would match the two tables up.  Could someone have deleted unattached text for your sql text group?<br />

looks like you lost the texts in company-000 in the tables-tttxt001, 002, 003, 004 and the actual text is stored in tttxt010.<br />
<br />
You might have to get the old texts/restore the environment to find them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 23:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help.  I've found the texts in 000 and am going through the tedious process of &quot;reattaching&quot; them to the queries.  Still would like to know how it happened but for now just glad I don't have to do them over from memory.<br />
