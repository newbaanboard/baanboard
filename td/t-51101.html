I'm trying to create a SQL query for Microsoft Access to calculate Summarized Explosion for the BOM (tibom010). Does anyone want to share the code?<br />
I found the DB2 code for it but cannot convert DB2 to Access SQL. <br />
See link: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2v7luw/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2v7.doc/db2s0/bomapp.htm<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

For example, if I have 5 level BOMs stored in table tibom010, how do I find the top &quot;father&quot; for the lowest component in SQL. <br />
I know that I can print the Multi-level BOM in BaaN but would like to use SQL or Access.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">29th April 2008, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The BOM is a tree structure. Means that this kind of structure can be explored only by means of a recursive algorithm (or the simulation of it, as done in BaaN, using a stack and pushing and pulling elements in it as the tree is read in depth). <br />
I think that searching a SQL statement that can do this kind of work is like searching to squaring the circle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">batmush</div><div class="date">29th April 2008, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">If this can be done in DB2, then must be something in Access or SQL. <br />
I did it in Crystal reports by replicating tibom010 8 times but it's very slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the most elegant way that I've ever seen for recursing a BOM in Baan was done by Chjagge in this  historic posting (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=22850). Maybe, just maybe, one can do the same in Oracle's PLSQL or SQLServers TSQL or Access VBA.</div></div><hr />

Thanks anyway.</div></div><hr />

Hi Mark (and others),<br />
<br />
I am building some customizations in Baan (Baan 5C) in which I need to fetch multi level BOM's for a list of manufactured items. I have to store each one of the BOM lines into a different table with some calculations on it. <br />
<br />
If I understood your post well, you have the code for that. Would you care to share your code with me? Would be great!<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Eli</div></div><hr />
