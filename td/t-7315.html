	With the help of postings on this board I was able to modify our Sales Invoices to print with the company logo (used a font) on them. It works great when they print em manually using a Windows Printer.<br />
<br />
	But, now we would like to change the job which prints these invoices to print with the logo. So, I changed the printer device to windows printer. When the job is started manually by using session Activate job (ttaad5203m000) everything works fine but, when we run the jobs In queue using the job daemon, the jobs just stays at Running status and report just hang. They show up as premature in device queues.<br />
<br />
	Any ideas what might be happening?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />

Setup a job scheduling software on the Baan server - there are free ones out there to kick off the job. That way there is a BW instance and an associated BWPrint<br />
<br />
Baan on Unix:<br />
There is no active BW. So setup a pc with Baan client on it. Follow up with instructions for Baan on NT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have BW client on my PC. Is it possible to use windows standard Scheduled Tasks feature to accomplish this? You mentioned something about free job scheduling software. Do you happen to know any such software?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

But I have heard that yes it is possible to use Windows Scheduling. You will probably get better response in the Tools Administration forum for this one.<br />
<br />
As for the free scheduling look on any download sites. I do not readily have a software in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carice</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Because your speaking about an external job program. <br />
I heard that an external job program won't work if you are using worktop and/or webtop. So watch out if you are thinking to update and if your are using an external job program. Has anybody also that experience or know the answer.?</div></div><hr />
