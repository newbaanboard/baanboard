<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I've still to get to grips with output expressions and I'm stuck at the moment trying to understand some layouts on the Packing Slip (tdsls4403)<br />
<br />
Could somebody please give me a high level explantion as to how output expressions are used in report layouts. Could you also explain what the following output expressions mean?<br />
<br />
1. line = 0 and not stand.desc<br />
<br />
2. lattr.break and tdsls040.txta<br />
<br />
3. line = 1 and tdsls000.erdc.4 = tcyesno.yes and not isspace(tdsls041.revi)<br />
<br />
I've checked through what Baan documentation I have but as usual it's not too helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The output expression is evaluated at runtime and is either true or false.  If true the layout is printed, if false the layout is skipped.  You probably already know this.  As for the expressions:<br />
<br />
1. line = 0 and not stand.desc<br />
<br />
If the line is 0 and stand.desc is false(0) then print this layout. <br />
<br />
2. lattr.break and tdsls040.txta<br />
<br />
This means if lattr.break  is true and tdsls040.txta is true print the layout.  Lattr.break is set when the sort fields change and tdsls040.txta will be true when there is a text number or not 0.<br />
<br />
3. line = 1 and tdsls000.erdc.4 = tcyesno.yes and not isspace(tdsls041.revi)<br />
<br />
This layout will print if the line = 1 and the revision contains some characters and the tdsls000.erdc.4 (looks like a sls parameter) is set to yes.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this helps or answers your question.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Just one more question with regards to your explanation of the expressions. When you say 'If the line is 0......' or 'If the line = 1' what does the 0 and 1 denote? 0, 1 what?:confused:<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

I glance at the report and line is one of the input fields to the report, so this tells me it comes from the script. Since we do not own source and we do not use the SLS module I really do not know what line represents.  A wild guess would be that it would represent the line that would be printing for the packing slip - but it is only a guess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never really seen any documentation for 'line', but it seems to be used a lot in standard Baan reports (especially for detail layouts).  Here is how I believe the value of line is generally interpreted:<br />
<br />
 0: This generally seems to be used for text and/or descriptions<br />
 1: This seems to indicate what I would think of as major (usually main table) detail information.  For example, in printing sales orders, this could include the item number, quantity, price, line number, etc.<br />
 2+: Other data (could be from related tables)<br />
 <br />
This is just my view of things.  Perhaps someone else has more formal definitions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I went out and checked the print po session which uses line on the report.  In this case it uses line like BOM data use k.of.data.  If line=1 then you have like item purchasing data(use layout 5), line=99 then you have sub-contracting data(use sub-contracting layout).  So it appears to follow what evesely said.<br />
<br />
Anyway without the source code it is hard to say exactly how they are using it, but I would suspect like evesely pointed out. <br />

Learned something new today, maybe they will let me leave early.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
line = 0, 1 or 2, and similarly k.of.data are both arbitrary (sp?) variables declared external in the program script and shared as a report input field.  The values are set in the program script before the send report command and used to control what type of data is being sent to the report, so that the proper detail layout can be printed for them.<br />
<br />
line and k.of.data are just the 2 most commonly used variables for this trick, but any variable name can be used.  Ed's explanation is the 'standard' application.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I now have a better understanding on how print expressions are used.<br />
<br />
Have a good Thanks Giving!<br />
