<br />
At the time of doing customizations many of times it happens that we need to provide zoom to standard sessions. By default the New Button is also active in zoom session.<br />
Is there any way to block the New Button for that zoom session to have a better control.<br />
<br />

You can import the session code of the calling session in the before.program section of the called session and there in you can disable the command add.set if the session code of the calling program matches with the session code of the program for which you want to disable.<br />

Probably I was not able to put the requirement clearly. Please consider this<br />
<br />
Say we have developed a customized session to maintain Customer Details. In this one field to be maintained is Sales Price List. Here we have provided zoom to session tcmcs0134m000 (Price Lists). By default in Zoom Session &quot;New&quot; button is coming as enabled. We want to disable this &quot;New&quot; Button.<br />
We don't have source code of tcmcs0134m000.<br />
<br />

<br />
Probably the cannot be done as its a Standard Maintain Session. As There is no display session available, this was required.<br />
<br />
The other alternate is that we need to design Customised Zoom Sessions, but we were trying to avoid the same.<br />

Then all I had to do was to go into the copied form - turn off all the options I did not want the user to see or have.  This included making some fields display only on the form.  It was not a lot of work.  Yes we ended up with a maintain and a customized version, but it solved our problem at the time.</div></div><hr />

If that be the case , u can zoom to standard tcmcs0534m000 instead of tcmcs0134m000 .</div></div><hr />
