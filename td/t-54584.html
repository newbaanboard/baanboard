<br />
Can any one please give me information related to the input field Standard Script my query is as follow:<br />
<br />
If I am keeping this field as no then i have to specify the name of program Script, but if i am keeping this field as Type1/2/3 with main table or Type 4 without main table then the system should use the standard script.<br />
<br />
But How can i know which standard script the system is going to pick. e.g: i am assining the main table as tccom001 or NIL(when Type 4 without main table).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

You have to choose according to the session that you are creating. What kind of a session are you creating? What should it do?<br />

 Just for the knowledge i asked that question, I was creating a session with my table tctst001 as a main table by keeping standard script field as type 1/2/3 with main table. In form i am taking some table field and starting the session, then the system is not giving me the fatal error. But if i am assigning some form field then system is giving fatal : the form field is not defined. <br />
<br />
Then my question was that if i dont have known script then how can i declare that field.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Whenever you are creating a new session it is always advisable to keep the standard script option to &quot;No&quot; and specify the new program script.<br />
The New Program Script Type can be type 1/2/3 with main table, type 4 without main table or 3gl.<br />
<br />
Type 1/2/3 with main table scripts are used for maintain and display session which has main table assigned to it, type 4 without main table used for processing or print sessions and 3gl is used to program non event oriented sessions.<br />
<br />
Hope this info helps..</div></div><hr />
