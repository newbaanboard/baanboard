<br />
I have customized a report... Here i don't have the UI script but i have report script.... Whenever i print the detail.1 layout, each record in the detail layout are printed single record for each new pages...<br />
<br />
But i want to print all records in the same page... My report script as follows...<br />
<br />
after.receive.data:<br />
if pos(tisfc001.pdno,str) then<br />
tisfc001.pdno=&quot; &quot;<br />
else<br />
str =tisfc001.pdno<br />
endif<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	bcode = trim$(tisfc001.pdno &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; str$(tisfc010.opno))<br />
<br />
Note : mentioned the condition &quot;not isspace(tisfc001.pdno)&quot; as a output expression in detail 1 in order to avoid the duplicate records...<br />
<br />
Can anybody please advise how to print all records in the same page....<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...<br />

That is what I would first look for in 4c4. With this checked it would start a new page each time the layout is hit.</div></div><hr />

Thanks so much for your response.... As you told i'm not checking the &quot;New Page&quot; check box in the report layout as shown in the attachment... So how each record is printed in a new page...?<br />
<br />
Suppose if i click the &quot;New Page&quot; checkbox on the script layout then only we can  get each records in a new page... But i'm not selecting this &quot;New Page&quot; checkbox.... <br />
<br />
Actually i copied an existing report and also create a new one... i have customized in the new report. We can get each record for individual pages in the old existing report also... Similarly i get the same in my current report.... I think there is any logic is implemented in the UI script in order to print each record in the individual page...?<br />
<br />
At the same time, i don't have t UI script for checking this... Hence can you please suggest is there any other option for getting all records in one page instead of individual page....?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...<br />

Check the Page length for the report and also check the length of your Detail.1 and see if its not covering the entire page.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Page length of report is -1... I'm not able to change... and the row length of detail.1 is 2... So how can i get all records in one page by changing this arguments...<br />
<br />
Please suggest your valuable idea....<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

My first thought was run it where you only get 2 records and put the report in debug mode to see what is happening.  I don't know enough about LN to know if there is something else that could cause this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you told, detail layout contains Barcode... But i'm able to print multiple records as per my requirement by using some programming logic in my report script... So the output is fine now...<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your valuable guidance Mark....<br />
