<br />
I have developed few session, reports and libraries in the development environment. All these components are in a new package named by me as &quot;ais&quot;. Now I want to copy all these components into the live environment with the new package &quot;ais&quot;, I mean the new package should be created in the live environment and all components copy in that package. <br />
<br />
Can I used that &quot;Copy Software components procedure&quot; methods using the session &quot;ttaadv6265m000&quot;. Any precaution ?<br />
<br />
If some other way is better and risk free then please let me know. Actually I am doing this &quot;development to live&quot; process very first time, and I dont want to take any risk.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
we use the session ttiex4500m000 to created patches for the live environment. With this session you create a patch which you can import using the session ttiex1284m000 on the live system.<br />
<br />
The new module you created on test you have to create manually on the live system though.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
I dont want to use that internal Import/Export session. If I want to use that &quot;Copy Software component&quot; to copy the components from one test VRC to live VRC, both test and live VRC (environments) are on the same machine, will it be active and working in the live environment?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
This is very simple, <br />
<br />
1) First u open that session which u want copy one VRC to another VRC. <br />
<br />
2) Then go to SPECIAL and use CHANGE CURRENT VRC FOR USERS and change that one to a target VRC.<br />
<br />
3) Just simply press copy button, you will find the VRC automatically change to the target vrc<br />
<br />
4) Doing above activity for session you have to do Program script, report and form first.<br />
<br />
Till u face any problem u can talk help from me on yahoo messenger<br />

 <br />
I think in this way it will change the Pakage VRC to another package VRC of the actual session, but not make a copy in the target Pakage VRC. <br />
I want to keep the original session in the development VRC and make a copy available in the package VRC for live. Am I right or it will create a copy of the original session in the target VRC ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I have 2 questions:<br />
1. I tried that &quot;copy component procedure&quot; to copy components form my test/development VRC to the live VRC. its copied succesfully, but I am getting error while compiling the scripts. The error is <br />
<br />
&quot;can't read dd for tabel &lt;Table_Name&gt;&quot;. <br />
What could be the reson?<br />
<br />
2. Is there any special consideration for the user who should perform this copy process or any user who has &quot;Supper User&quot; rights can perform this process?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
