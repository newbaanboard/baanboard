<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sant123</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 04:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a problem using the activate() and switch.to.process() functions to switch between parent and a child process.<br />
<br />
I am trying to combine a single occ (form Type 1) session Maintain Item Master and a Multi occ + view (form type 3) session Display Alt Supplier by Item). The main thing is both the sessions have different main tables.<br />
<br />
Its not working for me, the child session is not getting displayed at all. its displaying when I am in the debugger, once the swith.to.process(parent) is executed in the child process the child session is lost.<br />
<br />
Any one done this type of thing, please help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have source, if you do look at maintain sales order lines - it's the best example; if not let me know and I'll help you put it together, I have written a program like this before, unfortunately I was not clever enough to keep a copy of the software when I left that client  :(  <br />
<br />
By the way only one of the two session can be active (parent) the other one will just be a display session that will accept commands from the parent like &quot;next.set&quot;, &quot;prev.set&quot;, etc ... that's the only method that I've used.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sant123</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 22:34</div></div><div class="posttext">This works if the child session is ON TOP of the parent session using sattr.combined = COMBINED.TOP in child session and sattr.combined = COMBINED.BOTTOM in the parent session, but I cannot get it to work the other way around, and all the baan sessions are like child on TOP of the Parent, how do I reverse it.<br />

Appreciate any help, Tools Gurus.<br />
