<br />
I want the customer to be able to define whether a record is void and beleive a tick box is the easiest way.  Is there a domain or if not how do I go about creating a new one?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

In IVc4, use ttgfd4120m000 (4520 in Baan V).  It looks like domain ttyeno in both cases is a yes/no check box.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">7th January 2002, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I never really tried ttyeno.  I also show tgyenox as yes/no with a check box.  I would think that a tg domain should allow integration.<br />
<br />
If that fails, you just might want to add your own tc domain (e.g., tcyn.chk), add it in the session I mentioned, and then run Convert Runtime Data Dictionary.  Then once you exited and re-entered Baan, you should be able to use it at will.  Of course you could pick an existing domain like tcyesno, but that might have unwanted consequences -- I would not suggest that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As records are added I want the record to have an automatic, sequential number allocated.<br />
<br />
