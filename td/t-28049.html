  I know this topic has been mentioned before and solutions given but, in all those solutions there were program script changes which some of us dont have access to because of license issue. So then the question would be, is there any way to find out the &quot;Page x of y&quot; in a baan report with only the report script at your disposal? <br />
To make myself clear again, without the program script(session based) manipulation, is there any way to find out the &quot;Page x of y&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is the current page number and &quot;y&quot; is the total number of pages, in Baan? <br />
<br />
It would be great if any of you who has tackled this issue share with us what was done to achieve this feature which till now..post SP19.. havent been made available by Baan...<br />

I really do not recommend this, but what you do in the report script is count how many detail items or lines to be printed.  So you have to get the page length, count the detail lines, footers, before.fields, after.fields.  You have to figure out how many each get printed.  Then total the number of lines - then take this and figure out how many pages are going to be printed.  If it is a simple report then it would not be that hard - but for something like purchase orders it is just about impossible.  <br />
<br />
We use this at our site for purchase orders, but because of all the text it is not 100% correct.  I could never figure out all of the ways text could skip to the next page.  I really do not recommend this solution.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">3rd September 2006, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Mark,<br />
    Looks like we are in the same boat as my requirement too is for the Purchase Orders. What i was looking on to do was to find out whats my spool.pg.length and then divide the total of this variable by the the length of one page<br />
Roughly.. <br />
Total pages = sum(spool.pg.length)/ spool.pg.length<br />
<br />
Since the length is going to be uniform through out, finding the total and dividing it by one pagelength should provide the desired result.<br />
Now assuming this works, the problem i have is which section do i put it in and is there a function which finds the total of a variable? Sum gives me a compilation error..<br />
Now again assuming both the above problems have been solved, how do i make it appear on all the pages. My hunch is that, based on what i seen how this report works, its going to come only in the last page. So how do i overcome that? <br />
<br />
Another variable that took my attention was the lattr.enddata which results in 1 when it reaches the last page and a 0 on all the previous pages. I tried putting it in a while loop inside a function but then it went on an eternal loop and i had to terminate the bshell. Here again i didnt know where to call this function from...<br />
<br />
So any helpfull suggestions from you would be highly appreciated. Above all, do you think the two ways i suggested here will work at all?<br />
