<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrMarco</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">A very strange problem has occured which I haven't come across before:<br />
<br />
I am attempting to compile a program script in debug. It compiles fine, but when the program is run, it runs whichout debug i.e. as normal.<br />
<br />
There are no other instances of the session running.<br />
<br />
The script has statements in the before.program section, so it has the opportunity to &quot;get into debug&quot;, as it were.<br />
<br />
I looked in the application directory and there are two files dated correctly: one with an &quot;o&quot; prefix and one with a &quot;u&quot; prefix.<br />
<br />
I have attempted to compile other existing programs in debug, but with the same puzzling result.<br />
<br />
Has anyone any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me guess, you use a NT server<br />
The NT OS does not refresh its cached objects when they are refreshed on disk. You should log off from Baan to get a new session object from disk. Restart shared memory might help if that does not work (then the object is in Baan's shared mem). Remember that also NT is caching its (frequently used) files.<br />
<br />
Last but not least ... you do not have the -- -nodebug option set?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrMarco</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, no. We don't use an NT server here, which is particularly puzzling!<br />
<br />
I have logged out and even taken the system down and restarted Baan. Still the same problem.<br />
<br />
I have checked, and I do not have the -nodebug option set in the user profile. Still completely stuffed!<br />
<br />
I am sitting here loading cartriges into my shotgun. I don't know whether to shoot the computer or myself!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case, there can be only one solution.<br />
That is the one of which you will say &quot;Stupid me, I should have thought of that!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you test it in a package combination that does not have the current developers VRC in its derivation structure, the newer compiled object will never be used.<br />
<br />
If you compile in the TEST_001 vrc (actually the Own VRC of the TEST_001 package combination), but you test in the OPER_001, you will never see the debugger come up.<br />
<br />
Check the output of &quot;ls -l `explode6.1 o[objectcode]`&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">14th June 2002, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had a similar problem ... the other way round. After compiling with the debugger, it was not possible to remove it again.<br />
<br />
At that time I did the following:<br />
                  <br />
- copie the script to an other name<br />
- compile it without debugger (helps nothing, but I did it!)<br />
- delete the original<br />
- copy the other script to the original name and compile it <br />
- and things went well again<br />
<br />
there should be another posibility:<br />
- delete the object, and compile again<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />

<br />
I want to add:<br />
You can check whether the object is in debug or not by reading the compilation flag shown in &quot;bic_info6.1 -h o[objectcode]&quot;<br />
<br />
if your current object is in debug, you can see the debug flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi NS,<br />
<br />
I couldnt find the Debug display session ? Can you please clarify me?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Other options to verify -<br />
<br />
1. $BSE/bin/bic_info[version code] -f o[script code]<br />
<br />
The output would be like -<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;bic_info6.2 -f ozmadmtest<br />
<br />
---------------------------OBJECT FLAGS---------------------------------<br />
object_flags    = 2=DEBUG<br />
[DEV:nprao]/app/baan/bse/bin<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
It indicates if the object is in debug or not.<br />
<br />
2. Please check the VRC structure as well as your current VRC as per Omeluuk suggestion. If you are doing parallel development on different VRC that can be an issue.</div></div><hr />

       There is no Debug display session rather its an option in the following session.<br />
              User Management<br />
                    Default Settings<br />
                          Maintain User Settings<br />
<br />
In session Maintain User Settings, there is a field Display Debug which needs to be set to yes in order to see the debug screen in a separate window.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I dont know which BaaN Version you are working on...<br />
<br />
We are on the BaaN5.2 and I couldnt find the option you referred to.</div></div><hr />

      Sorry, I should have mentioned the version before. We are using Baan IV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrMarco</div><div class="date">17th June 2002, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have tried all of the suggestions here. Everything seems to be set up correctly. The only problem was an error message when I attempt to use bic_info, as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
bshell6.1&gt; ls -l oxxx9100<br />
-rwxrwxrwx   1 bsp   bsp   71582   Jun 17 08:12 oxxx9100<br />
bshell6.1&gt; lic_info6.1 -h oxxx9100<br />
oxxx9100: Error 0<br />
oxxx9100: Fatal Error: Can't open object 'oxxx9100' for reading<br />
<br />
  1 ERROR    REPORTED<br />
<br />
bshell6.1&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
This also happens when I use the -h option.<br />
<br />
I cannot compile ANY programs at all in debug, whereas I had no problem doing this a few days ago. It would seem to suggest a global setting has been changed, but all seems fine.<br />
<br />
The suggestions so far have been great, and they are much appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">17th June 2002, 13:53</div></div><div class="posttext">You should use bic_info6.1 like<br />
bic_info6.1 -h oppmmmnnnn<br />
so you should also add the package code here.<br />
o = for object<br />
pp = code of package (like td or ti)<br />
mmm = code of module (like ilc or pcs)<br />
nnnn = number of object (like 4113 or 5201)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrMarco</div><div class="date">17th June 2002, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that! I now have a response. The relevant bit is:<br />
<br />
object_flags   = 2=DEBUG  8=DLL<br />
<br />
So it looks like the debugger is being added to the object, but when I run it, it STILL does not go into debug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">17th June 2002, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Now try this:<br />
ba6.1 -- -dbgfdev -keeplog -logfile WhyNoDebug &lt;Session to run&gt;<br />
where &lt;Session to run&gt; should be some code like<br />
tiitm0101m000<br />
or<br />
tdpur4401m000<br />
so<br />
ppmmmnnnnlooo<br />
where pp mmm and nnnn are like above, but l = m for main session and ooo stands for 000 ;)<br />
<br />
Now in the file WhyNoDebug you can find all loggings of the file actions inclusive paths that are used to retrieve the objects from.<br />
Compare the object paths given for your object and the output of bic_info6.1 -a oppmmmnnnn | head<br />
(one of the first lines should give the object path, this path should also be used when the session is run).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th June 2002, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) Any new tools patches installed?<br />
<br />
(2) Does explode6.1 point to the same object that you did the bic_info on?<br />
<br />
You can try create runtime data dictionary(ttadv5210m000)  on the session.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
<br />
Mark<br />
<br />
(Ooops forgot to add you may have to log off and back on to the system to get the new data dictionary)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">17th June 2002, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a truly wild stab at this if none of the other suggestions work.  It could be the compiler, has anyone there ever compiled in debug ??? if not then it could be the compiler:<br />
<br />
type this to get the last fix date for bic6.1<br />
<br />
<br />
what `explode6.1 bic6.1' &gt; file.out<br />
<br />
or go to $BSE/bin and type what bic6.1 &gt; file.out<br />
<br />
look at the very first line in the file.out file, it will give you the date of the latest fix.<br />
<br />
I am on BaanIVb2 and the bic6.1 is from Aug 1999<br />
<br />
Is youre's older ?? if so see if any solutions  are availble from baan.</div></div><hr />
