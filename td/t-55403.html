<br />
We are working with UNIX (sun OS 5.9) and baanIV SP5. <br />
I used file.mv to move files between an initial location and a back-up location.<br />
The two libraries are with permissions drwxrwxrwx  owner and group is bsp.<br />
The files created have the following permissions -rw-r----- userA group_bsp.<br />
<br />
if I use userB, I can at unix level execute the command <br />
&quot;mv /pathA/fileA /pathB/filea&quot; The file is then moved in pathB with permissions, owner and group same as original &quot;-rw-r----- userA group_bsp&quot;<br />
<br />
In the Baan script, executed with same userB, the Baan command file.mv fails (return code = -1 and e =13  this identify a permission problem).:mad:   <br />
<br />
If I execute in the Baan script the shell command<br />
shell(&quot;mv patha/filea /pathb/filea&quot; SHELL_BACKGROUND)  if works succesfully.<br />
<br />
Seems that file.mv is more restrictive than  the unix command &quot;mv&quot; :D<br />
<br />
Any idea why this occurs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">19th March 2009, 09:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to tell you a bit move about the unix mv command. First question: Are the files or directories on the same filesystem? <br />
* If no, then the file is copied first, and then the original is removed. Example: as root, create a file test in /var; permission 666. <br />
Then try mv /var/test /tmp; you will get a file /tmp/test, and the error message &quot;mv: /var/test: cannot unlink: Permission denied&quot;,<br />
because /var is not writable by normal users. <br />
* If yes, then it's what the we normally expect.<br />
 <br />
I don't know exactly how file.mv() is implemented, but I think that it's not a shell(&quot;mv ...&quot;) mostly because of the huge overhead of shell(). So I made a simple test program:<br />
 <br />
<br />
function test.file.mv()<br />
{<br />
long ts, te, rc<br />
 <br />
| just a huge file<br />
file.cp(&quot;/stand/vmunix&quot;, &quot;/tmp/vmunix&quot;)<br />
 <br />
ts = time.num() <br />
rc = file.mv(&quot;/tmp/vmunix&quot;, &quot;/tmp/vmunix.new&quot;)<br />
te = time.num() <br />
 <br />
message(&quot;rc=%d time=%d&quot;, rc, te-ts)<br />
}<br />
<br />
 <br />
On my system, this &quot;move&quot; takes 5 seconds, so i guess its a copy/unlink!<br />
 <br />
And last but not least, whenever a file gets created, check the umask settings of that user, e.g umask 7 gives rw-rw----, but umask 0 gives rw-rw-rw- and so on.<br />

<br />
Both libraries are on the same file system.<br />
I had already looked to the umask of the userA (who created the file, umask = 022) but the system administrator  doesn't want to change it and I must work with this.<br />
<br />
I have a work around  using the shell command but for portability reasons I use file.mv or any file.* command and I try to avoid shell commands.<br />
<br />
My first tests didn't give any problem with file.mv, ( i used the same user) but integration testing showed this difference.:D<br />
<br />
Hope this can help somebody.<br />
