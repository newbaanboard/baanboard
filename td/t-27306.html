<br />
         I'm trying to find a way to print four copies of a Sales Invoice (one each for Customer,Accounting, File...) and loop through 4 corresponding footer layouts (also one each for Customer,Accounting, File...). <br />
<br />
I do not have access to the source program script, only the report script. I was trying to set a print condition for each footer layout but am unable to find a way to set up a counter variable to cycle through 4 copies of the same invoice, choosing the right footer along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th June 2006, 21:29</div></div><div class="posttext">One solution is to write you own AFS session to call the program.  What I do purchase orders is to provide a session with flags on it - file, accounting, etc.  Then I print the PO for each type the user selected.  I also have another session (cloned from print PO) that just points to a different report.  The users also call this session through an AFS program. <br />
<br />
Another solution is to create the AFS program, then export a variable for the footer you want to print.  Ex.  each footer would have a print expression sfoot=1, sfoot=2, etc.  Then you export sfoot from the AFS program and import it in the report script.  Not sure I tried this, but in theory it should work. You may have to actually control the footer being printed in the report script, but I think it should work as described.<br />
<br />
I am sure there are other solutions, but this is how I typically control sessions where the users need to always generate mutliple reports without actually running the session twice and printing both reports.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
maybe this way will work.<br />
Set No. of copies to 4 in &quot;maintain ordersteps for tdsls4404&quot;.<br />
Create 4 different footers.<br />
Set the printcondition to the footers.<br />
E.g.<br />
Footer 1 if no of copies = 1<br />
Footer 2 if no of copies = 2 a.s.o.<br />
<br />

<br />
      Looks like I'll need to delve into some AFS, would be nice to have a global copies.printed variable instead.<br />
<br />

      That would print four copies of the selected footer, not four copies each with a different footer (what I need).</div></div><hr />
