<br />
is there a way to delete a report rule already used in document type? If i try to delete from ttrpi220 from ttaad4100 i get fatal error 605, while if i try from session it gaves me a stop message that is impossible to delete because the record is used in another table..<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

Not sure I would recommend this, but we have done it just a few times.  You have to find the references to a table where you are trying to delete the record - then go to them and delete those records first.  One session we used just a few times is ttaad4229m000 Print References to parent.  Not sure if that or something else like it in LN exists.  Before doing that I would just make sure that it will not cause any issues down the line.</div></div><hr />

If you can't purge the Batches, the only way is to set a condition on the Report Rule that it will never apply (e.g. &quot;return(false)&quot;).</div></div><hr />
