<br />
I have been trying to execute the ntbshell from a bat file which one run a 3GL program creating a text file in the tmp directory. The proceso locks that runs without problems but if look for the file in the tmp directory I do not find it.<br />
<br />
I looked in to the forum and find some threads about it,  but in my case the bat file does not work.<br />
<br />
The bat file is attach.<br />
<br />
If somebody could help me to identify which is the error, please<br />
<br />
Thaks for your attention.<br />
