<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I've created a new table to store some orderline reference info. Key field is order/item/pono. <br />
<br />
I've created a new multi-occ session to add this reference info. It seemed to work fine, until I had more lines than would fit on one page!<br />
<br />
eg. if I can see 10 order lines, I add info for first 9 with no problems. When I get to line 10 and press TAB, I get error<br />
index 11 of of dims [1] 10<br />
<br />
I presume this is something to do with moving to line 11, I've run in debug and checked _index1 values in use to make sure they do not have some crazy value - but they check out OK.  I also check the domains used in the table and they seem OK.<br />
<br />
I guess there could be 2 solutions; 1 is to stop Baan moving to line 11 and just cycle to line 1 again.  2 is to make it work properly with no error!<br />
<br />
I've not come across this problem before - any ideas<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

Index out Dims: How to diagnose and correct. <br />

Symptom information<br />
Index out of dims <br />
 <br />
Solution description <br />
VERSION(S):<br />
All Versions<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
When processing data in Baan, a BW error box appears giving the index out of dims message (as example):<br />
<br />
Fatal Error : Index out of Dims<br />
Can not continue in &lt;session code or object&gt;<br />
<br />
ATTACHMENTS:<br />
n/a<br />
<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Index out of dims is generally caused by an overflow of table field(s). In the database table array, there are no open addresses availble. This may be caused by a imported change to a table via patch, or by a data overflow situation.<br />
<br />
Most times, this issue is corrected by loading the latest object(s) for the session in error.<br />
<br />
- In order to identify the object with error , please create &quot;dbgobj&quot; output and check the output while the error is being displayed on the screen. The last object in the file would be giving this error. <br />
EXAMPLE(S):<br />
Here is an example case of index out of dims:<br />
long myvar[10] <br />
<br />
myvar[11]=5 =&gt;&gt; this gives an index out of dims since 11&gt;10<br />
myvar[0]=5 =&gt;&gt; also gives an error since Baan arrays always begin at 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
WORK-AROUND:<br />
If the problem occurs after a new object is installed on the system, you will need to re-introduce the older object so that the process can continue (if possible).</div></div><hr />
