<br />
While executing the session the table is inserted or updated and at end the table is cleared using &quot;db.clear.table&quot;<br />
<br />
A lock is created on the table while running the session and is not removed. <br />
<br />
I created another table with same structure as i was unable to remove the lock on the table.<br />
<br />
But even after creating a new table the problem persist.<br />
<br />
Can anybody suggest any changes in the script attached  ????</div></div><hr />
