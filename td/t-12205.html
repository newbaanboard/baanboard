<br />
I am about to print barcode through BW client. We are on BaaN IV C4.<br />
<br />
I am referring quick guide QG1310 for this. But I am not getting where this type01, type02 are located. In $bse\lib\barcode  i didn't find this directory in my client. I have tested Barcode test print from Help menu. It works fine. <br />
<br />
Can someone tell me what steps I have to take to print the barcode.<br />

<br />
Since you'll be printing through Windows, you can forget about the whole thing in the Quick Guide, as it is targeted for those with Baan residing on Unix. Simply filled in the barcode type number in the properties of the field you'd like to print. You might want to try filling it with 1, 2, 3, and so on and see which one can be picked up by your gun. Depending on the content of the field, some barcode type will work and some won't. If the field contains integer, then most of the barcode type will work (and print out). If the field is alphanumeric, however, only some will work (if I'm not mistaken type 10, for example, will work for alphanumeric, but I can't recall exactly. I don't have a Baan system in front of me now)<br />

I have removed everything &amp; tried in the way you suggested. But in print preview of report it is showing +#&amp; and the value of tccom001.emno (i.e.110000) instead of Barcode. Will you tell me what I missed out. <br />

<br />
For that particular report field, make sure that the field only contains tccom001.emno and nothing else (e.g. do not use &quot;+#&quot;&amp;tccom001.emno). After that, fill in the barcode type property of the field with 1. Compile the report. If it doesn't work, change the barcode type to 2, and so on until it works. That's as simple as it is when I used it<br />
<br />
I also just remembered that when I was using barcode printing in B4, upgrading the BW to certain version prevented the barcode from printing. What I had to do then was to downgrade the BW to the previous version. So, you have to make sure that barcode printing works for your particular version of BW (or BWPRINT to be exact). You can find that out from Baan Support<br />

<br />
Thanks for your valuable comments. I got it yesterday. But funny thing is that I upgraded my client &amp; gone through barcode type 1, 2, to 28 &amp; then got success. It's very easy only thing I was not aware of that. <br />
<br />
Anyway now I am trying to integrate Barcode with BaaN. I had gone through documentation of function servers &amp; DDCs but really can't understand from where to start &amp; how to start. Can you tell me the steps for that. Take the &quot;Mainten Receipts Session&quot; for that.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

I've done a barcode integration before. Unfortunately, none of my barcode integration implementation used DDC. We usually used 3rd party middleware and connect it to Baan using its API or other methods.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to know more about using DDC for your barcode project, you may ask the moderator of this Tools Development forum to move this discussion thread of yours to the AFS/DDC forum. There's a lot of experts there on DDC :)<br />

<br />
your input gave a good lead.<br />
<br />
i went one step further.<br />
<br />
1) check in BWPRINT help topics, Barcode Types, you have to use a type of barcode from this<br />
<br />
2) in the report layout field,<br />
<br />
you have to concatenate check sum and check digits as follows:<br />
<br />
strip$(rv.barcode) &amp; &quot;, checksum=FALSE, checkdigit=FALSE&quot;<br />
<br />
barcode = 2<br />
<br />
this is for printing EAN8 barcodes<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

I am facing same problem which Mohan faced. Already I have performed all the suggested steps. Now I am able to print BarCode but after scanning BarCode through gun, automatically some raw characters added before the data i.e. &quot;]C1&quot; (Bracket C one). Please suggest something.<br />

To use Barcode with bwprint, see attached dokument.<br />
I've written a function to build barcode in winBaaN.<br />
I think the problem is in different length of datafield information.<br />
e.G.<br />
supplier no is 999999 o.k.<br />
supplier no is   99999 the field is to short.</div></div><hr />
