<br />
Now I have the following prob: Im searching the location, where a value is assigned to a var. The easiest way to do that is, IMHO to use the debugger. But there are a big number of DLL's which call other DLL's from which we don't have the sources. Hard to decide, which source I need.<br />
<br />
Is there only this way: Bay one source, if its no the right one, buy the next, until you get the right on?<br />
<br />
Or is there a possiblity to say to Baan: &quot;Hey, I need the source for THIS or THAT problem?<br />

I will maybe pursue this as we can not afford the $$ Baan wants for the complete sources.</div></div><hr />

We are in the same boat as you (can afforded the complete source package).  If you are sucessful in buying specific source <br />
code, please let us (or everyone) know how to go about this.<br />
<br />
It would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried to put the main code in debugger (assuming the variable is declared &amp;/or used in the same) and then may be if you put the trace on the variable, at each point of change in value it will stop and at the top of the line normally it should give the source code number in which the value is changed.<br />
