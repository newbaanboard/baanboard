<br />
We're trying to use two consecutives &quot;switch.to.company&quot; instances for update regs of different corrects companies. But second &quot;switch.to.company&quot; instance doesn't work!!!.<br />
we known &quot;tccom950._compnr = 302&quot; instance but what happen if we use standard dll with unknowns table updates???<br />
<br />
Note: Is runing on b40c4,  SP 19.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
	ret = switch.to.company(301)<br />
	db.retry.point()<br />
             select	tccom950.*<br />
	from	tccom950 for update<br />
	where	tccom950._index1 = {:tccom950.orno}<br />
	selectempty<br />
		db.insert(ttccom950,db.retry)<br />
		commit.transaction()<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
	ret = switch.to.company(302)<br />
             db.retry.point()<br />
	select	tccom950.*<br />
	from	tccom950 for update<br />
	where	tccom950._index1 = {:tccom950.orno}<br />
	selectempty<br />
		db.insert(ttccom950,db.retry)<br />
		commit.transaction()<br />
	endselect</div></div><hr />

<br />
We understand your answers, but we use super users with permissions for all companies and that companies are CORRECTS at all (same vrc, ...). In fact the second &quot;switch.to.company&quot; function returns &quot;1&quot;, as first one, However there is no real change of company, second update is made in first company (301).<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot indeed, we&#8217;re waiting for your great solutions.<br />
<br />
Bye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th January 2006, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">For grins and giggles add   &quot;tccom950._compnr = 302&quot; before the second insert.  You might want to do this for the first insert also. OH - does the second select find records in company 302?  If so I think this will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ignalf</div><div class="date">19th January 2006, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi people!!<br />
<br />
We know this solution &#8220;tccom950._compnr = 302&#8221; if we need to insert a record. Also is not necessary if we need update a record (second select find records in company 302 without that sentence). But the great problem is if we use, inside the &#8220;selectempty&#8221; of second select, a standard &#8220;dll&#8221; with insertions of UNKNOWNS tables. We will have to change all the &#8220;dll&#8217;s&#8221; tree, coding &#8220;ppmmxxx._compnr = var.comp&#8221;. This is not logical at all.<br />
<br />
We are thinking that is not working at all &#8220;swith.to.company&#8221; function, because the first one work perfectly also with &#8220;selectempty&#8221; (tccom950._compnr = -1) taking company 301, but the second one, inside of &#8220;selectempty&#8221;, the status is &#8220;tccom950._cmpnr = 301&#8221; SURPRISING!!!!!!<br />
<br />
We are in contact, regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th January 2006, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">My apologies - I understood that you knew about it, but I did see where you stated that when you did the second insert the _compnr was still 301.  I think what you will need to do is spawn a separate process for each of the companies you want to update.  Something you know that will not share record buffers, which is what is causing the problem.  You could use a 3gl script, a sub-session, or even launch background batch jobs.  Without know exactly what the DLL's do that you are planning to call then it makes it difficult to make suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 06:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes , What  u observed is a noted and known phenomena . It's discussed earlier on this forum. I think it's the way database driver determines company when ppmmmfff._compnr = -1 . It relates it to the user startup company unless otherwise specified by a separate statement.So the simple solution which u too know is to write ppmmmfff._compnr = company number before db.insert statement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really here, we have got old programs with sequential &#8220;switch.to.company&#8221; sentences working perfectly on B40c4  service Pack 4. However with service pack 19 doesn&#8217;t works by the cause we are discussing. <br />
First of all we are locking for a solution without a massive recode of scripts. Some of then standard scripts (dlls, functions).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your fight. We are in contact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably there is something in missing in ur findings . Just a relook by yourself or  ur colleague may probably  bring  some hitherto-ignored-fact in ur comparisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked your code again . There may be some possible actions. I wonder something that in your script :tccom950.orno is external variable ? if it is external then <br />
in second loop won't run properly.Please explain your mechanism more !<br />
<br />
Good LUck !!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
SSA has informed to us to use an hidden parameter of the function &quot;switch.to.company&quot;: <br />
switch.to.company(301, true)... And!!!!! works <br />
<br />
Thank you very much really by your effort!</div></div><hr />
