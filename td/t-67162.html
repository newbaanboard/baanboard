Recently we started implementing Thin Clients in a virtual environment.  In this environment, my VB applications do not communicate with BaaN.<br />
<br />
There must be a solution for this.  Anyone familiar with this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />

<br />
There have been several discussions/threads about the incompatibility of OLE with thin client and I guess Infor doesn't have any replacements as of now. Not sure if they are going to provide one or not.<br />
<br />
Looks like this similar thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=67144) is also related to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">10th December 2014, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your courteous response.  Sounds like the solution is NOT use a thin client where these applications are used.  I don't have a lot of physical locations but it does tie my hands.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">3rd February 2015, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">It has to do with the architecture I am connecting TO using the thin client.  We are running in a virtual environment and connecting to a windows server. The administrator of the system has created images that control what we are allowed to run and the baan client is in the core image, meaning everyone sees / has access to baan.<br />
<br />
He added additional baan client configured with user name / password and named the way we call it from vb.net scripts.<br />
<br />
We are all new to this environment including our administrator and we don't know what we don't know.  Persistence helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does it work with the WebUI? i.e. LN on web-browser?<br />
<br />
By Thin Client I assumed thin client mode. Anyway, thanks for posting your solution. Will surely help someone with similar requirement.</div></div><hr />
