<br />
I'm trying to create a session/process that can start a bshell for me.<br />
<br />
I have the below scenario....<br />
I logon to Baan and start the tmboaserver or some session. This session must always be running... since other sessions depend on this tmboaserver or the FIRST session. Sometimes.. for whatever reason... the tmboaserver loses connection to bshell. Hence... the subsequent dependent sessions cannot run, coz they depend on the tmboaserver or parent session... <br />
I have to start the tmboaserver again... manually.<br />
<br />
The above bshell will always be started by the user &quot;Baan&quot;. <br />
I would like to create a process/session, which can run as a job... check if the bshell is activate. If the bshell is not active, then launch a new bshell.<br />
(the bshell will launch the tmboaserver by itself.... this i got figured out). <br />
<br />
How is it possible to know if a given bshell is active or not. <br />
Is there any other way to know, unless we compare the ticks ?<br />
Which commands would i use for the above purpose. <br />
<br />
I'm on Baan Vc.<br />
<br />
All help is appreciated. Thanks<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Little John</div></div><hr />

I am not clear about all the requirements, here are some ideas. <br />
I'm trying to create a session/process that can start a bshell for me. <br />
If you are trying to start a new &quot;bshell&quot; then you have to use the multi-bshell functionality. If you are trying to start a bshell as a subprocess then you can use $BSE/bin/bshell6.2 -server option with a 3-GL program.<br />
I logon to Baan and start the tmboaserver or some session. <br />
You start the tmboaserver in BMS Mask options, so that whenever a user logs in then it is started automatically.<br />
I have to start the tmboaserver again... manually.The above bshell will always be started by the user &quot;Baan&quot;.  <br />
Do you mean there is only one tmboaserver running for your environment or more than one ?<br />
I would like to create a process/session, which can run as a job... check if the bshell is activate. If the bshell is not active, then launch a new bshell. <br />
There are 2 options if you do the BMS way, you have to create a monitoring program to check all the process of the current user using pstat() and then finding if tmboaserver is active or not.<br />
Refer to the link - Continuous display of Baan information  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=18560#post18560) <br />
And if one tmboaserver is running for your environment then you have to create a external monitor program to check and restart if its down.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />
