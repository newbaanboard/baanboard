I have the following situation,<br />
1.- I made a physical count from a certain item in my warehouse. Suppose that this count is equal to 3.<br />
2.- The item have lots.<br />
3.- Suppose that global system stock (this is, the sum of the stock of all lots that is registered in the system for this item) is 10. This is, I have a diference between the system stock and physical count of = 10 - 3 = 7<br />
the values are: <br />
stock on lot 1 = 5<br />
stock on lot 2 = 2<br />
stock on lot 3 = 2<br />
stock on lot 4 = 1<br />
4.- Then I have to correct the stock for each lot that I have on the system starting with the higest lot (in this case lot 4) until my diference reach 0.<br />
The registers must look like this:<br />
corrected stock on lot 1 = 3<br />
corrected stock on lot 2 = 0<br />
corrected stock on lot 3 = 0<br />
corrected stock on lot 4 = 0<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">19th October 2006, 08:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Its unclear how your correction process works. Whats the maximum qty a lot is supposed to have? The example you gave was with physical count 3 and that is entirely allocated to Lot 1. Why not split Lot 1: 2 and Lot 2: 1 ?<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could ellaborate on the correction procedure?(Point 4)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th October 2006, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Well assuming you can create an array of warehouse and lots in the correct sorted order it is pretty simple to run through the records:<br />
<br />
	i = 1<br />
| You use total warehouses here. Excess will be worked off in order of<br />
| warehouses.<br />
	while i&lt;=total.warehouses and total.short&gt;0<br />
		if qty.warehouse(i) &gt;= total.short then<br />
			|Send warehouse, total.short to report<br />
			total.short = 0<br />
		else<br />
			total.short = total.short - qty.warehouse(i)<br />
			| Send warehouse, qty in warehouse to report<br />
		endif<br />
		i = i + 1<br />
	endwhile<br />
<br />
Something like this should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">19th October 2006, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the count is 3 and I can make the correction on lot 1. But by procedure of the warehouse management, we cant apply all the corrections on the oldest lot due to the cost of the article. ThatÂ´s why I have to do it partially on each lot, beggining by the most recent, in this case 4, and cancell the stock of that lot until the diference (7) is reached; and is reached on lot 1, in this particular case.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
Thanks Mark, I will some test using arrays.</div></div><hr />
