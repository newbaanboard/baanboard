<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">3rd December 2001, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">My Finance Department wants a new field placed on the supplier master to indicate whether a supplier is Critical or Non-Critical for cash disbursement purposes.  They then want to be able to use this enumerated field as selection criteria in the session Select Invoices for Payments (tfcmg1220m000).  This way they can select and pay critical suppliers within their stated payment terms and pick and choose the non-critical suppliers as they see fit.  Has anyone done this before or anything similar?  Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The select invoices session uses the payment terms code as one of the criteria. The easy way to handle is to create another payment terms code for the suppliers you want to flag as critical.<br />
<br />
Add this payment terms on the supplier master. Whenever they run the payment run, the user can select only this payment term to pay.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">4th December 2001, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I had already suggested that to them, but they wanted to keep payment terms in tact so that they could pay 'Critical' suppliers within their own individual terms (so as not to pay a vender offering 60 day terms at the same time as a vendor offering 30 day terms).  There are too many different types of payment terms to set each up individually - one for 'critical' suppliers and one for 'non-critical'.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">12th December 2001, 00:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have source code?  You'll need it for the following:<br />
<br />
1.  Add new field to supplier master for Critical (Y/N) - say tccom020.crit.  Make this a yes / no field (domain = tcyesno)<br />
2.  Add new field to Maintain Supplier form - dump the form, do not need to modify the script.<br />
3.  Modify the tfcmg1220m000 form.  Add a Choose Critical Only field (domain = tcyesno) to the form.  Call this crit.yn<br />
4.  Modify the tfcmg1220 script.  Declare the crit.yn field at the top as follows:<br />
  extern   domain tcyesno   crit.yn<br />
The main select(s) should include the supplier table already.   You may have to add the tccom020.crit field to the select clause.   Add the following lines to the where clause:<br />
    and   (crit.yn = tcyesno.no <br />
    or       tccom020.crit = tcyesno.yes)<br />
<br />
That should do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">12th December 2001, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately we do not have source code.  What I ended up doing was creating a session that removed any supplier's documents (whose supplier was marked as 'Non-Critical') out of the payment batch after it was selected.  The only tables that I had to update were deleting the records in tfcmg101 corresponding to the non-critical supplier and resetting the t$step field (in tfacp200) to null so that the document could be selected again.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion!</div></div><hr />
