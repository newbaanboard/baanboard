In other words I would like to use functionality &quot;enter specific customers - Yes/No&quot;.<br />
<br />
If YES script should record specific customers &amp; if NO script should select range of customers. <br />

I know this thread may sound absurd to anyone, as I am a functional person &amp; this is my first complicatd session.<br />

Please help me.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. <br />
<br />
Can u please help me in generating the subsession for capturing selective customers. I had a script with me for capturing specific order numbers, but that doesn't work as the data type is different for order no &amp; customer no, it is long in tcorno &amp; string in tccuno.<br />
<br />
I am attaching script for capturing specific order no's<br />
<br />
thanks for spending time for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">7th January 2003, 03:49</div></div><div class="posttext">One option is to have a session with 2 forms...<br />
<br />
On both forms have the same fields (ie: order from and order to, item from and item to, etc...). Including the option of 'Enter Specific Customers Yes/No' on both forms. Ensure all the field names are the same (otherwise it's a pain having to code for both field names, ie: orno.f and orno.t are the order ranges on both forms, as opposed to orno.f1, orno.t1 and orno.f2, orno.t2 for the fields on both forms).<br />
Anyway, on one form have only cuno.f and cuno.t (for customer range) and on the other form have as many customer fields as you need (maybe an array would be useful here....).<br />
When the user changes the value of 'Enter Specific Customers' simply interrogate this value and flick to form 1 or form 2, eg:<br />
<br />
field.spec.cuno:<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
    if spec.cuno = tcyesno.yes then<br />
        to.form(2)<br />
    else<br />
        to.form(1)<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
Then when you do your select statement, simply see which form is current to determine if you do a selection on individual customers or the range. eg:<br />
<br />
if form.curr = 1 then<br />
    do.selection.by.customer(cuno.f, cuno.t)<br />
else<br />
    for x = 1 to num.arrays<br />
        if not isspace(form.cuno(1,x)) then<br />
            do.selection.by.customer(form.cuno(1,x),form.cuno(1,x))<br />
        endif<br />
    endfor<br />
endif<br />
<br />
function do.selection.by.customer(domain tccuno from.cuno,<br />
                                                      domain tccuno to.cuno)<br />
{<br />
    select   tdsls040.*<br />
    from     tdsls040<br />
    where tdsls040._index1 inrange {:orno.f} and {:orno.t}<br />
    and     tdsls040.cuno inrange :from.cuno and :to.cuno<br />
    selectdo<br />
         | ....<br />
    endselect<br />
}<br />
<br />
Of course, if they don't put in an order range, this will cause full table searches for every entered customer. So you may want to refine the query (maybe use the 'IN' statement), but I'm sure you get the idea...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the funny faces in the index search are supposed to be colon's and the letter 'o'....</div></div><hr />
