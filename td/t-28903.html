<br />
we are writing from Baan to an NFS-Drive. We don't use special characters, just use &quot;seq.puts()&quot; with our string in found our files equipped with CRLF.<br />
Yesterday we had a crash, among others, also with that NFS-drive.<br />
Today we noticed, that our files &quot;end of lines&quot; only are only LFs.<br />
<br />
I tried unchanged Programms, which worked fine tall the time, but the output of them also contains only a LF not a CRLF as desired.<br />
<br />
Is it possible, that this has something to do with the NFS-drive?<br />
<br />
Thanks:confused:</div></div><hr />

U can use dos2unix or transfer the files in ascii mode to do conversion among these 2  different way of writing lines .</div></div><hr />

Are you directly writing on the NFS-Drive? Or are you writing it on the server then copying it?<br />
Are you adding chr$(13) manually to the end of every line?<br />

<br />
for the first: Thanks for your support!<br />
<br />
The thing is: People told me that there was a CRLF before the NFS-Drive crashed. Meanwhile I'm not so sure, that this is right, because I checked an other (productive) system, where I also only found LFs.<br />
<br />
The technique: The program writes directly to the NFS-drive, there is no copy at all. There is also no chr$(13) in the program.<br />
<br />
Because people told me there was a CRLF &lt;BEFORE THE CRASH&gt; I thought maybe it's done somehow by the NFS-Drive. <br />
Meanwhile I think my information was wrong, because in the program is no chr$(13) and NFS doesn't handle &quot;end of lines&quot;!<br />
<br />
So my conclusion is NFS couldn't cause the problem!</div></div><hr />
