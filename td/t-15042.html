<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhill5</div><div class="date">15th April 2004, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">In our environment, the users are connecting using a bwc which is set-up with a 'BaanLogin' log-in method.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it appears that using this method of access means that the Unix $LOGNAME environmental variable is set to 'root', not the log-in id of the user.  We access $LOGNAME in many places in our customised scripts using the getenv function.<br />
<br />
It works OK using the Rexec method of connection, but we can't use this method for technical reasons.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a simple way round this problem, which won't involve code changes?<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone know how the pre-defined Baan variable logname$ is set?  Is it the same as the $LOGNAME value?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Try using -- -set LOGNAME=someuser and logging in.  Then again this would cause each user to have a unique .bwc file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhill5</div><div class="date">15th April 2004, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea.  Unfortunately, we don't want to have to create individual bwc's - too many clients.  <br />
<br />
However, I wonder if there is a way of setting a variable using the &quot;-set&quot; option in a dynamic way?   For example, to the value of another (Unix) environmental variable.</div></div><hr />

If you figure it out please post the answer.  I know tried something like this one other time and could not get it resolved.  <br />

This is the variable I use.  I know that would involve a coding change for you.</div></div><hr />

David,<br />
Log in as root at the Baan Unix server because you must have root permission to start the BaanLogin daemon.<br />
You can say that the feature/pre-requisite.<br />
You might try to user the $USER</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhill5</div><div class="date">19th April 2004, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">We received this reply from Baan:<br />
<br />
<br />
With porting set 6.1c.06.06 and the Baan login method, the variable LOGNAME always comes back with root.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:       <br />
<br />
The problem with variables is solved with porting set 6.1c.07 and higher.<br />
<br />
<br />
As we are unable to change the porting set at the present moment, we have had to make a code change.  Substituting with the predefined variable logname$ appears to work OK.  However, I think the suggestion of accessing $USER would have worked as well.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, on AIX the LOGNAME variable can not normally be changed by a standard user so on the last line of the wrapper script where you call the bshell, set the BaaN variable as follows:<br />
<br />
bshell6.1 $* -set LOGNAME=$USER</div></div><hr />
