<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th March 2019, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to check through the code and make sure all of the update are getting committed before the next transaction.  It is very possible that the code is hitting something (new data or new condition) that was not thought of when it was designed.  And it is possible an error condition that is now occurring that has not occurred in all those years since its original design.</div></div><hr />
