<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhill5</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been encountering some problems running a Baan script which<br />
uses the 'shell' command to perform some file manipulation.  After <br />
running a few transactions, the script crashes with a pop-up error:<br />
<br />
FATAL ERROR: PTY error: 'Can't open pty' (e=0) PRESS &lt;RETURN&gt;<br />
<br />
In theory, there should be enough pty devices available on the server.<br />
To me, it looks like pty devices allocated to the script are not being<br />
released.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else come across this problem?<br />
<br />
Is the use of 'run.prog' recommended for Baan IVc4 instead of 'shell'?</div></div><hr />

There are BaaN file handling functions, why do you have to use shell() or OS based functions ? If you can make it work in BaaN code, its more portable across OS.<br />
Which OS are you running on - AIX/NT ? <br />
Please post your code for others to review.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhill5</div><div class="date">31st August 2005, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Our server OS is AIX.<br />
<br />
We have used 'shell' to remove temporary files, and we have subsequently discovered that we can use seq.unlink instead.  <br />
<br />
'shell' has also been used to run the 'cat' and 'mv' commands, plus some Unix shell scripts that we have written.</div></div><hr />

Writing portable code is part of good programming and design.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skapoor73</div><div class="date">15th September 2005, 09:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I am also encountering the same problem in a test server(has only 6 concurrent users). I am using BaaN IVc2 on AIX 5.2 wth PS 6.1c.07.07<br />
<br />
We have tried increasing the maximum number of pty from 64 to 1024 and stll got the error(did not reboot the machine as our understanding is that it is a dynamic parameter). <br />
<br />
In my current prodn environment(HP-UX), this parameter is set to 64(or 56) and is working fine.<br />
<br />
Please advise with what to do. How far we can increase? How to ensure that we do not run out of ptys(it's strange. Obviously, pty is not getting released). Not sure how many I will need when I have 125 users???<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhill5</div><div class="date">15th September 2005, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Increasing the max pty parameter will only give you temporary relief.  In our experience, the pty's are only released when you log out of Baan.<br />
<br />
The only solution we have come up with is to re-write our code by replacing the use of 'shell' with the function 'run.prog' (or use some of the other in-built functions, such as seq.unlink to delete files).  This appears to work - the pty devices are either not used or are released properly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">15th September 2005, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a problem, particularly in Baan IV as I have noticed.<br />
<br />
I don't believe it has anything to do with available pty's, but rather witht the shell() function itself. <br />
<br />
What works for me is extensive error control and loop backs. Keep knocking out those shell commands until you get the result you want. <br />
If you post your relevant code, I'll be happy to make a suggestion.</div></div><hr />

Release notes for portingset: 7.6a.02<br />
<br />
MaintMahler: # 25740 (BDUX18327): Increase of pty usage after BDUX17260<br />
<br />
Date: Wed, 25 May 2005 10:33:23 +0200 (CEST)<br />
<br />
Created on:  MaintBaanIVc<br />
Type:        bugfix<br />
<br />
Problem Description (Customer terms)<br />
After installing portingset 6.1c.07.07 the following error was reported:<br />
Errno 24 (The process file table is full) bdb_errno 0<br />
Failed to open pty pair.<br />
After increasing the number of pty's from 256 to 512 the problem was solved.<br />
It looks like the pty usage increased after installing this portingset.<br />
<br />
Workaround<br />
Increase the number of available pty's on system level.<br />
E.g. double the number of available pty's.<br />
<br />
Test Procedure<br />
Before logging into Baan, set the following in to the Command field of Bw Configuration:<br />
-- -dbgpty -logfile ptytrace -keeplog<br />
Log in Baan, and from the menubar select File-&gt;Run Program.<br />
Fill in: ksh, and check &quot;Run External Program&quot;.<br />
Press OK.<br />
Now a terminal emulator is opened.<br />
Type exit and leave the terminal emulator again, and log out Baan.<br />
Afterwards check the ptytrace file, it should contain:<br />
<br />
pty: opened master /dev/ptc fd 9<br />
pty: opened slave /dev/pts/2 fd 10 PTY STRUCTURE       <br />
PTY: proc	= ottstpvtemul_r<br />
PTY: in		= 12<br />
PTY: out	= 9<br />
PTY: mfd	= 9<br />
PTY: pfd	= 12<br />
PTY: rpid	= 0<br />
PTY: spid	= 32416<br />
PTY: flags                <br />
PTY: no input for process ottstpvtemul_r<br />
pty: opend slave /dev/pts/2 fd 13<br />
<br />
So 1 master pty should be opened.<br />
In a wrong situation you will see 10 times &quot;pty: opened master /dev/ptc fd ..&quot;.<br />
