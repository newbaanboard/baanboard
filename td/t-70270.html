<br />
I have added three CDFs to table and added those fields to a session of type Maintain - List window.<br />
<br />
But in WebUi - it shows each CDF two times in grid, <br />
<br />
and BECS it shows correct.<br />
<br />
Any setting am missing?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
Explanation: When you add CDF field to a table and open the session on Web-UI or Mingle; the CDF field will be available on the session automatically. Note you are saved of customising the standard session. That is the purpose of CDF field… It saves you from the headache of customization.<br />
However, if you want to see the field on worktop you will have to customize the session and add the field to the session manually through DFE. This is when you will face the ISSUE where your CDF appears twice on Web UI. And that looks BAD.<br />
<br />
Solution: Stop the automatic appearing CDF on web UI. You can do that by deselecting “Active” checkbox present on the tools session where you define the CDF field. Hence, only the manually added CDF field will be visible.</div></div><hr />
