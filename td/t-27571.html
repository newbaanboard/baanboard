You can check if the file exists using file.stat() (or file.present - ttdllfilehand) then copy it to the client:<br />

<br />
Use the suspend() command while you are waiting:<br />

<br />
have you tried using the function server2client function in program script after rprt_close function call.<br />
<br />
Else you can set up a device like &quot;baan2excel&quot; . Just try &amp; search the forum for similar posts.<br />
<br />
Else one weird solution &quot;write an afs for your session , and then transfer output file&quot;<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or write your own device driver like ttstpconv - see the code and utilities section.  I posted an example from Kevin Brock in the forum.  What we actually do is transfer reports down and then launch an excel macro for the user to format the report.</div></div><hr />

I think George's suggestion was most suitable to your requirements: plain, simple and straight forward...<br />
<br />
So you make a while loop: while the file not present on the server, suspend(1000) --&gt; 1000 is 1 sec.<br />

The thing is.... they call the function server2client for a reason. It will only transfer to the machine that the current bshell is connected to.<br />
To transfer a file to another server, you WILL need an FTP solution on the side.</div></div><hr />

You can map that server on your PC (or use a general path with &quot;\\&quot; for example &quot;\\server123\dir123\file123.txt&quot;) then use server2client().<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
your os is unix !<br />
You can use ux2dos and rcp command to transfer the file to an other server.<br />

<br />
One of the solutions Bigjack and I posted do not require another session or FTP.  Alls it requires is for you to write a 3GL script for a device driver and sample code is in the code and utilities forum.  And as a side benefit it will be available for any report you want to run to the client.</div></div><hr />
