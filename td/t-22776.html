I am trying to use the set.synchonized.dialog to start a synchonized dialog as a sub-sesssion. By going through documentation, I made sure that form type and session type are set properly. The sub-session behaves properly for modifying and duplicating records. It opens up with the proper info. But on a new record, the header info is missing. Ex. Project, Year, Period is on the main session. I press New and it opens up the synchonized sub-session, but the same fields are empty. Works fine for modify, as mentionned before. How can I make the add work properly?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

For the type of form I had, both main and sub-form had to be of type 3, the sub-form with only 1 occurence showing.<br />
