<br />
I have a report where I have a text field (TXT1) and I want to have a second field that has several occurrances and put it in a text field(TXT2). So, the report print as a regular text field without reprinting the entire record. TXT2 below will be my multi-occ string that I want to move to a text type field. TXT1 is my regular text field. AAAAA and XXXX fields are other fields.<br />
<br />
AAAA  XXXXXXX   TXT1     TXT2<br />
                TXT1     TXT2<br />
                TXT1     TXT2<br />
                TXT1<br />
Any idea is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">1st April 2011, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">This code combines two fields tcmcs041.dsca and tcmcs080.dsca with two &quot;..&quot; between the field.  This also strips spaces from the fields and puts the resuts in AAAA field.   Hopes this helps<br />
AAAA = strip$(tcmcs041.dsca) &amp; &quot;..&quot; &amp; strip$(tcmcs080.dsca),<br />
<br />
strip$ This returns a specified string without trailing spaces</div></div><hr />

I want to have a multiple rows for TXT2 made out of a table records without duplicating the AAAAA XXXXX record.<br />
<br />
It is fine, I think I'll find another solution.<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />

I think I see what you are asking for, but can't think of a good way to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">4th April 2011, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark, No it doesn't work with the suppressing. The thing is the text field in reports, do that(suppress other fileds and prints the text in multiple rows). <br />
<br />
Doesn't matter, I used stacks and things are now fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
