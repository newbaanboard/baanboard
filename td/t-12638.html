<br />
I am new at this forum; urging you for help with the following matter:<br />
<br />
I am building a display session with six forms, which is displaying data from one main table, yet with different selection (filtering) per form. <br />
<br />
The table is structured with field 'record type' as primary key (index), and for each form, the records from a different record type must be displayed.<br />
<br />
The table is a table with total sales-figures per sales-to bp, parent bp, company, etc. per period/year. When entering the first form I will get the records with record type 1, then when tabbing to the second, I will get all record type 2 records and so on for all six forms (-&gt; record types).<br />
<br />
I also have to allow a selection for the user on each form to give a range of periods/years which have to be displayed; AND I have to allow an option (form option) to include certain records which are not being selected by default.<br />
<br />
How do I program this in such a way, that I will always get my correct data in each form, also when tabbing a lot through the forms?<br />
<br />
I never yet worked with query extends. I understood you can only use them in before.program. So I probably have to use variables in my query.extend.where() which are being changed in the before.form of each form? Or maybe there are better ways?<br />
<br />
Any help/suggestions would be highly appreciated!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warans</div><div class="date">19th August 2003, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I have come across on similar situation...<br />
<br />
Here is what I suggest for you:<br />
<br />
Since record type is the distinguishing feature on each of the forms....<br />
<br />
Use the following section in the program script to filter records on each form:<br />
<br />
main.table.io:<br />
after.read:<br />
       on case form.curr<br />
       case 1:<br />
                    |** Write condition to display record type 1 records<br />
       case 2:<br />
                    |** write condition to display record type 2 records<br />
        ....<br />
<br />
         and so on..<br />
        endcase<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out well....<br />

<br />
But what syntax am I supposed to write for each form? query.extend.where(.......) ?? And then which commands do I place where in order to get correct display of my data? Do I use rebuild.query()? execute(find.data)? Both? Other commands? Please help me out more.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance!!<br />

I tried what i understood from you: <br />
I wrote a quere.extend.where in the main.table.io after.read. Didn't work. Then I added after each query extend a rebuild.query(), but then I got lots of bw errors saying &quot;Undefined SqlId (0) .. can't continue&quot;.<br />

<br />
Please help me out.<br />

<br />
Not sure if the problem is some syntax - try blanking out the query extend before rebuilding a new one.  You can trace that value in the debugger, so make sure it's filled how you want.  query.extension is a string array.<br />
<br />
It may also be the section you are calling from.   This does not need to be called from main table io / after read, and I suspect that it should not go there because the mode is in read state.   Probably need a neutral section where the data is not being read.  Possibly be better in the form.* sections, you may need to play with that.  <br />
<br />
Here's syntax that worked for someone else, very similar:   link to post on rebuilding queries (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10017&amp;highlight=query)</div></div><hr />

<br />
lbencic was absolutely right, we  should not mix main.table.io and query extend functionality together...<br />
<br />
I did not mean that you need to use query extend when using main.table.io()...<br />
<br />
The logic what I suggested was a simple one which you can straightaway try it out. Like your grouping, we have grouped records based on group number in our 5 forms....<br />
<br />
Since the distinguishing factor in your case is, record type (which must sure be a field in the main table which you're trying to use..),<br />
<br />
Just try this and let me know what you found:<br />
<br />
main.table.io:<br />
after.read:<br />
on case form.curr<br />
case 1:<br />
       |* I'm assuming record type 1 for form1<br />
      if table_id.field_id &lt;&gt; 1   then  <br />
            skip.io(&quot;&quot;)<br />
      endif<br />
      break<br />
case 2:<br />
|** write condition to display record type 2 records<br />
....<br />
<br />
and so on..<br />
endcase<br />
<br />
Instead of hard-coding like 1 for record type, use appropriate 'DEFINED' constants based on your needs...<br />
<br />
Since, I did not know exact details of your table, I have given it in general...you need to build your own logic of distinguishing the record type records on each form.<br />
<br />
The code part (if condition) what I have given above is just an assumption; you can write your exact required condition and try it out.<br />

With change to another form were build a new query in the before.form section and this works for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does query.extension work in BaanV, or do I use query.extend.where()? In which sections can the query extensions be used? Because I understood initially that they work only in before.program; but now I see I can simply put them in the form sections and add a rebuild.query() after each modification? <br />
<br />
I am going to try to get around with all the bits of info and advice you all gave me so kindly, and will keep u updated with the result. <br />
<br />
For now one more thing: I want on each form to select all the relevant records (based on table (index) field record type, but want to point at the record which I was pointing at when leaving the first form. In other words on the first form where I have record number 1 (table field) i am currently holding by record no. 523, then I swtch to other forms. For record type 1 I have the BP, parent-BP, area etc. Now I always want to get the pointer for the current form to the relevant parent-BP, area etc (form 1: per bp, form 2: per parent, form 3: per area etc) based on the pointed record when leaving the first form. So I save the fields in tmp.fields in the after.form.1, but then how do I point tot he relevant record for each form? How do I do that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again in advance! It is much appreciated!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, in Baan V use the query.extend.where - heres a link to query.extend.where syntax (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_sql_query_extensions_query_extend_where) .<br />
This will fit with klixy's example, but if you use the EXTEND_OVERWRITE mode, you probably don't have to blank the string before you fill it.<br />
<br />
For starting at a specific record, I have not tried, but maybe save the record you want before you refresh, then look it back up again and try the make.current()  (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_form_and_form_field_operations_make_current) commmand, it seems to do what you need and is ok in that section.   Let us know if that works :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 20:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't succeed with make.current(). What happened was: when tabbing from first forms to others, I got pointed at the correct field (parent, area etc) but the records with record type 1 -&gt; first form were displayed instead the correct record type.<br />
<br />
Maybe I did something wrong? How am I supposed to &quot;look the record back up&quot; as you adviced me? <br />
<br />
p.s. I posted a new post just now with a better, more detailed explanation of the structure and requirements for this session, and the problems I encounter, just because I see that I am having many problems with this session :confused: , and this forum - which i've just discovered yesterday - seems amzing help!! <br />

Kind regards,<br />
