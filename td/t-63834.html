<br />
I have a big problem in my development environment (windows server, SQLserver database), create a report that is sorted by date and the records appear correctly, I installed the program on the production environment (AIX server, Oracle database), and the records are sorted improperly, although it is the same program. I tried to follow the program in debug mode in production, but in this instance if I appear good records, but I compile the program again in normal mode and the records appear in the wrong order.<br />
<br />
Can anyone guide me with this problem?</div></div><hr />

Where do the sorts take place - on the report?  Not sure about LN, but in 4c4 I can go and look at the tmp report files to see the data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for you response:<br />
1. The dates are UTC, that is date / time<br />
2. The sort is on session script on the report exist input fields presorted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th March 2013, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Really beyond my knowledge, but I would be checking the session script to make sure the records are coming out in the expect order.  Maybe a difference between how your oracle and sql are treating the records.  Can't really say, but that is where I would look.  I would probably go into table maintenance session and view the records to make sure they look like I expect.  If they come out of it correct, but then get printed differently then maybe something in the report is causing it.  Of course I do not have a clue on why in debug mode the records might come out correctly versus not in debug mode - of course assuming you ran it in debug mode for all the records.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">19th March 2013, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">can you completely remove your program from production (session, form script, report + script) and re-install from dev?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mario</div><div class="date">22nd March 2013, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Try to change de fields in the report to descending / ascending in stead of presorted. If I remember I had the same kind of problem, after the change it was solved. <br />
<br />
Did you use 'order by' in de program script? If not, than it's logical that you see different sorting between MSQL and ORACLE, if you did order by, I hope someone else has a clue. <br />
<br />
Best Regards, Mario</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd March 2013, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Very good point Mario.  I recall one time when I had a report that moved from test to production, that for some reason stopped working.  Ended up I did the sort options on the report to fix the problem.  It had something to do with the something like the explain plan(or something like that) - for some reason it was different between production and test.  That also reminds me that on the test system I could do x&gt;0 where x was a double, but in production it would not work and I had to switch it to double.cmp - which should have been used from the start.</div></div><hr />
