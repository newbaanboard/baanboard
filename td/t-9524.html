<br />
Anyone has applied new porting set 7.1d.01 on baan 5c?  If so are there any problems with that?  We recently applied it and now we have some problem with production orders.  When we browse thru tabs of session (tisfc0101s000) for active production order, when you come to first tab, it is changing the order number to 4 digit code (which is order series) from 9 digits.  When I put it in debug mode with trace on field tisfc001.pdno, it is changing the moment I return to first tab after browsing other tabs.  I am not sure whether it is with porting set or not, anyway  we logged a case with baan support and it looks like it is defect. <br />
<br />
   Good that we haven't moved this into production.  I am wondering if anyone else had similar problems or any other problems with this porting set.  <br />
<br />
   I guess we should keep one active thread for new porting set defects and problems so that others who plan to apply they will know the problems before hand.<br />
<br />
Any comments Pat??<br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />

Can you check your BECS version? Sometimes older version of BECS causes wrong display..!<br />

(We are currently on 7.1.c and to be able to use the latest Worktop, Baan Support require us to install 7.1.c.05 at the least). Thanks, guys &amp; girls<br />

There is a bug with the client binaries with this portingset, so you could not run the baan-client on the server after installing 7.1d. (WIn2K)<br />
Workaround is to install the latest baan-client on the server after update the portingset to 7.1d<br />
