<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">4th April 2005, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The function itfgld0031.send.message.to.background.process() call the session tfgld1201s000. This session appears in client process and while this session is being executed the main session continue.<br />
<br />
The funcion itfgld0031.send.message.to.background.process() is called each time a ledger account is updated. <br />
<br />
We have changes in tfgld1201s000 session with any updated to new tables. This time to finalize the session is longer and when the second ledger account need to updated the session tfgld1201s000 don`t work.<br />
<br />
The session called with bms.send() only can run one time? There is any way to know if the session called in the first function itfgld0031.send... is finished when the second one is called?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">4th April 2005, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">You could use a shell script and see if tfgld1201s000 is running through bshcmd6.2, but that only works if you run it on the same client.<br />
<br />
bms.send does not start a session, it merely sends a broadcast message to a process (or o multiple processes).<br />
<br />
So from the bms perspective there is no limitation to the number of instances. <br />
<br />
The same is probably true for tfgld00031. Whatever command it uses to start a child process, there is no reason for it to be single-threaded unless that is hard-coded.<br />
<br />
Does tfgld1201s000 set an application lock? That would be the standard method in Baan to prevent multiple executions of a session. If so, then you can use that to see if the session is already active.</div></div><hr />

I write in the first line of the program to show a message and the second time itfgld0031.send... call bms.send() then message donÂ´t appear.<br />
<br />
In tfgld0031.send... I write a FOR statement with 50.000 iteration and the problem is solved. <br />
But how can it be possible if bms.send() don't blocked session my function only execute one time?<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />
