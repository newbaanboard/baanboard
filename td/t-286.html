<br />
How can I be able to load data from a flat file to baan session.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I have never done an exchange scheme but I have hear they are pretty easy.<br />
<br />
I prefer function servers since they process the data through a Baan session. This makes sure that all of the appropriate tables get updated.  Attached are a couple of files they may help you if you choose this method.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you so much.  I am having a hard time to understand the concept of function server, but my boss requires to use this method.  I researched about it and I found out that it is maintain in DDC. While maintaining function server and function, I am encountering error like &quot;Invalid combination of function server/function&quot;.  I'm really confused on this matter for I am new in using it.  Please advise me where should I start to understand DDC method and api.  Are they used together?  Are function server already available in Baan or there are times that I have to develop my own?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sorry but I do not know anything about the DDC method.  I have never used it.  When we were converting to Baan one of the consultants told me we needed the source in order to use the DDC method, and we do not own source.  So I never looked at using this method.  I saw your other post and I hope others answer your DDC questions.<br />
<br />
I use the AFS (api method) to generate my function servers.  The documents I attached to the other reply should help you get started using this method.  I believe there is some sample code in the attached documents.<br />
<br />
So to answer some of your questions. No they do not have to be used together. I guess they could be used together, but I only use the AFS method.  I think some DDC function servers might be in Baan ,but again I do not use these.  If you want I can post a sample session script.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joshua</div><div class="date">19th October 2001, 05:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Thank you so much.  The files you gave me helps me a lot.  I have read in the manual that the FS in created thru &quot;ttspcreatdll&quot;.  I have tried to create my own then follow the script you have given me also (I maintained it in Maintain Libraries).  But while compiling the script created thru ttstpcreatdll, it gives me a lot of error.  It is my first time to create an FS, so I don't have any idea how to edit the dll script, I just copied the script (file-api) you gave me and I used different session to invoke and update. <br />
<br />
I am really confused. It seems that the FS is consists of a functions and the script you gave me (file-api) is merely a 4gl script. (that's why it gives me a lot of error while I am compiling)  Do I need to develop a session and edit the script like the one you gave me? If that so, there will be a new session  running before the standard session will invoke, am i right? And how can I be able to use the FS. <br />
<br />
Please enlighten me.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
I really appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th October 2001, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I will try to answer your questions - if our wan stays up. We have been down since yesterday.  <br />
<br />
(1) Sometimes using ttstpcreatdll will give you errors.  Certain sessions create invalid function names.  Usually I go in and change the sessions names, then just recompile.  Example - Once it created the same function names for two different form variables.  The only thing I have ever done is clean up function names.<br />
<br />
(2) My typical AFS session consists of asking for a input, output and error file name.  So yes I typically create a new session and attach the DLL that was created from ttstpcreatdll to it.  I have never tried this with a 3gl session.  I have created AFS DLL's that are called from sessions.  So my FS session runs in the foreground and the called session runs in the back ground.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">24th October 2001, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, check that you have the latest API tools patches and the right porting set.  This makes a big difference to the working of API.  You can check all this on the Baan support website.<br />
<br />
Another thing is that some Baan sessions may not work properly when using API as the functionality in the session isn't enabled for API.  Baan seem to be doing a lot of work on that at the moment.<br />
<br />
It is not necessary to use the dll generated by ttstpcreate dll in your session if you have the API include file in the session.  I generate the DLL and use it as a guide to my new session.  Yuo can call the API functions straight from you session.  I find it helps with readibility.</div></div><hr />
