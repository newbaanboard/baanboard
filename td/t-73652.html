I need to print a QR code on invoice and the problem is - length of QR string is above 900 and i cannot create a form field on report of that size, hence, QR is not getting printed. can u pls suggest how can i overcome this problem? <br />
I tried to allocate memory of the length of variable from report script. but it doesn't seem to be working!:confused: <br />
Please suggest. its real urgent for me.<br />
<br />
ps: I set it to str35m on report and QR got printed with half information. i.e. 35 characters of qr.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
Thanks for the answer! <br />
I solved it by dynamically allocating memory to report layout field. it was not working before bcz I didn't declare the variables as extern :)</div></div><hr />
