<br />
I'm looking for the labels that are used on the buttons, like create/continue/copy. In wich table are they stored? Also am I searching which menu is used as application menu in the Baan-Gui.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, those labels are hard coded. I have never come across the labels in any table during my hunting for other things. Okay, you can change the buttons (I normally change the view of the icons in most installations, just tidying them up or altering the icon to be more company specific) but have never come across altering the labels on the buttons. <br />
<br />
And what do you mean by the menu, all menus have thier 'names' shown down at the bottom of the GUI so you can trace it back if you want to alter it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PeterH</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for such a quick response.<br />
<br />
The labels have to be somewhere in the database, because we're facing an other problem, where the import from Oracle7 too Oracle8 caused a problem. Each character like 'ë,é,è'etc is changed into 'k,l,m'. This also results in the dutchversion in butons which should have a label like creëren or kopiëren into button with the label crekren or kopikren. So they have to be somewhere in the database.<br />
<br />
The menu application I translated wrong in dutch it's applicatie in the english version it's file. It's at the upper left corner of the gui.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, sounds like it could be some hidden table somewhere, maybe not in the actual baan database but hidden away somewhere. As for the pulldown menu options, as far as I know about that, its is also hardcoded. So if someone comes up with an answer to this one, I'll be interested in that too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think these things are hardcoded as such as they are all available in multiple languages.<br />
<br />
Peter, as I said in the other post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=351#post351) , I strongly suggest to check your database NLS settings and characterset:<br />
<br />
From within SQL*Plus:<br />
<br />
select * from v$nls_parameters;</div></div><hr />

(I had a very quick look but didn't see it) however there is a lot of language dependant stuff.<br />
<br />
Try $BSE/tools/dd/dtt.pd/dtt.pd</div></div><hr />

If you are using ISO8859 on Oracle, you should set your users locale to ISO-8859-1.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Locale data from Baan must be accessed by running 'mtttss3000m001' (damn 'hidden' menu :mad: )<br />
<br />
Run the menu shown and check your locale data as well.<br />
You should have for ISO-8850-1, single byte the values 1, 126, 32 and 122.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for such a quick response.<br />
<br />
I've checked the local settings for one user, and the field was empty, filled it with ISO-8859-I, compiled, damned same result as before. I Also checked session, tttss0104m000 and the values you suggest are there.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">27th August 2001, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello<br />
<br />
1) Tools Labels<br />
Check in table &quot;ttadv140 in 000 coy&quot;<br />
the labels are stored in there<br />
for print it is &quot;ttgenprint&quot;<br />
<br />
2) Appn(Special) Menu<br />
In standard sessions if you are referring to the Special menu wherefrom it comes, check out &quot;Form Editor&quot;, double click the choice field, there is a zoom menu attached, if not thru specific options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">29th August 2001, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two places to place labels for buttons.  If they are ascii buttons, added like a field on a form, it has it's own label.  If they are GUI buttons, which is what I am assuming you are looking for they are in the form editor.<br />
<br />
Bring up the form editor.  In the top of the form, make sure that you are using language 2 for english.  Often in new forms a developer does not set this correctly and will get dutch results (language 1).  All development is done in English (believe it or not) and then translated into other languages.  On the lower buttons there is one labeled &quot;Spec. Options&quot;, this is where you enable your buttons.  On the first form is the description that will show up in the menus.  On the second tab you will find a short description.  This is where the button gets its label.<br />
<br />
I hope this helped.<br />

<br />
i dont know which baan version are you using. Usually the tools tables, ttadv140/150 contain the label infos, and also the text number. corresponding to the text number, the actual text based on the language is stored in the table series of tttext001-010.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PeterH</div><div class="date">7th September 2001, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks everybody for the suggested help.<br />
<br />
At last I've found the text for the buttons. :p   They are stored as enum-set and the description for these sets are in ttadv402000.<br />
So one part of my problem is solved.<br />
<br />
I'm still looking for the file,exit problem.:mad: <br />

<br />
Do you only have Dutch as A-language on your Baan environment? Do you have by any chance German or French? If so can you check whether the menu's in these languages are OK? The problem is of course the 'strange' characters that are language dependant:<br />
<br />
<br />
Dutch: e with 'trema'<br />
German: umlaut etc<br />
French: accent aigu/grave<br />
 <br />
<br />
I have seen this problem many times before and each time it was linked to wrong NLS settings at installa time. Do you remember if you correct set your NLS_LANG, BINARY_SORT etc at Baan install time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At last I've found the table we're these labels are stored. It was table ttadv450, message tt dskbrw0009.<br />

Thanks everybody for all your tips.<br />
<br />
Till next time.<br />
