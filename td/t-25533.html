Hello,<br />
<br />
as i remember, some time ago i'm facing the same problem in B4c4.<br />
It think it was the porting set (not sure).<br />
Workaround was : the variable has been declared.<br />
After installing some patches an servicepacks with new porting set, the error disappears.<br />
<br />
Check your PS between prod. and dev. system.<br />
<br />

Tools VERSION(S):<br />

<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
&quot;Reporting&quot; <br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
After installing solutions 110323, 110334 and 116099, it is not possible to compile a report.<br />
The following errors occur:<br />
Error: spool.xml not declared <br />
Error: utf8_std_mode not declared (while expanding macro r_spool_line_xml).<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
In order to solve this defect, two files must be replaced on the Operating System.<br />
How to proceed, is mentioned in the SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS.<br />
<br />
<br />
PATH NAME IN DIAL-UP DIRECTORY/WEB SITE:<br />
Below are supported VRCs based on the Baan standard derivation structures. <br />
<br />
If your Current TOOLS VRC is:<br />
B40_c, B40_c1, B40_c4:<br />
/ftpdownload/updates/B40_c/116210_1std.dmp <br />
/ftpdownload/updates/B40_c/116210_2std.dmp <br />
<br />
COMMENTS:<br />
Please read the special instructions!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:<br />
Please proceed as follows (UNIX-like systems):<br />
1. get both dumps from the ftp-sites (see the links mentioned in this defect), and place them in your home directory.<br />
2. cp 116210_1std.dmp bic_global <br />
3. cp 116210_2std.dmp bic_repgen<br />
4. go to directory $BSE/include6.1<br />
5. cp bic_global bic_global.sav<br />
6. cp bic_repgen bic_repgen.sav<br />
7. cp ${HOME}/bic_global . (do not forget the final dot: it means your current directory)<br />
8. cp ${HOME}/bic_repgen . (do not forget the final dot: it means your current directory)<br />
<br />
When you are using Windows, you can use Windows Explorer to rename the dumps, copy the old bic_global and bic_repgen (to have a back-up of these in case you make e.g. a typing-error) , and then use copy and paste to put the new versions in directory $BSE/include6.1. <br />
<br />
Now you have replaced the old bic_global and bic_repgen with new versions.<br />
When you compile a report, the errors will no longer appear. <br />
<br />
