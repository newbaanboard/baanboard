For example you can comment out each of the and statements to see if one really slows up the query.  I am thinking maybe the curr.dsty pieces might be quicker just putting in an if-then-endif statement in the selectdo. You can also try commenting out the order by clause - if possible you can try to let the report sort.  Been a few years but I recall order by causing some issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">15th June 2011, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark is correct - it is slow mainly because of the order by clause. <br />
<br />
The second reason could be the OR clauses - I have noticed that sometimes moving the OR conditions to inside of the selectdo to skip what is not required improves performance. For some reason, the BAAN select is slow when OR conditions are involved.<br />
<br />
You should get better performance if your order by was sdshp910._index2, since that would force the index to be used.</div></div><hr />
