You can always try searching this forum for exactly what you are trying.  I would need more information on what you mean by file upload and download programs.  Now someone familiar with your version might now right off hand what you are referring to.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone visits the site everyday so it might take a while to get an answer.</div></div><hr />
