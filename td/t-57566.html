            I would like to ensure from you that whether it the whole layout  which is not getting printed or it is just a single field which is not printing the value.<br />
<br />
1.           If it is the whole layout which not printing, then check the expresion which is mentioned in the &quot;Output Expression&quot; for that particular layout. Even if the the value for this expression is evaluated to true, then I think it is somewhere in the report script where the value for the variable &quot;lattr.print&quot; is getting assigned to false.<br />
<br />
2.          If it is a particular variable which is not printing the value then, check the expression mentioned in &quot;Print Condition&quot; for that particular field. If the value for this expression is evaluated to true, then I think the value for that variable while printing is getting blanked.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps.<br />

<br />
The reason why your layout is not getting printed cause, you are calling layout.again() function in before.layout section ..........<br />
<br />
Thanks And Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th January 2010, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried changing layout.again to lattr.print=false.  I think this is what MilindV is saying.  I did not study the script to see if that would work.</div></div><hr />

I mean all you really have to do is control the printing of each layout as it is needed. So basically you turn them on and off with lattr.print based of some condition.</div></div><hr />
