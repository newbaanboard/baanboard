This is known as several products:<br />
Fullscope:  QKEY<br />
RMCis:  RMCgen<br />
Baan Development:  Bolt-Ons<br />

Fullscope &amp; RMCis (my company...) both sell these as products.   I can't speak for FullScope, but a link to the RMCis product description is:<br />

<br />
Or let me know directly I can send you a user doc.<br />

There are also some free version of similar wrapper ideas posted on these boards, search under 'rush' in the Code &amp; Utilities section.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for posting reply...Exactly what you said is my requirement. I want the information related to wrapper code implementation for additional controls without having BaaN script source. <br />

I an satisfied user of Qkey for more than 7 years. THere is one more tool from fullscope like Baan AFS. I think that fits into the deifnintion of wrapper more appropriately. The session wrapper will let you execute a session logic. Also, if you are trying to automate a type 4 session, then you can do with standard Baan function- Load DLL and execute DLL. These are the basis of Qkey product.<br />
