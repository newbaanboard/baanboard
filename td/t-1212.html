<br />
I created a new Menu and attached it to a field on a form.  When I run the session and try to zoom from that field, I am getting error message saying that &quot;cannot open menu 'mtdsls0000901'&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I compiled the menu and am able to see the menu when run from &quot;Run Program&quot;, but I am not able to zoom to this menu.<br />
<br />
Do I need to do anything else to get this menu in zoom?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">1st March 2002, 23:26</div></div><div class="posttext">The first reason that comes to mind is as follows:<br />
- the menu has been developed in the (say) 'dev' Package VRC.<br />
- the form of the field that you attached it to is in the (grand) parent Package VRC of 'dev'.<br />
<br />
You would need to also copy the form, that you are attempting to attach the menu to, to the same Package VRC as where the new menu is sitting.<br />
<br />
I cannot think of any other reasons right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trchandra</div><div class="date">1st March 2002, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">But all the components (form, session, menu...etc) are in dev VRC.   Infact when I linked some other existing Menu it did work! It is not working for newly created menu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know which baan version you are working or which option are you using to activate the menu.<br />
<br />
Please try to use this in your code -<br />
<br />
string zoom.to$( string process(14), long zoomcode, string zoomname(18), string returnfld(18), long formpos )<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
Use this to zoom to another session or menu.<br />
<br />
Arguments<br />
<br />
process	Specifies the name of the session or menu that must be started.<br />
zoomcode	This can be either Z.MENU or Z.SESSION, depending on whether it is a menu or session that is being started.  <br />
zoomname	The name of the calling process. This is used in the zoom.from sections in the called process. If no name is provided here, zoom.from sections in the child session are not executed. <br />
returnfld	Indicates the name of the variable to be returned by the function. It must be the name of a variable in the called process. If an empty string is specified here, the function returns the exit value of the zoom process. If the argument is not filled, the function returns nothing. <br />

<br />
  Thanks for the info. <br />
  Let me explain the scenario.  I have a field on the form called &quot;Order&quot; and I want to provide user the option to zoom to Purchase Order or Sales Order.  So I thought I can create a menu with both sessions and link that menu in zoom for the field.  <br />
<br />
   When I have zoom option, why should I use zoom.to$() and handle the return field and put it in form field?<br />

<br />
I have tested out your case. I attached a menu to a field where I am zooming. And it worked fine to me!<br />
<br />
I think you should check your menu code, edit the form field with the DFE to zoom tab and check if its zooming to a Menu.<br />
<br />
Dump the form/session and menu.<br />
<br />
You should get it!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">2nd March 2002, 02:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you check if you have specified the menu sequence number when you attach the menu to the form field. It needs to be the same as the sequence number that you used to create the menu (usually, 1).</div></div><hr />
