I have just started learning ERP LN.  I am creating a print session in LN.  I have a field which gets its value by zooming to another session.  However, when I run the session the zoom button next to the field does not appear and the field does not accept any input.  Could any one give me some pointers to resolving this?:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
check the settings for the field in &quot;maintain forms&quot;.<br />
<br />
Are the ZOOM parameter for your field set ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your response.  Like I said I am new to the entire Baan Experience.  I just started learning LN last week.  So please forgive any questions that seem ignorant.  I've been thrown into the deep pool of Baan and now it is sink or swim time.<br />
<br />
Anyway, where can I find this &quot;Maintain Forms&quot;?  I've poked around a bit and have been unable to locate it.  I have set the properties of the field to zoom to a session and return a particular field in the DFE if that is what you mean.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Ben</div></div><hr />

Hello Ben,<br />
let's give you a life belt.<br />
<br />
All Administration, Customization and Development is located under TOOLS.<br />
<br />
<br />
The BaaN &quot;Maintain Forms&quot; are located on different places.<br />
Form 2 of session &quot;Maintain Sessions&quot; (ttadv2100m000).<br />
See attachment.<br />
Or you're able to use ttadv3100m000 &quot;Maintain Forms&quot;<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Ben, <br />
Bernd's suggestions are applicable for Baan-4/5 versions. In LN, it is implemented as Integrate Sessions (sessions &amp; forms are combined). You have to select the option to 'Edit Form', which starts the DFE then you have to check for the fields' properties.<br />
However, when I run the session the zoom button next to the field does not appear and the field does not accept any input. <br />
Is the field a input/display field? If you attach a screen shot it might gives others better idea of the issue and to give appropriate suggestions.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Thanks for the info bdittmar and NPRao. <br />
 <br />
The field is set to be an input field.<br />
 <br />
I've attached pictures of the Preview Details and Show Details Session under the file menu. In addition I have also attached a picture of properties for the field.<br />
 <br />
Cheers, <br />
Ben<br />
<br />
*Edit:  I've just heard that other users are encountering the same problems with zoom fields--even with sessions that were created months ago.  Leave it to the new guy on his first project to discover that something is broken with the system.  I'll stop pulling my hair out now.<br />
<br />
I have discovered that if I change packages that I am able to create working zoom fields.  <br />
<br />
It looks like something with which the Sysadmin will have to deal.<br />
<br />
I'll be sure to keep you informed of developments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your information.  That caused the fields to become editable and the zoom functions to work.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all of your help.<br />
<br />
I am still puzzled as to why this started happening with the system.  It doesn't just affect me, but sessions that were created months ago by different users.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that an update to our LN system could have done this?  If anyone could point me to some more information on this I would greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Ben</div></div><hr />
