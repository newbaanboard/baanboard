	We have part numbers in our system that uses both 0s and Os and users are having difficulty in reading those parts because BaaN displays 0s and Os identical. I was able to change the font they use in BW client to something that displays 0s and Os differently but now the problem is printing. When they print reports to the screen it displays 0s with a slash in the middle but when the same report is sent to the printer it prints both 0s and Os identical.<br />
<br />
	Anybody has any workaround for this issue? Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I was thinking more in terms of changing print drivers to some how put a slash in the middle of 0s. Is it possible? <br />
