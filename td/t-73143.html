Being still in BaaN IV for a few months, we have to generate text files in a folder but would like to put a security if 2 files are generated in the same second. It is indeed easy to put date and time until seconds in the filename but not at all to add also milliseconds…<br />
<br />
How would you solve that issue according to the fact that the generation has to be be really fast?<br />
<br />
My ideas were:<br />
- Adding milliseconds: I only found the mtime() function that generates a number of seconds since last run of the session. Risk zero or overwriting is not present as, 2 users can share the same timestamp.<br />
- Ensure that previous file is not still present: my files are on a window server and file.stat() doesn't seem to find it… Moreover I'm not sure that this method is the best on a performance point of view.<br />
- Generate a random file name: What is the best way to do that and to ensure that the file name will not occur again before a long time?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your ideas.<br />
Best regards,<br />
Stephane</div></div><hr />

When I want to guarantee a unique file name I just created a table like first free numbers. I would lock the table(application lock), get the number, increase it, release it - then the next process could run.  Just a thought - most cases for me date alone was good enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
suspend(1000) |* To add 1 second(1000 milliseconds) delay before creating a new file<br />
<br />
I hope that's available in Baan4</div></div><hr />

Did you try - creat.tmp.file$() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_directory_file_operations_creat_tmp_file)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Mark's solution is the best one. Maybe you can create the suggested table as &quot;date, time, counter&quot;. date to clear the other day, time to track till seconds, and counter to increase (instead of milliseconds).<br />
<br />
And finally, since you are on Linux and you want to generate files on windows shares, don't rely on file.stat() because of buffered I/O.<br />
<br />
