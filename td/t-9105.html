<br />
This is a script that can do the job. It 's a raw version. I couldn't let the challenge of making a script pass by.<br />

See attachment for script and device settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th March 2003, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a bad idea - I used awk or sed at one point like you did.  What I did was put in the header page xxx of yyy - where xxx was the baan page number and yyy was to be replaced using sed.  The only problem was with sending the report to the printer afterwards - never seemed to be able to get it right.  Would you happen to have a solution for printing after this conversion? Anyway this solution did work pretty good if you were doing something like a PDF file and not printing the report.  And of course this was only a solution for systems running a UNIX type environment.<br />
<br />
Of course if you fine tune this to a complete solution we could include it in the code and utilities forum as another possible solution for the ever so popular page x of y problem. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">b.v.dj</div><div class="date">4th March 2003, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion the script should do all, so  you don't have to modify all Baan reports. <br />
<br />
Sending the report to the printer is done by the line:<br />
/usr/bin/lp -c -d$2 -n$3 -s /tmp/xofy.rep2 <br />
<br />
This is possible, because I 'sed' on the output file with printer controlcharacters in it.<br />
<br />
I know it doesn't work on MS. Yet another reason to use Unix.<br />
<br />
I hope someone picks up this code for enhancement. I don't have the time to go further with this.</div></div><hr />
