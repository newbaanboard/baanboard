<br />
I am no big hero in this yet.. Have an Access table which I need to read in Baan, and conditionally update some Baan tables. I know that I could use Exchange for this, but I want to do it in a (customized) session, reading, validating and updating the data programmatically. <br />
<br />
I first started doing it by first manually importing the Access table in Excel, saving the Excel file as CSV, struggling with the annoying unwanted automatic (re-)formatting of certain cells by Excel, and then in Baan just reading the CSV records, using string.scan()<br />
<br />
I started thinking however, there must be an easier way to achieve this, without having to manually prepare the CSV-file...<br />
<br />
Like I said I am no big hero working with external files to Baan. What is the best way to achieve my requirements??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

In this baan dll you can separate the fields again and update your tables directly or use AFS for update or ... .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">If you ever had an older baan Client (from ~2003) installed at your PC look at baan\samples. There are some XLS-Files with sample code for accessing Baan with OLE. In the newer clients they seem to be removed (I didn't find them anymore in my actual client). <br />
There have also been some discussions on the board about how to access baan with OLE.<br />
If you don't find them, send me an email.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Check out the AFS/DDC/OLE Forum (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=59).  Do a search on OLE and you should see some examples of what you can do with VB.  I personally do not trust OLE automation - this is a personal choice.  Baan once told me it was no longer supported and I should use Openworld technology.  The problem is that one portingset and client we used broke the OLE technology and I could not connect to baan.<br />
<br />
Here is how I would solve it:<br />
(1) create excel macro/vb macro to export data in format I want.<br />
(2) Write Baan program to:<br />
      (a) execute macro created in (1)<br />
      (b) use client2server to move file up to the server<br />
      (c) use string.scan to read file</div></div><hr />
