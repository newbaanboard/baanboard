<br />
I have been able to correctly display barcode in Baan reports using BWClient and following the Quick Guide 1310. I have a question though....Is it possible to display only the barcode and supress the text?<br />
I have two reasons for this:<br />
<br />
1) I want to display the text in the top of the barcode.<br />
2) The barcode has a character prefix that should not be displayed in barcode text. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">17th January 2003, 03:38</div></div><div class="posttext">To accomplish this you have to use a barcode type that does not display the text (obviously a different one then you are already using).</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the answer. But our clients require us to use CODE 39 and CODE 128 barcodes in an Odette label format (automotive).<br />
<br />
I guess I will have to look at a third-party product which is a bit of a disappointment since this is really the only obstacle to implement it directly via Baan.<br />
<br />
Thanks once more,</div></div><hr />

As far as I understood creating barcode works as such:<br />
You send a leadin to the printer to start graphicmode and barcode.<br />
This leadin contains information about the kind of barcode, it's appearence (important for you here: human-readable or not) and position.<br />
This data is followed by the actual characters to be &quot;barcoded&quot; and a &quot;leadout&quot; .<br />
These sequencies are stored under $BSE/lib/barcode/&quot;Startletter_of_Printer&quot;/&quot;printername&quot;<br />
Grab a printer manual and give it a try.<br />
Unfortunately I am not sure whether this approach works for a NT System as well. <br />
I would appreciate to get a feedback.<br />
<br />

Odette labels are a standard in the automotive industry. You can get details about it at Odette Org. (http://www.odette.org).<br />
<br />
The bwclient method of creating barcodes uses a plugin DLL from a third party company. Essentially you send an escape sequence to tell the bwclient a barcode is coming followed by the type of barcode and size, ending with the data itself (all of this in the report script). There's another degree of freedom you can set using the registry (or the bwclient preview windows) - barcode aspect ratio. There is no apparent way to control where or how the text is displayed - I went to the third-party plugin website and downloaded the manual. They have those possibilities coded but the bwclient just doesn't provide the interface it seems.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
