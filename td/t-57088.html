<br />
Searching through the forum I see that some of you have successfully installed and integrated BIRT into your LN environment.  Following the directions from the eclipse site, I have installed the required components but I don't know what to do next.  How can I use the reports developed with BIRT in LN?  Please note that the system is on FP2.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
to edit the report you need to enable it for rptdesign in tools-&gt;device management-&gt;enable reports for RPT design<br />
<br />
after that you can export it in the report session pick one report, and then specific-&gt;export RPT file... <br />
<br />
after that you can open it with the BIRT and to import it just click on the specific-&gt;import RPT file...<br />
<br />
i hope this helps, i'm working on FP5 and i don't know if this solution works too in FP2<br />

<br />
i rechecked again on the manual, and i can't find the exact Tools version you need to be able to export/import it.<br />
<br />
but for the Reporting tools and the report viewer the minimal requirement is the tomcat 5 and jre version 5.<br />
<br />
but jclju1  may be right, i've once tried it on our FP3 and i can't find the session, and i skipped the FP4 to FP5, and the session is available.<br />
<br />
i hope that's not too confusing.<br />

<br />
Just to make sure I understand you correctly: the integration between LN and Birt is not seamless, meaning that you have to use a flat file transfer rather than being able to print the report straight from LN?  That's not very user friendly.  Do you put in place some workaround to make it easier for the user, or is this primarily an IT function?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">28th October 2009, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't want to change reports you can start session &quot;Enable reports for RPT design&quot; and after that you can print enabled reports from ERP LN (webtop only) to device RPT (you have to create this device in ERP LN).<br />
If you want to change anything in report layout then you have to export report to BIRT, make your changes and finally import report again from BIRT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elrodyn</div><div class="date">29th October 2009, 02:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
just to add the information.<br />
<br />
the report still printed directly from LN, but to view it you need to have webtop UI, install and define the RPT device, and enable the report.<br />
<br />
and if you want to customize the layout again, as jclju1 said, you need to export the .RPTdesign, which is contains the xml format of the report to the the IDE(BIRT).<br />
<br />
oh and the report result can be exported again to the excel, PDF and Word, this is the basic function of the report viewer.<br />
<br />
hope it helps,<br />

just for Clarification:<br />
As stated in first post by kmcinc he downloaded BIRT from the Eclipse site.<br />
With That version you have no Integration with LN as like the DD Definitions in creation of Datasources (in case of Query based reporting).<br />
<br />
Infor delivers a customized BIRT Designer based on BIRT 2.1 (i think) called 'Infor ERP LN Reporting Studio'.<br />
<br />
As for the the flat file transfer remark:<br />
This is only needed if you want to customize the generated BIRT-Report in Report Designer.<br />
