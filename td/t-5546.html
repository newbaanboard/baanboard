<br />
Just wondered if anyone has the set of Baan standard development books?<br />
<br />
Electronic copy would be marvelous, if not, if anyone knows how to get hold of them that would be brilliant.<br />
<br />
We have done the development course and the books would be really usefull to recap on what we have covered.<br />
<br />
If you can email me outra9e@hotmail.com.<br />
<br />
Cheers everyone.</div></div><hr />

I believe you don't know many things about international copyright. But, it's not my problem.<br />
<br />
About the most recent official Programmer's Manual (the help sent by me is also official and comes with Baan) is not so pratical to use, at first, or you have to be connected to the Internet to use it by some browser or you have to download the whole pages of the manual with some utility and always use a browser to see it.<br />
<br />
Another problem.. this latest manual is for Baan V, lots of commands and functions DO NOT work in Baan IV, Triton, etc.<br />
<br />
So, what is more practical? Open a simple HLP file, that just uses a few amount of memory, is faster, is more practical, do not need anything special to run, do not need to be connected to the Internet or, the MS-Internet Explorer, for example, that uses a large amount of memory, can make the system become slow if you runs a machine with few memory, what is more practical for a programmer?<br />
<br />

Pat was correct in deleting the attached file. If someone is missing a component(any component including help files) the correct place to get it is Baan Support.  This board is not the place to post any material that has a copyright. Yes I know some have done it in the past, but we want do not want this board(or its founders) to get in trouble with Baan or any other vendor.  So we are doing our best to clean this up.  We ask only that you respect and follow these rules. If you are unhappy with any of the rules then feel free not to participate in using the board. I would hate to lose any contributor, but we do have a few rules we expect users to follow.<br />
<br />
In this case it should have been sufficient to tell the requestor which file to look for, where it was located, and how to use. If they did not have the file then they should contact Baan support.<br />

I never said that your manual is 'unofficial' but I doubt that it comes for free. Special permission was granted to us to publish the BaanV programmer's manual by Baan Development which also guarantees that you have the most recent information as we get updates straight from them. We realize that there are differences between BaanIV and BaanV but we had to make a choice and chose to offer the best maintained manual.<br />
<br />
You are free to pass on 'your' documents to whoever you want by email etc but not on baanboard. We are trying hard to provide a good service to our members and to be a valuable and reliable resource in the Baan community, not a quick-fix leech repository.</div></div><hr />

Your explanation made everything clear now. If it's a rule of Baan Board it has to be followed.<br />
<br />
But, I am sure you will agree with me that the answer below<br />
<br />
&quot; If you haven't noticed: the most recent Programmer's Manual (Official!) is right here on the board in the LIbrary &quot;<br />
<br />
does not explain many things like you did in yours.<br />
<br />
Excuse me for the file and congratulations for the Baan Board, it's the best tool for the people who lives into the &quot;Baan World&quot;.</div></div><hr />
