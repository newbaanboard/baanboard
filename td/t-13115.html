<br />
In case of single logistic, multi finance:<br />
<br />
How do I fetch the current logistic company number in a script? Is there some predefined variable for that? <br />
<br />
For instance: to fetch a record from cisli245 (invoices). Logistic company is part of the index. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<br />
long GET.COMPNR( ) This function returns the identification number of the current company.<br />
<br />
long SWITCH.TO.COMPANY( long new_compnr ) This function switch to another company and sets the internal predefined variable 'compnr' to the value of new_compnr.<br />
<br />
COMPNR.CHECK returns TRUE (not 0) if the user has authority and FALSE (equal 0) if the user has not. The user authority for company numbers can be maintained by the Super User in the Data Dictionary.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">25th September 2003, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your response. However, I asked for retrieving the LOGISTIC company, in case of SINGLE LOGISTIC + MULTI FINANCE. Of course I mean in case the current company is a financial company DIFFERENT than the logistic company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">25th September 2003, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also query the table TFGLD000 - Logistic Companies by Financial Company which references the finance and logistic companies that go with each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th September 2003, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">In tfgld000 the logistic companies by financial company are listed; i.e. multi logistic, single finance. In my case it is the other way around: single logistic, multi finance. (tfgld000 contains only one record)<br />
<br />
So I still need to know how to retrieve the main, logistic company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">29th September 2003, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Because it only has 1 record, tfgld000.loco is your logistic company, if you read this table from your financial company.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">30th September 2003, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you please explain to me how the table tfgld000 is set up? What records are present at what logistic/finance combinations? Right now by us, there is only one record on the main company with the same finance company number, in all three finance companies.<br />
<br />
I.e. logistic main company: 500<br />
Finance companies: 500, 510, 520.<br />
<br />
We have one record only with tfgld000.fico: 500, tfgld000.loco: 500. This record is shared from 500 to all other companies, so in 510 and 520 I see the same record.<br />
<br />
Please clarify. Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />
