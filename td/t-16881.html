Then on the layout select multi-column and horizontal inside the maintain layouts sub-session.  I do not think you need to use the lattr peice of code. I can not remember where it is on the form - I have only done this once and it was about 3-4 weeks ago.  I modified a report to print some tags 3 across on 8 1/2 by 11 sheet.  Worked really well after I got the height and width correct.  So you might have to play with that piece to get 3 barcodes across.<br />
