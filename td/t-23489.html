<br />
I have a form type 2, multiple records on a single form, being used with a custom maintenance session.  We might have several pages of related records, that is occurances per form = 10 and we can roll through 30 or more records on the form.  <br />
<br />
When doing an insert, my users would like to always enter at the bottom, the 10th occurance.  This would enable them to see the previous 9 occurances as they enter the new record.  <br />
<br />
However usually upon doing an insert, the user is prompted for the first occurance, at the very top of the form and cannot see his previous records.<br />
<br />
Is there any way that I can set the form or add script so that my users are always entering on the 10th occurance or bottom of the form ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">23rd March 2005, 20:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest using the GUI to your advantage.  If there is a row that you want most of the information from a previous row to be using on a row being inserted, select that row before doing the insert.  When Baan displays a 0 or blank to the screen, the GUI will display the previous occurrance values as default values.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, whenever the screen is full of information, it will blank the screen and place you on the first row.<br />
<br />
Depending on your skill level, you may try to do a split window like sales order lines in Baan IV where you display multiple lines in the session on the top of the window, and have an input session at the bottom.  Depending on your need it may be more trouble that it is worth.</div></div><hr />
