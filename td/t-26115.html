<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th January 2006, 21:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you could just do a lp to some printer and see if that works.  Or you could always write a program to run ttstpconv on the text file in question.  You could make a quick session to just prompt for a text file and run ttstpconv and convert to ascii.  Search the board for ttstpconv - there is sample code in the code and utilities forum.  Your program need not be as fancy, but it might work.  This assumes that the tmp file is a report file.  If this is the input file to the report then you need different code to read it in.  I think report files use ^B to separate the fields.  You can run any report in debug mode to see how to handle a report input file.</div></div><hr />

the one you just run.</div></div><hr />
