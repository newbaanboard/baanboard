I am getting errors and fatal error when I try to run a custom report session.<br />
This is the BW message text.<br />
<br />
Error:  Load DLL: Incompatible array subscripts in link external 'lattr.layout.id$'<br />
<br />
Error : Load DLL:  Subscripts 1, surce 50, external 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Fatal Error:  Dynamic Link Faliure external symbol 'lattr.layout.id$' in DLL object 'ottstprepdll'<br />
<br />

<br />
Fatal Error: Dynamic Link Faliure function 'r_bic_repgen_init'<br />
<br />
Fatal Error: Can not continue in rtfcmg12001110c2 (r.main)<br />
<br />
I am very new at deciphering BW Messages as they relate to cusomizations!  I am hoping one of you may have seen something like this before.<br />
Additional information:  there is no library that is supposed to be linked to the report or the session.  <br />
There is no report script.  just input fields/layouts etc...<br />
If anyone has seen something like this before please shine some light for me! <br />
Or anyone has seen something remotely similar too!<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Our app admin installed some tools fixes and it broke both compiling and running reports.  I do not recall the exact errors, but we ran into it when compiling first.  In either case I would contact BaaN immediately.  Sorry I do not have a better solution, but I do not recall the exact errors when running the reports.  So I am not sure if it was something like what you ran into.<br />
<br />
Good Luck! And please post what solution you do find, it will help others when they search the board.<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">8th May 2002, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan solution 70614 deals with Dynamic Link Failure messages. It gives a process to determine if the library or the specific function in the library is present.  I followed the solution and unfortunately, I have had to contact baan support.( it's one of the options that come with the solution!)  I will post more after I have talked with baan support.<br />

This turns out to be a tools problem.  We recently applied SP6 to our dev. environment.  Solution #80487 was included in SP6.  Apparently, after this solution is applied, you are supposed to go download a new bic_repgen file from baan support web, and replace the old bic_repgen file with it.  HOWEVER, this has not been effective in our case!  <br />
When we use the old bic_repgen file, we are able to compile the report but, end up with fatal errors as I posted originally.<br />
When we use the NEW bic_repgen file, the report has compilation errors!  arrrrgh!@!<br />
I have attache the compilation errors for anyone who is interested.  The most interesting is the first where It seems to have a probelm with an '=' <br />
anyway, we are still working on this...<br />
I am hoping one of you forum leaders will copy this post to the Tools Admin. &amp; Installation because it was caused by a service pack.</div></div><hr />
