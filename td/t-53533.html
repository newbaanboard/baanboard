I just tried to find something like a filedialog for the client. With help of BaanBoard here, I found &quot;select.file()&quot; in tgbrg0019 which works fine for the server. Also in tgbrg0019 I found a stub of &quot;tgbrg0019.select.file.on.client()&quot;. According a comment, file dialog will be available in &quot;Verdi2&quot;.<br />
<br />
Is &quot;Verdi2&quot; a code for a Baan Version?<br />
Is there an other way to realize filedialog on Baan 5c (SP14)?</div></div><hr />

Posted this since I am not sure what is in baan 5 or what verdi2 might mean.  The only other thing is to use the vb executable(in code and utilities forum)that was posted for opening a file on the client.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">3rd September 2008, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Richard,<br />
indeed Verdi is an internal Codeword for a Baan-Version.<br />
I know of 'Grieg' (5.0b), 'Corelli' (5.0c), 'Reger' (5.1 or 5.2 ?). I think that Verdi was initially the code for Baan 6/Baan LN/SSA ERP LN/Infor ERP LN.<br />
<br />
As for your problem, maybe this is a solution for you:<br />

Local File Selector (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=26814)<br />

<br />
thank you for your support. I found it a little but funny and annoying together, that there is that &quot;body&quot; of a function in  tgbprp0019. Originally there was some code in it, which they commented again with the hint to Verdi.<br />
In a short test, I also tried to include ottdllbw to be sure, but it helps nothing (of course).<br />
<br />
The use of an &quot;external&quot; program, as you proposed is at the moment not desired. <br />
<br />
Imortant for me is, that I can say: There is no function within Baan to create a file selector!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had done a File Selector some time ago. You can find it here:Local File Selector (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=26814). Try Version 2.<br />
<br />
I Just saw that Andreas hat already mentioned this! Sorry.</div></div><hr />
