<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StillOnBaan</div><div class="date">24th May 2021, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using BaaN IV c4 and using BridgeLogix for our barcode scanners.  The server that runs the BridgeLogix connection which fires up tmboaserver recently got a windows patch that for some reason made the server think the hardware changed significantly, probably because it is a VM.<br />
<br />
We successfully reactivated the Seagull license server for the barcode printer and also logged on the computer and ran slmid.exe to get updated computer ID.  We then fired up SLM.MSC and replaced the server instance for the Infor XML Connector 2.7 with the new ID and gave it the same Server/Instance name.<br />
<br />
The scanners seem to be able to login to BaaN without an issue, but when they go to transact or lookup data they get the error:<br />
<br />
&quot;No Adapter for ERP License obtained and not license info found&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there some area other than the computer ID in SLM.MSC that needs to be updated?</div></div><hr />
