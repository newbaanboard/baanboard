<br />
I am making a interface that always it is ON (It is connected with a external device), waiting records for processing.<br />
<br />
For the normal events (end.program, abort.program, etc), I had made the necessary sentences for disconecting the interface, by I don't get disconecting the interface when I kill the process by ksh.<br />
<br />
There is any event for this situation.<br />
<br />
Any ideas????????</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I understood your question correctly, you can use the pstat function (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_processes_pstat) to see all the running processes. Then you can know when your process is killed or not.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<br />
The pstat() function shows if the process is executing, but I need to know the event that execute in the interface's program script when I kill the process by ksh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th December 2007, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure any event gets executed with the kill command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">12th December 2007, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">As I know, there are no events that are launched when a process is killed.<br />
<br />
So your program will hang while waiting for the event, is that your problem?<br />

You can create the lock when the program starts and delete it when it ends normally.  If the user kills the program the lock will still be there.  The next time it is run you could check for an old lock - if the old lock exists delete it, enable/disable what ever this field is, and create a new application lock.  Not sure if that will help or not.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that several users can execute the interface at the same time, the difference is in the external device used, the status is changed in relation for this.</div></div><hr />

I think your posting lacks a lot information about your interface/device. <br />
<br />
1. What kind of device/interface is this? socket, shell script, file based? etc<br />
<br />
2. If it is a shell script, then you can use the trap (http://www.alasir.com/books/bsd/562-565.htm) command ignore the kill commands or trap them so the process can finish gracefully. <br />
<br />
3. If it is a critical service/process then any user should not be able to kill it. There should be a layer of security that you run it as root or any other Unix Superuser.<br />
<br />
4. Post your code. If you are using the shell() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_starting_and_stopping_programs_shell) or run.prog() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_starting_and_stopping_programs_run_baan_prog_run_prog) command then you have to wait until the subprocess has ended. You can write smart return codes in your shell script and get them back into the Baan Program.<br />
<br />
5. Why are you killing the process by ksh? You can go into a Unix Terminal (instead of the ksh from Baan) and kill the process, then you cannot trace it in Baan program. <br />
<br />
6. The problem is that I verify the external device status by a field table this is disable (change value), when the program finish normally, but when the user by any reason used kill process by ksh I cannot know this action for can disable (change value) field table and the next time that the login user the field table is disable.<br />
This seems like a design issue to me. When you start the session again, you have to get the current status of interface/design, you might save the information somewhere else about the status on the last run.</div></div><hr />

1. What kind of device/interface is this? socket, shell script, file based? etc<br />
It is a interface with a external system, this puts the information in a baan table, the interface is always looking for information  for processing.<br />
External Device = External system puts the information in a baan table (A)<br />
Interface = BaaN Session looking for information in BaaN Table (A) for processing<br />
<br />
2. If it is a shell script, then you can use the trap (http://www.alasir.com/books/bsd/562-565.htm) command ignore the kill commands or trap them so the process can finish gracefully. <br />
This option doesn't work for me, because  it is sometimes necessary, particularly when the process is hung by some reason<br />
<br />
3. If it is a critical service/process then any user should not be able to kill it. There should be a layer of security that you run it as root or any other Unix Superuser.<br />
This option doesn't work for me, because that it is not the problem</div></div><hr />

You could build user-id in as part of the key.  From what I have seen I am not sure you can capture the kill, so to me that means you have to do something at session initialization.  That is why I recommended an application lock.</div></div><hr />

If  error handling and record processing in ur program is ok then this program willtake care of itself when restarted .<br />
<br />
bshell.pid() gives the unix pid of the bshell . Probably that may help u write some script / cron a job send an email .</div></div><hr />
