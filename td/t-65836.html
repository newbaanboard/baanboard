<br />
He has a custom program that is generating a large data file which he is then sending to a shared folder on the network using server2client. This works fine when running subsets of the data. When doing the full extract, the data file is over 1 MB in size, and the server2client function seems to be failing in our production environment.<br />
<br />
When testing the problem, he copied the production file to our test environment and was suprised to find that the file was transferred to the network folder without any problem. This leads me to believe that there may be a parameter or system variable that limits the maximum size of files that can be sent using server2client.<br />
<br />
Is anyone aware of such a parameter?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was 1.32MB to be exact. The server2client call is returning -2.<br />
<br />
Are there any restrictions at the target?<br />
<br />
Not that I am aware of. He was able to successfully move the same file to the target directory from our test ERP LN server without a problem. This is what has us confused.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will easy to trace out the problem if you could post the code snippet. May be there is an incorrect call.</div></div><hr />
