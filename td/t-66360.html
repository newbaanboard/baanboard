It looks that I will have to &quot;most likely&quot; support all three interfaces.  The easy answer is to say all users have to use LN UI, but as WEB UI is very much different than LN UI and I have finance people demanding Worktop, I'm pretty much out of luck.<br />
<br />
With LN UI, the server2client will not work and it's recommended by infor to use start.application.local() as server2client is being &quot;obsoleted&quot;.   This is fine, but the start.application.local() does not work in worktop or webui (the latest versions of each).<br />

I do have an active case on support that I created last week.  Thanks in advance for any help anyways.<br />

NO_UI without a User Interface <br />
BW_UI UI is bw client <br />
WEBUI_CLASSIC UI is thin-client in classic mode <br />
