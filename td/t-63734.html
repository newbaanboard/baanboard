<br />
  I am trying to create an overview session that would showcase tdsls401 table - Sales Order lines and txta, txtb field but I need to show both what their text number (ctxt) is and their text value in the overview session.  How can I accomplish that?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st February 2013, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure I get this - but if I want to show the text number on the field I would just add the text field to the session.  So first I would add the text fields to the session so the text manager could maintain(or display) the text.  Then I would just add the text field to the form.  So if I had a table with a text field tppss990.txtn I would add it as text and then just add the field to the session.  Then the user could see the text or the text number.  Maybe I do not understand the request.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look at table tdsls400.txta in GTM, you see a value like &quot;14133&quot; for example. You go to Maintain Texts session and find text &quot;14133&quot; you will see your actual user text.<br />
<br />
Our problem is we want to see that &quot;14133&quot; value appear on a form for reference.<br />
<br />
Our situation is that often orders are processed along to the point that we can't edit text. Packaging requirements change and we have to react to change the text in &quot;Maintain Text&quot; <br />
<br />
Saves us the GTM search to find out the text number .....<br />

<br />
it seems easy enough but i have been also working with Infor directly on trying to find a way and have little progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why dont you use table tttxt010 to fetch the text number and display it on your form using a variable.<br />
I guess this is what you require.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">30th April 2013, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Won't I need source code to make that connection in my Sales Order header and lines sessions to view that variable? I thought the functionality I can use within ueDLL's related to those tables only.<br />
<br />
If I'm mistaken, please let me know what you suggest as the path to a resolution ....<br />
<br />
What you are saying is maybe do a select stmt to txt010 where the index num = the tdsls400.txta value or something like that ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">30th April 2013, 22:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Well,<br />
<br />
What we do is that we add our customizations to the &quot;Specific&quot; section on the menu of the standard session and you can just use import commands to get the text number of the Sales Order using the select query.<br />
<br />
Instead of that , if you want to put it up on the form, you can use CDF if you are aware of it.<br />
<br />
Else, a simpler way would be to add a form command in Specific of the form so if a user want to view the text number he can just click on that particular form command in specific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st May 2013, 04:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure I get this, but if I wanted to display the text number(and not the text) I would just add it to the form.  The only difference is instead of the text domain I would use a number domain.  Not sure why that would not work.  So for example I would put tiitm001.txta on the field as a long domain. Seems I did something like this once as a mistake - I just know I did it once somewhere.  Will look tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Now if the baan sessions prevented me from maintaining the text, then I would just create my own session to modify the text.  I mean in 4c4 I could generate a quick session on a table like purchase order lines.  Remove all options but edit purchase order line text. Well maybe on the generated session I might have to add the text options - can't remember.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am missing something between your version and my 4c4.  You might want to change your profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">1st May 2013, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">We have added new sessions via the &quot;Specific&quot; menu for many things but it adds extra sessions to users where we may not need it. Also, the wierd thing about the text in Sales orders is that the DAL appears to fully &quot;lock down&quot; the text after a certain point in the process and my new sessions were also locked for text editing. So I had these great sessions with GUI to adit text at will, then they got locked down ..  Oy !  <br />
<br />
Alternately I guess my session could point to the txt010 table and open with the corresponding text number to what i want and have one session per text in the sales order. We have added many text boxes for cusoms info, packaging, etc etc ....<br />
<br />
Because there is a DAL already attached to sales orders session we are not prepared to customize it....<br />
<br />
I don't know what CDF is ....  ?  Can you elaborate ?<br />
<br />
Mark, I'll try that option again. I think a co worker did try that in DFE and it gave us nothing or an error mismatch. I haven't revisited this in a while but i will try that again and report back....<br />
<br />
Oh, I also updated my profile now that we are fully off baan IV :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">1st May 2013, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding the field to my form, DFE auto picks the domain txtn and greys it out for editing ......<br />
<br />
It won't allow me to override to a numeric type domain ..... Revisiting this thread issue is starting to remind me the hoops we jumped through trying to get it to show ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st May 2013, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I could not change the domain either.  What I had to do to get it to display the number was uncheck the &quot;Link/Max.Displ.Len&quot;.  Then give I gave it a length of 10.  That worked for that part.  <br />
<br />
Since I do not know LN I have no clue how to get around locked text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">1st May 2013, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">DFE will give me a 10 character text box after editing similar LN settings in the Form Editor ...<br />
<br />
The only way we were able to get around editing the sls400 / 401 text was a direct link to Maintain texts. They get locked at the DAL layer by LN once outbounded or something like that. Infor had no solution except to customize the code IIRC, and we declined ....<br />
<br />
It is looking like we will need to develop sessions to edit that text by having the custom sessions zoom to txt010 table to the appropriate text number we have in our orders. Ultimately that would be the most foolproof way to allow users to edit this text and just restrict who has the 'power' to do so ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">1st May 2013, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">In some areas of the application there is a requirement to add easy and for free Customer Defined Fields. This fields solve the business requirements of (a group of) customers, but their need is not generic enough for deployment in the standard. Free Customer Defined Fields could help a customer to store his specific data requirements without having to customize the system. The information in the CDFs are, when possible, carried forward through the business process. For instance when customer specific data is stored on the requisition header it should be carried forward when the requisition is turned into a purchase order and finally into an invoice. <br />
<br />
Restrictions<br />
The following restrictions on CDFs are imposed:<br />
<br />
There can not be references on a CDF <br />
There can not be permissions on a CDF <br />
There can not be indexes on a CDF <br />
It is not possible to have an array column defined as CDF <br />
A CDF can not be defined as a MLF <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Try this link:-<br />

Hi, I want to ask, how i can change the number to their text. Currently i'm customizing the report.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">10th January 2014, 05:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
If its a Baan Classic Report, you can directly use the field.<br />
<br />
e.g. tdsls401.txta in your report layout. You can set its length e.g. 70<br />
<br />
If you are creating a report where you want to manipulate the field or export it to some other application use this:-<br />
<br />
#include &lt;bic_text&gt; <br />
  string bbuf(80,40)<br />
  string btext(500)<br />
  string     text1(150)<br />
  long b1<br />
 <br />
                btext = &quot;&quot;<br />
		btext1=&quot;&quot;<br />
		text1 = &quot;&quot;<br />
		text2 = &quot;&quot;<br />
		for b1 = 1 to<br />
		text.to.buf(&quot;tdsls401.txta&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, 2, bbuf)<br />
		btext = strip$(btext)&amp;&quot; &quot;&amp;strip$(bbuf(1,b1))<br />
		endfor<br />
		text1 = btext</div></div><hr />
