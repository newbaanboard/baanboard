<br />
We have a shipment module that I developed, where we create transport orders that contain all sales deliveries that ship with one truck.<br />
<br />
I wrote a program to print delivery notes by transport order, it prints standard delivery notes for all orders that are part of the shipment (using afs). So I get one print job for each sales order.<br />
<br />
Now we want to use a fail-over pool of two identical printers for these delivery notes. For Baan this would be one printer, physically it would be two, where the printer driver divides the print jobs over the two devices.<br />
I one device breaks, the other one prints all.<br />
<br />
Because of this pool I want to achieve that all delivery notes of the same transport order come out at the same printer. Therefore I want to combine several print jobs to one job.<br />
<br />
One way would be the following:<br />
- I print the standard delivery notes to an ascii file, and combine them in one file<br />
- I write a session &quot;print file&quot; in Baan with a one line report that reads this file line by line, and prints it to the actual printer<br />
<br />
Should this work?<br />
Does anyone have another idea how to do this?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

The difference was we always wanted certain pieces of some reports going to different printers.  What we had was several reports that we wanted separated to go to different printers.  So what I could do was create a session to let them tell me which section went to which printer.  The batch job would run at night for the sessions wide open and create 4 reports in ascii files.  Then my session would run and pull the specified data from all 4 flat files and send it to the correct printer.  In my case each of the reports had something like work center in the heading and I could parse the reports that way.</div></div><hr />
