As far as I can see there is domain tcnama which is 35 char. long. <br />
I guess it is not safe to extended tcname up 50 ch. because it may be used in many reports. <br />
What is suggested procedure if I want to do this ?</div></div><hr />

You could probably follow it using your domain.  I do recommend that you find all tables that use that domain and make sure it is what you really want to do.  You will probably have a lot of forms and reports to update also - that is if you want them to display or show the actual 50 characters.<br />

Good Luck!<br />

<br />
Baan ERP has a more configurable (and bigger) item domain, but I still decided against modifying it on a life company in that version.<br />
<br />
Its just too big of an enterprise to feel comfortable about a successful ending. <br />
<br />
However, if you decide to go ahead, make sure to keep us all posted. It will make a great spectator event. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">2nd December 2004, 13:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at the result of the session Print where used domains (ttadv4410m000). After this you know where the domain is in use and which/how much reports, forms (potentialy) sessions and so on you have to change. I think it will be very much work. We've done this for tcorno and tcdino (both to 8 digits). tcorno has been very much work, tcdino was not so complicate. <br />

Is it really worth the trouble? Whatever the problem is that you are trying to solve, there is probably a better solution.<br />

Additional thought no. 2: This post belongs in the Tools Admin forum ;)</div></div><hr />

I almost agree, except I keep thinking about all the changes us poor developers would have to make when a domain changes like this.  I think the original question centered around that.  Plus as you originally stated -&quot;a change like this makes for a good spectator event&quot;.  This helps keep the focus in this group - I do not always peruse the other forums. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milsykor</div><div class="date">7th December 2004, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to introduce it little bit. The users claim that field lenght doesnt meet their requirements. Basicallly the description for particular customer doesnt fit in the field lenght which is now 35, thus the customer doesnt have to pay the invoice just because of his name divided into field nama + namb.<br />
So it has negative impact on business stuff. Actually we are fully aware how many components can be affected by doing that but they cant live without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">7th December 2004, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Then the next step would be to check which componente you really need to change. For example, we didn't change anything from manufacturing or replenishment because we don't use it. And check the data volume you have to change. Baan will dump and recreate any table with  tcnama/tcnamb. This can/will be a very time consuming process. If you have archived some data, move the company to a new VRC. So you can migrate it later in the &quot;background&quot; and move it back to your live-VRC (if there is no difference between the VRC's there is no problem). Don't forget EDI (especially the conversion schemas with fix length if you use any). <br />
We had no problems with migrating and updating after the changes we've made (c2-&gt;c4;sp8-&gt;sp14). It is a little more work but we also did many customization at the forms and in the scripts so the additional work didn't count.<br />
<br />
Just my experience<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th December 2004, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of changing the length - Why can't you just change the reports to add nama/namb in the format you want it?  Then the invoice looks okay using the two separate fields.<br />
<br />
Some domain changes are less intrusive than others.  I recommend only changing the forms and reports where you absolutely have to.  For example when our item length changed we did not modify every form/report.  Only those that really needed to change - makes things easier for upgrades and patches.  Updates can be problems at times, especially if Baan changes a table you modified to reflect the new change.  Just make sure you always do a VRC comparison and keep things current.<br />
