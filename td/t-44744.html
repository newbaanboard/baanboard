<br />
I don't know if &quot;field help&quot; is the right word. I mean this feature:<br />
<br />
1. You click the question mark, normaly top right in a Baan-Window or menu-bar<br />
2. Your mouse-pointer changes to a pointer with a &quot;question-mark&quot;<br />
3. With that pointer click to a field on a form ....<br />
<br />
....  and Baan tells you the (table)-name of that field.<br />
<br />
But this feature doesn't work with any field. We don't know from what it depends, if it works or not. <br />
Is there any way to customize that?</div></div><hr />

From your problem description I presume that the field help does not work for Customized sessions based on Customized tables. Please confirm if my assumption is correct. If this is the case then please try the following...<br />
<br />
Check if the field help code has been defined for all the fields that are being used on the session.<br />
Next, for all these fields check if a help code has been assigned in the table definition of the table.<br />
For you to see the field help, the field help code should be placed in &quot;Help Information&quot; option of &quot;Maintain Table fields session.<br />
Finally, dump the form of the session.<br />
You should be able to see the help text now for all the fields on the session.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no the problem concerns not all fields on customized sessions, I think it stadard it happens also.<br />
An other thing: in a first step we don't care about the &quot;help text&quot;, we just would like to see the name of the field. <br />
Strange: I found fully customized sessions with also a also fully customized table  with only three fields. If start this session &quot;field help&quot; shows the name of one field. For the other two fields &quot;field help&quot; doesn't work. Even though, we aren't interested in help texts (only in the field name) we checked help texts but nome of the fields, nor of the labels has one?<br />
Despite of that for one field &quot;field help&quot; works.</div></div><hr />

I am trying to understand where the problem lies. So please check the following ... and try doing as suggested below.<br />
<br />
Let us consider the same session that you have attached. I presume the session is based on a customized table. <br />
<br />
1. Go to table definitions --&gt; select fields --&gt; then go to field details for all these three fields in the customized table.<br />
2. Now, tell me what do you see in &quot;Help Information&quot;, Help Input&quot; and Help Display&quot;. Do you see any help codes filled in there.<br />
3. If yes, then try running the session &quot;Create runtime help&quot; for this current session. Include forms too. If this does not help then run &quot;Create Runtime Data Dictionary&quot; for the sessions only. DO not forget to check &quot;Run time help option&quot;.<br />
4. If no then please define help codes for these fields.<br />
5. Add these help codes to fields in the table definition under Help Input and Help Display fields.<br />
6. Then run &quot;Create Runtime Data Dictionary&quot; for the sessions only. DO not forget to check &quot;Run time help option&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have just created a new session based on new table with three new fields. At first I have not added the help codes. So I did not get any help. AFter that I have added field help codes then tried. I get all the information that you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Please try this for your current session. It should work.</div></div><hr />
