<br />
Please, sorry for my English:)<br />
<br />
May I use variables inside the SQL query?<br />
<br />
I want to change sort order on runtime.<br />
<br />
select 	tisfc001.pdno(1;4):sndr,<br />
    	tisfc001.pdno,<br />
    	tisfc001.cwar,<br />
    	tisfc001.mitm,<br />
    	tcibd001.dsca<br />
    			<br />
    	from tisfc001	inner	join	tcibd001	on tcibd001.item = tisfc001.mitm<br />
order by 1, tisfc001.cwar, 4<br />
<br />
Depending on the options on the form I want to change the sort order of the latter, for example at 5 (tcibd001.dsca), may I use a variable there, or is it not possible at all?<br />
<br />
Should get something like... order by 1, tisfc001.cwar, var<br />
But this construction is not compile<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

So if we give the users a couple of different sort options we would put different reports in different report groups.  Then based off the sort picked what the report group would be - then the reports would have the different sorts on them.  Just one suggestion I thought I would mention.  You should probably wait for someone who knows ln.</div></div><hr />

You can change the sort order at run time based on user inputs.</div></div><hr />

Agree, it would be convenient</div></div><hr />
