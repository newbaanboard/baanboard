(this interactive feature is a new requirement and didnt plan for this before writing the dll). short of re-writing the whole thing and bring this logic into the java front-end, is there a way i can call a non-baan form (pls see my note: open external program) like html, dos screen, etc that can pass a value to baan? i can probably call an asp page, take the user input and place the value in a temp baan table but i thought that would give me a lag as i need the value fast so i can print the labels.<br />

About the only thing I have done is call DLL's from excel - which did something in baan.  This is only something I played with and not something we ever did in production environment - I also had issues all the time with upgrades.  I am by no means an expert on any of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
don't know whether this will be of help for you, but I had to do something similar, just the other way round: call a Baan Session from external and pass variables to it.<br />
Start of session xxyyy1234m000 with &quot;I&quot; &quot;can&quot; &quot;pass&quot; &quot;something&quot;<br />
ba6.1 xxyyy1234m000 I can pass something<br />
This is how to retrieve the variables:<br />
for i=1 to argc()-1<br />
 value(i)=argv$(i)<br />
endfor<br />
IIRC, argv$(0) contains the sessionsname itself<br />
Perhaps you can use this to control printing with external programs and keep track of the status in Baan in background?<br />
<br />

just to be clear, my intermec scanner is running on windows mobile. i will need a screen that comes up, takes a user input (quantity), hit enter. this data will be accepted by LN dll and processed per my script.<br />
<br />
i have tested by running this dll through bde (eclipse) but the computer has baan installed on it. it called the unix shell and executed the script. but i cannot open the same in the scanner.<br />

<br />
I normally create a webservice to connect windows mobile devices to Baan. The webservice is installed on a server with the Baan client installed. It receives the call from the mobile device, forwards it to baan, receives the response and forwards the response to the scanner. You might do some extra processing on the webservice-part to get some load of the scanner.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
yes i do have a webservice that accesses my custom bde. you are right that i might do some extra steps on the webservice part to get the functionality i want. i might probably do that in phase 2 of the project. i plan to go live without this functionality in a couple of weeks. thanks for the input.<br />
