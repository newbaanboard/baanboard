Due to a new company implementation, we need to copy a lot of purchase orders from the old company to the new company.<br />
<br />
Anyone have faced this problem? if yes, how do you resolved?<br />
<br />
My first approach is generate a program that uses API calls, to fill the requiered fields on  purchase header (tdpur040) and purchase lines (tdpur041).<br />
<br />
Or, there is a better procedure to achieve this?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />

We handled this using a PO generation program (AFS) as it was in Baan 4, which copied the POs to the required company.<br />

<br />
One question: How did you manage the text for the purchase order header and the text for the purchase order lines?<br />
<br />
As far as I have read the documentation, AFS does not support text management.<br />
<br />

<br />
- Purchase Orders<br />
- Purchase Order Lines<br />
- Purchase Order Text <br />
- Purchase Order Lines Text<br />
<br />
to an ASCII file and then import them into the other company.<br />

I programed a session to do the task.<br />
<br />
I take a look for the exchange solution proposed and I decided not to do on this way, due to, the order number must be fixed.<br />
<br />
To solve the text handle issue, first I create the order with order lines, then using the function text.write we added the line description and order header.<br />
