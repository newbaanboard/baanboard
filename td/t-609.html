<br />
We are using standard EDI to push out an orders message. A BaaN tools session has been created to read the order output and reformat it in accordance with an EDI partner spec. The problem we are having is that it is only possible to get a maximum record length of 255, and one of the required records has a length of 450 characters. As far as I am aware  255 is the bshell limit which is hard coded. Is there anything that can be done ? Thanks in advance !!</div></div><hr />

If we are talking about writing reports then I have not found away around it yet.<br />

Good Luck!<br />
