<br />
Go to {BSE}\lib\user\u   folder. You will find list of names/user files here. There will be 2 files of the same name like:-<br />
<br />
kapil &amp; kapil-. <br />
<br />
So, Date Modified for the file &quot;kapil-&quot; will be its creation date.<br />
<br />
Likewise, you can find all the users which were created in range of the dates you want.</div></div><hr />

The ln application doesn't store the information when you have created the user. What Bhushan is referring to is the modication date of the runtime file of the user. That will be changed too if you change something in the user data.<br />
<br />
Since you are seem to use oracle (according to your profile) I would suggest to check the dba_users table in the instance. That has a field 'created'. <br />
Only question is if you have mapped your ln users one-to-one to oracle users. Than this will work. <br />
<br />
If you are using one oracle user for all your ln users than probably will be difficult to answer the question.<br />
<br />

As you said:-<br />
<br />
What Bhushan is referring to is the modication date of the runtime file of the user. That will be changed too if you change something in the user data.<br />
<br />
Yes , it shows the last convert to runtime date. But, two files are generated there for a single user i.e.<br />
<br />
For e.g. user_name file and user_name- file. When you do a convert to run time, the modification date of user_name- file is changed while the modification date for user_name files remains the same i.e. its creation date.<br />
<br />
Yogesh,<br />
 I am not sure if there is any other way. You can use Han's way to get it, I have not tried it. What I do, is simply sort the files by modification date and get the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">29th May 2013, 01:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternative way is to add the table ttaad200 to the Audit Profiles - ttaud3120m000. Make sure, to execute the option - Create Runtime Audit Definitions on the session ttaud3110m000 after you add the table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will that give the historical data? I mean, will it give the creation dates of the users which were created in the past? I guess, it wont give the users created earlier, but well it is good idea to keep track of the user creation in future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">29th May 2013, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Bhushan,<br />
<br />
It won't provide the previous information but once the entry is added into the Audit configuration it will keep track of all the changes.<br />
<br />
For now, Han's way will work better under the assumption that every baan user id is mapped to a unique Oracle user id.</div></div><hr />
