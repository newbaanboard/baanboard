<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose you may have sorted this out by now.<br />
<br />
However, here is what can be done. All involve basically buying-out the end-user on the layout change:<br />
<br />
- Create additional HEADER/ DETAIL Layouts and continue the additional fields on the new layouts.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
- Create additional REPORTS (example would be say Print Item Data) where related fields are located on each report and then the reports can be printed as desired.<br />
<br />
OR (last resort, I would resist this one as far as possible)<br />
<br />
- create an ASCII File (CSV format) where all the fields are strung together in one record as desired, 'put' the file to the C: drive of the user, and fire up EXCEL with the file, allowing the user to format and print as required. (It is possible, as you must know, to define a custom layout in EXCEL. So, each time the user runs the report, and when the EXCEL comes up, all he has to do is 'format' to the custom layout.) As you can see, not a very user-friendly solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ahulikavi</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 06:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Shah for your inputs, but  to make reports &quot;Excel Freindly&quot;, we need to have all the fields on the same row, otherwise its a pain to work on the info in Excel.<br />
<br />
In Fact for some of our reports we have used &quot;,&quot; (comma) as column seperators instead of &quot;|&quot; (pipe), user gives extension &quot;.csv&quot; after selecting device as Excel in the report print dialog, this avoids &quot;Text to Columns&quot; conversion in Excel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naabi0</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">You can change your list separator to a &quot;|&quot; in the numbers tab of Regional Options inside the Control Panel Folder and get around using a comma.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Not exactly an ideal solution, but it'll work.<br />
<br />
Create a special Baan device, either a Rewrite file or Direct using my ascii printinf file (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=761), that executes a script/program to merge multiple detail lines into a single line<br />
<br />
Baan device -&gt; Baan output file -&gt; script processor -&gt; new output file<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Baan report output (each &quot;row&quot; of detail split into two lines):<br />
A1|B1|C1<br />
D1|E1<br />
A2|B2|C2<br />
D2|E2<br />
<br />
result after processed by script (merge every two lines):<br />
A1|B1|C1|D1|E1<br />
A2|B2|C2|D2|E2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Er... maybe I should have clarified more about my 'EXCEL' solution: you will no longer be using the report layout. Instead, you will be using the seq.* functions, and assemble the output as a single row (as you rightly point out) by hand into a sequential file. (As I said earlier, this is the least programmer friendly option.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sitarammani</div><div class="date">16th February 2002, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I handwove the details with html tags <br />
&lt;html&gt;<br />
&lt;table&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;<br />
           &lt;td&gt;Thisfield&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Thatfield&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;....&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
               over multiple lines of detail.1<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;<br />
<br />
send the report to excel<br />
<br />
copy the entire worksheet <br />
insert a new worksheet<br />
paste-special values.</div></div><hr />
