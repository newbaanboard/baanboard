<br />
I have a small query.i am using BaanIV c4.<br />
I have written a code in after.field record. I want to display a line just above the last record. Is it possible to display a line in the after.field record.<br />
I think we can use lineno function but not sure how to use it.<br />
<br />
one more query.. can we make the last record in a particular layout bold?<br />
<br />
can anyone help me plz..<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You should be able to modify the script so that you know the last line and using something like 2 detail layouts and with the data you send the variable used in the layout output expression.  Example detail.1 is the non last line layout and its output expression is type=1, detail.2 is the last line and its output expression is type=2.  So what you do in the program script is determine the last line to be printed  - lets say you were printing SFC planning (Order, operation).  For each new order (using on.change.check) go locate the last operation.  Set type to 1 until the operation equals the last operation and then set the type to 2.  In the layout for detail.2 you can add your line and bold the layout.  There are probably other ways to solve this, but this is what popped into my mind.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
It was a well thought of solution. But it didnt help me much. because i am not able to determine the last line of my report in advance. and i dont think lineno function too will help.<br />
<br />
will be grateful.. if you could suggest some alternative solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

The only other thing I can think of is to first write the report to a file, then read the file in locating and marking the records where you want the lines.  Then sending the records to another report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbdave</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 07:33</div></div><div class="posttext">in before.layout of that particular layout<br />
u can check wether lattr.enddata = true<br />
if its true u can call a specific layout which is a line say detail.x<br />
which is otherwise always lattr.print = false<br />
so it doesn't get printed normally.<br />
try this if it works.</div></div><hr />

I am using a seesion through which i am sending the data to the report using rprt_send. Around 63 records are being sent from the session to the report. In report i have define after. field layout wherein it clubs these 63 records based on their workcentre grouping to 16 records. <br />
<br />
What i want is that before the 16th record one line shud be displayed coz that is the total field record and unfortunately i had to define it in the samelayout itself.<br />
<br />
As you had suggested in the first solution to define two seperate layouts for the total and other records, it isnt possible because i am using the values from the last record to perform calculations on the other records. <br />
<br />
I hope i am not confusing you. This is the best i could describe about my problem. Do you want me to send you the screenshot?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your valuable solutions.<br />

<br />
why dont u keep 2 diff after field layouts<br />
one will be printed always<br />
and other when lattr.enddata = true which have all fields declared bold in layout itself and other having normal/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raikar_raviraj</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">hi dave...<br />
<br />
Your solution is what i had thought about first, but due to some logical  and conflicting issue, i am not able to use two after. field layout for the same field.The lines problem also would have been solved by this method.<br />
<br />
<br />
Newayz really appreciate your effort in enlightening me with the best solutions possible for my query.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbdave</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">please try this<br />
can u use in before.layout:<br />
<br />
fieldxxxx = cf$(0) &amp; fieldxxxx &amp; cf$(1)<br />
<br />
fieldxxxx is ur report filed which ur printing in that record.<br />
use for each field in that layout which u want to make bold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">lattr.enddata = true <br />
Never would have suggested this - I was imagining a sorted report at each break would require the line. Plus I thought enddata was just for the last record sent to the report - isn't that correct? Or did I just not understand the initial request.<br />
<br />
And now I still can not fathom why two after layouts on one field would not work.  Or why an after report layout will not work. Oh well - must be a reason. :)</div></div><hr />

Well you have understood the problem quite well and you had given a justified solution too. The records definetly are being sent from the session to  report.<br />
<br />
and regarding two after.field layout for the same field is definetly possible.. i am never denying that.. But the calculation carried out in the after.field layout was too complex to be disturbed.. so i thought the better choice would be to use the solution as suggested by dave..<br />
<br />
Hope you are not getting me wrong.. <br />
<br />
Newayz thanks for your cooperations and solution.<br />
