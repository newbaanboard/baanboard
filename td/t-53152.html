<br />
Yes. Is all sql queries error.<br />
<br />
But I dun think have new installed for tools package. <br />

This problem happen after my Baan training, the trainer have created one SQL report in my BAAN. and except his SQL query report, other can't &quot;generate report&quot; and &quot;run report&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Do not use the package  the teacher used.  Then create a new query, see if you can generate a report.  I would go out and check the file and directory structure to make sure that permissions are correct.  I would not expect that to be the cause of your error, but it is all I can think of besides asking if someone installed something new.</div></div><hr />
