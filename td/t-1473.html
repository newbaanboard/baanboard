<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">22nd March 2002, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to sort the order acknowledgement bye order/cuno, not by cuno/order as it is now.<br />
<br />
So far it is not that difficult to solve that.<br />
<br />
The problem is: now, this reports exist in three languages, lets say 2,3,4. Of course Baan prints first one language complete, then the next and so on.<br />
<br />
How can I achive, that the sort sequence (by order) is independant from that languages?<br />
<br />
There is no budget for a lot of programming. So if there is a solution it should be fast and cheap.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I don't know of any short cut.  If you are not using all the languages then just change the one you are using, otherwise you'll need to change each one individually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">1st April 2002, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought most reports were linked to language 2 anyways.  So if you change the report for one of the languages, all you need to do is recompile the others.<br />
<br />
Looking at the source code, I am surprised that Baan has the data sort differently depending on the selection criteria the user specifies on the form.  In some cases, it will be cuno/order.  In other cases, order/cuno<br />
<br />
I see the following:<br />
If order from/to is 0 to 999999 then it sorts by cuno/orno<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it then checks what you specify for cuno from/to.  If blank - ZZZZZZ, then sort by cuno/order.  Otherwise, sort by orno/cuno.<br />
<br />
So if you want it sorted by orno/cuno without any programming change, try specifying order 1 - 999999 and cuno A - ZZZZZZ when running the session.<br />
<br />
This is the case when running Baan IVc4 with SP8.  Your results may vary for other versions.</div></div><hr />
