95% BOM's, SO, PO, ITEM.  only cost pice seems to be OK<br />
Has this just started occuring? <br />
about 1 year ago it started (after the migration to a new box)<br />
Did anything get applied to the system? <br />
SP16 from sp4.<br />
<br />
This has confounded our support ... but its a real pain</div></div><hr />

I can not think of anything else to look at.  Are those the most current(portingset and tools patches)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th August 2011, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it is always possible this new box has a setting somewhere that the old box did not have. If it is baan or the OS I do not have a clue.  The only thing I remember is that once we went from one UNIX server to a new one, the UNIX admins forgot to get one set of printer drivers and it screwed up printing.  But that got fixed before it got turned over to the users.</div></div><hr />
