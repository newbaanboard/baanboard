<br />
I´m looking after documentation related to graphs for LN... Did you got anything for LN?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">28th July 2010, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestion would be to create an ASCII Ouput from your session that is formatted as a CSV file, and then do the chart using EXCEL. If the output contains just the necessary fields for the chart, then it is just a few additional steps to create in EXCEL.<br />
<br />
So, for example, if you were requiring a chart of number of employees in each work center, you could write a session that would create an output as follows and save it as a .csv file - the first column is the work center and the next is number of people in that work center:<br />
<br />
<br />
=&quot;Z3Y&quot;,6.0000,<br />
=&quot;Z3X&quot;,4.0000,<br />
=&quot;Z7Y&quot;,2.0000,<br />
=&quot;Z7X&quot;,3.0000,<br />
=&quot;ZCY&quot;,2.0000,<br />
=&quot;ZMX&quot;,2.0000,<br />
=&quot;ZPY&quot;,4.0000,<br />
=&quot;ZSX&quot;,4.0000,<br />
=&quot;ZSY&quot;,1.0000,<br />
<br />
<br />
Then, you can quite easily create a chart using EXCEL<br />
<br />
(The work center code is surrounded by =&quot; and a &quot; because some of our work centers are with leading zero, this helps 'protect' the zeros when the file is opened in EXCEL).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rberti</div><div class="date">28th July 2010, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I tryed to make chart in LN before, and got stucked. I finaly did it by cpcomdll0020 and tccom.dll4220. But then I was noticed about whinp1700m000 session, and its chart works! I just cant do it with a new customized chart! and even importing its chart type it works with my tables data, but I can't change the color or axes... Its like the type of graph needs to pass by some step I just can't find. Its sad to have the tool and just not be able to use it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">29th July 2010, 00:09</div></div><div class="posttext">So, to change the color of the bars or lines, you would do as follows (this is for BAAN IV, so may be a little bit different for you):<br />
<br />
- Start the Maintain Session<br />
- Go to the chart session<br />
- Go to Form 2<br />
- Click on Charts<br />
- (If required, copy chart to current VRC)<br />
- Click on &lt;Continue&gt; - this brings up the Chart Manager<br />
- Next you have to select a Chart Type - click on File, then on Chart Types and pick the required chart type.<br />
- It will complain about &quot;No current chart&quot; - click &lt;OK&gt; to ignore that<br />
- Next click on &lt;Attributes&gt; then select &lt;Series&gt; - this brings up a sub session called Maintain Graph Series.<br />
-- If your chart was Bar Type, then click to Form 3, and choose the color you want for the series you are interested in. The series are according to what you have in your script. (If it was Line Type, you would go to Form 4, to fill in the complete area of the Bars, you would go to Form 5).<br />
<br />
This may not be exact sequence, but you can explore according to your installation of Chart Manager and try stuff out.<br />
<br />
(It was too much time consuming, so I just go the EXCEL way now a days).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rberti</div><div class="date">29th July 2010, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">lol, so we came to this again, excel. I agree with that. <br />
Using the libraries I've mentioned before its kind of easy to make graphs (at least in LN), but they just don't look that pretty and not easy to print...<br />
Anyway, in the installation of LN I´m working, &lt;Series&gt; and &lt;Graph&gt; options  are disabled. Works when I import another 'kind of graph', but I cant change these attributes.<br />
Perhaps there is a parametrization that enable/disable these options, or stuff like that<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replys!<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rberti</div><div class="date">29th July 2010, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Just updating, importing a type of graph from a standard chart, some options are enabled. I could not change the type of graph, I mean , if I import a type named &quot;2d_pie&quot;, for example, and its type is pie, I can't change it. But I can change the referent attributes. And the it works just fine.<br />
