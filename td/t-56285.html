I have a question about LN development.  First of all, we don't have source code for LN6.  <br />
How do I create a pop-up message to attach to a standard session that will alert the user that he is entering the production environment when he opens that session.<br />
I've seen it done before, but I can't remember how it was done. <br />
When the user opens tdsmi1500m000, a custom session pops up with a simple message that says, you are in the production environment. Then the custom session goes away. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help on this.<br />

<br />
Use search on forum with keyword &quot;BAAN_WIN_TITLE&quot; to look different options for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I know is that you can define a question for a form command which is executed  after the user has clicked the button or has chosen the function. This may be also a button for starting another session - but I don't know if there is a possibility to define a question while starting a session from the menu tree.<br />
<br />
For the form commands you have to change the standard functionality so you have to customize the form/form commands (source code is not needed either).<br />
