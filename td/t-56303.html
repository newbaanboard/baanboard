I am getting warning msg 3 time in my customised report session.<br />
<br />
Enclosed is the screen shot of the msg. Though it does not stop the printing but it is tedious to  pressing 3 time enter button for each time report got fired.  <br />
<br />
I hv checked the archieved but did not found the same or related error.<br />
<br />
Pls. help to sort out this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

On your client under Baan\lib\locale do you have this character set?  I see one on mine for korean_aix32 but I do not know anything about it. Is it possible you are doing something in the report to call for this character set.  Just guessing on my part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This character set is already present under the said directory.  I hv not written or called any things as such different from other reports.   However, in my report layout some fields font are (large 10 cpi) and some fileds fonts are (small 17.1 cpi) that's it.  <br />

I has the same problem with Japanese character which got resolved after I installed Japanese language on the client.</div></div><hr />
