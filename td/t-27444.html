I have an error when I dump a MMT session.<br />
I can generate fields with DFE but when saving, the message appears and no save is made.<br />
We are in SP2 install on winNT server.<br />
The DFE is a 7.6a10 version.<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">26th June 2006, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the TIV value for that MMT Session's Program Script.<br />
<br />
Refer to the SSA ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide<br />
Tools Interface Version (TIV)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The Tools Interface Version (TIV) is a concept supported by the SSA ERP LN Enterprise Server to guarantee backwards compatibility. By setting a TIV number to each object the behaviour can be different for incompatible features executed with different versions of the porting set or SSA Enterprise Engine. The TIV number is a property of the program and library scripts, and can be defined in session &quot;Program Scripts / Libraries (ttadv2530m000)&quot;. The bshell also have its own TIV number.<br />
<br />
Supported TIV numbers<br />
The supported TIV numbers related to porting set versions are listed below.<br />
<br />
TIV Description <br />
0 - 999  Supported TIV levels for porting set 7.5a and 7.6a  <br />
1000 Initial TIV level for porting set 7.5a  <br />
1001 Ftp functions added for portingset 7.5x <br />
1010 Initial TIV level for porting set 7.6a  <br />
1011 Ftp functions added for portingset 7.6x <br />
1012 Functions for Outbound Publishing <br />
1020 New functions in Bundle 2 <br />
<br />
MMT Session<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
To support MMT (Multi-Main-Table) Sessions, the format of the compiled form has been changed for both the controller and the satellite form. The new compiled form can only be executed if the 4GL Engine supports TIV 1000 or higher. This also means that the TIV of the form needs to be 1000 or higher. At the moment the TIV of the form cannot be set directly. Instead you must set the TIV of the script attached to the session. If the session needs to be executed by an older version of the 4GLE the TIV number should not be set (TIV=0).</div></div><hr />

So, I managed to solve this error by creating a script for my MMT session.<br />
And in the properties of my script I had a TIV valude at 1051.<br />
My porting set is 7.6b.<br />
Does it means that we must create specific script for each MMT session generated? :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
4.2.1	Program (UI) - and DAL script<br />
MMT sessions are supported by the 4GLE starting from Tools Interface Version (TIV) 1000 and higher. This means that the TIV of the forms must be 1000 or higher to be able dump the controller and satellite forms. (At the moment it is not possible to set the TIV of the form, instead you must attach a script to the session with TIV 1000 or higher.)<br />
Because the MMT session and the satellite sessions are separate sessions in definition, for each of these session you have to define its Program (UI) and DAL script, as you where used to do.</div></div><hr />
