If you want to exchange item data between companies you need to exchange at least two other tables, tiitm100, this table causes your error, and tdinv001.  If you have also have items wich contain text you need to exchange those also. Hope this will help you....<br />

Hi PeterH,<br />
<br />
I want to import new items in table tiitm001 with item, dsca, citg, and kitm fields in a csv-file with use of indictators. In the field relations I use a condition on field dcnt which: (in this order)<br />
- get item defaults depending on kitm and citg values<br />
- insert a record in table tdinv001<br />
- insert a record in table tiitm100<br />
- return dcnt value<br />
After this I fill combined fields with default values<br />
<br />
But:<br />
In the print log, I get a database error 100 and in the event logging I get:<br />
Reference does not exist:<br />
- FROM tdinv001[510] TO tiitm100[510] [            1237   ]<br />
- Reference does not exist: tdinv001.cmbb-&gt;tiitm100.cmba [            1237  ]<br />
<br />
Can You tell what I do wrong?<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

In session tuxch0121m000: Maintain Table Relations (import) I have to insert 3 batch lines:<br />
- Batch line 10: insert a record in table tiitm001<br />
- Batch line 20: insert a record in table tiitm100<br />
- Batch line 30: insert a record in table tdinv001<br />
Fill combined fields with default values on all batches.<br />
<br />
Or, can I do this a another way (better)?<br />

In  my opinion exchange schemes are good if you can get the data in desired format. You are trying to import from .csv file. I would always suggest to write a progam script as it is a more robust insense that one can do lot of things. Only draw back is that program script is not flexible for file layout. Currently I am in process of doing a migraton from other ERP package and I chose to use program script route as my conversion involves lot of business logic, which would have accomplished through exchange scheme, but with great pain. And alos exchange scheme cannot ead a tab delimited file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dorleta</div><div class="date">3rd December 2003, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the better way to import data in baan ( or another system ) is using the function servers. You can create for example a function server of maintain item and with a littlel program you can read the item from a file and insert in baan of the same way that would do the sesion, of this way you are sure that all the tables are actualized of the right way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harley</div><div class="date">9th December 2003, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Dorleta,<br />
<br />
How to use the function server?<br />
<br />
Please your advice<br />
Harley</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dorleta</div><div class="date">10th December 2003, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">steps:<br />
<br />
Create the function server:<br />
   you have to execute the function ttstpcreatdll in the parameter you have to specify the number of the session what you want to do a remote control and the name on your resultant dll. In this dll you have several function to control your session. Watch it.<br />
<br />
Session of import.<br />
 You have to create a sesion for reading your file and pass the data to the function server.<br />
<br />
it require a bit of patience but when you get one session all the rest of the BOIs that you do are very seemed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peters</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Dorleta for your reply to use function server. I am in the middle of studying this.<br />
<br />
But, for the mean time being I want to know how I can get the job don in using exchange.<br />
The workflow I mentioned in this thread still gives me a reference does not exist: tdinv001.cmbb -&gt; tiitm100.cmba error<br />
What must I do to get over this?<br />
<br />
Are there some exchange experts out there who can help me?<br />
Then cry out loud in this thread. Maybe with an example: How-to?<br />
For what I have read so far on Baanboard, I am not the only one having this problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dorleta</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">the error is clear<br />
<br />
The combined fields tdinv001.cmbb -&gt; tiitm100.cmba have relation.<br />
<br />
you are trying to insert a field (the conbination of  tdinv001.item and tdinv001.cntr) that not exists in tiitm100.<br />
<br />
Why? when you import items you have to insert records in tiitm001, tiitm100 an tdinv001 and in this order.Probably if you see the file log.bshell you can see the values of the record that cause your trouble .You can see too in the log file of your exchange (see the session code tuxch0101m000 to know the path of your log file)</div></div><hr />

<br />
At start of BaaN, we also loaded the itm001 file with exchange and had a lot of problems (163 fields ...).<br />
Meanwhile we created a script and a tempory load table with only the main fields like item,dsca,kitm,citg ... which is managed as an excel csv file by our users.<br />
In the script, we use the function to copy data from defaults (itm002 table), create the itm100 table and initialize the tdinv001 table.<br />
Maybe you need also the tdpur021.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peters</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the same table order.<br />
The log file includes:<br />
10|3|100|i|1232|Artikel9|110|I<br />
20|3|606|i|1232|Artikel9|110|I<br />
30|3|606|i|1232|Artikel9|110|I<br />
<br />
with fields:<br />
10 = batch line<br />
3 = ? (what is this)<br />
100 = database error 100 and 606 = reference error<br />
i = based on indicators<br />
1232 = item<br />
Artikel9 = dsca<br />
110 = citg, item group representation<br />
I = kitm, item type representation<br />
With citg and kitm the item default are filled from tiitm002<br />
<br />
Peters<br />
<br />
PS: Richard, maybe you can send me a copy of the excel script. Thanks. I don't understand the need of tdpur021!</div></div><hr />

There is not much involved in importing Item data and I have done many times. I don't prefer exchange schemes for various reasons.<br />
In order to bring item data all you need is two tables<br />
tiitm001 and tiitm100<br />
If you want to bring tdinv001, that is optional. In Baan standard session it does create a record, but I haven't come accross any issues if we don't bring tdinv001. You can bring tdinv001 if you wish so.<br />
<br />
It should be pretty simple to do this. Program script is my way to go. Just finished a conversion this weekend and it worked.<br />
