hmm...sorry for the confusion but there nothing wrong with the report. Here i attach the layout of the report for your information.<br />
5105</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th August 2011, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that is interesting.  All the graphics are there, but they just do not print.  And yes it should go out to 255 characters.  I have plenty of reports which go out to 220 or more.  The only thing I can think of is to try to re-add a few of the graphic |'s and recompile.  You might even try to put the report in debug mode to see what it is doing when it builds one of those lines.  Are the &quot;ffff' fields linked to a domain that might be longer than 4?  Grasping at straws on this one.</div></div><hr />

sorry for late reply. I had redraw the layout again and all the &quot;ffff&quot; field is not longer than 4 but the result still same. I still new in baan, may i know how to put the report in debug mode?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th August 2011, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">On the maintain reports form there is a compile button and a debugger button.  Click on the debugger button?  You did re-compile the report after redrawing the layout?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NotPro</div><div class="date">17th August 2011, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Mark <br />
i did re-compile it either in compile mode and debug mode......but result still same ...is it baan bugs ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th August 2011, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be a bug.  When you step thru it in debug mode do you see where it is building the line that will be printed?  You need to trace thru the report and to see if you see something inside the report causing the issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had click the debugger button and 5109 &lt;----these line shows up that same as if i click the compile button. Is this the correct way of debugging in baan ? correct me if i'm wrong .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th August 2011, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - just click the debugger button and it compiles in debug mode.  Then go run the session that generates the report.  The report should come up in debugger mode and you can step thru line by line and see what the report is doing.  I can't imagine why the graphics characters are not appearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NotPro</div><div class="date">18th August 2011, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear mark <br />
thanks for the information and patience guidance. hope i will find what going on 2moro in office. It is really very strange case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NotPro</div><div class="date">19th August 2011, 05:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear mark <br />
I had debug the session and i believe the lines shows in 5110 did the print out of the layout after line 200, but why the result not showing when output it on screen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th August 2011, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry been out of the office.  At this point I have no clue what could be causing it.  Assuming that is the pipe character - the debug shows a pipe at 201, number from 202 to 205, then a pipe again.  Why it does not show up on the screen is a mystery to me.  If you send it to a printer does it work?  Maybe there is something wrong with the screen driver and you should report it to infor.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply and your guidance. Sorry for late reply, because i'm having public holiday these few days. I had report the issue to higher management of my company, the process of reporting the issue to infor is depends on the management. For now the solution is devide the report into printing it from size (0700~ 2350) and size (2350~2500). For the print out part , i only manage to print untill size 2400 for A4 paper---&gt;5126, so the report is break down into 2 by using the way i mention above.<br />
