<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">25th May 2018, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We're using one LN Job running using planned tasks of Windows on our LN 10.2.1 system. The job is deleting the print history. LN will show a history of the job and the last time, the job was running in the job session.<br />
<br />
So let's assume your job is not running in LN. Well obviously its planned task is started in Windows, but somehow it is &quot;not going through&quot; to LN. Your're basically executing a batch. In this batch there's bw.exe, which is used to start the Job in LN. Bw.exe may not be able to run the job, but it terminates without any windows error, so the planned task will show an errorless execution of the batch file.<br />
<br />
I've been going through this too, when I was setting up the job: Windows executed the task, but no sign of execution in LN.<br />
<br />
I tested the batch by manually executing it in remote desktop on the server. So you can catch basic configuration errors (i.e. bw.exe not found; missing access rights).<br />
Then I started the planned task manually on the remote desktop. So you may get errors with the used windows user linked to the planned task. (Also check the windows error list of the server.)<br />
I had to fix access rights and file path until it worked. Did you try executing your batch manually?<br />
<br />
I did not use the Batch provided by Infor, I just started bw.exe like this:<br />
<br />
[/rem Job in LN starten<br />
&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Infor\BW\ERPLN\bin\bw.exe&quot; D:\erp61\job\job000.bwc<br />
<br />
job00.bwc has to be configured for auto login. <br />
<br />
In the field Command I've given the required parameter:<br />
<br />
-set BSH_JOB=WARTUNG ttaad5203m000<br />
<br />
In your case the field has to be empty, I think, because the parameters are added to the line of bw.exe. There's no need to change your batch. I'm just giving this as an alternative way.</div></div><hr />

This is my bat file and bat file for start job. Can u please explain how to configure bwc file. May be I have done some mistakes in configuring bwc file I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Premahari</div><div class="date">25th May 2018, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi can u please tell where to give password while configuring .bwc file. because, In .bwc file I couldn't find password.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">28th May 2018, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don't now if there are any tricks with the bw file. I just configured it for a normal login with password saved. (I did enter the given commands in the command field. So it's not a &quot;normal&quot; bw configuration.)<br />
<br />
I think saving the password is essential and is required every time you do changes on the bw.<br />
<br />
I do have the password=xxxxx line in the bwc file, so the password is saved.<br />
<br />
I think I saved the password, when manually configuring the bwc file, while being on the server using remote desktop.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stuckon4c4</div><div class="date">4th October 2023, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone. Sorry to resurrect an old thread but we're running into the same issue here. We have been running Baan using windows job scheduler for quite some time, but recently, the jobs have been doing this exact same thing. The windows tasks say they completed without error, but for large portions of a day they will all stop executing on the baan side only. Windows always shows it launched them. The weird part, and what makes it so hard to troubleshoot, is that it is seemingly at random times. I can't find any kind of rhyme or reason, and I've never been able to reproduce it manually. I've kept the server open all day sometimes and never seen an issue, but then a couple days later when I'm not on it, we'll suddenly have a bunch of jobs that aren't running on the baan side. Any help would be greatly appreciated, having trouble solving this.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />
