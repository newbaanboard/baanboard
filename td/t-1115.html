<br />
I know a solution with selecting data in the first company, assign the data to variables, switch to the second company, assign the varibles to the tables fields, and insert this in the second company.<br />
<br />
Is there no faster way? I mean assinging always all fields of the table needs a lot of typing work.<br />
Isn't there a way, just select a table in one company, switch to the other company and just insert the previous selected data in the new companies table?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

That type of exchange is the easiest:  just plug in the table names and you can have most of it generated.   You run the export in one company, then the import in another.    There is standard documentation on the baan support site that's easy to follow for this type of exchange.   Post your email back if you do not have access.  You can set up ranges to export.<br />
<br />
Another method is through Create Sequential Dump from Table (ttaad4226m000) and Create Table through Sequential Dump (ttaad4227m000).  That dumps the whole table.  It's also a little confusing, as you also have all those options to repair tables.  <br />
<br />
A quick and dirty way to dump the table is in General Table Maintenance.   When inside, hit the space bar...you get to a menu.  Choose &quot;Application&quot; / &quot;Export Data&quot;.  It will only ask for a directory.  It will dump the whole table.  You can actually modify that dump if you need to delete anything...  Then, switch to your new company in GTM, and run the &quot;Import Data&quot;.  The file is in the exact format it wants then.<br />
<br />
So..sure, lots of options.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

I tried Günthers solution, because it fits the most to my demand, and it works very fine.<br />

After i have copied the data from parent company to target company, i want to delete the record from parent company. Its like archiving. you insert a record in another company and delete the same record from current company.<br />
<br />
Is there a code to do this efficiently and not having me to assign all field values to variable, then insert those variables to new company and then go back to current company to delete the same record using variables?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">10th March 2016, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind that, for any table in BAAN, unless it is a small free-standing table with no references, copying records across company numbers or deleting records (ESPECIALLY deleting records) is not always a very simple task, due to referential integrity enforced within BAAN.<br />
<br />
For example: take Item Master (this is the worst case example, in any case). This table has several references like Unit of Measure, Item Group, Buyer, Planner, etc. which are MANDATORY. UNLESS the TARGET Company has ALL Of the references required by the Item Master Record being copied, it will fail due to missing references.<br />
<br />
As far as deletion is concerned: Item Master is the MOST DIFFICULT record to delete, because first, it is necessary to DELETE ALL of the related 'child reference' records: Purchase Orders, Production Orders, Sales Orders, Planned Orders, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I would extend the db.insert as follows to allow for handling the error (usually duplicate record error) instead of a catastrophic failure of the session:<br />
<br />
<br />
  db.insert(ttiitm001, db.retry, db.return.error)<br />
<br />
And then handle or ignore errors as appropriate.<br />
<br />
Also, for multiple tables, switch.to.company() may not quite fit in. So, instead, in my experiments with archiving, I was doing as follows (in which tisfc001 is the 'driving' table and its record is archived first):<br />
<br />
<br />
function archive.tisfc951()<br />
{<br />
        select  tisfc951.*<br />
        from    tisfc951 for update<br />
        where   tisfc951._index1 =  {:tisfc001.pdno}<br />
        and     tisfc951._compnr = :p.source.ncmp.c<br />
        order by tisfc951._index1<br />
        selectdo<br />
            tisfc951._compnr = p.archive.ncmp.c<br />
            db.insert(ttisfc951, db.retry)<br />
        endselect<br />
}</div></div><hr />
