You copied the report into a VRC that you can edit reports in?  I am no LN expert, but basing this off 4c4 experience.</div></div><hr />

LN might be similar to 4c4 but sure there are differences.  So I basically do what Bernd recommends. <br />
<br />
In 4c4 if I was going to change a report I would log into a development company.  I would go to maintain sessions.  I would then use special/Change Current package VRC - I would set it to what I needed for our DEV VRC  I would then go to from 2 and hit reports.  I would find the report I want to change and then just hit the copy.  It would default it the report into our DEV vrc.  I could then modify it and test it with the session.   Once approved by the customer we would move the report to the production VRC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like that idea - get someone local to show you the steps.  Because each user that develops need to be setup correctly and granted access to the VRC's. A couple of days or a week working with someone one-on-one will really help.  I did that back in the late 90's and it was very helpful.</div></div><hr />
