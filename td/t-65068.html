(The Environment is LN 10.3 (a.k.a. fp9) and Tools 7.6 a9 and porting set 8.9a, on Windows.)<br />
<br />
I am not experienced in development in environments where the user uses the web interface. I understand that that interface gives the user a smooth filtering possibility on fields, and reqmts related to this is the background to my Q.<br />
<br />
I have a development task where the requirement is to detect when the web-UI user changes the web-UI field filter on some field and then do a  simple calculation based on the records that are displayed on the userâ€™s screen (can be many pages) after the current filter setup has done its job.<br />
<br />
Do you know if there is a way to handle this with traditional tools 4-gl  and 3-gl programming? If yes, how? If no, what is the way to handle it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">5th December 2013, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor introduced the improved record selection functionality with FP7 (IMHO). I'm still new to this functionality too, but it is worth a look.<br />
<br />
Please check the latest programmers guide. Look up &quot;mark records&quot; in the index; this will give a first quick overview. There are more new functions I still haven't used yet:<br />
<br />
- for.each.record.in.view.do(..)<br />
- count.records.in.view()<br />
<br />
There's also a new standard-option present (select.all = 47) if you need to mark those records.<br />
<br />
Those new added functions may be the key to your requirements on calculating some values on selected records, but I still don't know how to detect (and handle) a changed filter in the script.<br />
<br />
Maybe using a button (i.e. &quot;Refresh values&quot;) or a special-option is the way to go? This will allow the user to access the calculation function in Worktop, too.</div></div><hr />
