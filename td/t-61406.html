- If all data is in an overview session, just use the Excel export that comes with Enterprise Server 8.7.2.<br />
- If you need to grab data from different tables, write a print session and a simple report and save the report to a file.<br />
- More complex: write the file yourself with the seq... functions.</div></div><hr />

The solution is very helpful to me and we are working on it.<br />
<br />
Prior to this, I have one more question which how to store the data from excel file to LN Database since I don't have any access to the physical Database in LN. <br />
<br />
Hope can hear any good news from this forum...</div></div><hr />

You can read data from the excel file and then insert or update it through querry  according to your requirements. You can find lots of scripts on this baanboard for reading data from a file.<br />
