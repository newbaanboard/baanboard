<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greasedman</div><div class="date">26th April 2005, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe ur using a sort of array with an index out of dims.<br />
<br />
Just like this:<br />
<br />
long a(10)<br />
long b<br />
<br />
b = 11<br />
a(b) = 3  &lt;--- ERROR<br />
or<br />
b= -1<br />
a(b) = 3  &lt;--- ERROR</div></div><hr />

The meaning of the error message is, that any datastring that Baan creates from your Form (for display or storing is the formsfile) is too long. It seems to me that the max. line length is 266 chars and becomes too large during creation.<br />

<br />
I have a requirement where I have to create a duplicate of table and a single occ session linked to the table (including form attached).<br />
<br />
But after creating the duplicate of the session I am unable to edit the form attached to it. I get error:<br />
<br />
&quot;index 267 out of dims [0] 266&quot;<br />
&quot;Cannot continue in ottadvformedit (&lt;170&gt;)&quot;<br />
<br />
The orignal session which I copied also gives the same fatal error on editing the form linked to it.<br />
<br />
Also their is no array field declared and used by me in the linked UI script.<br />
<br />
I tried to search this topic on the form, but could not find the solution to this problem.<br />
<br />
I think this error may be regarding the sort key defined for the session. I also tried changing it.<br />
<br />
I also tried delinking and linking the form to the session, but could not resolve the problem.<br />
<br />
What may be the reason for this error, also any way to resolve it?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are most welcomed.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards.<br />

Check form related data in table ttadv300, check xpos field and update value to 1.<br />

<br />
Your trick have solved my problem. Thanks a lot for the solution, now I am able to edit the form.<br />
<br />
Just for knowledge sake I want to ask some more question regarding same topic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any session where I cant edit the value for this field. I came across the session ttadv3105s000 where I can maintain the value for position 1, 2, 3, ... 9 but not for 0th position. I think atleast while creating the form we may be having some provision where we can set value for xpos for 0th position.<br />
<br />
<br />
If not then how can we change it's value other the GTM?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also in session ttadv3105s000 I am able to enter the value for xpos &amp; ypos for position 1, 2, 3,... 9 but on clicking save and exit button the values are not saved.:confused: Is there any specfic reason because of which the values are not been saved or am I doing something wrong?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<br />
Its glad to know that your problem is solved.<br />
<br />
I would like to answer your questions-<br />
<br />
1) You can not change value for zero sequence through any session(Except GTM). Zero sequence values updated when form is edited using 'ottadvformedit' utility and if there is any change in form position (which can be done using 'move window' option)<br />
<br />
2) GTM and form editor are the only tools to change form position values of zero sequence .<br />
<br />
3) You can edit form position value for any sequence from 1 to 9 by hitting 'modify' option from 'Edit' menu of session ttadv3105s000 and then save exit.<br />
<br />

<br />
All The Best!!!</div></div><hr />
