<br />
I have a peculiar problem with Form fields.<br />
<br />
When I open the form the labels all look distorted i.e. not in alignment.<br />
I have tried to change the alignment of all the fields to Left, Center, Right....also tried to make them Bold and stuff, but still it does not work,<br />
<br />
And the field labels looks very shabby.<br />
<br />
I am attaching the screen shot of the Form screen while executing actually session, and how it looks in the Form editor window.<br />
<br />
How to correct this ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually these are indeed Multiline label, just have a look at the screen shot..of the label field &quot;Maintain form label fields&quot;..<br />
<br />
In fact i will try the other way around..create multiple single line labels and check it out.....<br />
<br />
But, I sure want to know why are the lables looking distorted (missaligned)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">15th January 2007, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason for what is happening is that you have a line of single occurance fields (relating to &quot;Total CFT&quot;) in the middle of a multi-occurance layout. For some reason this confuses the layout manager that 'paints' the form (at least in BAAN IV c3).<br />
<br />
If possible move the single occurance line to the bottom of the form, say line 17 or 18 depending on how many lines of multi-occurance data you want to display. You may also move the single occurance line ABOVE the labels of the multi-occurance data. Just MAKE SURE THERE IS ONE LINE BLANK between the single occurance line and the mutli-occurance data.<br />
<br />
I guess those are the rules of the game!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed that was the case. The labels of multioccurance fields where above the single occ fields. <br />
<br />
After I shifted the single occ fields above multiocc field labels it got sorted out...</div></div><hr />
