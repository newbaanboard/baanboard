<br />
Various sessions in Baan allow for you to either load or save a file of some sort. i.e. Payment files in Cash Management, When sending output to Excel/Word device.<br />
<br />
At the moment when we want to load data into Baan, using one of these sessions we have to FTP the file from the local PC to the Baan server. Is there a way to direct Baan sessions to look at the local PC drive from which the client is running from? The same question for saving output from Baan to local hard drives.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

The solution presented is from the server to the client however the other direction is also available.<br />

<br />
I have attached a zip file with a dll and a small script for the client side which may is a other way of solving your problem.<br />
<br />
Just copy the script to your server and compile it as library. You know can call from any Baan session the function within the script.<br />
With the library you can copy from and to server, delete local files, get size of local files and start a local application (excel).<br />
<br />
The file script.vbs contains code to start the gui in the background and transfer files. (you can for example put this in a excel macro).<br />
<br />
I hope it helps</div></div><hr />

I don't pretend to be an expert at Baan development so I wonder if you could help me in getting you script to work?<br />
<br />
I have created and compiled a Library called tcmcsdllftp.<br />
<br />
How do I call a Library within a session script?<br />
<br />
I have attached a script from a session that I want to use your Library from, where the form field being used to enter the import file name is called 'filename'. Could you give me so guidance on how I should change this script to use your Library.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lakoon</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">yes...<br />
<br />
but tell me, <br />
<br />
1. Does the user give filename and path, or do you copy always from the same place?<br />
<br />
2. Where would you like to copy the file to (server directory)? Should this be the $BSE/tmp with temporary filename or should it be a fixed location?<br />
<br />
If we have to copy from different places we need one formfield, wehere the user can enter the path and the filename.<br />
<br />
...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 13:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Lakoon,<br />
<br />
The user will give a path and filename. i.e. C:\path_name\file_name<br />
<br />
Lets say the file is going to be copied to the $BSE/tmp directory using the same file name.<br />
<br />
With regards to the formfield are you saying i need an extra one to the one I alrady have? So I'll need a &quot;copy from&quot; filename and then use the original filename form field to tell the session where to read the import file from?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I have modified the script. Look at &quot;lakoon&quot;.<br />
<br />
please check the line with the string opration to get the filename. I'm wondering wether it works at the first time ;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
why so complicated, if the sollution is trivial and at hand?<br />
<br />
You are running HP-Ux11, with it comes a product called CIFS, which is Samba compiled with an HP logo. :-)<br />
<br />
It is supported by HP, so just call them up and ask them to help you configure it.<br />
<br />
It solves your issue, without installing anything new on the server or customizing anything in Baan.<br />
<br />
Samba will allow all your windows user to map his or her home directory on their windows PC as a drive. The user copies his file to this drive with the explorer and just impports the file. Because this is the home directory and the Baan bshell is also running in there, they do not even need to specify the absolute path.<br />
<br />
Trivial,<br />

I think we need to get this thread moved to the Tools Development forum, I will ask the Moderator.<br />
<br />
Whilst I'm here though. I couldn't try your solution on the session I originally had in mind as this was developed by a third party and I did not have the 'i' files to allow me to compile the session script. But I have another, in house script, that I want to try your solution on but I can't get it to work.<br />
<br />
This session is updating certain fields in the Item Master based on an input file. This file is normally saved to the Baan server and the path of the file is entered into a formfield called 'in.file'. I added your lines of code into my session script, which compiled with no errors. But when I run the session I get a error box saying &quot;c:\path_name\file_name File Not Found. Could you please take a quick look at the script to see if you an see anything obviously wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
