Now if you get the other date into the same format you can just subtract the two dates.  What is the format of your date and time in the table? Typically in 4c4 we just use a tcdate as our format, then have a separate field for the time(if we even tract the time).</div></div><hr />

Hello Bert,<br />
<br />
dte$() gives date and time as MMDDYYHHMMSS<br />
month-month-day-day-year-year-hour-hour-min-min-sec-sec<br />
This is what is stored after scan ?<br />
<br />
With num.to.date$(date.num(),0) you'll get:<br />
<br />
The actual date formated as string as DDMMYY<br />
<br />
time.num() are the seconds 'til midnight.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
If you only need to calculate the days between you can use:<br />
<br />
diffdays = date.to.num(lval(dte.field(5;2)),lval(dte.field(1;2)),lval(dte.field(3;2))) - date.num()<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope i have set all braces at right position.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bklunder</div><div class="date">6th April 2010, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick replies. I should be a little clearer on my request.<br />
<br />
I need to know how long a go a serial number was scanned because we shouldn't ship a unit until 24 hours after it was made (curing times etc). <br />
<br />
My library script has a select statement that populaltes a table with the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
string				curr.time.and.date(12)<br />
string				curr.time(6)<br />
<br />
curr.time.and.date = dte$()<br />
curr.time = curr.time.and.date(7;6)<br />
<br />
select *<br />
from tdwrt500<br />
where tdwrt500._index1 = {:serial.number}<br />
selectempty<br />
 tdwrt500.serl = serial.number<br />
 tdwrt500.date = date.num()<br />
 tdwrt500.time = lval(curr.time)<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
So if a unit is built at 23:50:23(HH:MM:SS) on April 5 I will have the following data in the table:<br />
<br />
DATE: 05-APR-10<br />
TIME: 235023<br />
<br />
If check in the morning of the 6th  at 07:00:23 with a date.num() - tdwrt500.date I will get a result of 1. I need it to give me a result of 07:10:00 (less than 1 day or 24 hours).<br />
<br />
Is this possible?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i do'nt have a BaaN system in front yet.<br />
<br />
I'll check the way your requirement will be solved.<br />
<br />
Idea:<br />
<br />
Date scanned and time scanned is stored in table.<br />
<br />
so<br />
date.num() will give the actual day (date).<br />
time.num() will give the seconds since 00:00:00 for the current day.<br />
<br />
Maybe with a little bit calculating it will be possible.<br />
<br />
I'll give you some hints the next two days, or someone out there has a ready solution?<br />
<br />

         I have got a logic which is mentioned below:<br />
<br />
<br />
curr.time.and.date = dte$()<br />
curr.time = curr.time.and.date(7;6)<br />
<br />
( (date.num() - tdwrt500.date) = 1) ? ((tdwrt500.time &gt; curr.time) ? 1 : 0) : (date.num() - tdwrt500.date)<br />
<br />
The above expression will return <br />
0   : if date is not changed or if changed, 24 hours have not passed on<br />
&gt;0 : difference between the days.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have myself not used this code, but I think it will work out for you.<br />
<br />

Hi Rahul,<br />
<br />
I think; there is minor change in condition required as below.  <br />
<br />
<br />
((date.num() - tdwrt500.date) = 1) ? ((tdwrt500.time &lt;= curr.time) ? 1 : 0) : (date.num() - tdwrt500.date)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It appears to be doing something. It is giving me either a 0 or a 2 depending on the date / time given. This is a good thing. I'm a little confused. What do the '?' and the ':' represent in this statement?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th April 2010, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">It is like a if then else statement. If the statement is true do the ? statement else do the : statement.  Kind of like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as attachment a way to calculate the differences, shown as Excel sheet.<br />
<br />
Break all to seconds an calculate with them.<br />
This will do the trick.<br />
