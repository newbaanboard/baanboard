<br />
You need to have an update session to update the data into a customized table.<br />
<br />
Now, in the customized table, you need Week Number field and Year Field.<br />
<br />
The basic thing here is to design your table in such a way that its easy to display the data as you need.<br />
<br />
Customizing the session is the next part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you are ok with n - weeks ,   you should have a temp table with to hold n quantities + the key fields.<br />
<br />
what bhushan said  can be combined in a single session ,  you can create a maintain session on temp table and on before.prorgam you can clear the temp table and reinsert the data  and fill in the  quantity values (as per your logic). <br />
you can always change the  form labels  in the program.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. I cannot fix the week because user can key in more than one year for the planned delivery date. If I fix the week, then the table will have a lot fields. Please advise. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Vamsi suggested, you need to decide the number of Weeks you need to show on your session. It can't be X weeks. AFAIK, there is no way to add data dynamically to the session. <br />
<br />
Another way is to create a window and add data as per your requirement using dialog.* function.<br />
<br />
But again that will make things complicated to program. <br />
<br />
Lookng at your table definition, I think you will need to tweak it. Instead of Week as single field, you might need to add Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 and fill the data accordingly with Week 1 Quantity, Week 2 Quantity ...<br />
<br />
This will make things easy to show.<br />
<br />
The last option is to have Week Description as Vew field.</div></div><hr />
