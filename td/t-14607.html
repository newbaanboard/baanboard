<br />
I have created a report where I'm using a company logo in a font. This font is assigned to User Font 1 and works fine when tested on my machine.<br />
<br />
Then, I go to a user's machine, install the font, start the report in preview and right-click on the area/single character representing the logo. All the options are grayed out - this user cannot change the font or choose a replacement font anywhere in this (or any other) report! <br />
<br />
Thinking that it might be a user-rights thing, I logged onto my machine (Win 2000) with this user's login and, as this user, I can change the font. <br />
<br />
So, I reckon it must either be a local bwprint issue, or a &quot;user-rights&quot; issue on this users' machine (Win XP). But where do I look?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertB</div><div class="date">26th February 2004, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick reply Gary - I just talked with our systems guy, and he says definitely, yes, many users have different versions of bwprint and he's in the process of updating these. Now why couldn't he have mentioned that this morning when I told him of this problem?  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'll try updating this user's version tomorrow and try it again...<br />

<br />
check registry keys on your machine for baan bw:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Baan\BwPrint\Fonts<br />
<br />
maybe you have to install this to your colleges pc.<br />

<br />
Yes, this was one of the first things I thought of, and I discussed it with the systems guy, but he reminded me:cool: of the differences between my OS and that of this, and many other, of our users (NT4 thro' to XP). So, a direct export/import of Registry settings will not always work. Sure, I could manually edit those settings on the user's machine, but it's best left to bwprint itself to alter these settings - and in any case, we're working on an approach of script-driven, system-wide, updates of stuff like bwprint...<br />
<br />
Isn't working with so-called &quot;computers&quot; fun:D ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertB</div><div class="date">28th February 2004, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I've since found out it's not the bwprint version - it's a Win XP thing. If the user doesn't have superuser rights, HE/SHE CAN'T CHANGE/CHOOSE THE FONTS IN BWPRINT - probably since bwprint writes its' settings to the registry. This is definitely a Baan &quot;feature&quot;! :p<br />
<br />
Maybe it's about time bwprint stored settings to a table or INI file on Win platforms... <br />
