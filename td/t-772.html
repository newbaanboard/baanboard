<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">14th January 2002, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">On Baan b2 I print a report with a text field. The text field has several lines. During the print of the the field, a page break occurs. On the new page one line is printed correct, after that, the rest of the lines from the text field, are suddenly printed bold, and totaly on the left side of the report?<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that the format changes within the text field, I have no glue, where ist comes from. <br />
<br />
Any ideas ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

It may show a CF$(1) [i.e., bold] being thrown in there for some goofy reason.  That would be the first thing I would check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">14th January 2002, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried the debugger. In case that field there ist no spool visible. Seems to be done with &quot;r_text_xy&quot;. Found nothing which can kill the format. Btw: due to the length of the string not all is visible in the debugger.<br />

Thanx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">14th January 2002, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">When I have had to look at text printing, it seems to have been printed using the r_print_text function.  This takes a ton of inputs.<br />
<br />
If you actually use r_print_text, then since the problem seems to occur only after the first line, you might try this.<br />
<br />
field.textfield:<br />
before.print:<br />
	r_text_cf(1) = 0<br />
<br />
This is the variable that gets passed to the r_print_text function to determine bolding, blinking, etc.  Of course, I don't guarantee anything :D, but it might be worth a quick try.  I ran a quick trial setting it to 4(REVERSE), and it reversed the lines after the first one.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
you`re right. I use r_print_text(). As far as I can see in the debugger &quot;r_text_cf(1)&quot; is set to zero, before the text is printed.<br />
Anyway, I followed your suggestion and entered &quot;r_text_cf(1) = 0&quot;. I did it in &quot;before.print&quot; AND in &quot;before.layout&quot; it doesen`t help.<br />
Perhaps you have to consider: The printout of the first lines of the text is OK. Than a pagebreak happens. After the pagebreak ONE line of the text is still OK, but all following lines are bold and shifted to the left border.<br />

Is this only for one particular text or is it universal when the text crosses a page boundary?  The only thing I can think of is very unlikely: having a bolding control code in the text directly or via substitution.  Sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The last time I worked with IVb is already some years ago. <br />
However I do remember that there was a bug with page breaks in texts. Have you checked that with the Baan support?<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
Uli</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Uli, hi Ed<br />
<br />
Ed: I checked the text an found no control-character. Also: Without a page break it works, Furhter: If other texts are interrupted by a page break the same thing occurs.<br />
<br />
I think I have had the same problem with an other report. So I think I agree with Uli, that it is a bug.<br />
<br />
I searched the Baan Knowledgebase (but can not spend much time). Find nothing yet, maybe there is to much info, bacause I think it doesnÂ´t concern a certain session.<br />
<br />
So my solution is for now: I calculate if the text fit on the page. If not I call a &quot;page()&quot;. That works fine and was fast done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx for your support<br />
