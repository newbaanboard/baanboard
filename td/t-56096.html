<br />
Somebody has offered a coursebook for Baan IV earlier in this forum. I wonder if an updated version of this book is available (ERP LN?) and somebody could make it available for the community. I know there are documents available which describe the tools module including development in LN quite well but a coursebook would be the best choice to start developing imho.<br />
<br />
So, any comments?<br />

In fact - I wasn't sure if sharing learning material is allowed or not. As the same stuff for Baan IV has been posted here, it looked like there shouldn't be any problem with the same stuff for later Baan versions... So maybe other way: Is it possible to legally obtain (buy) such learning material?<br />
<br />
Any information would be appreciated.<br />

Hi Pet, as your profile says your located in Germany i assume your native language is german. In that case you can try to get in contact with ITC Training &amp; Consulting in Hannover (ex Baan Schulungszentrum).<br />
ITC (http://www.tc-itc.de)<br />
Back in the old days i was able to purchase there training material (very good) for 5.0c.<br />
I don't know if they are still disposed in selling their material, but you can give it a try.<br />
<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />

The Infor copyrighted help / material whatever is available on this board is available only with permission of Infor (erstwhile SSA) . All documents  with statutory information (as shown by NPR) can not be shared / posted at random . This is applicable for earlier versions too . <br />
<br />
Even earlier ATC's can sell reference material only if they are channel partner now . Best way is to ask Infor only to guide to right channel partner or their education centre .</div></div><hr />
