<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smiffy</div><div class="date">19th December 2001, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an existing exchange scheme and have tried to add a condition to prevent a record being exported.  This means a condition attached to the table relations.<br />
<br />
However, the values of the table fields, do not feed through to the script.  I know that it is picking up the latest version of the script, as it has been tested by just passing a boolean of false and this rejects all the records as required.<br />
<br />
The table is declared at the start of the condition script.<br />
<br />
We notice in debug that the select on the table to retrieve the data for export, only selects the fields defined.  However while running a different exchange scheme in debug, we see that the select retrieves all table fields ; tablename.*  <br />
<br />
Can anyone help ?  Is there a procedure or setting that we are missing ?  The table has recently had a new field added, but I cant see this being the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must insert all fields in &quot;Maintain Paramets by Condition&quot;, that you want check in your conditionscript. I mean the fields of the table, that you want to export. You donÂ´t need to define the table again in the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smiffy</div><div class="date">20th December 2001, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but I cannot set the field up as a parameter, as it is not defined on the ascii file, (It is not required on the ascii file).  This doesnt explain why in a different exchange scheme, the values of the table fields show up when the condition script is in debug.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help anyway.</div></div><hr />

So you should regenerate the exchange script, as these fields will not be read now. If the field you want to check is one of the new ones, this for sure is the reason. If it isn't, this still could help (don't trust exchange further than you can throw it)<br />

I had created the export script, but there was still a problem.  However the new field was added to the ascii file definition (with a field length of zero) &amp; added to the table field relations.  This was then set up as a parameter and then could be checked by the condition script.<br />
<br />
I still dont understand how any actual table fields  cannot be checked in the script, but in another exchange scheme they could.<br />
