<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">4th May 2005, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a strange situation:<br />
<br />
I have a search session, in which the user enters a range of search words in the top part of the screen. After tabbing a field the query is performed again (rebuild.query and first.set), and the results are shown in the bottom part of the form, multi occurance.<br />
<br />
When using the tab to move between fields, everything works fine. When using the &lt;arrow down&gt; key, then - after once or twice - the system hangs!! I debugged, and saw that the program sequence is followed the same way as when tabbing, and the system simply hangs when it tries to execute first.set...<br />
<br />
Anyone an idea of what causes this, and how to resolve/overrule this problem? Can I trace/fetch the arrow down action in my program script? Then I could maybe bypass the issue by forcing a tab instead or so.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">4th May 2005, 16:07</div></div><div class="posttext">One more thing:<br />
when looking at the ticks while the system 'hangs', it runs approx. 10.000.000 ticks per second (10 million)!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th May 2005, 11:35</div></div><div class="posttext">One more remark: when I trace the predefined variable 'choice', it doesn't switch to a different choice when using the arrow down key. So not even a different choice is being used. I tried replacing execute(first.set) with execute(first.view), but then also the problem occurs. <br />
<br />
Anybody an idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th May 2005, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure you can trap the arrow key without writing a whole bunch of code.  There is a post in here somewhere that shows how to do that.  The way I solved this in one session is that I made the user click a button - then I ran a routine to make sure everything I needed was set.  For some reason no matter how many times we stress using the &quot;tab&quot; key the user conveniently forgets.  In this case the button calls the same routines that the &quot;tab&quot; does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g端nther</div><div class="date">9th May 2005, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Some time ago I also had that kind of problem. I decided to add logging code to each 4gl event (e.g first.set/before.choice: lprintf(&quot;first.set/before.choice&quot;)) and so on.<br />
<br />
lprintf() is a pretty old function of my own that does three things: open a text file in append mode, write to it, close it. The system overhead is not too much, but I can use a simple 'tail -f ...' to look online into baan ...<br />
<br />
Maybe that could help you to find out what goes wrong?<br />

Do you also remember if you found the problem or a resolution for the problem? Also, if already you mention it, can you please post me the source of your lprintf function? Just to satisfy my laziness...<br />
<br />
Thanks!!</div></div><hr />
