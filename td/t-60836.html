<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">12th July 2011, 21:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick question... my counterpart and I have been going bug-eyed with this and a fresh set of eyes may come up with a solution.<br />
<br />
Writing some custom code to build a text file and then bring that text file in as text to the purchase order footer text (tdsls040.txtb).<br />
<br />
Windows 2008 Server version of Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
When my counterpart runs the script it works fine for him, however when I run it I get a return code of -1 for the text.write() function.  The SSA ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide does not provide any insight as to what could be causing the error.  As best as I can tell, my user and his user have the same text permissions within Baan and our Windows AD usernames have the same permissions in the database and file permissions in the system folders where the text files are created and maniuplated prior to the text.write function.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any suggestions as to what could be causing the problem?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th July 2011, 22:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops my bad.  I meant to say check to see if they can read the file since this is text.write.  I would think if you can write to file in the directory you should be able to read, but mistakes happen.  I was also going to say double check and make sure the text group permissions are the same.  When our users change jobs we sometimes forget to update text permissions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">13th July 2011, 09:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Check also if your default text groups are the same if you have no default text group defined for tdsls040.txtb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">13th July 2011, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Ended up that I did not have a default text group set up and my counterpart did.  We tested with some other users and everything works now.  Thank you all for your assistance and suggestions!</div></div><hr />
