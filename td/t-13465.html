<br />
    How are you?,hope that you are  all doing well and enjoying yor time.<br />
<br />
<br />
 I am working in a program which its function to transfer records from some tables of a company to the same tables of another company, i am doing that by getting all the values of the fields of the records that should be transfered and assign them to variables then switch to the other company then assign the fields of the table by the assigned variables,and i find doing it that way messy and unreasonable,my thinking is that there is another way to transfer a record from a table to the same table  of a diffrent company,but i couldn't find this way out.<br />
<br />
  I will be apprciating if anybody can provide help concerning that task.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks In Advance.<br />
<br />
Yours Truely<br />
M.Adel</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Create Sequential Dump of Table (ttaad4226m000)<br />
   this will create a dump of the table to an ASCII file<br />
- Create Table from Sequential Dump (ttaad4227m000)<br />
  this will read the same file back, and you can change the company number.<br />
<br />
That's great for data dumps to test companies, etc.<br />
<br />
If you need to do it programatically, you can select the record, change the company number, then insert it.  The company number is a little known, not shown field that does exist on each table, so you can change it.<br />
<br />
<br />
db.retry.point()<br />
select   tcmcs045.*<br />
from     tcmcs045<br />
where  tcmcs045._index1 = ...<br />
selectdo<br />
            tcmcs045._compnr = new.company   <br />
            db.insert(ttcmcs045, db.retry)<br />
            commit.transaction<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Need better error checking and commit loop, but you get the idea</div></div><hr />
