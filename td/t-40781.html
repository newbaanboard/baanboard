The requirement is to switch from the current package combination to some other package combination and create records in that package combination. only super user has got the rights to access all the package combination so we can use Switch.to.company() but normal user cannot use the function.Can a normal user be given rights to access more than one Package combination? Or is there any other solution to meet the requirement. :confused: <br />
<br />
PLEASE SEND US THE SOLUTION ASAP. IT'S VERY URGENT.....</div></div><hr />

You might(not sure about this) have to give them some developers rights - but you do not have to give them access to the development sessions. So I think you can, but we do not do this.</div></div><hr />

That way you do not need to have normal users in the tools sessions.<br />
