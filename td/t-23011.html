<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 06:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone provide me with the latest manual document numbers and publication dates? I have manuals from 1998 and as I was advised in an earlier posting, new functionality exists due to the later porting set.<br />
<br />
I would then place my order with SSA for the updated manuals. <br />
<br />
I look forward to your reply.<br />
<br />
PS. I do not require the course material that dates year 2000 or so. I have the manuals for both baan iv and baan v.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we could find a way to read each other's manual without violating any licensing rules.  <br />
<br />
Since the licensing and distribution of most manuals is so strict, I would be cautious to recommend Baan as a long term product for an organization.<br />
<br />
Why be afraid to display what one can do with Baan. It's programming model and development language grammar is better than the competition's.</div></div><hr />

It was obtained from another Baan board, back in 2000.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You can always go to Baan support and search the documentation that they have available.  That is where I would start.  They provide many documents this way.<br />
<br />
You can also try the wiki (http://www.baanboard.com/twiki/bin/view/Progmanerp/ErpProgMan_Start) attached to baanboard.  Of course it is Baan V but most of it is relevant. Also run help that comes with Baan - click once on tools, then go to help and contents.  Between the two you should have a good starting place.  And when you run into problems you can always search this forum and if you do not find what you are looking for, then just post a new thread.</div></div><hr />
