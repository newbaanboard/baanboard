<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">26th July 2006, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a customized session which displays inventory units.  On that session I have a button which uses the zoom.to to open a sub-session.  The user then enters information into the sub-session and processes (Clicks continue).  The subsession performs some operations which change the number of units in inventory then exits and returns control back to the original session, however without manually refreshing the original session the inventory value displays its old value.  I tried this:<br />
<br />
choice.user.1:	| Customized session<br />
on.choice:<br />
	zoom.to$(&quot;tdosd9002m000&quot;, Z.SESSION, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
	next line of code to refresh data<br />
<br />
However when I debug, I never hit the next line of code.  Why is this and how can I get the data to refresh to reflect the new inventory unit value after the subsession updates it?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help.</div></div><hr />

I need a drink...  I went to debug one last time to be able to answer your questions and found that it was an ID10T programmer error....<br />
<br />
MENTAL NOTE:<br />
<br />
If you want to script after zooming from session1 in your script, make sure that you add you additional code after the code to call session1...<br />
<br />
not after the code to call session2.<br />
<br />
Can you delete the thread to save my embarrassment?  Naw nevermind... it will be a good lesson in humility...  Sorry for the bother and thanks for trying to help!</div></div><hr />
