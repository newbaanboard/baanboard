I use BAAN IV for several months so I don't really know how some parts work. I have to print two kind of labels. I go in a screen to print one and I have to go in another one to print the other.<br />
I have to every time to go to the printer, put my label, print the first and return to the print to turn my paper and print the other.<br />
I'd like to know if it is possible to create from 2 different screen a kind of page with the 2 labels like this 'll be able to put my blank label and print in one time.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />

Or are you printing a label and paper from same printer?  It sounds like there are a lot of options - we basically keep a dedicated label printer right next to a regular printer.  We send the labels to one and the reports to the one next to it - and typically it is one session we use.</div></div><hr />

To give more information: I have to print 2 labels on the same page. I have to go in a screen of BAAN IV to have the first labels and to go in an other screen to have the other label. Currently I have to print the first label on a part of the sheet, and to go to the printer to return the blank label before to obtain the second label from another screen and print on the same page.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know if it is possible to find a solution to print in one time the 2 labels on 1 page?<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th June 2016, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Not without coding of some sort.  I am thinking we use RMCis label to develop labels and then I would just need code to print the label. <br />
<br />
It might also be possible to write some AFS(or API) code that could do something for you.  The api code could possibly run the first session for you, print to a file, then run the second session, print to a file.  Then you have to figure out how to combine them to get one label to sent to the printer. Not even sure this would work - I have done something like it with baan reports set to ascii output, but not labels.<br />
<br />
I can't think of a method without coding involved.</div></div><hr />

I think it is too complicated for me. I think I'll continue to use the way I currently use.<br />

thank you for all help you gave me.<br />
