    It is my fault. I made a mistake. Count idle time and control Baan session auto exit or not, is not Baan itself. But a software which named &quot;CloseIdle 2.0&quot;. It is a program for Windows. In its setting file, &quot;Closeidle.ini&quot;, I found that:<br />
<br />
[I][Applications]<br />
1=Option Dialog<br />
<br />
[Option Dialog]<br />
Timeout=1<br />
MaxInstances=1<br />
MenuBrowserName=Dynamic menu browser<br />
RetryCloseWaitTime=2<br />
MaxCloseAttempts=3<br />
<br />
[Option Dialog App Commands]<br />
SubMenu1=File<br />
MenuItem1=Save<br />
SubMenu2=File<br />
MenuItem2=Exit<br />
<br />
[Option Dialog Terminate List]<br />
<br />
<br />
[Exclude List]<br />
1=Calling session<br />
<br />
Section: [Exclude List]<br />
<br />
This section can contain a variable length list of windows (identified bytheir title bar text) which should be ignored by CloseIdle.There is one entry provided in the default configuration: &quot;Calling session&quot;. This identifies the small pop-up dialog window that appears briefly whenever a BaaN session window is opened. It is not necessary for CloseIdle to &quot;hook&quot; into this window. You can add to this list any windows which are considered &quot;critical operations&quot; that should never be interrupted. You should use this feature with caution however, as a user could potentially use it as a means of preventing BaaN from being closed altogether.<br />
(Like:[Exclude List]  1=Calling session  2=BW Messages)<br />
<br />
<br />
The debug file contains:<br />

    Now I want to get the name of zoom session such as &quot;Calling session&quot;.Does anyone have used it? Please Help!<br />
