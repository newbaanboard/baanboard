<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tab0529</div><div class="date">28th June 2010, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a customized table and session to view it.  The table is similar to tihra100, hours accounting.  The index has year, week, day number, employee, week sequence number.  In the customized session, I defined this index to be used.  When I click the Find function, only the year, week, day number, and week sequence number are asked for in the input Find form.  The employee field is skipped.  Does anyone know why the employee data canâ€™t be input in the Find form?  The employee data is necessary to find the exact match.  I can add any definition data to help resolve this issue.</div></div><hr />

(1) Make sure this is the primary index on the session.  Just double check the correct index is active before doing the find.<br />
(2) Make sure the employee field is on the form AND it can accept input.<br />
(3) You might need to convert to RDD, log out and back in.  I have had that happen a couple of different times with sessions - not just changing indexes, but adding forms, etc.</div></div><hr />
