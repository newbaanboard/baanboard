<br />
I just want to find out if any of you have already commpleted this kind of requirement. I have been requested by a department that they would like to see which operations have been reported complete by which operators, on which days and at which times. I have this Excel layout that I am trying to achieve, I am just not sure where I would get the date and time information plus the operator from. Perhaps I can request your assistance on this please?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th June 2013, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Well our system is setup a little differently - we track who completed what in our own version of &quot;Report Operations Complete&quot;.  You can try checking tihra100.  I am just not sure what has to be setup to make it work - but it has an operations complete on the record, transaction date and employee.  See if that has what you want.  Since we use Autotime and our own complete operations complete those fields are not set, but maybe they work on your system.</div></div><hr />
