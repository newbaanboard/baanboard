<br />
I'm facing a problem that I get a message &quot;Unknown message&quot;<br />
<br />
when I check/uncheck some &quot;check box&quot; in the form...<br />
<br />
in the script I have no strange message boxes or displays.<br />
<br />
I just put some check box that I defined in the &quot;Maintain Form&quot;<br />
<br />
after playing with the form and check boxes I get suddenly<br />
<br />
this strange message box &quot;Unknown message&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea what is that? and why it happens <br />
<br />
(mostly when there are check boxes in the form).<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it looks like &quot;Not all Messages&quot; are converted to DD if you have no modifications in script.<br />
<br />
Messages are used in &quot;check.input&quot; e.g.<br />
<br />
Hope the hint helps, Bernd</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for replying...<br />
<br />
what strange that I have no using of &quot;message&quot; function <br />
<br />
in my script at all and no sections for fields!<br />
<br />
I get this &quot;Unknown Message&quot; in normal message box.<br />
<br />
The script I wrote uses BWDLL (app_start, server2client),<br />
<br />
and a lot of check box... and I use the check box a lot <br />
<br />
(select/deselect) I suddenly got the message!<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if you have found a solution for this yet - we just ran into it.   If not, we have not resolved yet either, but we have noticed the following:<br />
<br />
It definately has to do with the app_start - if you comment that out it is fine.<br />
<br />
It also has to do with the section and the start option of all things.  If in the before program and the start is modify set, which we had, we get the error.  If we change the start option to nothing, we do not get the error.  If we leave it at modify set, and move the check to the choice.cont.process section, we do not get the error.<br />
<br />
So, we have moved it around as a work around.  I don't like it there as much, but we are living with it. <br />
<br />
I would guess this is a bug of sorts - most likely a porting set issue or something, hopefully to be corrected.  Post up if you have resolved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dorleta</div><div class="date">21st November 2003, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that word ( or another apllication called with app.start )  send a message to the bshell that is unknown for it.<br />
<br />
the solution is:<br />
 app.start(....<br />
long dummy<br />
dummy = next.event()<br />
<br />
this extract the unknown event of the qeue and your trouble is resolved.<br />
<br />
Excuse my bad english and good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same Problem:<br />
<br />
	cmdline = &quot;cmd /c &quot; &amp;chr$(34)&amp; &quot;dir /b &quot; &amp; MIDIR &amp;&quot; &gt; ${temp}\&quot;&amp; MIDATEI &amp;chr$(34)<br />
	app_id = app_start(cmdline, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;)<br />
<br />
and I got (strange, not every time) the &quot;Unknown Message&quot;.<br />
<br />
I added<br />
<br />
	dummy = next.event()<br />
<br />
and everything is fine<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">16th September 2016, 22:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Following the postings on this thread, I have used app_start(..... followed with line &quot;dummy = next.event()&quot; to stop the stupid &quot;unknown message&quot; message.<br />
<br />
Since many have posted success with this technique, I'd like to comment that the dummy=next.event() seems to trigger a slow response.  I've noticed the spinner spins longer.  Has this been a problem for you?  What have you done?</div></div><hr />
