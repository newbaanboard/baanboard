<br />
I want to automate a job but am not able to setup the same. PLease find below the steps that I am folllowing.<br />
<br />
- I have created a job in company xxx having periodical and use external sched flag checked. (with user test - superuser)<br />
- The relevant sessions have been added to this job<br />
- The status of this job is &quot;Free&quot;<br />
- In /var/spool/cron/crontabs/job file the following line is added<br />
  30 20 * * 1 $BSE/etc/rc.startjob xxx &gt;&gt;/home/test/job.log 2&gt;&gt;/home/test/job2.log<br />
   (The user &quot;job&quot; is linked to company 000)<br />
- I did restart cron using /sbin/init.d/cron start command<br />
<br />
It didn't work. The job has got executed (log files are created) but the linked sessions are not being executed.<br />
<br />
Next, I though the problem would be the user &quot;job&quot; is linked to &quot;000&quot; company. Hence I tried to create a new file with same user name &quot;test&quot; in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/job and have copied the cotent of &quot;job&quot; into it and restart the cron. Still no luck.<br />
<br />
I have seen many threads on the same topic in this forum but couldn't get the answer. It seems that I am missing out some thing, help appreciated ..<br />

<br />
inprincipal you are on the right track. Here is what you do, if you want croin for scheduling jobs in Baan:<br />
<br />
a) For each company, where you want to run jobs, create a user, job000, job100, job500 etc.<br />
<br />
b) Test for each user, whether you can log onto Baan and have appropriate Super User rights.<br />
<br />
c) For each user, create a crontab, with the script you listed already.<br />
<br />
d) Restart cron or edit the crontab with crontab -e, depending on your Unix derivat.<br />
<br />
e) Make sure the user is allowed to use cron (cron.allow).<br />
<br />
Post the rc.startjob file here to have a look. The rc.start file is of now interest, in this matter.<br />

Thanks for your input...<br />

- I believe the first threee points (a,b, c and d), i have already covered. I suppose &quot;job&quot; is not a mandatory word in user name (in my case it is &quot;test&quot;). Please let me know in case you find any issues with it.<br />

The script looks good. So what does rc.startjoberr say?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The content looks correct, so:<br />
<br />
a) Did you check logs in $EBSE/log<br />
b) Is the job at all started in Baan, what does the job history say?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rajeev2012</div><div class="date">11th June 2007, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I have also tried to run the job from command lione but it didn't work. I have tried the following command:<br />

<br />
&quot;job.log&quot; is balnk and job2.log has followed line:<br />

hence, i beileve something is wrong with my setup ... <br />

Please let me know your views</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">11th June 2007, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, that clarifies a lot and you should have the same message in the mail of the corresponding user.<br />
<br />
It also mean, that your BSE_TMP is pointing to /apps/extend/tmp, which is a bit non-standard, but ok.<br />
<br />
Simply correct (as user root) the ownership and permissions of the directory:<br />
<br />
chown -R bsp:bsp /apps/extend/tmp<br />
chmod -R 775 /apps/extend/tmp<br />

<br />
I have made th said changes and have managed to get the job run manually (through commandline). However, still I am not succeed to get it automated. I think the problem would be company or access/permission. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">12th June 2007, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">If it runs manually from the shell, then you took a big hurdle.<br />
<br />
One reason, why these things then opften fail to run from cron, are simply environment settings. When you log into unix, a ton of enviornment variables are set (type env to see, depending on the shell you arer using). These enviornment variables are missing within cron. So you have to set them within the rc.startjob script. For example missing oracle enviornment variables could be the cause.<br />

Another scheduled jobs (patch management related) work for another user &quot;job&quot; ( the only difference is &quot;job&quot; is linked to &quot;000&quot; company)<br />

 - for root &quot;PATH&quot; variable has an extra entry &quot;/usr/sbin:&quot; that is missing in &quot;test&quot;<br />
 - for root SHELL=/usr/bin/ksh wheras for &quot;test&quot; it is SHELL=/usr/bin/sh<br />
<br />
I am not sure about the first difference but i feel teh later doesn't make any difference (as i tried sh as well as ksh command for manual job activation and uit worked).<br />

I have managed to get it worked. I was making a small mistake. I had created &quot;crontab&quot; file by copying the old existing file. Hence, I suppose all relevant fiels were not being updated with the same. Now, I have removed the &quot;crontab&quot; file and have created a new &quot;crontab&quot; file with the followed command &quot;crontab -e&quot; using &quot;test&quot; login.<br />
<br />
Though, it's woking, I am still curious to know which file was not getting updated  and causing the issue.<br />
