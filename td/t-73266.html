<br />
I'm having some issues with the excel extracts I'm trying to generate with BaaN SQL queries.<br />
<br />
My queries are most of the time quite simple: select without script and generate a BaaN form for the fields I want to display. However some of my fields end up on excel with &quot;spaces&quot; before or after my information.<br />
<br />
In a standard session you can easily use a strip$(shiftl$(xx)) in the script to clean your data but it isn't that easy directly in the form.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a clue on that point?<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Regards,<br />
Stephane</div></div><hr />

<br />
But in my version (LN 10.3) I can write the same function in &quot;Report Layouts&quot; -&gt; &quot;Report Fields&quot;<br />
<br />
You can add below expression in Report Fields<br />
strip$(shiftl$(xx))<br />

It was also our first idea to add a strip$(shiftl$(xx)) in the form. However the only place me managed to put it in is directly in the &quot;Print expression&quot; around the name of the fieldâ€¦ We then get a popup informing us that &quot;field isn't defined as report input&quot; but we don't see any impact in the excel extract. <br />

<br />
It should be working..<br />
<br />
I used trim$ function to remove white space from sentence.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Before trim<br />
Expression : whwmd215.item<br />
Domain : tcitem<br />
O/P :&quot;         C00001&quot;<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;After trim<br />
Expression : trim$(whwmd215.item)<br />
Domain : tcitem<br />
O/P :&quot;C00001&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope this will work for you...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sdietrich</div><div class="date">8th July 2020, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, this solution really seems not to work on BaaN IV. I also tried to play with alignement and size or format of the fields without success. Does anyone have another idea?<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th July 2020, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">It should work - if you are having problems on the form just try creating a new form variable called something like formfield_st1 - then set the form field in the script to the strip$(shiftl$(xx)).  The field on the form should not have any preceding spaces - same if passed that variable to a report. <br />
<br />
We always had a issue in 4c4 where the 4gl forms would sometimes add spaces on the form between fields(not in the field).  So while it looked okay in the maintain forms - it was not perfect on the display form.  But the field would be aligned the way we wanted it.</div></div><hr />
