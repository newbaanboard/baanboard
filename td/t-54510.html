I have searched the programmer's guide, this forum, and what few Google groups that are dedicated to Baan software, without any luck. What is the significance and proper use of the . (dot) notation, as in change.field.label()? In C#, etc., the dot notation is for inheritance, as in Sytem.Data.SqlClient.DataTable. That would translate to a Datatable from the SqlClient class, derived from the Data class, derived from the System namespace. In LN it appears that the dot is used instead of spaces or underscores? I appreciate greatly any light you can shed on this for me.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

To me in 4c4 the &quot;.&quot; means nothing - just a Baan naming convention setup for the internal calls.  I use it in my programs because of the site editor - it works better with the . in function names than the _ (underscore).  I can't wait to see what the LN folks say.</div></div><hr />

I do not thinked in question like that.<br />
<br />
Dot means exactly nothing..<br />
<br />
when in java you use <br />
<br />
<br />
void createSomethingElse()<br />
<br />
<br />
in baan we usually use<br />
<br />
<br />
function create.something.else()<br />
<br />
<br />
as there are no classes there are no acess to attributes.<br />
<br />
hope it helps =)</div></div><hr />
