   How to convert ticks into time (seconds) that the program is using in baan?<br />
   When u open Opiton Dialog and goto Shell...<br />
   You can issue command 'ps' to see current processes...<br />
   there one of the column is TICKS...<br />
   Can we get time from this ticks?<br />
<br />
appreciate your help</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, acording to baan help TICKS=number of used CPU ticks;<br />
Based on what I know about CPU's that mean the number of CPU clock units the CPU need to run a specific command(s) (I mean assembler commands). This mean that this number depends by CPU speed (not the &quot;comercial&quot; one but the real one-you will need technical specifications from the manufacturer) and let's call it work flow of the CPU (it's not necessary to be the same number for a specific process; what I mean is that there could be different depending by the CPU load, not much, only a few tick -because some assembler commands can be executed in x or y ticks).<br />
So, for accuracy you will need to know the MACHINE CODE of the process and then start to count for each command the number of ticks; this is if you want to precalculate this time.<br />
<br />
If you just need the value simply multiply the number of ticks with internal clock speed of the CPU.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help.<br />

Please refer to - Application Performance Guide - M2017 B US.pdf - Chapter 6- Profiling and Tracing.<br />
<br />
Profiling and tracing<br />
BAAN Application Performance Guide<br />
53<br />
6.2.3 Analyzing the profiler output<br />
The meaning of the column headers is:<br />
Count Number of times the function is carried out<br />
Utime User time in seconds<br />
Call Average time for certain function call<br />
Perc % Percentage of total time<br />
Stime System time in seconds<br />
Rtime Real time in seconds<br />
Alloc Number of allocated bytes<br />
Free Released memory<br />
Ticks Number of bshell ticks<br />
Function Name of executed function<br />
Each time in the output is the time used only in that function. The profile figures are<br />
not cumulated.<br />
So, if another function B has been called in function A, the time used in function B is<br />
not taken into account for the time logged in function A.<br />
The Rtime column is the most important column.<br />
This is the time a function really takes (a user must wait).<br />
For this reason, it is advisable to search for the highest values in this column.<br />
The Count column is also very important.<br />
The numbers in the Count column can be verified to see that the number is not too<br />
high.<br />
Because: count * call = rtime.<br />
The Ticks column is also important.<br />
The number of ticks indicates how may CPU ticks (instructions) are handled in the<br />
bshell.<br />
There is no relation between Rtime and Ticks because one tick take a fraction of a<br />
second, but it can also take many minutes.<br />
For example: A full table scan can be carried out in one bshell tick and can take<br />
several seconds (or minutes). A calculation can be carried out where thousands of<br />
bshell ticks are needed and only one second or less is taken.<br />
So, a function with a high rtime and a low number of ticks, is probably a function in<br />
which intensive database action has been implemented.<br />
A function with a low rtime and a high number of ticks, is probably a function in<br />
which a calculation or a fast database action with a lot of fetches has been done.</div></div><hr />
