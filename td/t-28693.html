<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">16th November 2006, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I've created a new table in our system in say VRC &quot;ABCD&quot; which has a parent VRC &quot;WXYZ&quot;. Package Combination B40CABCD has all ABCD VRC's and Package Combination B40CWXYZ has all WXYZ VRC's. The Baan company that is currently attached to my user has a Package Combination B40CWXYZ.<br />
And my user is also attached to the same Package Combination B40CWXYZ.<br />
<br />
Now when I run my maintain session which has this new table as the main table it runs just fine without any issues. However, for another user who is attached to the same company but Package Combination B40CABCD, gets this error while saving any changes -<br />
Fatal error: Error 1236 (bdb_errno 1236) on &lt;new table number&gt; in db_insert(51)<br />
Fatal error: Cannot continue in &lt;new session&gt; in DLL: ottstpstandard()<br />
Error: A not terminated transaction is aborted.<br />
<br />
Also note that if I change the package combination for this user to B40CWXYZ the session works just fine. Im thinking this has something to do with the runtime data dictionary for this Package Combination. However, I've converted to runtime dd for both Pk combinations.<br />
<br />
Really appreciate some insight into what is causing this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
MG.</div></div><hr />

Example in our test patch company everyone(including developers) comes into tpt which is derived from prd.  When I make a change I do it in tpt and everyone sees the change.  In this case it looks like you would be developing in our prd which would not be seen in tpt.  To test this can you log into the ABCD VRC and try to force it to create run time data dictionary on the table.  I agree with you it looks like abcd's RTDD does not know about the table.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for you input ... actually I was developing the components in the correct VRC but I had done rtdd for both VRC's. And for whatever reason, the ABCD VRC had the dd messed up.<br />
<br />
So deleted everything and recreated the table and converted to rtdd and now it works fine ...<br />

Thanks,<br />
