<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">masoodhn</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">How can I convert a black screen baan correction program like otfcor9995 so that I can create a job out of it as oppose to getting this ascii screen which does not allow to make a job out it.<br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">First - only one post is necessary.  I deleted the other.<br />
<br />
Second - In this case I am not sure how you could do this.  Have you asked Baan about this?  Since I am not familiar with this session or actually the correction programs I am not sure what is available.  I can not remember if the large correction programs we use to run were done manually or with a job. It seems to me Baan also converted one other correction program so we could run it in batch.  Really do not recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">masoodhn</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Running the otfcor9995 object would eliminate the need to run the following correction sessions/objects: <br />
<br />
1.  otfcor9997 --&gt; corrects rounding in the tfacr200 table<br />
2.  otfcor0950 --&gt; corrects rounding in the tfacr201 table<br />
3.  tfacr2245m000 - need to recalculate customer balances after rounding in the tfacr tables are corrected<br />
4.  otfcor9996 --&gt; corrects rounding in the tfgld106 table<br />
5.  otfcor9994 --&gt; balances docs that might be out after running otfcor9996.  May or may not be needed<br />
6.  tfgld3203m000 - need to rebuild ledger history after correcting the rounding in the tfgld table<br />
<br />
Since this will fix the problems in the tfgld410 table before it gets posted to finance.  <br />
<br />
And since the posting is done several times per day, therefore, if we run this session/object once daily as a job, then it would eliminate the need to run all of the above mentioned correction programs to fix the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't run it on our system.  What happens if you do attach it to a session with a form?  Have you just tried it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">masoodhn</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">But the same form keeps coming back up.  My form does not show up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danny Leolux</div><div class="date">8th August 2006, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I build simular correction programs in my time at Baan Support. These were build only to run as an object. They were created as 3GL program without standard program. So no session or form object.<br />
<br />
Therefor they can only be runned realtime and not in a job.<br />
<br />
However often the scripts of these correctionprograms are present on your system. If you know how to modify them you could turn them into a real Baan session with session and form object. Then of course you could run it in a job.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this helps,<br />
