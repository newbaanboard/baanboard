If not then you need one of the source extenders, like Qkey, RMCis, or ~Vamsi's solution in the code and utilities forum.  This would allow you declare more form field to be used in the reports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">U.R.Naga Kumar</div><div class="date">9th October 2007, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">dear Ralph,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th October 2007, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I missing something?  It sounds like they are trying to declare a form variable in the report.  I do not think that is possible - even in ln.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th October 2007, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally nobody use procesinfo while  attaching the session to menu. So even this variable can be used besides free$ .<br />
<br />
Problem with free$ is that it is single memory location in bshell . So if user modifies the same in one program, it becomes available in other program .So it can yield unpredicatable results if the same has been used in many programs as user input fields.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica23</div><div class="date">8th January 2008, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks george...but yet my prob not solve....actually when i run session it gives error unknown  formfield's i dont have script access thats why could not check whether its external declare or not.....i check report script i found they use free$ variable...i dont have any idear of this predefined var....could u help me plz?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th January 2008, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The link George pointed to contains a solution that will let you create a script.  You can then declare the variable in the script.  The script works as a wrapper around the original Baan object.  Without the script using a wrapper program like this is the only way I know of to get a form field declared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">9th January 2008, 05:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe in Baan 5 free$ does not exist. U can try procesinfo$ on form ,import the same in report . It can be 200 character long. <br />
<br />
This is the value which developer can use when linking sessions to menu .Normally  these are always empty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can assure you that free$ exist in BaaN5 it even exist in Ln.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th January 2008, 06:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Then it may not be declared in standard program  for that version (V)  if user is getting unknown form field . <br />
<br />
I would prefer procesinfo$ over free$ as procesinfo$ is not shared across program and changing it in one program will not affect it's value in another program of same bshell .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">14th January 2008, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Folks, &quot;use a source code extender hack&quot; is not an awnser that will help a beginner. <br />
<br />
Without using any hacks (that I strongly discourage to use), there is only one awnser:<br />
<br />
It is not possible to extend a print session with new form fields without having the source code of the session and most likely also other source codes of (Baan) Dynamic Link Libaries. It is further not possible to extend a session with new fields without having licensed the development environment, since you will have to modify the session script. <br />
<br />
If you buy an ERP Software without insisting the vendor makes the sources available to you, you will run into that sort of problem, sorry. You will have to ask your implementer to do this software change for you.<br />

Relevance of complex tricks to beginners and going back to implementors is alright. <br />
<br />
Finally end user is the best judge for that .</div></div><hr />
