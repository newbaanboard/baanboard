<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marlowe</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 01:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done some customisations to the Sales Invoice layout cisli220011000 in Baan5c. This report is used by several sessions, most notably Print Invoices (cisli2400m000) and Reprint Invoices (cisli2405m000). There is a skip.to(spool.pg.length - 12) in an after.field section so that the totals print at the bottom of the page. The problem I have is that these print higher up the page when the report is called from Print Invoices than when it is printed from Reprint Invoices. The page length on the report is set to 64. When I run the report using the debugger spool.pg.length is set to 64 (correct) when called from Reprint Invoices, but when it's called from Print Invoices spool.pg.length is set to 60. Any ideas how this can happen? I have done a Create Runtime Data Dictionary for each session. Could spool.pg.length be set in the session script? I don't have access to the source code so I can't check. Any help would be most appreciated.</div></div><hr />

1) Are you sure that you use the same paper type ?<br />
2) same printer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marlowe</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I am using the same paper type and the same Windows printer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the page length on form 2 of the report? The only places I am aware of that set spool.pg.length are the device and the report.  I also looked in my old 4c3 documentation is there is no mention that spool.pg.length is read only.  So maybe the sessions are setting it. No access to baan 5 source for this session.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marlowe</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 23:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The page length is set to 64 on the second form. I don't have the program source, but I can only assume that the page length is being set there. I have tried setting spool.pg.length to 64 in the before.program section of the report script. It works, in that it stays set at 64 when I get to the skip.to() part, so more lines are skipped, but the after.field section gets printed on a second page, presumably because the Print Invoice session still thinks that the page length is 60 and that there won't be enough room to print it on the same page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 23:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - it is too late at that point to set the page length.  Spooler is already open for the report.  Not sure what you can do in this case - unless you can check for the parent session. Then say something like:<br />
if parent.session = &quot;cisli2405m000&quot; then<br />
  skip.to(spool.pg.length - 8)<br />
else<br />
  skip.to(spool.pg.length - 12)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is possible or if it would fix the problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marlowe</div><div class="date">17th December 2003, 00:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I might have to do that. That would get the two prints looking the same, even if neither of them filled the whole page. Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />
