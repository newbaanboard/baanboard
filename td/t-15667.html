<br />
How do I determine which fields in ttadv301 (fields by form) are actually placed on the form with which they are associated?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the field name in table and session object name with which the field is associated are always same. In this way u can guess which field are actually placed on the form &amp; associated with which object.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">15th June 2004, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">For instance (4c4) tccom010.ctit (title) appears in the fieldlist of form tccom1101m0001, but is not present on the form itself. It is only there because the table is linked to the form.<br />
<br />
What I need is a criterium to collect form fields that are actually _on_ a form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th June 2004, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Think u can do so with pre-defined variables form.curr , curr.pacc$ , table ttadv211 , ttadv112 and ttadv301 .</div></div><hr />

I could not find a case where the field is in the field list(ttadv301-form fields) and it was not on the form.  I am on 4c4 and the maintain form field session does not let me maintain the fields.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">15th June 2004, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">That's why I double-checked ;)<br />
<br />
Sticking to form tccom1101m0001 (from session tccom1101m000), I see<br />
tccom010.ctit, tccom010.geoc.1.9, city.limits.5, tccom010.seak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">15th June 2004, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is not that the fields in ttadv301 are not accessable, the problem is that they are not being used.<br />
<br />
I need to know what fields are actually used in the fom lay-out, not which ones are available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th June 2004, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just checking one of my sessions that has a table with 30/40 fields and uses 3 forms for input.  I only see those fields that are on that form.  The tccom010.ctit field is on my tccom1101m0001 form.  I can not seem to find an example of this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">17th June 2004, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">The discrepency between ttadv301 and actual form can occur in 2 cases.<br />
<br />
1. programmer has used function input.field.invisible function to make the field invisible. Think less likely situation in ur case.<br />
<br />
2. the form dump has been copied / delivered at the directory level without updating the same at tools level . In such case u can see the field variables at command prompt in unix by command 'strings &lt;formdumpfile&gt;' . We have quite few such cases of some programs from original installation.<br />
<br />
So finding out such fields programatically is quite difficult.</div></div><hr />
