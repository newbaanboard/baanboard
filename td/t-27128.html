<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onnoboer</div><div class="date">17th May 2006, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I created a form (BaanIV_c4) and put some graphical lines on it. In the editor everything is ok but, after dumping the form, the lines are not visible. The only line that can be seen is the graphical box but that's not really a line.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a clue to solve the abovestanding issue??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">17th May 2006, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The graphical lines drawn on a form using the &lt;CTRL&gt;[G] option are visible only when using the 'green monster' screens (VT52, VT100, etc.).<br />
<br />
It is not very pretty, but to be able to see the graphical lines on the GUI display, use the &lt;ESCAPE&gt;[G] to draw the lines (actually, it always draws a box, so the 'line' looks strange on the form editor, but once placement is achieved, will look just fine on the GUI form.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onnoboer</div><div class="date">17th May 2006, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your input but I wanted to use the line to draw an arrow and that's not possible using the box-line functionality.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope ive got your query right. Have you tried creating a line with underscore character &quot;_________&quot;.<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onnoboer</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I've tried the underscore. The goal to achieve is an arrow like this:<br />
                                            ^<br />
                                            |<br />
                                            |<br />
          ------------------------|<br />
                                            <br />
The problem is that the underscores / lines and arrows don not properly line out in the form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You may define display only fields on the form, then control in the program script what characters they are filled with.  I did this once to make a very similar (awkward) arrow on a form once too.  Works as long as you don't want too fancy of graphics, your example looks do-able.</div></div><hr />
