<br />
I am storing a text field using an external editor (notepad.exe) but Polish characters are not well stored (attach example). It works well with the standard text editor.<br />
<br />
I was searching solutions here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=24740) but I could not find it.<br />
<br />
Do you have any piece or advice to solve this issue? Which other information I should mention?<br />
<br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />

There is the interface (where you edit text with notepad, so I assume you do not use LNUI but native BW or such?<br />
So there is conversion of &quot;strange&quot; characters all over the place.<br />
From database character set and collation to the UI (uses TSS), OS characterset, presentation on the screen in the session, then to notepad (again TSS to OS characterset) en from notepad back (OS characterset to TSS) and into the database. Just to name a few.<br />
Then there were changes in the way conversion is done and issues where setup (database driver conversion and UI conversion) was not always in line. <br />
<br />
We encountered an issue with the â‚¬ (Euro sign) in one of our item code (tcibd001.item) that caused internal errors. Dropped the incident with Infor Support and they suggested a complete database conversion and fixed setup. Because of the recent extra changes our setup was outdated and faulty.<br />
<br />
Suggestion - Ask experts from Support.</div></div><hr />
