I have been getting an out of dims error on the standard maintain customer session - &quot;index -1 out of dims [1] 5&quot;.<br />
What confuses me is that it is a standard program with no modifications. I am further confused because there is no exception/error raised in the NT event viewer that might give me an idea as to which field in the table is causing the problem.  (Yes,  it is true I am often confused by Baan.)<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this before?  Could the standard program become corrupted by patches?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For sure it's a bug, most often it's referring to a position within an array that is not valid.<br />
<br />
I don't want to say that the standard program gets corrupt by patches but don't that the guys that work in the baan company are human too. So they make mistakes also.<br />
