<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">30th July 2002, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed a problem that keeps occuring recently.  When I run program scripts in debug mode and I click on a variable to see whats in it, I get the error &quot;Connection with server lost, reconnect?&quot;  This is a recent problem and I suspect it has happened since we upgarded our Porting set.  We are currently on 7.1c.03.  We are running Baan ERP 5b<br />
<br />
We have logged a case but I was wondering if anyone else has come across this problem?</div></div><hr />

(Environment is HPUX and BAAN IVc).<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, the connection loss was in a different session, I forget which one, not the debugger as in your case.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this problem is known for your operating system and development is working on it. We have the same problem.<br />
<br />
If you type in the variable name then everything is working fine. <br />
<br />
Bye,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 00:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a similar problem, except that putting a script into debug would allow us to &quot;click&quot; on the variable to see the value, but if we typed the variable name, the BW connection was lost.<br />
<br />
Also, as we are on UNIX, when we used the VI editor, pushing the tab key, would cause the cursor to move two tab positions. This was a pain, cause we had to push tab then backspace, to move only one tab position.<br />
<br />
Anyway; it appeared the problem was our BW version. We loaded the latest BW client for Baan V (verison 7.1c.04.147) and the problem is now fixed.</div></div><hr />
