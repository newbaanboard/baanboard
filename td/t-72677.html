<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">11th February 2020, 04:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using Extension Modeler type Session. I added a standard form command in order to implement something after a standard form command is executed without any error, but the point is that I don't know how to check if the standard form command is error or not. Is there anything like a variable or function to check for such result?<br />
<br />
For example, Clicking putaway in Warehouse Receipt session (whinh3512m000) and expect it to putaway. After it is done, I want to implement something for this condition. If it has any error or putaway is not success, then I want to do something else.<br />
<br />
I only found Before Command and After Command for the available Hooks but these hooks alone cannot get the job done.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

If it is &quot;Put Away&quot; then you can execute what you want to execute. There is no other way by which you can check whether the form command is executed successfully. <br />
<br />
There might be some kind of flag which is updated on the successful completion of the form command code.</div></div><hr />
