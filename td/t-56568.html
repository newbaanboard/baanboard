  <br />
I am working with Infor LN 6.1 SP 3.  <br />
  <br />
We have actually a requirement that tell us, &quot;We need a session that on the top of the form, it has a grid and the bottom of the form another grid&quot;.; that is, the customer request us that he needs a special version of Multi Main Table.  <br />
  <br />
My question is Â¿Is it possible to make in LN?  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
Thanks a lot.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">19th August 2009, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">No.  Baan has a 4GL development environment that tells you as a developer how to do things. This is a feature: As a user, if you know how to handle a particular session type, you know how to handle all the sessions of that type. As a developer, if you know how one UI script is working, you know how all UI scripts are. No session-by-session fancy &quot;clever&quot; stuff to learn.<br />
<br />
Of course you could reinvent the wheel (the 4GL environment having a standard program) and reprogram everything from scratch using user interface objects (DsCGrid), programming your own event loop and everything.<br />
<br />
But this would be exactly the type of addons/customizations that cause a maintainance nightmare. You're relying on concepts that are subject to change or go out of existence on very short notice. If your customer tells you to do it anyway, don't do it. If you boss tells you to, don't do it. Just never ever do it, it's like programming your own filesystem if you need to program an email client.<br />
