<br />
I want to create a new session that will export data from couple of Baan tables and put it in an ASCII file  on a specified location (file name and path will be user defined). I have few questions/requests.<br />
<br />
1. Can anybody please provide me with a sample program script or pointers to accomplish this (Using BaanERP5.0c.<br />
<br />
2. As my BaanERP 5.0c system is on a windows network, will it be possible to put that extracted file directly on a 'Mapped Network Drive' (rather than creating it first on a local drive and then copying it over the network)? Does any body know if it is  possible? I tried using a mapped drive in the Exchange Scheme but it didn't work. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st October 2003, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Are we talking the complete tables?  Or just certain data.  The way I do this is to create a session that generates a report.  I run the report to a device with a driver that I designed - you can check out some samples in the Code and Utilities forum for ttstpconv.  This device does users the server2client command to copy the report down to where the user wants it.  Or if it is always going to be the same place you could run the report to an ascii file and do the server2client command all in the script.<br />
<br />
If you want to export complete tables you could try this:<br />
<br />
function export_table()<br />
{<br />
| Setup the comp and table.name before calling this routine.<br />
	string	cmd(200)<br />
<br />
	cmd = &quot;bdbpre&quot; &amp; bse.release$() &amp; &quot; -t &quot;&quot;|&quot;&quot; -N&quot; &amp; table.name &amp; &quot; -o somedir -C&quot; &amp; str$(comp)<br />
	e = shell(cmd,0)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
This will create a | delimited file and you could use server2client to copy it down.  I am sure there is a way to create the file on the local drive to start with, but I always like the option of having a backup on the server.<br />
