If you want to use Windows Scheduler on your server to schedule the job, try this:<br />
<br />
1.  Create a new LN Job (ttaad5500m000) called PEGGING and tick the Use External Schedule check box.<br />
<br />
2.  Add your Generate Pegging Relation session to the Job.<br />
<br />
3.  On the server create a Startjob.bat that looks like this:<br />
<br />
@echo on<br />
@setlocal<br />
<br />
@if &quot;%1&quot; == &quot;&quot; goto argerror<br />
@if &quot;%BSE%&quot; == &quot;&quot; goto argbseerror<br />
<br />
@if NOT &quot;%1&quot; == &quot;&quot; set BSH_JOB=%1<br />
@if NOT &quot;%2&quot; == &quot;&quot; set BSH_JOBOK=&quot;%2&quot;<br />
@if NOT &quot;%3&quot; == &quot;&quot; set BSH_FRSES=&quot;%3&quot;<br />
<br />
%BSE%\bin\ntbshell.exe -server ttaad5203m000<br />
@goto end<br />
<br />
:argerror<br />
@echo Usage: startjob name-of-job-to-start [jobfile-OK] [From-session-number]<br />
@goto error<br />
<br />
:argbseerror<br />
@echo Error: environment variable BSE not set. Set BSE variable before executing this script.<br />
@goto error<br />
<br />
:error<br />
@REM generate error on OS level<br />
@dir /fake &gt; nul 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
@goto end<br />
<br />
:end<br />
@endlocal<br />
<br />
4.  Create a Pegging.bat that looks like this:<br />
<br />
call startjob.bat Pegging<br />
<br />
5.  Use the Windows Scheduler to schedule Pegging.bat</div></div><hr />

I have opened 'Sessions by Job' (ttaad5501m000) session to add sessions into my job, but new button is coming disabled into that session.<br />

Hi Nirali,<br />
<br />
The proper way to add sessions to a LN Job is to select the Add to Job... button in the session itself. Then you can select the Job to add the session to.<br />
<br />
I would recommend that you go with an external Job Scheduler such as the Windows Scheduler ... the LN scheduler is not very flexible or reliable.<br />

Does your Generate Pegging Relation session have an Add to Job button as in the attached document?<br />
