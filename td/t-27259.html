<br />
The customer has the requirement to use company's logotype on some documents like invoices. (It is a little drawing of a horse.).<br />
Someone in our organisation has told the customer that this can be done with SSA Ln6. <br />
I can not find anything in the report writer that supports this.<br />
Anyone out there who can be of assistance?<br />
<br />
- How to get the picture into the report ?<br />
- Best way to represent the picture ? (gif-file or x or y)</div></div><hr />
