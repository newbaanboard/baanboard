<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Graf</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to create a report that shows customers sorted in descending sales amount.<br />
<br />
My program script is reading table tccom010 and then reading through table tdsls045 for each customer and accumulating a total for that customer.  I then do a rprt_send() in the program script for that customer.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I am sorting the report by the accumulated amount in descending order.  One of the requirements is that I create a column that ranks the customer according to his position in the report.  I don't think that I can calculate this in the program script because the sort is happening in the report.<br />
<br />
Example of needed report output:<br />
<br />
Rank     Customer                 Sales Amount<br />
1           111111                           90,000<br />
2           333333                           85,000<br />
3           222222                           80,000<br />
<br />
It seems that I can do something in the report script but I haven't been able to make it work.<br />
<br />
All replies appreciated.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Graf</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your responses.  I have tried all of the suggestions (as well as all the variations that I could think of) and still the rank number appears as 1 for every line.<br />
<br />
It appears that the coding that is suppose to increment this number is only being executed the first time.  I think that the way the program script and the report are interacting is different than the way I thought it worked when using different sort fields.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I will keep trying and let you know if I figure it out.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">If sorting by the calculated amount I would suggest using the line count in the after section of the amount field.  (You would need to account for situations where exists more than one customer per<br />
descending amount).<br />
<br />
Also note, if you are suppressing lines in the report (print expression other than 1 on report layout) then the calculations<br />
will not come into play.<br />
<br />
What are the sort fields on the report and what is the defined sort sequence ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Graf</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have the report set up to use the after calculated field to update the ranking.<br />
<br />
I am not suppressing the printing of any lines.<br />
<br />
The sort in the report is as follows:<br />
<br />
calculated amount field           Sort Seq. 1 (Descending)<br />
customer number                    Sort Seq. 2 (Ascending)<br />
<br />
The program script is reading tccom010 index 1 by customer number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have the a line the states that line.count = 1 try changing this to line.count = 3 (or anything but 1).  This will help us determine if the line.count + 1 calculation is ever being touched.<br />
<br />
If this line is not being touched then all counts should show as<br />
the new value.<br />
<br />
It may also be possible that instead of defining line.count as line.count + 1 simply use the aggregate function of count for<br />
incrementing the line.count value based on the desired layout<br />
section you which to base the increment on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, do post :)<br />
<br />
Also, try declaring the line.count as a Report Input Field, NOT as an external in the report script.<br />
<br />
Try debug and see if line.count = line.count + 1 ever gets hit, etc.  If so, place a trace and see if it gets reset somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Graf</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I defaulted the initial value to 3 instead of 1.  All of the lines on the report then came out with a value of 3.  This means that the increment code is never being executed.<br />
<br />
I have not tried the count function but will give that a try also.<br />
<br />
Being fairly new to this board I am not sure that I know how to post my code but I will see whats involved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 22:57</div></div><div class="posttext">should be fine. I thought you might be on a IVb version.<br />
<br />
If you want to sort on the calculated field - make sure the field is defined in the input fields section as sort 1.   <br />
<br />
But I do not think that a field that is calculated in the report script can be used as a sort field, as the sorting has already occured at this point. This is what I think but am not 100 % sure.<br />
<br />
Can you not get the total delivered qty for each customer from a different table ? look at some of the report/display sessions in the sales module.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Graf</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The field that I want to use to sort is calculated in the program script (slsamt).<br />
<br />
The field that I am having a problem with is calculated in the report script.  I just want to print this field, not use it for sorting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I had some time on my hands so I made my own session following your guidelines and it worked for me.  I dropped the line<br />
<br />
order by tdsls045._index2<br />
<br />
in the program script (since the report is doing the sort), <br />
<br />
I moved layout detail.1 to after field tccom010.cuno.1 and<br />
here's my report script...<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
domain	tcamnt	rank<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 23:17</div></div><div class="posttext">The order by in the program would be used to optimize the <br />
selecting of records from tdsls045.  This should not affect how<br />
the data is sorted in the report unless the report fields were <br />
setup as presorted.  Removing the order by tdsls045._index2<br />
may adversely affect the performance of the session.<br />
<br />
What is it that you are incrementing ? (detail lines ?) or customers ?<br />
<br />
If you are printing detail lines then the line.count incrementer<br />
will be active (verify via debug).<br />
<br />
Are you actually printing any details on the after field sections<br />
of customer or total ?  The problem probably does not lie in<br />
the program script or the report script, but in the way the report layouts are being used.  The line.count field should not need to be defined as an external variable (in the report script), just defined as a variable, and it should not need to be defined as <br />
an input field.<br />
<br />
Try using: <br />
declaration:<br />
    domain tcmcs.long line.count</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Graf</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">At first I made the changes suggested by evertsen except that I did not declare field rank in the report script because I had it declared in the Input Field section.<br />
<br />
This produced the same results as before.<br />
<br />
I then decided to take the field out of the Input Field section and declare it in the report script.  This produced the results that I wanted with the rank incrementing by one for each line of the report.<br />
<br />
I do not understand why this change made the difference.  At this point I'm not sure that I care how it works just that it works.<br />

It won't matter what domain he uses for the counter as long as it is numeric in nature (although I would have used a &quot;long&quot; myself).</div></div><hr />
