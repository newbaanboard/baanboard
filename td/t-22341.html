Then once the report starts go out to the tmp directory and check the input file.  You should see all 8 fields that the scan expects.  I can not remember the field separator that the reports use, but you should be able to see this in debug mode.  You may want to also check that the data being passed is not corrupt - I have seen this happen when control characters and such have got into report fields.  My first guess is the data that is being passed.<br />

After some debugging I found a field that had a special sign. In our case it was &quot;\n&quot;, which made the string.scan$() crash in the report.<br />
<br />
My advice, check all the input fields for strange values.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
