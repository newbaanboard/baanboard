<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st October 2003, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a session that calls tdinv1120m000  - yes it is an API session, but that all works fine.  Then tdinv1120m000 starts tdinv1121s000, which then starts tdinv1101s10b.  So what I need is a method to get data from my session into tdinv1101s10b - by sheer luck I have this code.  I did not post this into the API forum because the tdinv1101s10b session can only be partially controlled.  I am looking for another method to populate some variables for api.mode = true.  I have tried export in my session and import into the tdinv1101s10b, but that does not work.  I do not have source for the other programs so changing them is out.  Any suggestions are welcome.<br />

Once u get the pid of ur session then use get.var function to get the values of ur session in tdinv1101s10b . <br />

Do gimme the feedback on this.</div></div><hr />

I was able to get the variables into the session, but then a whole new set of issues cropped up.  So it is back to the drawing board.<br />

Thanks again!<br />

Can you explain what are the issues you got ?<br />
<br />
You can also explore more using the functions -<br />
<br />
at.base() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_variables_based_at_base1) <br />
<br />
If that function doesnt compile in your Baan-4 series, then it might be -<br />
<br />
long base.extern(ref variable, string name(,), long process_id)<br />
<br />
the variable has to be declared extern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd October 2003, 01:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Boy was I off on the sessions in my first post.  Okay the real problem is controlling my function server code for tdinv1101s10b.  What happens is I enter data into tdilc1120m000 - inventory adjust transaction type.  Next I do insert and tdilc1121s000 starts up - enter the inventory location here.  So far everything works - and I already have this working in a 4c3 environment, this is a test for our 4c4 upgrade.  Anyway in tdilc1121s000 when I do a insert in zooms to the tdinv1101s10b session.  The first time in you enter reason code, project, ccn.  Now I do continue - this is were things go ka-blooey - it returns to tdinv1121s000 process what I provided, tdinv1121s000 gives a message - &quot;Need full peg&quot;, and starts tdinv1101s10b again.  Now I should be able to enter the project,build item ,etc. to specify where the inventory comes from.  But I have no control here - stpapi.end works, but that is it, no stpapi.puts work.  So I thought since all tdinv1101s10b does is let you enter the full peg - I though I could just pass them into the program for api.mode = true.  It did not work - even though all the variables are set I do not get any error from tdilc1121s000 and tdinv1101s10b starts again. In the script for tdinv1101s10b there are two zoom sections - adjust1 and adjust2.  The first time in the adjust1 section runs and the second time the adjust2 section runs.  Adjust2 just allows me to enter the full peg and adjust1 sets a variable that makes attr.input false for the peg info.  I have also noticed that when I do a continue on tdinv1101s10b - it does a execute end.  This has caused me problems before.<br />
<br />
I was really trying to back door my way into the session, but it really made things worse.  I told my app admin I want baan to give us the latest solutions for these sessions and the API libraries for 4c4.  I know we just installed some new tools stuff in 4c4. So I wanted to verify that stuff first. There was a script for tdinv1101s10b that was in our production layer on the test box(for 4c4), and nobody knows where it came from.  If I do not use this version and I use the Baan A&amp;D1 version it processes okay, but it takes the inventory from the incorrect project. Very bad.  So what Hitesh gave me worked, but did not solve my problem.<br />

When I look at the source for tdinv1101.10 ... is that which you mean?  Sorry, I don't seem to have that tdinv1101s10b session you are referring to in my A&amp;D company, but who knows.<br />
<br />
Anyway the source for tdinv1101.10 has an wierd 'execute(end.program)' at the end of the continue process / before choice section, and there is not an 'if api.mode' around it.  This generally kills my API's.  <br />
<br />
So, yes, you can check with Baan to see if they have updated, my version is from 1999, so hopefully so !<br />
<br />
If not, the continue process logic is limited, I bet with QKEY which I think you have you can do something like call all sections but the continue process, then write your own continue process / before choice section without the end program.  Or, really most of what that section does is export variables, so maybe you can find another way of getting the variables without calling the stpapi.cont.process on the tdinv1101s01b session..<br />
<br />
Good luck, let us know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th October 2003, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes that is the script that I am looking at.  I have tried wrapping &quot;if api.mode&quot; around it with no success so far.  My admin says we already have the latest objects.  But you did give me some other ideas to try.  Thanks will let you know if I get a solution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th October 2003, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The current solution is not what I wanted, but it appears to work.  What I did was take the tdinv1101s10b session and import the variables as Hitesh suggested.  This appears to work on getting the data from the tdinv1101s10b session into tdilc1121s000.  What I am not able to do is trap any errors, so I added some code to check the transactions first.  Now all I have to do is make sure no &quot;bad&quot; transactions makes it into the code.  Oh well so far it works.  I do get kicked out once in a while while running this - so I am not sure if they are related, so you can check the new post I am going to do on it.<br />
