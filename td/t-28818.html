<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onnoboer</div><div class="date">4th December 2006, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to have a report with the following layouts in this sequence:<br />
tdcms060.reln<br />
tdsls040.ccur<br />
tdcms060.orno<br />
tdcms060.pono<br />
<br />
Doing this I have a problem with the sequence of the layouts. They are sorted in alphabetic order:<br />
tdcms060.orno<br />
tdcms060.pono<br />
tdcms060.reln<br />
tdsls040.ccur<br />
<br />
Is there a way that the layouts can be sorted in a way I want??<br />
<br />
All help is appreciated...</div></div><hr />

If there is still problem  , please elaborate .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Long time not seen.... (1996/7 Baan Barneveld.....)<br />
<br />
In my opinion the sort method ascending and descending is related to the sort of the records and not to the sequence of the individual layouts. <br />
There is no problem in generating the report but when I do a ' Maintain all layouts'  then the layouts are sorted in alphabetical order and not in the sequence I want.<br />
<br />
This is what I want:<br />
header<br />
before.field        tdcms060.reln<br />
before.field        tdsls040.ccur<br />
before.field        tdcms060.orno<br />
before.field        tdcms060.pono<br />
detail<br />
after.field          tdsls040.ccur<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance,<br />

Then use these External Variables to build your report layout.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
extern  domain xxxx    var.1   | tdcms060.reln<br />
extern  domain xxxx    var.2   | tdsls040.ccur<br />
extern  domain xxxx    var.3   | tdcms060.orno<br />

No, that's not enough. I want the layouts printed in a not-alphabetic order.</div></div><hr />

Do I have to assign the table fields to the variables in the programscript or in the report script? I assume the first and I don't want to maintain the program script...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am fine  . Hope u too r fine . <br />
<br />
U have to assign the same in program script . I think after.receive.data also will not help as that works after report tmp file  sorting .</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you don't want to change the session script and you need to do all within your report, maybe my thread <br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9090&amp;highlight=advanced might be useful. That principle works if your report requires sorting. <br />
<br />
But I'm not sure if it will help you regarding your original problem.<br />

I have read this thread several times and I still do not understand what you are asking for. The layouts print based on the sort order of the report - not the way you see the layouts in the maintain layouts session.  Why does it matter what order you see the layouts in, if they print in the correct order?  I have several reports that use mainwc and subwc as the first and second sorts.  When I look at the layouts I see detail, after field main wc and after field subwc.  I know that the subwc layout will print before the main wc layout - so I do not care what order I see the layouts when designing the report.  And yes - even if I switch the sort to sub.wc and main.wc I see them in the same order.  Am I missing something?  Why do you have to see the layouts in any certain order?<br />
<br />
If there is something printing incorrectly that is a different matter, then you might need to change the sort to get things group correctly.</div></div><hr />

You are right stating that the report is printed in the way I want but when I do a &quot;Maintain all layouts' the layouts are displayed in an alphabetical sequence. When I do so I suppose that Baan gives me a kind of preview of the report layout (WYSIWYG). That's not the case and that's clear to me now. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all your effort!</div></div><hr />
