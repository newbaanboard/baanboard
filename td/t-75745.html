<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">12th April 2023, 05:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Am trying to extend ReceiveDelivery BOD to populate user area. <br />
Cloud Edition.<br />
<br />
If I add this in Extensions (Extension Point: BOD; Component: ReceiveDeliveryBOD) I do not get ‘Field List’;<br />
If I use ReceiveDeliveryPurchaseInBOD, I get field list from tdpur406;<br />
If I use ReceiveDeliveryWarehousingInBOD, I get field lists from whinh310 and 312;<br />
<br />
Extending which of above will actually extend Sync.ReceiveDelivery BOD ? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">12th April 2023, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">This ReceiveDeliveryBOD is the parent. That one is used towards ION. The other 2 are child implementations. As the BOD can be fed from multiple modules a dedicated implementation is there for purchase receipts and for the warehouse receipt. At that level table relations are known so at that level the extension needs to be created.<br />
The Parent level has no logic other than passing it through for child level to ION and vice versa.</div></div><hr />

Now am able to publish ReceiveDelivery BOD and tested extending ReceiveDeliveryWarehouseBOD. <br />
But...when I execute using whbod0200m000 I get the BOD published. For same receipt number, when I execute tcbod0200m000, no document is published. I find data exist in both whinh310/2 and in tdpur406. I would expect that tcbod0200m000 is also able to publish same BOD but from tdpur406. Seems tdpur406 stores both warehouse receipts and purchase receipts<br />
<br />
I want to extend the BOD by extending ReceiveDeliveryPurchaseBOD which is based on tdpur406. But for now, it only seem to be able to publish from whinh312 even as tdpur406 has same data</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">13th April 2023, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Most receipts are done in a warehouse. Also the receipts not related to purchase, for example for a transfer. So the WH table is the main source for receipts, that is ReceiveDeliveryWarehousing BOD. In case a warehouse receipt is related to a purchase order, tdpur406 will be updated. In that case the information is on 2 places, for BOD publishing we take the WH data as leading.  The receipts without a warehouse are only registered in tdpur406. So only records in tdpur406 for an empty warehouse are used for populating the ReceiveDeliveryPurchase BOD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">13th April 2023, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">My scope is that of receipts made against purchase (not Transfer or Production receipts for example). ReceiveDeliveryPurchaseBOD is based on tdpur406 and it is all in one table (receipt and line) unlike whinh310 and 312. (Am hoping it will be one receipt line per BOD published against one header and multiple lines when it comes from whinh310/12) A finer question will be... under what circumstance will ReceiveDelivery fire when executed from tcbod0200m000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">13th April 2023, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;So only records in tdpur406 for an empty warehouse are used for populating the ReceiveDeliveryPurchase BOD&quot;; So, you say that only cost PO lines that is not received in warehouse is published using ReceiveDeliveryPurchase BOD<br />
<br />
Let me test. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">13th April 2023, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, only cost PO lines that is not received in warehouse. <br />
In the BOD documentation, https://docs.infor.com/ln/2023.x/en-us/lnclintegrationsolh/ln_cross_bod_mappings/ln__ionbodin__en-us.pdf is stated &quot;This BOD is published when users Confirm or Correct a Purchase Receipt manually<br />
and the Ordered Quantity field is greater than zero and the Warehouse field is not filled.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">14th April 2023, 11:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Tested and BOD behaviour understood. Thanks again. Good day!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">14th April 2023, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">the identifier returns Receipt# and not line. If additional data needs fetched from PO line, parts of index is missing. How do we handle this? a workaround can be to populate CDFs but this I can resort to, if there is no possibility to use calculated fields</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">14th April 2023, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">PO information is in &lt;ReceiveDeliveryItem&gt;:<br />
