<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brynn.ireland</div><div class="date">18th August 2005, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently am stuck with a very unique problem. I have customised the session maintain receipts using Qkey. However since doing so ever so often the cursor get stuck in the Receipt Date field (a field that I have not customised). I can still modify the date but am unable to tab out or change focus to another field using the mouse. This action does not hang up the bshell and no errors are logged in any of the log files.<br />
Are there any tools within Baan that will allow me to see where or what has caused this. The option dialogue box has the status set to sleep and the ticks are not increasing. If I kill the session, there are no error messages ?<br />
Furthermore, this only happens once in ever 300 - 400 receipts.<br />
Any suggests would be appreciated to try and find what is causing this ?<br />
Many Thanks in Advance<br />

We used qkey to modify the script also, but we do not have this problem.  Of course our receiving is mostly automated now and there are not many manual receipts.<br />
<br />
One question is - Are they bringing up the session and leaving up until the 300 or 400 receipts are done?  I doubt it, but thought I would ask.  It could actually be something totally unrelated to qkey or this session.</div></div><hr />

Here is the code that you requested, a bit more background on the receiving side. We receive at 23 different locations and anywhere between 1 - 3 users a week get hung up in the Maintain Receipts session ? Different users at different locations. Its only ever happened once in testing and is extremely difficult to reproduce ? All these changes were made for to SOX compliancy, and cannot be removed. No modifications were made to the receipt date field.<br />
Many Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th August 2005, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">You might want to check with the Qkey support (who-ever that is today) and see if anyone else has reported anything.  Are you on the latest release of Qkey?  I know a couple of different things were just fixed in the version we received - sometime in the last 6 months.<br />
<br />
Not sure why you have the &quot;,1&quot; after the message text - no arguments in the message itself.<br />
<br />
I do not really see anything that would cause a problem. I take it you have tried duplicating the error?  I am just wondering if there is something in the Baan code itself causing the problem.  I wish I could remember what session it was that I could lock up if I held the tab key down - that was years ago.</div></div><hr />
