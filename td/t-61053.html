Is there anyway that we can insert, displayed and printout character or number like 5117 in baan. I only know that i can insert, displayed and printout ±°²³¹ªº correctly. Any information and guidance provided is much appreciated.<br />

Never had got such situation. But may be you can give try to following options:<br />
<br />
If you want to display some field in report as subscript you can go to the field properties, then to Font tab. There you have option of Subscript &amp; Superscript. Please refer attached image.<br />
<br />
If you want to display some field on session as subscript, then you can use function pf$ (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_char_b_win_pf). I think that this function would do the trick for you if you are working on Baan 4. Programmers guide says that  function is only supported for character-based windows, but have seen some similar function working for windows based.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps you.<br />

I think you are trying to print the report in Display device.<br />
<br />
Try printing the report in Windows Printer Device.<br />
<br />
Had never done this before. Atleast because of you got a chance to try it :) . I have attached the screenshot of the test report for reference with subscript text area encircled in red.<br />

Thanks Rahul for your reply .Looks like there something wrong with my baan or the printer ....when i print it out ...the result weren't like what you have. The subscript text and the superscript text were appear bigger than the normal one with normal font and still in line with the normal one. as shown in the picture 5127 both words are printed on size 17.1 cpi, but the character with font either superscript or subscript and italic is just bigger than the normal one which crop in green rectangle. Does this means than my baan system does not have those functions? <br />

i had install a small cap font and tested in the Microsoft word ----&gt;5136, but when i implemented it on baan ...the result would come out like -----&gt;5135....which the smaller character than suppose to be at the bottom had be located on top. This situation also happen when the larger word set with large font (10cpi) and smaller word set with small font (17.1 cpi). Any members in baanboard knows what's going on ??:confused:<br />

<br />
start BwPrint.exe from your Windows system. Click on menu Help-&gt;Font Test, you can see all font settings. Now you have to click with the right mouse button exactly onto the font which do you want to change. The font dialog appears. After saving your changes BwPrint updates the registry with new settings. Now you have to choose the font in your field settings of the report layout.<br />
<br />
When all other clients of your company needs this font settings you have to export explicit this one registry entry and install it onto the client pc's.<br />
<br />
My attached screenshot shows you on Font 24 my own font which I use it as logo on our reports. How you can do this, see the document.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

Thanks for you reply. I had already tried all the steps in the document you had attach, but the result till came out same ---&gt;5146. I also tried the Font Test and result is ---&gt;5144. Besides that, i had also install new font which is small capital type font named  &quot;Scriptoria Small Caps SSi&quot; which i had add it into registry editor --&gt; 5145 and test it on Microsoft Word --&gt;5147 . The new font also been added into the Fonts folder in control panel. Do i still miss so step ? why the smaller fonts still appear to be on top of the Larger font? <br />
