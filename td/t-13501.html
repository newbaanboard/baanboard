<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">4th November 2003, 23:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a report that will generate a Unix shell script to e-mail division managers a list of projects and their associated costs.  The script gets generated as the report script runs.  The report has four layouts:<br />
<br />
Header<br />
Before division<br />
detail<br />
After division<br />
<br />
In the Before Division layout I first delete any pre-existing file (one unique file per division manager) recreate the file and insert the To's, From's and Subject as well as some text directed toward the user.<br />
<br />
In the Detail layout I create an HTML table which has the output data embedded.<br />
<br />
In the After Division layout I close the file, change the permissions of the file and then execute the file.<br />
<br />
It sends out a handsome e-mail notifying division managers of any jobs where costs exceed sales (in red) or where costs are within 85% of sales (in blue).<br />
<br />
My problem...<br />
<br />
Any particular division whose list of jobs exceed one (hardcopy) page do not include the entire list in my file.  For example if Division 1 has 40 jobs that fit the flagged criteria and the hardcopy of the report will print 20 per page, my e-mail will contain:<br />
<br />
Header information from the before division layout.<br />
The last 10 jobs on page 3 of the hardcopy report (detail layout).<br />
Footer information form the After Division Layout.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions?  Much thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

As you said, you remove the file in this layout i.e. you simply see the last page. Right?</div></div><hr />
