<br />
I'm working on a custom session, I implemented the program script, generated a report everything working like a charm.<br />
Now I wanted to add another report to the same session, so I duplicated the original one and linked it to the session. After this I cannot print anymore. When I click on &quot;Print&quot; nothing happens.<br />
If I remove the report I've added, everything works again.<br />
<br />
Oh... and yes, the reports are in the same group, different No.<br />
<br />
Thank you, BR<br />

Try to compile both session and reports and try again. On clicking on print, it should pop up a window asking which report you want to print. Also check if you have this session running, if yes, close it, compile it and try again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
firstly, thank you for your fast response, but that's not working.<br />
I was thinking the same prior posting on here. I've even restarted Worktop to avoid some silly &quot;bug&quot; but nothing helps. As fast as the session has two reports it wont work...<br />
I have done the same before and everything worked fine. This time I have no idea what could it be?!<br />
<br />
Anyone any other idea?<br />
<br />
BR, David</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems you need to compile the labels first. <br />
<br />
In FP6 the pop up windows asking for the report would display an empty line, if the label of the new report wasn't compiled yet.<br />
In FP8+ an uncompiled label seems to surpress the report selection window and LN refuses to print anything (and it won't give any error).<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, that might be some data corruption as I haven't faced such issue. Try duplicating, deleting report or session. If I face any such problems I just do trial and error and you never know.<br />
<br />
If any one has faced a similar issue he might help you with a proper solution for this.</div></div><hr />

It worked! It is realy strange that there is no error thought...<br />
<br />
Thank you once more!<br />
