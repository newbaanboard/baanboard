<br />
I am getting an error message as follows when try to generate a production order with generic item<br />
<br />
&quot;Not allowed to enter a generic item&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

use of Product Configurator is not supported from tisfc-sessions. You have to configure your item either from sales quotations, sales orders or via pcs-module,<br />
session 'Generate Product Variant Structure for Project'.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Hi MRF,<br />
how much are you familiar with the concept of generic item and Product-Configuration in Baan?<br />
It depends on that where to begin the explanation.<br />
<br />
Huh, just found the thread in the manufacturing section about this problem.<br />
So after reading that one it's more clear.<br />
<br />
You can't use a generic item in production order because you can't produce a generic item. You first have to configure a variant of the generic item which creates a new 'real' item which is derived from the generic one. You do that by means of the Product Configurator Session (choose options of features).<br />
After that you have to use the the 'Generate Product Variant Structure for Project' Session tipcs2220m000 (from which you can launch Product Configurator) which creates a new item, a Project(optional, depends on your pcf parameter), a real bom and a routing.<br />
This newly created item can be produced in a production order.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes it more clear,<br />
greetings,<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />

Thanks for such detail explaination. just one thing that is to be further clear<br />
<br />
&quot;You first have to configure a variant of the generic item which creates a new 'real' item which is derived from the generic one&quot;<br />
<br />
the real item means an item of type &quot;Purchased&quot; or &quot;Manufactured&quot;? or some other type?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

the generated item is of type manufactured. But you can simply switch the type from manufactured to purchased and vice versa in General Item Data.<br />
<br />
Greetings,<br />
