I need to add an index to tfgld106 table due to major performance issues in couple of reports. Is it recommended adding new indexes to tables? What are the possible side effect adding new indexes?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

No. Only in rarest of rare cases it should be done<br />
<br />
side effects <br />
1. Finalization program (which inserts records in tfgld106) and archieving programs may get slower as it has one more index to update. Already 8 indices are these.<br />
2. Change in later SP may not be visible and u may need to port Baan SP  changes in tfgld106 again to these new customized table. <br />
3. It may be poor diagnosis of the problem or poor report analysis e.g. u need ledger balances / dimension balance then Baan has separate tfgld201-212 tables. It may be the performance problem is due to poor coding . In that case u may need to fix poor coding to get the solution. Further archiving tfgld106 to history company may also improve performance.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

You have to be veri carefull with the election of the keys of your new index. If you don let duplicates and they exists baan will delete ald the duplicates keys whitout advise.<br />
<br />
Choose duplicate keys or be very very carefull</div></div><hr />

In rare cases u can (in fact that's the only option) add index to standard tables. In fact we also have added index to a standard table in one case.<br />
<br />
But as a general rule adding indices to Baan standard tables is discouraged.<br />
<br />
One must check the keys properly before adding unique indices in order to avoid loss of data during reconfig .</div></div><hr />

I don't see any issues with adding indexes. I have added indexes to many tables in Baan. The tfgld106 may be large table and reconfig may take long time to do. That is the potential draw back. Chec how long it willtake to re-config the table. One can observe a simple rule for adding indexes. Make sure your new index has all the fields of any one index. In thi sway you will never land up with los of data. e.g We needed to add index based on invoice date in tdsls045. In this instance I ensure that I have all the fileds of index 1 as part of my new index. As long as you follow this rule, you should be fine. It is the re-config portion that u need to consider. As far as overhead, it may not be that noticeable.</div></div><hr />

How can you check to see how long a reconfig will take?  This issue is causing us some problems with getting a reconfig to finish.   We are actually adding a new customized field to a Baan table (ack!),and wanting to use it in a new index. <br />
thanks,<br />

You will need to do this on test system. It is very Difficult to guess the time. May be doing on weekend or long weekend may help. Take the dump of  the table before you do this. <br />
<br />
The other option that I can think off is- Export all the records from tfgld106 Using exchange scheme, inlcude all the fields. Then delete the table and then add the field and index,  recreate the table, import the records using exchange scheme. Basically, the approach is that if the there are no records in table then re-config goes fast. And the one way  to do is to export the records (to have copy) and then import them back after recreation. The export process, might it self take some time, but this should work.<br />
Since you will be inserting records through exchange scheme so al reference counter should work. And I don't think any other table has references to tfgld106. I have removed records from tfgld106 few times.<br />

I like the exchange scheme idea...<br />
I am not changing the tfgld106 table tho'.  It is the tdsls041 sales order line table!  I still think we could try this...<br />
thanks,<br />

I think in tssls041, it shouldn't be problem. Befor eyou do this back the table, take a table dump. You shoould be able to finish the reconfig(it may take long time). <br />

I don't see any issues with adding indexes. I have added indexes to many tables in Baan. <br />
<br />
Now my question is - Can adding a index with duplicates effect performance of other indexes? In 4c3 our oracle DBA's added some backend indexes. I was not able to see them in table maintenance.  Now we converted to 4c4 and these indexes did not come across during the migration process.  None of the current oracle DBA's know why they were created.  So I agreed to create them in Baan in 4c4 - performance issues with some sessions that these indexes should help.  No problem, but I did notice that one of these duplicate indexes really slowed up table maintenance when I selected it.  It was not really a problem and I did not notice any other issues when anyother index, but thought I would ask the question anyway.<br />

I have seen performance issues with Index duplicates in DB2 and SQL. I would always try to have a unique index. I don't see any reason to have duplicate index. Basically I took Baan's apporach. You will hardly find any Duplicate. There may be a marginal overhead due tp addition of index. <br />
I on't see any reason not ofr adding index. We migrated from IVB2 to IVc3 in past and everything came fine. I have never came accros any problem with Indexex in an upgrade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th December 2003, 04:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm - Never thought about this, but I wonder if it is better to have a duplicate index or to rearrange a unique index so the fields I want are first(or first/second).  For example tdilc101's primary key is something like 8 fields, where the first 4 are warehouse, location, project, item(at home so do not hold me to this). I currently made a duplicate index on item only, but I wonder if copying the first index to my index, reversing warehouse and item, and keeping it unique is better?????  <br />
<br />
This index is the one I was scrolling through in table maintenance and it appeared to hesitate much more than one of the unique indexes. In our case the item could be in multiple warehouses which may have the same location - most common occurance would be the receiving/inspection locations.  The more I think about it the less I like our indexes. The hopes of some people is that the indexes may improve some performance issues we have - I do not see how but am willing to give it a try. I may put them in and then pull them out if the sessions in question do not improve.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">17th December 2003, 05:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark,<br />
This discussion is diverted of using Unique vs Duplicate indexes. It is good to discuss. I have observed that if one have dupicate index on a table and one tries tp scroll through GTM, one can see that it takes a while before it moves to next record. My guess is database is trying to figure out which record should come next. You can test this in your ILC101 index. See the perforamce if ou try to use duplicate or unique one. There is one dupicate inex in standard baan and that is  in tdsls040 and I have no idea why Baan did this. I created my own unqiue index in same table and I see it is better than Baan index. The Baan index is Customer and then customer PO and duplicate. In our case we have many account number for a customer (parent child), so it was difficult to look for a PO if customer is not know. I created my own idex - Customer PO, Customer and Order. And there was improvement in performance.<br />
<br />
When one creates a index (of course you know about this) one needs to know under what circumstances one  needs to use this. The case you have mentioned is having duplicate index on item, I think you were better of any standard Baan index (unless you have project). If you would like to get Item, warehouse, location etc then make sure that you have the fields in correct order and at the same time ensure you have all the required field of a unqiue index. I didn't mean that keep the same order of unique , it can be any order and one is safe as long as the index becomes unique. It works for me in all cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">18th December 2003, 07:47</div></div><div class="posttext">When user browses through GTM with duplicate index , the performance is extremely slow. I also noticed during these times the CPU usage goes upto 50% ( 2 CPU server in single user mode). CPU usage could be lower if there are many users. However in that case response time will be more poor.<br />
<br />
I think for duplicate indices GTM program performs next record algorithm runtime and does lot  of disk reading and hence the slow response with heavy CPU usage.<br />
<br />
Duplicate indices do not cause any problems while using it in program script.<br />
<br />
As somebody noted in this post,good way is to follow Baan practice of adding primary keys at the last to make indices unique. However there are exceptions like table tfgld102 , tdinv700 etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suggestion to overcome the problem of adding index in standard baan table. <br />
<br />
Instead of adding new field and new index in existing standard baan table, the user can create new table (tftemxxx) with the field  and this table will have all primary key field of tfgld106 with additional new fields and new index.  The user can do create runtime data dictioary for new table and import the fields (only index fields) from tfgld106  <br />
<br />
To retrieve data from tfgld106, the user can fetch data first from tftemxxx using index (which is not available in tfgld106) and then we can fetch data from tfgld106 from the retrieved value of new table.<br />
<br />
advantages:<br />
<br />
1) baan standard table not disturbed. Latest service pack will get update on standard table.<br />
2) reconfigure table with alot of records in new table -  No system down time<br />
<br />
Hope this suggestion is not silly....</div></div><hr />

but keeping the data in both tables synchronized is going to be a real headache. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil</div><div class="date">24th December 2003, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestion will be valid fo adding new field and Index to the standard table, instead of adding in standard table. the user can have new field and index in customised table.<br />
<br />
Adding new field involves customisation and the customisation have to take care of adding records in new table.<br />

<br />
Depends on what you are doing.  In our case we have some monthly processes that could always be changed to export data and import into new tables. Our DBAs could do this rather quickly.  We also populate our Business Objects table using something like this.<br />
<br />
What has happened with our 4C4 A&amp;D1 upgrade is that we are running into problems with sessions that worked in 4c3 - performance is bad. The first thing Baan wants us to do is back out all of our modifications in production, very time consuming and in some cases we lose data while they try to fix the problem.  I no longer plan on adding new indexes to fix a Baan problem - we will wait for Baan to fix them.<br />
<br />
If you can use this technique I would advise you to.  It will reduce the amount of time you have to  check patches and upgrades.  We spend about 1 week every SP trying to catch Baan changes that will cause us to modify our production layer(new forms, table fields, etc.).  <br />
