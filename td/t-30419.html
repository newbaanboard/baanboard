My attempt has resulted in 4 columns of the same repeating columns.  Do I need to make a dynamic array?<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">25th January 2007, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">By my knowledge this cannot be achieved in standard Baan (unless maybe with dynamic forms this is possible...). If you HAVE to do it this way, then indeed I think the easiest way is filling an array and displaying it as required on the form. I don't know what the max. amount of records to be displayed is in reality...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">2nd February 2007, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if you mean that, but in &quot;Reports&quot; is a field, where you can fill in a number of multi cols. So the result should be indeed to have, let's say three colums with items. <br />
I tried it some years ago, with a little bit more complicate report... and decided to use something like an array :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">5th February 2007, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">This option is not available for forms.

I agree that with a form I would use arrays or find another solution.  But I have successfully created one multicolumn report and yet I agree with Eli.  It is not something I would recommend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joepte</div><div class="date">5th February 2007, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help - this was all so that users could scan more barcodes without having to refresh/save after a dozen or so scans.  I think the best way is to launch excel scan there save the file and read it into Baan - then they can scan all they want with less interaction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th February 2007, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - I have actually done this two different ways.  One way was for floorstock transfers - on this form I used arrays, because they would only want to transfer to 2/3 locations.  They use tags from another program to scan in the inventory transfer issue.  The other way I did this was using a table I set-up.  Then they could scan in (or load from an excel file) as many as they needed.  Once it was loaded(however they loaded it) they could process all of the records.</div></div><hr />
