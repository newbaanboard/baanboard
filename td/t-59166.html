I print from Ln to the Excel primter defined normally to an .csv file. WhatI have experiemced it is that some fields having a numeric value (as 08000.00100) are cut because of the column type general in excel. They arrive in excel as 8000.001 and the others zeros are lost. For my report this is bad because these are item codes.<br />
Has anyone an ideea what should i change?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you write this data like this: &quot;08000.00100&quot;? It would keep the zeros that you're loosing, but is not very kindly...<br />
Maybe another character would work to sinalize that the fild data is a string. I didn't try, but perhaps a TAB character.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

A simple solution for the leading zero's problem is to surround the field with<br />
<br />
=&quot;&lt;part_number&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
The =&quot; will make Excel read the colum as text.<br />

If you search for Excel .csv Leading 0 you will find a couple posts to review.<br />
