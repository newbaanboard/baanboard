<br />
it is more or less only a SSRS Problem, but maybe someone can help me:<br />
I've created a Report with subreport in SSRS. The data source of the subreport is not an LN data source. I've entered there all Parameters also the credentials for connecting to the external data source.<br />
But on runtime in the LN Environment (Infor Mingle) I have to insert the credentials again. Is there any Special Setting? <br />
Remark; for this subreport I don't use the jca_uri and jca_ticket Parameters cause it is no LN data source.<br />
<br />

<br />
thanks for your hints. If tried both:<br />
&quot;no credentials&quot; and &quot;windows authentication&quot; =&gt; result: subreport not executable.<br />
Also I've checked the direct Access by Management Studio: with the credentials I have to use the Connection and execution of the T-SQL-Select works fine.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">2nd November 2015, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">i also assume that when you open your non-baan data source the input credentials are always there (cached). i never had problems with opening an external database. hopefully someone else can give their 2 cents here.</div></div><hr />

Also, post your solution if solved. :)<br />
<br />
On BIDS side, you might try rebuilding the report as well and make sure the security configurations for both are similar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your help. I've checked the links and tried<br />
- the Explorer Settings and<br />
- the deactivation of the RSWindowsNegotiate-Parameter in the rsreportserver.config file.<br />
<br />
But both Actions doesn't led to a result. There are still the credential Input fields also after restart the reporting Service.<br />
<br />
I will dig deeper into the theme, and check the links again.<br />
<br />
If you have an additional hint I would be appreciate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">3rd November 2015, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm curious what happens if you run the subreport by itself. i assume it shows you a couple of fields for parameter inputs from your main report and if filled everything works fine. if this is the case, then the subreport takes the credentials correctly through windows-to-sql-server logic. i am wondering if this is a ming.le flaw where it passes the baan login as parameter for the user login in a non-baan database. the problem is, unlike SSIS, SSRS doesn't offer a lot of login options. SSIS is picky on credentials too but since it has more options, the problem can be solved rather logically. having said that, i'm still hoping you can solve this with simple (complex?) windows settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaBernd</div><div class="date">3rd November 2015, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Benito,<br />
<br />
thanks for (also mental) Support. I've tried to run the subreport out of the Report wep pages. Here it works without entering credentials. <br />
Here in this Report web pages I also have to insert the credentials in advance and save them. That works fine.<br />
But when I call the Report again out of the Ming.le Environment I still Need the credentials for the subreport.<br />
<br />
Maybe I will check when I Change the subreport in the Report builder Environment which behaviour I will get afterwards. But that is a Job for tomorrow.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaBernd</div><div class="date">4th November 2015, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello to All again,<br />
<br />
I made several tests and found the following behaviour:<br />
<br />
Master Report (Infor LN, DataBase1 on LN-Server): Windows-Authentication <br />
<br />
Subreport A: (DataBase2 on Server2) Login with credentials for the SQL-Database as SA-User or separate Read-Only-User: Here I have to enter the credentials during runtime.<br />
<br />
Subreport B: (DataBase3 on Server3) Login with credentials for the SQL-Database as SA-User: no additional Input of the credentials for the data base user is necessary.<br />
<br />
For both Subreports I use the credentials of their SQL Server Data Base (SQL Server Authentication). So I belive the Problem have to depend either on Data Base Settings or Server Settings. Could that be possible?<br />
Does the Data Base user Need a Special privilege or role to get connected with saved credentials?<br />
Or is there a Privileg which enforces a prompt for the credentials?<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Bernd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">4th November 2015, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">what i would suggest is to copy the user settings from server3, compare it with server2. also i recommend not to use the user &quot;sa&quot;. good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaBernd</div><div class="date">6th November 2015, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Final Solution!<br />
<br />
Hello Bhushan, Hello Benito, and all others,<br />
finally I found the solution after running few days in the wrong direction :-(<br />
<br />
The solution is very simple after identification :-)<br />
I've inserted the credential during creation of the subreport in the Report Designer from MS Visual Studio (SSRS / BIDS). After creating, saving and creation of a build I've uploaded the designed subreport to the &quot;SQL Server Reporting Services&quot; page. From here Infor-LN accesses the reports with the &quot;MS_SSRS1&quot; device.<br />
But after the upload of the subreport the credentials was lost. So I have to insert the credentials again inside this &quot;Reporting Service&quot; Management page (see attached screenshots).<br />
Now my subreports will called without reinserting the credentials.<br />
<br />
I hope this explanation is helpful and thanks for your help and Support. <br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Bernd</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">6th November 2015, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm glad it worked for you too. i am confused why it worked before if the subreport was ran by itself. that test told me that the credentials for that datasource were setup properly. oh well...as what they say here, as long as it works ;)</div></div><hr />
