I want to just copy the user, and not the whole tables.<br />
<br />
The basic assumption is that the second system is an application image of the first.</div></div><hr />

there is no Baan Session available for that.<br />
When I understand you right... you will buid up a secon application Server and work on one Database???<br />
In that case you only need to copy the u and p files from $BSE/lib/user.<br />

I don't think it is to hard to set up a user, but the authorizations would probably be the most time consuming.  Of course I have only done this in a limited fashion - but I have dumped tables, greped for my key value into a new file, then imported the new file in append mode.  No destruction of current data.<br />
<br />
And my favorite &quot;easiest&quot; way is to just get the admin to worry about. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
IF you want to copy a single user to another company or to more than one company you can do the same thing by take a sequential dump of all the required table and remove the data which you donot want to copy and then run bdbpost to enter the record of specific user(s) to another company.<br />
<br />
syntax would be:<br />
<br />
bdbpost6.1 -Rmnf -t&quot;|&quot; -D . -E &lt;err file name&gt; -c 995</div></div><hr />
