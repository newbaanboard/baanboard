<br />
In my first exercise <br />
<br />
1.<br />
I have created one form dmoes8102m0001 of type 4(Single-Occ) with two fieldss of Kiloes and Miles. I have also entered choice field here..Form looks like as below.<br />
<br />
Kilos : FFFFFFFFFFFFF<br />
<br />
Miles: FFFFFFFFFFFFF<br />
<br />
                                       VVVVVVVVV C<br />
<br />
2.<br />
<br />
I have created one program script dmoes8102 with type 4 without main table. In the declaration section of this script, I have defined kilos and miles with appropirate domain. Compiled the script.<br />
<br />
<br />
3<br />
Created one  Maintain session deoes8102m000. Linked above form and script with the session. and compiled the session. <br />
<br />
Now when I run session, it does not do anything. It just displays as follow<br />
 <br />
Kilos : 0.00<br />
Miles:  0.00 <br />
<br />
It does not display choice field and does not allow inputs.<br />
<br />
From above, I understand that I have to enter choice field in main script..<br />
<br />
Will anybody please guide me what is missing from the script?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance and regards</div></div><hr />

In maintain forms there is a button that says Standard Opt. - click on that.  Then set the options you want available - you can use help to learn about the options.  In this case you want at least modify turned on.</div></div><hr />
