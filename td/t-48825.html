In the User Data session ,every user can be set 6 roles .But ,if i set more that 2 roles for one user ,all of the roles will not be effective, why?<br />
The role is set for access the table,field....Not in the DEM(set for sessions).<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

In 5c all roles are active. If you need more roles you can create a new role and assign subroles to it to have more roles.<br />
<br />
There is one thing you need to be aware of: using roles parallel means you get the most wide open permission. If you use subroles you get the most restrive one.<br />

<br />
Not effctive,means the roles dont work.<br />
For example, we have set two roles,the first role is not authorized to access 'tcibd001.item',and the second one is not authrized to access'tcibd001.dsca'.Then if one of the two roles is set to the user,the role will work respectively.But,question is,there's one user who can't access the table fields 'tcibd001.item' and 'tcibd001.dsca',when we set all of the two roles to the user ,all of the two roles wont work ,and the user can access all of the two fields.<br />
So,how can i make the two roles working.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
