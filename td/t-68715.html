<br />
I have a report (supplier balance) in which even if the end of data is reached, the before.layout is printed unnecessarily. <br />
<br />
The layout should print only if the data is present below it.<br />
<br />
I am attaching report output and layout screenshot for reference. Can anybody guide how this can be avoided.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamsi_gujjula</div><div class="date">14th March 2016, 07:49</div></div><div class="posttext">you can check using lattr.enddata as mentioned in the above post <br />
<br />
the other variable you might want to check is lattr.autobefores</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have tried a layout condition (not lattr.enddata) as well as checking at the report script level in before.layout section of after.field. Still there is no result.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">14th March 2016, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">WHich is the layout that is getting printed? before.field.tccom122.ifbp or after.field.tccom122.ifbp?<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways i think it is the before.field.1 that is getting printed. Why dont you try putting the condition lattr.break in it as you have used for before.field.2? It will ensure that that layout will only be printed in case of a sort field change and not during a page break.<br />
<br />
Put the combined condition as  &quot;lattr.break and not lattr.enddata&quot;.</div></div><hr />
