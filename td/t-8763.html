<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chadwickh</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to select off a column having the characters RF in it. I always get 'No rows selected':<br />
<br />
select user, name, shcm<br />
from ttaad200 <br />
where shcm like '%RF%'<br />
<br />
The characters are always in the same positions so if a substring options works that works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">If the positions are fixed you can try this -<br />
<br />
<br />
select user, name, shcm<br />
from ttaad200 <br />
where shcm(start.position;end.position) = &quot;RF&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">You should use the same syntax as in the expr.compile (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_expressions_runtime_expr_compile) function.<br />
<br />
Use .* where you mean 0+ characters.  Use only the period for a single instance.  So, if you want  RF as the second and third characters, you would use:<br />
<br />
<br />
where shcm like &quot;.*RF.*&quot;</div></div><hr />

BAAN Application Performance Guide<br />

3.7 Using like<br />
Problem<br />
The like condition is evaluated in the driver and not in the RDBMS.<br />
So, all selected records are copied from RDBMS to driver before checking the like<br />
condition.<br />
Solution<br />
Replace the like function by tests on substrings if possible.<br />
Example<br />
Bad situation<br />
Select books.*<br />
from books<br />
where books.number inrange 1 and 10<br />
and books.author like &quot;P*&quot;<br />
Improved<br />
Select books.*<br />
from books<br />
where books.number inrange 1 and 10<br />
and books.author(1;1) = &quot;P&quot;<br />
<br />
Large performance impact<br />
<br />
3.6	As set with n rows.  This select option limits the number of rows returned from the select.  For a 15,000 row table, the select took 5,000 milliseconds without this option and 1 millisecond with as set with 1 rows, only returning a single row.<br />
<br />
3.7	The like condition.  This condition is not applied until the data is in the database driver so more data is selected than is needed.  If a substring is used, the data is filtered at the dbms so only the required rows are returned.  On a 15,000 row table, the like condition took 4800 milliseconds and the substring took 290 milliseconds.<br />
<br />
Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.10 discuss situations that affect index selection for a select statement.  The choice of wrong indexes is often the single largest performance impact in an application.  For simple queries, these sections give examples of how to influence index selection.  However, for complex queries, it is sometimes very difficult to predict which index will be chosen, especially if you donÂ’t know the details of the dbms optimizer.  In these cases, a dbms monitoring and tuning tool is essential.</div></div><hr />
