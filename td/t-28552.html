I tried doing a search and couldn't seem to find anything, so apologies if I'm being repetitive.<br />
<br />
Since we don't use session authorizations as intended, we use menus to drive who has access to what session.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping that someone has come up with a way to do a multilevel where used, so I could punch in a session number, and having it recursively loop through the various where used sessions as needed, and generate a list of start menus that (eventually) point to that session.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice/help.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.  Actually, I'm looking for the exact opposite of that - and a bit more.<br />
<br />
I have a list of sessions and I need to know who has access to them.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's true, I suppose I could print out the menu structure for all the users and then search for the session I'm looking for in the results, however, this doesn't fulfill the requirements being set for me.<br />
<br />
The problem is, some of these sessions actually aren't even accessible directly via a start menu, but rather they're subsessions accessible via a zoom from a choice prompt from within a session.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes sense, if you want, I could provide an example of what I'm doing by hand, I just had hoped someone had automated it somehow.</div></div><hr />

I am not aware of anything that does it automatically and hopefully someone will post something along that line.  What I did for our dem flows was to take a report and write it to a table - then I use it to do the reports that some of the users wanted.</div></div><hr />
