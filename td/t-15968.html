<br />
I'm programming a special ttstpconv to drive a fax device.<br />
This 3GL opens a window to ask for fax number and name.<br />
It should work for all baan sessions.<br />
<br />
I'm using new.window, print, read.input. All is working fine, but at the end of the session, the black screen reminds open (after del.window).<br />
If I close the window with the cross, it's OK. If I enter return, the session goes back to the device screen and the black screen is still open.<br />
<br />
An end() order doesn't change anything.<br />
<br />
How can I close the window ?</div></div><hr />

Also I saw this in the knowledge quest &quot;The screen is not refreshed automatically. If you use the bx-server, however, a refresh is given by X.&quot;  So maybe when you return to the calling session a refresh is in order.  I am not sure and am guessing at this point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 07:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We too have this black screen when there is a message in the 3GL program or any other UI matters.  The black screen remains open as long as it's runnning. When we use X , the program itself ends (which we do not want). So black screen remains open in our  case. <br />
<br />
I think end(), exit(),stop() and abort() all should work in the program (in our case the program gets terminated when it executes the last statement). Are u sure end() does not work in the program.</div></div><hr />

I didn't know that a 4GL session can be used as a &quot;ttstpconv&quot;.<br />
With this new script (including a execute(cont.process) and end() ), it's working and the session ends.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
