Last week we created a 3 in long label and but for some reason, bwprint is allowing a 1.12222 inch of printable area.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">23rd December 2015, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a bit tricky indeed, but the help on the session ttaad3110m000 (including the linked &quot;Automatic paper selection for Windows printers&quot;) and ttaad3512m000. Then there is a solution on the knowledge base explaining how to add paper types consistently (a procedure which also involves ttaad4100 to insert the right types in the predefined available list...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">23rd December 2015, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">... in the predefined available list...).So one of the questions would be: is your papertype on the predefined list? Check the Official Paper Sizes on https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd319099.aspx (link in the Baan help page is no longer valid)</div></div><hr />

in addition to what omeluuk suggested i fixed my issue by changing the paper type in bw page setup. i experimented with a lot of paper choices in the field &quot;size&quot; until i got what i wanted. i then used the &quot;change position&quot; to adjust further.Somewhere in my dark memory there sits some vague thing which had to be done in the system registry as well, but since I at the time followed the KB article I felt save at the time and forgot now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medtun</div><div class="date">25th December 2015, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the answers.<br />
You were talking about a solution on the knowledge base. Are you talking about baanboard's KB or infor's one ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medtun</div><div class="date">30th December 2015, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally it worked for me too. An update for the printer's<br />
(an old Karl Valentin) driver solved the problem.<br />
Thank you again.</div></div><hr />
