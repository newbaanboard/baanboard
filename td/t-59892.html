<br />
We are on BaaN IVC4, HP-UX 11.23 Unix servers.  These particular printers are defined as Windows Printers in BaaN and have a UNC Path.  When you print to them it copies the driver locally to your PC.  It gives us the ability to modify the fonts in the registry locally.  We would like to also modify the line spacing but not sure what or how to add that into the existing registry setting.<br />
<br />
For example: I have an address that has 5 lines that will print out on the label.  On my other software outside of BaaN I am able to say the font is Arial, Size 10 and Line Spacing is 5.00.   I need this ability in BaaN also so that the address can be compacted some by line spacing vs shrinking down the FONT.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
