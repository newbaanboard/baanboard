<br />
Any body has idea to add new layout to report and attach scripts to the new lay out programmatically. The idea is to add new layout to all report through program instead of modify all reports and store some information at the time of report generation and get those information in scripts attached with the device i.g. Business partnerÂ’s name and contact information<br />
<br />
If Any boday can provide some sample code of help in any way then it will be more good.<br />

Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th May 2004, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">One idea is to use a API function server.  You could bring up each report, read through the layouts, find like the next detail available, add it, then save the report.  For the script you could check ttadv330 to see if a report script exists, if yes then open the script in append mode, add your layout code.  If no script existed then set the ttadv330.scpt to yes, then open the script in write mode and add everything needed for the new layout code.  Sounds feasible, but not really sure about the API code.  I have never really written one for tools sessions.  Plus you will have to track VRC's, directories and lots of other information.  Just my thought for the day.<br />

It sounds almost like you want to add something to all reports without really changing the Baan standard report.  <br />

What exactly are you trying to accomplish?<br />

<br />
I want to associate a script with this additional layout, so that it can store some required information into a table, which I will read in a script attached with a device.  I assume that this script associated with the layout will execute when the report is being generated, and at this point, I will get the required information and store in table(s). Will appreciate more suggestions specifc to this particular requirement.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

If you are trapping info in the device driver you can manipulate reports using ttstpconv.  Use seq.open, seq.gets to read through the report to get what info you may want to store in a table.<br />
