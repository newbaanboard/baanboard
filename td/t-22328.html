<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swanandp</div><div class="date">15th November 2004, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a maintain session with form type 2. I have some multi-occurrence inputfields on the form and also I have a single occurrence date field as input fields in Baan ERP(baan5b). No other single occ field is an input field. The problem is that in a date field if I enter -10 and then tab out to the multi-occ field then correct date i.e. date less than 10 days from today is displayed. However if I just enter -10 in the date field and then use the mouse to click on the multi-occ input field then that -10 remains as -10 and also gets saved like that. The problem is that field events are not getting fired in this case. If I make this field a multi-occ field then it works fine for all cases. However my requirement is to have a single occ field and not a multi-occ field. I have even tried using  the function single.occ.fields.on.mocc.form but this has not made any differnece. I have tried this function even after generating a new session with a form type 3 even though the date field should not be a view field. Please suggest what can be done in this regard.<br />
<br />
My baan installation details are <br />
Baan 5b Service pack 11<br />
Porting set is 6.2a.03.01<br />
<br />
Please do not give answers as to upgrade Baan version as this is not currently possible for us.<br />
<br />
Eagerly waiting for answers</div></div><hr />

when field changes, after.input, after field? may be u can use it convert it into a date ?<br />
I do not know what date domain you are using?may be some conversion b4 saving the record will ensure that or give a message without saving.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, think abt providing a mandatory look up for calendar for that<br />
field to select from the calendar?<br />
<br />
if possible attach a screen shot.Only one occurence per record?<br />
<br />
Also, check the start option you have set.</div></div><hr />
