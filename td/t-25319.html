<br />
We are trying to use ODBC to connect to a Baan database through Crystal reports.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions, ideas would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

It depends on database of BAAN.  I think that you can easly connect Crystal reports to baan. Look at database you used and its ODBC driver for your windows.<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

<br />
To connect ODBC driver, go to control panel - Data Source (ODBC) or Control Panel - Adminitrative Tools - Data Source (ODBC) and connect it to the database you want to connect.</div></div><hr />

It offers a Baan interface to Crystal Reports called the Crystal Enterprise Solution Kit for Baan. We have used it for over five years and it works very well. Business Objects has recently renewed their relationship with SSA Global to continue development with their interface.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">9th January 2006, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Through Crystal Reports you connect to the Baan system through their interface using your Baan userid, password, hostname, BSE, and company number(s). Once in, it displays the Baan data dictionary tables and their fields for you to select from. You can select fields that consist of numbers, dates, strings, enums, and text and create custom reports in the report tool. Since you are actually logged into Baan, it will observe company, session, table, field, and range of data restrictions that you can set against any userid through Baan. The data that you report against has the same appearance as the data you would normally see from any Baan session. You do have to know how Baan data is structured when you construct a report because you are working directly with the relational structure. Keep in mind that not all data displayed in Baan sessions is directly off the table, but might be derived programatically. Don't know if this helps?<br />
