How can I display multioccurence records in a session of form type 3 where these records are to be fetched from other than main table.Infact i need to select these records based on an index and maintain a field which belongs to the main table of this session against each occurence displayed and save all these occurences.<br />
Is it possible with a select query on that table but how to display these fetched records in this session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th March 2008, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">How about providing us the layouts of the two tables?  Usually what I do is I use the table with the most records(child records) as the main table.  Then I just look up what other tables I need based off the reference.  So maybe the table definitions would help us understand why you need to make the parent record the main table on the session.  You could always do syncronized sessions - a lot more work, especially if it is a maintain session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan1612</div><div class="date">21st March 2008, 05:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Infact my reference table has the details that I need to show against the main table fields (composite key) so I cannot change the main table.I have figured a work around  but that does'nt exactly suit my needs.I am not familiar with sync sessions so if you could plz help me with them if they suit my requirement.<br />

btw m still waiting 4 ur reply to another thread &quot;single occ field in multi occ form&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st March 2008, 13:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, without seeing the two tables and how they are joined I can not make a suggestion.  See this thread and my code example (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=6419).  What I did was create one session for the main single occurance session.  Then create another session for the multi-occurance child session.  You can see the basic commands needed to sync the two sessions.  It is not easy and there are still issues with my sessions - in my case I have 1 main table and two different children sessions.  So lookup help on attr.combined, switch.to.process(where they have an example) and activate. I can post the parent code and child code, but right now in test I can not get the complete form to display.  I have not figured out why all of sudden in one test company two forms do not work.</div></div><hr />
