      Can anyone please tell me from where does Baan refer to get the length of page in report.<br />
<br />
      I have the condition where if I check the value for &quot;spool.page.length&quot; I get it as 72, but I could find that the value of variable &quot;lattr.lineno&quot; goes upto 75.<br />
<br />
      I have mentioned &quot;Page Length&quot; as 72 for the device I am using in the session &quot;ttaad3100s000&quot;<br />
<br />
      Also I have mentioned &quot;Paper Height&quot; as 72 for the Paper Type I am using and for the font in which the report is printed.<br />
<br />
      Any suggestions are welcomed. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rahul.kolhe22</div><div class="date">14th April 2010, 07:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Mark,<br />
             Thanks a lot for your reply.<br />
<br />
1. In my report I have 2 headers each of height 8 lines, but either of them is printed.<br />
2. There is no footer,<br />
3. Top margin is 5 and foot margin is 1,<br />
4 and about the page size I have mentioned it in previous post.<br />
<br />
As per my knowledge the total page height/length we mention is including the margins, header and footer. Please rectify me in case I am wrong.<br />
<br />
I have attached the image of my report. My problem is the blank space highlighted in red. According to me that emty space is been left because of the header.<br />
<br />
What I found is while debugging when the 2 lines (highlighted in blue) seen on the 2nd page are printed, value of lattr.lineno goes beyond 72 (i.e greater then the page length I mentioned) AND value of lattr.pageno is still 1, whereas those line actully appear on 2nd page on the paper. <br />
<br />
When I check value for spool.pg.length it is 72.<br />
<br />
So i want to know where does lattr.lineno refer to for the page length. I dont think it refers spool.pg.length<br />
<br />
I hope I am clear. Please suggest. Any suggestions will be appriciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

       Hey I have found that the spcae left is not for header. My assumption was wrong. That space is left for Top margin.<br />
<br />
If I reduce my top margin to 0 then it does not leave any space.<br />
<br />
I would like to know from where does report script calculates the length for the report page.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

I do not know if this impacts windows printers, but several standard baan reports would &quot;overflow&quot; a page like this when this was not checked.<br />
<br />
I do this in one report:<br />
<br />
after.layout:<br />
	|message(&quot;P.total %d, project.count %d&quot;,project.total,project.count)<br />
	if tdpur999.dpas = tcyesno.yes<br />
	   and project.total &gt; 0<br />
	   and project.count &lt; project.total then<br />
|990827.sn<br />
| When printing the distribution it may run across page boundary so<br />
| check and if needed do a new page.<br />
		if(lattr.lineno &gt; (spool.pg.length - (r.top.mrg + r.bottom.mrg))) then<br />
			page()<br />
		endif<br />
|990827.en<br />
		|message(&quot;layout again.&quot;)<br />
		layout.again()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
The lattr.linenr is the current line being printed.  In my case I am using layout again to keep printing - since this layout could run across pages then I check and do a page() command.<br />
<br />
Not sure if any of this helps.</div></div><hr />

          Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
          I tried using page() function in after.layout section, but it is not working. As the layout is before.field and secoundlly the field being printed is a text field, so I tried using page() function in field.&lt;text_field&gt; section and before.print subsection. It worked. But I cannot find the header printed on the next page.<br />
<br />
I think with little bit of work around I will manage it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the solution.<br />
<br />
I think that here I am trying to forcefully change the page through report script functions. Can anyone please tell me what may be the reason because of which variable lattr.lineno goes beyond (i.e. by 3 lines and till line number 75) the page length/height (i.e. 72).<br />
<br />
Or altleast can anyone give me some idea on what does variable lattr.lineno depend. <br />
<br />
Is it some sort of tools problem, which need some patch to be installed or I am missing something<br />
<br />
We do have some other similar reports, which work fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm having the same issue when printing a text field on the report.  The text is made up of 20+ lines and the report is not printing the footer and ejecting to another page.  Can I ask what you did to make it work?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rahul.kolhe22</div><div class="date">29th April 2010, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
	In my case I had three before.field sections. Height of 'before.field.1' is 3, 'before.field.2' is 3, 'before.field.3' is 3.<br />
<br />
	Then in 'before.layout' section of these layouts I checked whether the total lines left at the bottom of the page is either less than or equal to the height of the layout to be printed. (i.e. lines left at the bottom of page is less than or equal to 3)<br />
<br />
	If yes then I checked whether the control is on the last line or there are some few lines left below.<br />
<br />
	If lines are left then I forcefully called the internal function generated by report generator to print detail section. This detail section had no data to print in it. It is just created to leave some blank lines. This layout is printed till control goes till the end of the page. In this case header automatically gets triggered when page changes.<br />
<br />
	If control is at the end of the page then I force fully called the internal function generated by report generator to print the header.<br />
<br />
	I know my this solution is not a proper fix. Because here I am forcefully printing the different layouts. But I had not other solution as none of the functions like page, skip.to worked for me.<br />
<br />
	Hope I am clear and it helps you.<br />
<br />
