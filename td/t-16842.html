<br />
I want to analyze database tables, related to RFQ creation and supplier linking processes. I can know the related tables by going through scripts of the corresponding sessions  and then check detailed field definition of each  table field, and get to which other tables it references to, but this is quite time consuming method.<br />
<br />
Is there any facility in baan (or some other method/approach used) to know table relationships (primary/foreign keys, child/parent tables) in a simpler way?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />
<br />

<br />
In Baan you have a IDEF1-X generator diagram tools (ttadv4131m000)<br />
I'ts  a good idea, but this tools is very poor.<br />
It's run in ASCII mode (with BW) :( <br />
it's good if you run with a little range of table :( <br />
The report and display it's not very simple to use   :( <br />
<br />
You can see an example in doc attachement<br />

<br />
I'm not shure wether its working also in ERP but in Baan IV you can use<br />
the session maintain queries (ttadv3180m000)<br />
If you create the query via Easy SQL you can enter a table name. If you then mark the table and click on the button &quot;Table Data&quot; (Top Button of the buttons on to bottom of the form) the opened display session (ttadv3581s0000) will show all the tables which have a table relation.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, that this are maybe not all relations, as some of the relations are only handled in the applications....<br />

I could not find session ttadv4131m00 in BaanERP 5c, can you please indicate if its different in BaanERP 5c?<br />
<br />

<br />
Lakoon, The session you mentioned is also not available in BaanERP. The sessions mentioned by Marcel, allow to create diagrams, but I want to know existing relationships among tables. This I want to be able to have an overview of tables and their relations for any particular session.<br />
<br />
The session ttadv3180m000 mentioned by Guillaume, seems helpful in this regard, but its not avilable in BaanERP, or may be is under different session name.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts in this direction?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jabran</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry but i think that the session which generate IDEF1-X diagram (ttadv4131m000) is not available in BaanERP 5.<br />
In the menu of baan IV is tools/developpement/domain and tables/gestion/ maintain IDEFX Diagram.<br />
<br />
I think this session doesn't exist in baan 5, and Now the session for the diagram is the session mentionned by marcel (tg*)<br />
But in this session, (i don't try) but i think is not possible to genrerate the link<br />
automaticly (like ttadv4131m000 of baan IV)<br />
<br />

<br />
what about using DBSLOG?<br />
If you fill the param field of your BW-Client with<br />
-- -set DBSLOG=077777<br />
all actions of the bshell will be written to {USERHOMEDIR}/dbs.log<br />
Search  bshell documention / Tools manual for the meaning of the switches and you should be able to log all actions on DD and tables.<br />
Keep in mind that this logfile will get big.<br />
Also you might miss dependencies according to what actions/sessions you are monitoring.<br />

<br />
The Query Session in ERP is called ttadv3580m000. Then zoom to ttadv3181s000 and then to ttadv3581s000, which is displaying all the related tables<br />

<br />
Lakoon, Thanks for your response. For some reason the sessions you mentioned are not showing the information. I end up debugging the code and guessing relationships from the queries involved. Perhaps it is the best way to proceed in such scenarios.<br />
<br />
I thank you all  for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">28th October 2004, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">How about parsing the data dictionary directly?<br />
<br />
For instance /baan/dict/ddB40Sc1/dtccom/dtccom020 in our environment gives us the standard data dictionary for the supplier master.  All it is is a flat file.  What you are looking for is any :REFR: designators.  So if I am looking at dtccom020 and I see:<br />
<br />
F<br />
:NAME:tccom020.cwar<br />
:REFR:tcmcs003.cwar<br />
:REFM:1 t1<br />
:DOMA:tccwar<br />
<br />
I know that that tccom020.cwar references tcmcs003.cwar (Warehouses), Also the domain is tccwar and REFM is the type of reference.  If you see a DEFA indicator then that is the default value.<br />
<br />
I would imagine that some programmer (who had time) could sit down and create a parser that would give the ability to navigate through the data dictionary.</div></div><hr />
