We use Wordpad as our editor for scripts and each time I open a script it is all jumbled - no formatting I suppose. I know we could switch editors but for the moment we will stick with Wordpad. Is there a way to ensure the text is formatted so that it is more readable.  This jumbling occurs even when the code is generated by Baan.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I personally like vi.<br />

What is the o/s on which Baan server resides. I would like to hazard a guess that wordpad is not recognizing end of line characters. And this is because you are running Baan on a Unix server and an old version of Wordpad (Win 95?).<br />
<br />
That was sticking my neck way out, will wait for some more info from you :). A screenshot of your jumbled code would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noname</div><div class="date">27th August 2002, 04:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  The o/s of the Baan server is NT, the local machine is W2000. I think it isn't recognising the end of line chars or any formatting chars as it does wrap but seemingly randomly.<br />
I was hoping there might be some setting in Baan that might help 'beautify' the code, because although it does compile it doesn't look like it should.<br />
Sorry ~Vamsi but at the moment can't attach a screenshot but thanks for sticking your neck out</div></div><hr />

I found that if different developers were using wordpad &amp; notepad, scripts were being corrupted by wordpad.  You can end up losing all previous development.  Don't use wordpad !</div></div><hr />

I have downloaded the scite editor and will give it a try, but I would like to understand why wordpad behaves as it does.  It unfortunately isn't a case of some people using notepad and others using wordpad.  I might install solution 126998 but again I think it is something I am doing wrong somewhere.  Here is a picture of what happens - I have generated a script for this purpose.  I have tried the various but limited wrapping options in Wordpad to no avail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Solution 126998:SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
When Editing a source on a NT system the source is not correctly converted from <br />
the binairy mode as it is stored on the server to the text mode on the client. <br />
Therefor the text is not readable when using notepad for source editing.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Conversion is now done correctly. And sources are also writen back on the <br />
server in binairy mode. It delivers (a.o.) a dllfilehand that stores in Unix format instead of in NT format.<br />
<br />
Wordpad should be able to read chr$(10) as a chr$(13)&amp;chr$(10) sequence and show formatting as correct lines. May depend on your windows version. Anyway I spoke to Geert van der Wal (PEG programmer who is responsible for the standard functions of Baan) and we decided that the files needed to be stored in UNIX format on the server - even if it is a NT box. The sessions should add chr$(13) in file transfer to client and strip them afterwards.<br />
<br />
So editing should be done with the Baan sessions (and then with either Notepad, Wordpad, any other ASCII editor) or when you want to do it directly on the scripts on disk you must need a &quot;Unix-format aware&quot; ASCII editor.<br />
<br />
The script attached shows two problems, one being the &quot;longline&quot; problem where chr$(10) is not detected as a end-of-line character. This has been dealt with in the above solution.<br />
<br />
There is another problem, which is line width. Originally the vi on Unix limited the line width to 80 characters, being the width of a terminal screen. But since external editors became widely used, this 80 charachter limit was no problem anymore. Now with Wordpad you find yourself in wrapping long lines. Select a font setting small enough to have no problems with lines as long as 132 charachters to overcome this problem. Be sure to select a non-proportional font.</div></div><hr />

Thanks to Lucas for the solution. I figured it had to do with the endofline characters. But did not know enough to suggest a solution :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use the WinVI, it's the best editor to use with Baan for NT/2000 or Unix environments.<br />
<br />
It is a freeware software. Please downlaod it from:<br />
<br />
http://www.winvi.de/en/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I replaced your original program attachments with URL's where you can download them. That way people will always have to latest version and we can save space on our forum. If you have better download links then please add them to your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">30th August 2002, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Everybody likes his own editor best.<br />
No use in trying to convince others,... what is true for dentists (they'd rather brush their own tooth with the toothbrush of their fellow dentist than use the same method as the other dentist) is true for a lot of programmers and other computer nerds.<br />
<br />
I still like wp5.1 alot, though you don't see it a lot nowadays.<br />
<br />
If someone has enough guts to start a new thread on why to use which editor, please all join that thread.<br />
<br />
But this thread can be closed, because for the error in the (report)scripts that got corrupted when edited with notepad, it is past tense. See my contribution above.</div></div><hr />

You're right. I will close this thread. Feel free to open a new one discussing editors :)</div></div><hr />

I had already closed the thread :). The open/close threads is a toggle. I am closing this thread again.</div></div><hr />
