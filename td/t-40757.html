<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kansel</div><div class="date">21st August 2007, 01:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I have run into this issue of Infor having changed permissions to compile scripts/libraries with the same name as Infor is using. <br />
I have this library ppurdll44010 located in {$BSE}\application\tdB61O_a_stnd\ptdpur that I really need compiled into the corrosponding object (opurdll4401)<br />
The problem is that Infor have made major changes to the script. These changes have been incorporated into my script, but I am unable to compile the changes.<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
P.S. remove the .txt extension on the attached file and then it's ready to compile.</div></div><hr />

So in our case I would copy it to prd make our changes and compile it in prd.  Then any program calling this routine would hit our version first.  No reason to work in a baan standard VRC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kansel</div><div class="date">22nd August 2007, 10:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your replys. I know that I need product id 7026 to be able to compile standard scripts. Thing is that it is not a standard script any longer as it have been copied to our layer (as indicated by the tdB61O_a_stnd folder) and all the new standard functionality from the tdB61U_a_stnd script have been incorporated in the attached script that I need compiled.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is that Infor have changed the possibility to compile these scripts after FP2 and pre FP2 I was able to compile the scripts.<br />
<br />
To mark_h: I know this and it have been done, but I am still unable to compile the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">22nd August 2007, 10:41</div></div><div class="posttext">If you customized a standard script pre-FP2 and you didn't have a source code license, you got that source not in the official way, I assume. Probably you used one of the tricks published on Baanboard. <br />
It seems that Infor is fighting back a little bit. If you don't pay for the sources, you cannot compile them.</div></div><hr />
