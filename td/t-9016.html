<br />
hi,<br />
<br />
i have to create a report which should contain the following details<br />
<br />
cust_name project/sales order no position cust_item deli_qty sfc_orno1 stock1 sfc_orno2 stock2  <br />
<br />
<br />
here we are taking project no as sales order no.<br />
we are generating production order no through PRP engine<br />
Problem what i am facing is <br />
i am not able to find out the relationship  between sales orderno &amp; position<br />
no. (tdsls041) with sfc<br />
<br />
here is novice's  script<br />
<br />
this should give only 21 records but displaying 63 records<br />
<br />
thanx in advance</div></div><hr />

In your function read.main.table() you have commented out tipcs020.cprj; however, you still have a reference listed in your where clause.  Also a reference statement uses the following format:  Table.field refers to table.  You have table.field refers to table.field.<br />
<br />
You don't have anything calling &quot;get.item.stock&quot; yet.<br />
<br />
I would also include tdsls041.item in your index for get.item.stock.<br />
Depending on how get.item.stock is called you could have multiple records returned from tipcs021.<br />

I don't think tdsls041 is the problem though.  <br />
<br />
I have attached a modified try1.txt  My main concern was that you had included tipcs020 to pull the project number.  However, you already have the project number in tdsls041.cprj and tdsls041.cprj is the field that you use for get.item.stock.<br />

To me, the where clause in function get.item.stock() should be:<br />

where tipcs021._index1 = {:tdsls041.cprj, :tdsls041.item }<br />

<br />
Does all your Sales Order Items are Customised items? Or some sales orders are for normal items as well (Non Project code) which can result into wrong results as well.<br />
