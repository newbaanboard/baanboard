Infor just finished their audit of our BaaN system. They actually had us install a piece audit software on our BaaN server and had us send them the data it collected.<br />
<br />
After the audit, they told us that we have source code in our system which we are not licensed for!! But, the source code in our system either came from patches or from people from BaaN who put the source code to debug/correct the issues we had. All this happened when we had BaaN support (we currently don’t have support).<br />
<br />
Since we have developer license, we have gone on to make change to the source code (that we got it through patches or from BaaN developers). Now, according to Infor, we are not allowed to do that. They say, even though, we have this “left behind source code”, we are not permitted to edit or make changes to them. They have given us the options of buying the source code license or removing the source code and objects from our BaaN server rolling the sessions back to the way they were before we did our customization.<br />
<br />
As anyone been through this? Is Infor correct with this source code issue? <br />
<br />
Appreciate any feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan, for a while, delivered some source code with patches. but they never delivered the include files that would be required to compile that code. <br />
<br />
If you managed to get the include files and then compile the code you'd be out of compliance.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is another option that you may want to propose to them. They have a customization wing of their consulting. You could pay them to create &quot;custom sessions&quot; for you based on your sessions, that would be legal and allow you to to basically continue un-interrupted. <br />
<br />
The upside to this is <br />
<br />
1. You don't have to purchase the source for the entire app (it was $1 million back in the day). <br />
<br />
2. You could work it so that you got support for the customized software (i.e., they'd upgrade it when you wanted to apply patches)<br />
<br />
3. You don't have to rollback your customizations.<br />
<br />
4. It should be cheaper than the other options since it's usually $$ for time and they just need to take your code compile it and package it for you.<br />
<br />
If Infor has left a bad taste in your mouth after the audit, which is understandable, you could go to a 3rd party customization partner  and work out what I've mentioned above.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">28th April 2010, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave, thanks for your feedback. We would have got the include files from patches as well. <br />
<br />
In any case, wouldn't the agreement we signed when we purchased BaaN mention something in regards to this? i.e., not permitted to edit/modify source code that either delivered through patching or from BaaN support team? Is it part of the EULA?<br />
<br />

Kind of strange - but all we had to do was let them know they were our programs.  I did not know some of the things dave mentioned about maintaining our code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">28th April 2010, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark. I going to look at our license agreement to see if I can find anything related to source code. I am not sure if I am going to find anything but I guess it’s worth a try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However if u closely check ur customizations , u can do the same through AFS too . In AFS  u can virtually do almost everything (barring few limitations). But that certainly entails writing ur code to use AFS to call function servers of the sessions u customized . This alternative certainly requires some re-coding.<br />
<br />
Writing ur own code does not in any violate EULA  as long as u do not take any single source developed by vendor.</div></div><hr />
