<br />
This issue identified on Baan V where procesinfo$ is always empty if child session is started via a tools menu, which in turn is started via specific menu of some other session.<br />
<br />
Detail:<br />
My main session (type 3), has a form command of type “menu’ (Specific Menu).  In the menu, I have the same &quot;zoom-to&quot; session listed several times to do different things depending on the menu option selected by user. To make this work I have specified important information in the &quot;Process Info&quot; field.  This information &quot;should&quot; - according documentation - be exported to the &quot;zoom to&quot; session (as specified in the menu).  Problem is that procesinfo$ is always empty in the zoom session (so the Menu field Procesinfo is not being exported to the zoom session)..........  I've tried using quotes / numbers…  Also tried to import procesinfo$... but, procesinfo$ is always empty.  Am I doing something wrong?  To work around the problem I have had to create several sessions linked to the same program script. Its a nasty work around and I'd much rather have a single zoom to session with procesinfo$ containing information regarding the users selection in the menu.<br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I have never used it.  What I did was use export and import - so I executed export in the main session and import in the subsession.  Then based on the value the subsession would run something different.  Not sure if that is a viable work around for you or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the input.  In my session there are approx 35 &quot;options&quot; under specific.  Some users do not have the screen resolution required to effectively show all 35 options.  Hence I have started grouping them logically within Menu's to be accessed via specific menu. Problem is that many of these &quot;options&quot; are simle functions within the main program, and not actually sessions. Since my form is dynamic I cannot add a bunch of buttons in various places on the form as we used to in Baan 4 (or std forms)<br />
<br />
back to the point - since these are mostly functions in the main program (based on selected records ((for i in 1 to... etc))  I would be nuts to call sessions for every record.  However, if procesinfo$ worked then I could send the user selected menu option back to the main program (from a single sub-session) to tell it what to do (which option to execute in main program).  Since it does not wrk, I've had to create 20+ sessions (all linked to the same program script) since this is the only info passed from menu to activated-session... <br />
<br />
Really is quite absurd if you think about it. It would help if Infor get procesinfo$ to work or add some kind of option for menu &quot;scripts&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th January 2013, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot more complicated than I originally thought.  It almost sounds like one session I have where I have managed to keep it under 10 buttons so far.  What I have is a main session that lets the users set a filter.  Then they click continue in it and it launches a subsession.  Then one this subsession they can select individual records, or all of the displayed planned order - and do a whole series of option.  Like add a po line, add it to a po line, new purchase order , etc.  So far we have kept it under 10 options.  I could not imagine having to call different sessions for everything - so 90% of the code is in this one session.  <br />
<br />
Now what I have thought of doing if it grows to large is to add a new domain to the form.  This domain would be a drop down list of options.  Then when they click continue I could see what the domain was and then call the appropriate code based off the selected domain value.  I don't know if that could be incorporated into your session, but that multiple session stuff would bug me also.  In my session all of the options they can pick use some of the same code at various times, so I a few main subroutines and a bunch of smaller ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you wish any variable work across all programs (ie single instance/ version ) in bshell , free$ is the one u may try.</div></div><hr />
