<br />
I am trying to use DAL using<br />
<br />
<br />
dal.new.object()<br />
dal.set.field()<br />
dal.save.object()<br />
<br />
<br />
However, it is giving me a 205 error as follows<br />
<br />
Application error in session ***session code***: Wrong use of DAL Engine ('unreachable case' failed): something wrong with insert or update action on DAL ***table***. <br />
 <br />
File: ittstpdaltbl0 (line 2914). <br />
 <br />
Description: <br />
error = 205: Column is not according to its domain definition (table ***table***, company ***company***). <br />
 <br />
StackTrace: <br />
***stacktrace*** <br />
<br />
***xxx*** are private information.<br />
<br />
There are many dal.set.field() in the code. So, I want to know which field(s) it is talking about. What is the easiest way to figure it out when there are many fields in the code?</div></div><hr />
