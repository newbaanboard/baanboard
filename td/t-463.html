<br />
I am attempting to add text field tdpur041.txta to the form tdpur4131s0001 - Display Receipts to allow our stores people more visibility of the text against the Purchase Order lines and avoid using the text option as they are generally only interested in the first line of text.<br />
<br />
I add the field tdpur041.txta but the form is displaying the text number and not the actual text. In a report script I would interrogate table tttxt010 to get the first line of text, is there anything similar I can do within a form to get to the text.<br />
<br />
Please note I do not have a development licence.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

If you have source for the referenced session, you can: <br />
   1) add a temporary string field to the form (i.e pol.txt)<br />
   2) in the pol.txt fields before.display event, get the 1st line of <br />
       text using the text.to.buf() function<br />
<br />
If you don't have source, you will have to:<br />
   1) create your own display session and script<br />
   2) reverse-engineer the source for the referenced session and <br />
       add your display code<br />
   3) or use a 3rd party package to wrap session event code<br />
       around the session object you already have (I have a <br />
       package to do this, but it's not ready to be released yet)<br />
<br />
Any other options out there?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I don't have the source nor a development licence it appears that the Third Party option may be the only option.<br />
<br />
On a previous thread somebody told me about a product called QKEY but to date I have not received a reply from the mail I sent to them. <br />
<br />
Have you heard of this product and are there any others out there ?<br />
<br />

We use qkey here and it is an excellent product, but I do believe you will need a developers license to use it.  Qkey gives you the ability to make changes to a baan source object - adding, modifying, and changing objects. You do not need source to use qkey, but I think you need a developers license.<br />
<br />
Also I have a copy of some source that would probably also be sufficient for your needs, but again I do believe you need the developers license. The source was provided by Vamsi.  I have not had a chance to work with it, but I hope to get to it soon.<br />
<br />
Without a developers license I am not sure what you can and can not do within Baan.  I do believe you could have a consultant modify the session on their box for you.  That is about the best option that I see.<br />
<br />
I am sure Gordon could provide you with a solution. Check out his web site. :)<br />

<br />
I've spoken to Gordon offline and now currently assesing the options but I will probably need to find out how much of a need there is in the business for these sorts of changes before proceeding.<br />
<br />
However this thread has led me to the conclusion that we do have a development licence and I'm just lacking the source, so at least I'm a little clearer on that front and could use a third party product.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

Neal, I presume you mean you were trying to contact the author of the other response about QKEY and did not get a reply -- hopefully you hadn't actually tried to contact RedKlay and not received a reply like another person seems to think.<br />
<br />
If you would like to examine the QKEY option, feel free to e-mail me directly at RedKlay (my address is in my board profile) and I will put you in contact with the right people.</div></div><hr />
