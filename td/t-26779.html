Not sure what you are trying to accomplish.  I believe there are several methods to print barcodes.  Some barcodes are done by selecting a user defined font.  This font is defined in the print driver file located in the $BSE/lib/printinf directory.  We use pfont14=\E*r0F\E&amp;f0s6y2x1S - this what we use and we print direct from UNIX to HP printers.  I recommend doing a search on this board for Barcode - there are a ton of threads that may be able to help.<br />

Also more information may be needed - I recommend completing your user profile so everyone can see your version of Baan, database driver, etc.  This may change answers to your posts.  Also you might want to explain what you are trying to accomplish and how you are printing (windows, UNIX).</div></div><hr />
