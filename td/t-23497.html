<br />
I am facing a problem in a customized session. The fields in the session are all variables and data is picked from a table and displayed. Hence the choice options for start.set, first.set, next.set, prev.set and last.set is defined in the program. <br />
<br />
Everything is working fine except in case of start.set. When i click the option start.set and input data and use tab key through, the system displays the record (can be seen while debugging) and quickly switches to the first.set and displays the first record.<br />
<br />
I debugged the program and found that start.set is executed and then the program goes to first.set. How can i solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st March 2005, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">What kind of form are you using?  If this is a display session how come you use start.set and not def.find to find records?  In a display session this is how I would expect start.set to work - especially if this is a multi-occurence with view fields.  What exactly do you want start.set to do?<br />
<br />
In one of my maintain sessions I use on.main.table to locate and find the view fields on the form.  This way when the users hits the add.set option I have the correct records displayed which match the view fields.  More info might help someone make a suggestion.<br />
<br />
<br />
choice.start.set:<br />
after.choice:<br />
	on.main.table(check_found)<br />
	if found then<br />
		execute(find.data)<br />
	endif</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right. Since this is complicated it is better to give more details so that I get a specific reply.<br />
<br />
I have enclosed a word document with this thread which has the screen dump and the code written for the same. It is a customization of Display Document History. I think this would be clear and helpful in replying.<br />
<br />
I am using form type 1 ( also tried the same with form type 3 and form type 4). It is a display session but since the fields that i am using is not directly from a table, i have used variables to display the data that is needed.<br />
<br />
Since all the fields are variables and not a table field the choice actions have been put in the code. <br />
<br />
The session and the code could be used as it is and then try to use the choice option start.set, then the record jumps to the first record and not the record that is input.<br />
<br />
Please go through the attachment and let me know if someone could help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st March 2005, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I see what you are doing now.  I did something like this once before, but without start.set being active.  I can see how you are finding the next record, previous record, etc.  From looking at the document I wonder if the start.set event should be after.choice?  I would expect the fields to be entered first, then in after.choice fetch the totals.  On the other options you want to determine the next record (be it a change on account, dim, etc.) then fetch the totals - which should be in before.choice.  BUT in start.set I think it would be in the after.choice even, because you want them to enter the data first.  At least that is what I think so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats great!!!<br />
<br />
I tried the start.set with after.choice option and it is working fine except that the values of opening balance, current month value and closing balance fields were not being displayed even though there is a refresh() after this. So, instead of refresh() I tried the command refresh.curr.occ() and it worked.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for the help!!!<br />
