<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">25th October 2010, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey everyone. Is there some sort of a wildcard varilable or code in BaaN that could help my statement? <br />
<br />
<br />
valid.emno = select.emno.info()<br />
if employee = 0 then<br />
|this is a required field<br />
tccom001.nama = logname$<br />
<br />
I want the logic to replace 0 with a wildcard as I have several employees to which might be 123456, etc, etc, for example. I want everything in the employee field to translate, not just 0. Is there a wildcard like in a MS SQL for example (select * from DB)<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<br />
function domain tcbool isLegalEmployee(long curr.emno)<br />
{<br />
<br />
if curr.emno = 0 then<br />
   return(true)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
if curr.emno &gt; 1234 and curr.emno &lt; 2123 then<br />
   return(true)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
| more ifs ...<br />
<br />
return(false)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
Then you can use this function in your code above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th October 2010, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - there are wild card options for the select statement.  But as George mentioned what are you trying to do?  Because you do not really need a wild card to either get all the records or a specific employee ID.  George demonstrated how you can just execute code for a range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">26th October 2010, 20:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I used this Like George did and it didnt work, kept giving me an error with the &lt; and &gt;. Im trying to basically tell the report that if something is int he emno field, then it needs to equal the logname$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">27th October 2010, 08:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Please post your code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">28th October 2010, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. I have a field called employee (the employee ID number) that is on a form and I also have next to it tccom001.nama, which it the employee name. I have been tasked to see if I could somehow use the current login (logname$) to match up the logname$ with the employee number but I cant seem to find a table withing BaaN here that has all that as our tables dont list all three, only two of the three. I figured there would be a master employee table of some sort that would house all of the information. So Im trying to find a was to automatically populate the current users employee number, as the tccom001.nama changes based on the empliyee number.</div></div><hr />
