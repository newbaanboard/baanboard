<br />
I have a Problem with printing invoices and order responses. <br />
The System is an IBM AIX 5.1 with BaaN IV c4 SP12.<br />
I found a similar description at the BaaN support website:<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
In a report the header is not printed on subsequent pages when it should be printed. This is caused by the printing of a detail-text. <br />
When this text is so large, that it has to continue onto the next page, the header of this next page is not printed.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
When a large text was printed, the program did not check correctly if a new page was started. Because of this, the header of this new page was not printed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is, there is only a solution for BaaN V, does anyone know a solution for BaaN IV? <br />
<br />
Thank you very much, Thomas</div></div><hr />

<br />
It shouldn't be to complicated. You will need to read the text table to find out the number of lines required for your text field, then set a 'need' amount for the layout, that the text is being printed on....<br />
<br />
Other options, could be restricting the text to printing only the number of lines available till the end of the page, by setting lattr.textlines.max (based on spool.pg.length minus how many lines have printed minus footer margin).</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you for your reply. <br />
<br />
The problem is that the error occurs in every report page ending with a text field and this can happen to several reports. So we have to reprogram every single program ...<br />
