<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kevin_Rell</div><div class="date">29th April 2002, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Baan report that is giving me a &quot;Bad skip value&quot; error.  The report keeps running and gives good output but I have to click OK on the message box.  I debugged the report and found that the error is coming from some of the Baan-generated report code.<br />
<br />
How do figure out what is causing this error?<br />
How do I fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">1st May 2002, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">You should debug the report, check where the error starts, judge the conditions on which the error occurs, see the variable values, check on which report section you are, then trace back to which layout part you are in. You can give different conditions on which layouts should be printed or not. I think one of those is not correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steveauckly</div><div class="date">1st May 2002, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using the skip.to() function in your code?  I have seen this function get the line numbers out of whack before.  Unfortunately, I have found no good way to fix it.  If you are using skip.to(), try tracking the line number in debugger, and make sure you are not trying to skip to a previous line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kevin_Rell</div><div class="date">3rd May 2002, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess r.skip.value cannot be negative when the function r.skip.cmd() is called.  I found that the bad code was in the header section of the report when I stepped through in debug mode.  I checked the header layout and found two &quot;stray&quot; lines outside of the true header lines.  I couldn't remove them from the layout so I deleted the layout and recreated it.  All fixed!<br />
