<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">28th August 2006, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to print images in a report. The requirement is to print between 1 to 5 images per page (= item), depending on availability of picture files.<br />
<br />
Pictures are gif-files, stored under $BSE/gif where file-name is item_code_1.gif, item_code_2.gif etc. till 5. So program should work as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
	for j = 1 to 5<br />
		file.name = &quot;e:\baan\gif\&quot; &amp; strip$(shiftl$(tcibd001.item)) &amp; &quot;_&quot; &amp; str$(j) &amp; &quot;.gif&quot;<br />
		fid = seq.open(file.name, &quot;r&quot;)<br />
<br />
		if fid &gt; 0 then<br />
			---&gt; HERE PRINT PICTURE<br />
		endif<br />
	endfor<br />
<br />
<br />
I saw here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=8010&amp;highlight=print+picture) that I should be able to just assign the correct html syntax to a text variable in the script, place it on the report as an input file, and this should be enough for ttstpconv (I assume??) to read it as html during runtime... (see the post of I96NDS from  9th September 2003, 12:30)? I am very bad at html, so maybe someone can give me a concrete detailed example of how to accomplish this..?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance!<br />

One problem however is that the &lt; and &gt; symbols are not recognized as such in iexplore. I.e. when I look at the source of html-page, I see &#60; and &#62; instead of &lt; and &gt;. On the html-page itself it is printed as &lt; and &gt;, however the images will not get printed. When I correct the &lt; and &gt; in the source, it works fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
function html.gifs.handling()<br />
{<br />
	domain tcmcs.long j<br />
<br />
	for j = 1 to 5<br />
		gif(1, j) = &quot;&quot;<br />

Crap - you already said this.  Have you tried just using &lt; and &gt; instead of the chr$(60) and chr$(62)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">15th September 2006, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I did.  I tried replacing the chr$(60) with &quot;&lt;&quot; and the chr$(62) &quot;&gt;&quot; and I get the same result.:confused: <br />
<br />
Also, when the file destination is to a unix directory, it is the same as when the file destination is to a directory on my PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th September 2006, 23:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We should have done a quick search - looks like from this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=28013&amp;page=2&amp;highlight=html) en already has a open case with baan support.  You might want to log a case also.  I do know at one point I played with this and used img to include a company logo and it worked.  That was back when we were on 4c3 - code and test report were lost somewhere along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th September 2006, 00:13</div></div><div class="posttext">And by the way I did think of a work around.  You could build your own device driver and have it do the following:<br />
(1) ttstpconv doing the html conversion,<br />
(2) Run sed to get the &lt; and &gt; in the file - below are the sed commands<br />
s/\&#60;/&lt;/g<br />
s/\&#62;/&gt;/g<br />
(3) down load to the client and launch ie for the given file.<br />
<br />
I would check with baan support first.</div></div><hr />

Mark, can you elaborate on your suggestion (build own device-driver and manipulate tags with sed)? Have you tried this? How would this work exactly? I wouldn't know how to start accomplishing this...</div></div><hr />

See this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=513) - it will show the basics.  In your case you would use HTML instead of ascii on the device.  Next you would run the sed command from the device driver file on the temp HTML file.  Next use server2client to download the file.  And last but not least use app_start to launch IE with the file.  Not complicated and you really should not have to run the sed command, but this would be a work around.<br />
<br />
OOOPs - forgot to add a screen shot of the actual sed command file I used for the replace commands.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your example. Sorry for late response; have been busy with higher priorities. I decided not to use sed, because I don't know sed, AND because I could solve it very simply without sed...<br />
<br />
I created a new 3GL script, in which I call ttstpconv manually, after ttstpconv has finished his job, I open the tmp-file, and I re-edit the html tags correctly and write it all to a new tmp-file. The new file is copied to the users local drive, and opened with Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
If anyone interested, I will post my script. (I don't post it now, because for some odd reason not many people seem to use ttstpconv for html printing...??? I mean otherwise I would expect more people to have ran in to this problem in the past...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd September 2006, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad to see you solved it. I guess it depends on how ofter you do sp updates or patching.  My original test was on 4c3 - since then we went to 4C4 and SP19.  So I am not sure where or when this feature was actually broken.  It also seems to me that a lot of people are still on lower SP's(like 8 and 9) and might still be working for them.</div></div><hr />

Joy, can you post your Case number? Like this I could refer to it in my communication with them.</div></div><hr />
