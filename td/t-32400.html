<br />
How do we separate the lines/rows in a text. Like for example, we have a text group with 10 lines/rows and 30 columns. How can we select only the 1st line/row to be reflected in a report field? How can we select only the 2nd line/row to be reflected on another field?<br />
<br />
When you select the text number, the whole text is printed in the report field. We just want to print the specific lines/row. We are using the text under session Maintain Lots. We have standardized our data encoding on a per line basis, such that the 1st line will bear the analysis data, the second line is for quarantine data, and so on and so forth for the other lines. We have customized a report to include printing of this text but we would like to separate the data per line on each report field.<br />
<br />
Looking forward for your usual assistance.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your suggestion. I have searched the 4GL Functions Manual Pages but cant find the syntax on lattr.print. Perhaps you can elaborate further. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">9th March 2007, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a predefined variable.

Did I miss something?  How is lattr.print going to help mana print the text one line at a time?  Maybe I misssing something, becuase I would recommend using TEXT.TO.BUF.  This puts the text into a two dimensional array that can then be printed one line at a time.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
read the text with &quot;text.to.buf&quot; functions and split the textlines to separate textline variables !<br />
<br />
LIKE :<br />
<br />
#include &lt;bic_text&gt;<br />
<br />
function read.and.seperate.textlines()<br />
{<br />
<br />
string tbuf(80,40)<br />
long t<br />
string text1(30), text2(30), text3(30), .........<br />
<br />
|reset variables<br />
<br />
text1 = &quot;&quot;<br />
text2 = &quot;&quot;<br />
text3 = &quot;&quot;<br />
...........<br />
<br />
<br />
for t = 1 to<br />
text.to.buf(&quot;tiitm001.txta&quot;, &quot;languagecode&quot;, 1, tbuf)<br />
<br />
text1 = strip$(tbuf(1,1))<br />
text2 = strip$(tbuf(1,2))<br />
..................<br />
