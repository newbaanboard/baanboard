<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">15th July 2003, 16:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an application in production that runs in GUI mode and my users are not happy using the mouse and the tab key.  So, I'm playing with the ascii interface and I have a problem.<br />
<br />
Currently the program uses a scanner to read the production order number, the user MUST key the number of pieces and press the tab key.  Then the program executes a vb script that reads weight data through the serial port where a scale attached.<br />
<br />
I am using commands such as app_start() and app_status().  The return value from app_start is a positive number so I believe this is appropriate.  But when the command app_status() is executed, the program hangs in debug mode.  I cannot tell that the program is running using my task manager.<br />
<br />
Can someone enlighten me?  Are these commands not appropriate in ascii mode?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th July 2003, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the app_start would require a connection to the client, which I do not think exists when running in ASCII mode.  I have only played with ASCII mode, but I do not think app_start &amp; app_status would work.  <br />

<br />
This is also true if you want to run this session in cron.<br />

I cannot tell that the program is running using my task manager.Try to open a ttstpshell (in ASCI mode - Reflection for instance - press F6 - choose &quot;start process&quot;; in BW open the option dialog - press button &quot;Start Shell&quot;). Then you can request the process list within the bshell with &quot;ps&quot;. You be resume debugsessions with &quot;debug #&quot; where # is the PID of the debug process. Kill a running process with &quot;kill #&quot; or close all processes with &quot;killall&quot;. If you want to know if your processes are still running (getting processor ticks), you can issue the command &quot;ps&quot; a number of times. Compare the processor ticks of each process between runs.</div></div><hr />
