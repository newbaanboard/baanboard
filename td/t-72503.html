<br />
I have a question: documentation of your customizations - how do you do that?<br />
<br />
My intention is to use the standard Help functions provided to build customized session and table(field)help.<br />
<br />
I put texts on session, table and tablefields which I can see and read from within Tools (ttadv1567m000). <br />
<br />
But now, when I request help on the session or field, I do not see my texts. The &quot;Infor Web Help&quot; viewer comes back with The requested Help text is not found. When hovering I see it uses: id=/baanerp/tc/com/tccom9105m000^tccom905.data, version=107O0dev1, lc=en<br />
<br />
It looks as if I still need a kind of RDD step to actually see (or transfer) the texts to the location where the Help viewer expects them to be, but there is no session (name) that hints me in the direction of the step to perform.</div></div><hr />

Make an enhancement request... :mad:</div></div><hr />
