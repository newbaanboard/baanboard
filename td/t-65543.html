<br />
I am new for Infor 10.3 products.<br />
I am trying to install the Infor ES connector for Infor Reporting. When I do that, it always told me, cannot found where is the Infor Reporting.<br />
So, what's Infor Reporting? I cannot find it in the ISO files, such as Enterprise server (&amp; Swing_UI), LN 10.3, even the studio 10.3.<br />
A little confusing to me, does it mean the application(business) studio etc?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Jeffers</div></div><hr />

I am using this Product now but since the Business vault is still limited I can't get all the data from LN, for example, the Engineering Data Mgmt is not found in BV.</div></div><hr />
