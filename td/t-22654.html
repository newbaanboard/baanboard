We have had several changes to our purchase contract report layout. How can I know which version of the contract I sent to my supplier?<br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered this during changes to their BaaN report? If so, is this logged or have other sessions been developed to determine which report layout was used when the reports were sent.</div></div><hr />
