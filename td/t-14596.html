<br />
I'm not sure if I understand you well. But of course the line 'and wtpur099.ponumber = tdpur041.orno' causes you to get only those records from tdpur041 that exist also in wtpur099. <br />
<br />
Please explain clearly what you want to achieve, and what the problems are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 06:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I needed to get data from purchase table where tdpur041.dim4  is in a range of a value entered on the form (proj.f and proj,t).  Then I also need to get data from purchase table based on  the values in my other table wtpur099,  which contains a purchase order number and project number(proj.f and proj.t) which is also on the form as a range</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh ok, I think now I get it. You want to select 2 ranges from tdpur041. 1) all records from tdpur041 where tdpur041.dim4 inrange :proj.f and :proj.t and 2) all records also from tdpur041 where for which there is a record available in wtpur099. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
Then you should try using the EXISTS condition, something like this: <br />
where	((tdpur040.orno inrange :orno.f and :orno.t or wtpur099.ponumber inrange :orno.f and :orno.t)<br />
	or (EXISTS (select	wtpur099.* <br />
		    from	wtpur099 <br />
		    where	wtpur099.project inrange :proj.f and :proj.t)))<br />
<br />
<br />
You will have to complete the syntax according to your needs, but for the basic idea, I hope this helps...<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
