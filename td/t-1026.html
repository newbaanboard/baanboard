<br />
I have a report with several After.Field layouts and After.Report layout. So:<br />
<br />
Layout              Print Condition<br />
--------------------------------------                             <br />
Detail                0<br />
After.Field 1      1<br />
After.Field 2      1<br />
After.Field 3      1<br />
After.Report      1<br />
<br />
Is it true that BaaN calculate After.Report layout based on After.Field layouts? And After.Field3 based on After.field2 and so on?<br />
Is there any chance to change that?<br />
Of course I have some Totals on After.XXX layouts.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I quickly compile one of my reports that had several after field totals.  Each one of the totals had a variable created called like total..1,total..2 etc.  Then each one of these totals was calculated based on the field I selected to be totaled - not based off of the previous after.field. Compile the report in debug mode and search through it for &quot;total..&quot;.  I do know that you can play with these total.. fields, but I do not recommend it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!!<br />

<br />
Yep, you're right. It was a silly question on me, but I tried several versions of the same report and now I'm very confused. It was an error in my script who &quot;gave&quot; me this ideea.<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm using these total..x variables; I don't think it's dangerous but for certain it's a lot of work to do. After a while if you cange something in the report layout you must change also the fields containing refferences to these total..xx, etc...<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your help.<br />

     I haven't tried playing with the &quot;total.x&quot; variables.<br />
<br />
     But if I am not wrong, if u add a new field on the report then<br />
     the total.x variables change.<br />
<br />
     total.1 could start pointing to a different &quot;total&quot; field.<br />
     You may wanna check it out b4 using them.<br />
<br />
     Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
