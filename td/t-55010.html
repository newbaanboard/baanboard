I am refering to the table whwmd400, field ffsi (Frequency for Storage Inspection). It's domain &quot;tccfre&quot; has the range as &quot;$$ in [1,999]&quot;, means according to me the field cannot hold 0 value, it can accept any value between 1 to 999.<br />
<br />
But when I try to enter the 0 value for this field on the session whwmd4100s000, 2nd tab (Inventory), field &quot;Freq. Storage Inspection&quot;, it accepts the value as well allows me to save it.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help me out to know why is it allowing to save 0 value?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

       I found even the same behaviour mentioned in the above post for the field tdipu001.suti (Supply Time). It's domain is tcwttm with range as &quot;$$ &gt;0&quot; but still accepts the value 0 when I enter the value for it from session or say GTM. It does not give me any error message.<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

Check your user profile file.  The is a line for domain checking that is either set to yes/no 0/1.  Change it to the other value, log out and back in and see if it now gives an error.<br />
<br />
In my experience there was a consultant that wanted to use the ABC code as a single character. Since he wanted to use more than just the A-C range, he shut off domain checking. :eek:</div></div><hr />

             Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
             I checked user profile file. The line for domain checking was already set to 1. Still I tried with 0 value for the whwmd400.ffsi and also other field. It did not give me any error message.<br />
