(same is with some more reports in distribution package)<br />
<br />
Fonts are bigger than thrue Unix on the same HP LJ printer &amp;<br />
 I tried it with 2 newest ver. of BW-client and get the same result.<br />
<br />
my system is<br />
BaanIVc4 on AIX with Win NT BW clients;<br />
<br />
I can solve the problem by localy changing fonts but it can make problems with other reports which are super now <br />
(so I don't do that)?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />

<br />
1. Why changing if all works fine by AIX =&gt; printer?<br />
2. Is it not possible to select your needed font as a default font in the printer setup itself?<br />
<br />
Now at our site we print directly from  AIX =&gt; printer, but we are changing that!<br />
We want to send the print queue from AIX =&gt; Windows printserver =&gt; printer. So we have nothing to do with fonts.<br />
We do so because we have problems, because one also prints by MS-word/excel and so on to the same printer. But if somebody print by Baan, he get priority and that give problems with the printer (sometimes goes down) as well with the users (prints get mixed up).<br />

Windows printing from Baan give us possibility to:<br />
a) preview before vasting paper<br />
b) store report as - bpf file <br />
                             . txt file<br />
                             . doc file<br />
                             . xls file<br />
c) to send mail directly from Baan<br />
d) use one Baan device no metter on which Windows printer user is using or where is printer or where is user ...<br />
<br />
e) ...<br />
<br />
And, when you get used with it - you need it and want it<br />
<br />
So, if someone want to help - I'll appriciate<br />

But, since you are mainly talking about a few reports couldn't you change the font on the reports in question?  I know on the purchase order report that is a lot of work, but I can not think of another solution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">28th August 2002, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case better take an old bw version from the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 08:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
problem in taking old bw is one more advantage of new bw;<br />
printing of bar-code, which I didn't mention, but we use it in hours accountig and works very, very good<br />
(after a lot of bar-code setup effords)<br />
<br />
I solve problem in the way I don't like:<br />
using User defined font (14) in bw.<br />
Problem is I have to take care than all clients in purchase dept. have that font defined different then others, and if any report comes with that font - there may be problems.<br />
<br />
I hope Baan people will try bw printing before issuing a new version of bw (bwprint) <br />
( isn't it ok?)<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Now you mention it, there was a solution on the Baan site mentioning these kind of problems using fonts in Baan. I forgot what it exactly did, but you were able to toggle some switch that caused bw-print to return to non proportional or old-fashioned font spacing... Search on the baan-site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">This solution should make things fit by using a option of bwprint.</div></div><hr />

prerequisit for this solution is horror - solution 116358 which I have available but I am realy scared to death to do this:<br />
<br />
:( &quot;This solution contains a new ttstpsplopen and ttstpsplclose with correct dependencies to solution 110323, which contains domains and table definitions, which are required by the new object ttstpsplopen. Before installing this solution (but after installing solution 110323) it is necessary to run create runtime datadictionary for tools: Session ttadv5213m000 for all package combinations/ sessions with the option &quot;Also Dump Data Definitions&quot; set to Yes. While this session is being run other users should not be allowed to be logged on to the system.After this action you should create the 3 new tables for company 000.The easiest way is to start general table maintanance and select this table. On the question &quot;File does not exist, allocate&quot; you should answer &quot;Yes&quot; and the table will be created. Do this action for the tables ttaad322, ttaad508 and ttaad331.Table ttaad508 should be created for all companies. When this has been done solution 116358 may be installed.&quot; <br />
eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
I'll be fine for now with user defined font 14 in BWprint which will be currier new 9 and reports will fit on paper<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />
