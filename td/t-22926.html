	We are sending out POs via email to our suppliers.<br />
	These are sent from one common email account say <br />
             purchasing@company.com<br />
	<br />
	To acknowledge the PO, the Suppliers just press the &quot;reply&quot; button.<br />
<br />
	Then the buyers access this email and update the PO acknoledment <br />
             details (PO#, Supplier, Date).<br />
<br />
	Now they want this update (to Baan) happen automatically.<br />
	So basically I'll have to read the email message to extract the info <br />
            (which is present in the subject). <br />
<br />
	I was thinking of someway to read the email and create a text file <br />
             which can be read by a Baan session.	<br />
<br />
	How do I create this txt file from the email message?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
some info on your OS would indeed have been useful here.<br />
If you have a local mailhost that is a unix machine, the solution is very simple.<br />
In most unix-flavours the mail for user XYZ will be put to a file /var/spool/mail/XYZ. Nothing keeps you from creating a script, that sleeps some seconds, then compares this file with the latest image from it, processes the new lines (scans for the signalling subject lines or whatever), creates a textfile if necessary, creates a new image and goes to sleep again.<br />
If your mailhost runs at your providers site or on a Microsoft-box, you can still have the account for XYZ on a unix (linux?) box and poll the mailhost with fetchmail ... rest see above.<br />
<br />
There will be possibilities to solve this on M$-systems too, but who cares....<br />

If I remember correctly you use Streamserve. There is a connector in Streamserve to read and process email. In the documentation it is referred to as &quot;mail input connector&quot;.</div></div><hr />
