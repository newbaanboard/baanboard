<br />
There is a specific requirement to take inputs from a Scanner into BaaN session. At the same time all the fields should be disabled.<br />
<br />
Basically the scanner should read the data from Bar codes and the same must be reflected in display fields.<br />
<br />
How can BaaN know when the field entry is complete. For eg if I have to scan a string followed by a numeric... and how would BaaN know that the data entry (scanning) for string field is complete and now it should move on to next field. Is there a trigger or a way to capture the event... With keyboard, we use tab or mouse clicks and then the BaaN triggers are fired. However, for the specific requirement I am talking abt.. all the fields have to be disabled.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?</div></div><hr />

Welcome to board!:) <br />
<br />
Whatever you explained is not sufficient, may be you can take a example and explain.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you can use string.scan for distributing data stream into variables and later put it into BaaN tables through session using AFS.<br />
<br />
And you can use attr.input = false to disable it for editing.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

But what I do for some of our tags is code in a &quot;tab&quot; at the end of a barcode.  That will move it to the next field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">13th July 2010, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">mark any additional knowledge on this since 2007. I have my scanner to send TAB, but still Baan wouldnt move the cursor to the next field. I know scanner is firing TAB, since i try it in notepad, i could see the data followed by TAB.<br />
I am searching all the Bar code post to find any ideas. So far no luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">14th July 2010, 05:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark i found the fix. I posted the solution in another post, re-posting here for closure<br />
================<br />
Now the issue is fixed. I had code 1009 programmed for TAB, this one translate to Ctrl I and if the application has some mapping for that key combination (like in Ms Word Crtl I is to make Italics) it doesnt work<br />
But now i found, after googling, we have to use function mapping keys for TAB, which sends a TAB which works fine. For Symbol LS4000i this code is 7009.<br />
It might be that for other scanners this code might be different</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th July 2010, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Our scanners are really not that sophisticated and we are using barcode 3 of 9. Plus not all tags we use did they want tabs after.  So in the one case where they did want tabs (since we created the tags in another baan session) I just changed the output to include a tab on certain fields.  I think they call them move tags and it allows them to rapidly transfer material from one place to another.  I think just recently they stopped using this process all together - not sure since baan is a very small part of my current position.<br />

But thanks for posting the solution.</div></div><hr />
