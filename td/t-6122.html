I tried to change a text entry in a report after saving the original. I compiled and converted VRC for the changed report.<br />
<br />
The text change was OK but a field that was hidden in the original report (payment terms for a customer) has now become unhidden, when I replaced the original report and converted the VRC the field is unhidden in the original report.<br />
<br />
So how do I hide a field?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I edited the field so that the print condition was 0 (it doesn`t give that option in help but I thought if 1 meant print then 0 should mean don`t print).<br />
<br />
That seemed to do the trick but why/how did it change in the first place??</div></div><hr />
