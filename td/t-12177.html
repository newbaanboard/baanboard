<br />
I'am trying to create a display session showing data from 5 tables. This needs to be shown as multi occurence form. I have tried using Display.occ and related functions in selectdo part of query but i always end up showing only last row of select.<br />
<br />
What is the correct way to program such a display session ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">14th July 2003, 13:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there... The best way is to select one main table first. (baan uses the principle of having one main table per session). Obviously your joins between the tables is significant - for example your choosen main table may not contain records however you might want to display the records on the other tables anyway. (could be a problem) Now that you have your main table you would call the other tables in your script based on the references defined. The best place to call the other tables is in the field section of the main table.<br />
<br />
<br />
field.xxxxxxx:<br />
before.display:<br />
     select  ttpppxxx.*<br />
     from    ttpppxxx<br />
     where ttpppxxx._indexZ =<br />

<br />
First check if variable &quot;print.orno&quot; is not empty<br />
Second check if records are exists in both table with the same item.<br />
Third, why u written query in after.display?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">renzosing</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">print.orno does contain a value, which is the order number, i checked this in debug mode. I'm only using tcibd001 to get the description on the sales item that is selected from tdsls401. Also, I was following an example I saw and that is why I used after.display. So, I don't know why its only printing the last record from the select statement, but I can see all of the data in debug mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the key table on the form?  Your after display section will not add rows to the display, the main table and key you are using should determine the rows.  If your key is just orno, it will only display 1 row for each orno, and given your logic display only the last value it had for those other display fields.  <br />
<br />
Your main table should have a key of Orno / Pono if you want multiple lines matching the tdsls401 table.  Maybe you should even be using the tdsls401 table as your main table, it looks like that's so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">See this post by (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=16672) Hitesh Shah if you are trying to display multiple records without a main table display link.  Typically when I write these type sessions my maintable would have order and item on it.  Then my query - I usually use before.display would look like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
    select  tdsls401.ofbp,<br />
            tdsls401.orno,<br />
            tdsls401.item:print.item,<br />
            tdsls401.oamt:print.total,<br />
            tdsls401.damt:print.discnt,<br />
            tcibd001.item,<br />
            tcibd001.dsca:print.dsca<br />
    from    tdsls401,<br />
            tcibd001<br />
    where   tdsls401.orno = :maintable.orno<br />
        and tdsls401.item = :maintable.item<br />
        and tdsls401.sqnb = 0<br />
    as set with 1 rows<br />
    selectdo<br />
        display(&quot;print.dsca&quot;)<br />
        display(&quot;print.total&quot;)<br />
    endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Notice that I am using two fields to get the description and total.  If item is not available then you need to use the post above - Hitesh lays out how to get mutliple records like this.<br />
<br />
On a side note - when posting queries or code you need to disable smiles in the post - keeps all them darn :)'s faces from appearing.  It also makes the code easier to read if you use the code tags - check the board help on these.<br />

It has a postion number, but it is zero for all orders. What I'm trying to do is when I import the orno number from the table tdsls420, I then look for that order number in table tdsls401, and get all the items that within that order number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with others that first decision is main table selection. And all rest has to be decided later on. <br />
<br />
My earlier  post referred to by Mark will not work properly if the there are no records in the main table . Ideally when bringing records from other tables there should be 1-1 or many - 1 correspndence (either with group by clause or without it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you are really fighting Baan if your main table does not have the key you want.  Key = Rows.<br />
<br />
Why not make tdsls401 the main table - it's just a display, right?  Try the following:<br />
<br />
On the session change the main table to tdsls401 <br />
On the form make the Orno / Position from tdsls401<br />
<br />
Import the orno as you have done<br />
Make a query extension to limit the tdsls401 orno to what you imported.<br />
See This WIKI topic on Query Extends in Zooms (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_sql_query_extensions_query_extend_where) for info, post up if you need help there.<br />
<br />
This should get you much closer.  You may still need to pull in the description, but that can be done easily through a simliar query as what you have, but just select the tcibd001.dsca, put that on the form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">renzosing</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 21:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to thank everyone for their input earlier. This is my last comment, but tdsls401 is the main table in the session. I'm importing the order number from tdsls420.  With the order number imported, I then do a search in tdsls401 for that order number. Once it finds the order number, I then want the business partner, item,etc. There are records (the order number) in the main table. For instances, when I run the script I select an order number that I know is in the main table. There are 8 different items associated with this order. When I have the debugger on, I see all the information I need from the select statement and it seems stored in the variable assigned , but when it is finishes the script only the last item associated the order number is displayed. Maybe, I'm still not understanding what everyone is saying, but my logic seems correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Your query after the order number is always going to find all 8 items.  It will aways do the display statements 8 times.  What happens is on the multi-occurance form it will always be on the first line.  So the display 8 times will result in only the last item to be displayed.  What I picture you having is session that looks like this:<br />
<br />
ORDER: tdsls401.orno<br />
<br />
ITEM         DESCRIPTION<br />
print.item   print.dsca<br />
print.item   print.dsca<br />
<br />
Where item and description are the multi-occurance fields.  So the fields(lower case) are fields first by your orno.  This triggers the after.display which finds all 8 parts and only displays the last.  If your form and fields looked like this(I am not familiar with these tables):<br />
<br />
ORDER: tdsls401.orno<br />
<br />
PONO             ITEM         DESCRIPTION<br />
tdsls401.pono  print.item   print.dsca<br />
tdsls401.pono  print.item   print.dsca<br />
<br />
Then with your query you could do this<br />
<br />
<br />
field.tdsls401.pono:<br />
before.display<br />
    select  tdsls401.ofbp,<br />
              tdsls401.orno,<br />
              tdsls401.item:print.item,<br />
              tdsls401.oamt:print.total,<br />
              tdsls401.damt:print.discnt,<br />
              tcibd001.item,<br />
              tcibd001.dsca:print.dsca<br />
    from    tdsls401,<br />
              tcibd001<br />
    where  tdsls401.orno = :tdsls401.orno<br />
       and  tdsls401.pono = :tdsls401.pono<br />
       and  tdsls401.sqnb = 0<br />
       as set with 1 rows<br />
    selectdo<br />
        display(&quot;print.dsca&quot;)<br />
        display(&quot;print.total&quot;)<br />
    endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Then as the session displays the positions it can find each of the items.  Hope I explained it better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">renzosing</div><div class="date">4th October 2004, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">O.k., below is my code.  If i run it as is it doesn't give me anything, I'm assuming this is because, once I select the order number (print.orno) which is imported. I don't refer to that order number anywhere in the script. I'm somewhat a beginner at this so I appreciate everyone's cooperation.  I see where having a main table is important, maybe I'm confused about this <br />
<br />
What I'm doing is importing only an order number from another session, table tdsls420 (print.orno). With this order number I then want to get all my data from table tdsls401. So, I assuming that tdsls401 would be consider my main and only table, with the exception of tcibd001, which is used to get the description only.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th October 2004, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - Let see if we can guide you through this process.  What main table do you have on the session?  Next what is the start option on the session?  What fields do you have on the form?  What type of form is it?  We do not have these tables on our system.  So what fields are on tdsls401<br />
<br />
I expect the main table to be tdsls401 for this session.   SO lets ignore the tcidb001 table for know.  Lets get the session working and doing a find on tdsls401 to start with.  Since your main table is tdsls401 we need to first get tdsls401.orno.  In Baan IV we have used this method(note for this part of the code I am assuming Baan V has these fields on this table and it works like Baan IV):<br />
<br />
<br />
zoom.from.all:<br />
on.entry:<br />
   tdsls401.orno = tdsls420.orno<br />
   execute(find.data)<br />
<br />
<br />
Then on the form only have something like this:<br />
<br />
ORDER: tdsls401.orno<br />
<br />
Pono              Amount<br />
tdsls401.pono  tdsls401.oamt<br />
<br />
Lets get this working first before we start throwing in other tables first.  Then once you get the concept down then you can modify the forms to what you really want.  When compiling use debug until you get comfortable with each step.<br />
