<br />
Here is the link for &quot;#ident&quot; documentation:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_3gl_features_object_identifications_preprocessor<br />
<br />
Can you please elaborate more about what do you mean by &quot;variants&quot;?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chethu4u143</div><div class="date">19th November 2008, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">actually while copying the script from baan session, you will be asked whether to create a variant or not in baan 4 b2. if selected yes , then you will have a new variant created ( separate script ) . At max you can create only 5 variants for each program script. <br />
my question is what is the use of these variant when compare to normal copying up ( taking back up) of a script</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th November 2008, 23:40</div></div><div class="posttext">We don't use it.  Me - I just copy the scripts to something like .1 or .2 if I need to keep multiple copies.  Then I just point the session to the version I want to run.  I have only done this a few times.  Usually in development we only work on a copy of production.  I am sure others might have a different use for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kw_foo</div><div class="date">21st November 2008, 04:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We use this as the backup of some complicated script before we make the changes on it so that we can check and compare the code before the modification and also allow to quick roll back if something unexpected after it roll out to production.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">21st November 2008, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">For me it's a useless option. When changing a script I always keep track in it of the changes by means of standard comments of start/end of old or new changes, so it's easy anyway to turn the script to original state.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">21st November 2008, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used it only a couple of times and regret it very much. The main risk I see is that sometimes I don't look whether there are variants and variant 0 as default will be opened for editing. <br />
So far it has never happened, but I fear that one day I will make a change in the obsolete version and compile it :-(<br />
Today I take backups on OS level before changing a script - besides we have a test environment.<br />
Has anyone found this variant thing useful so far??<br />
<br />
