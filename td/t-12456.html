<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhill5</div><div class="date">31st July 2003, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently customised a Baan session by adding a zoom to a non-key field, which takes the user to a display session.  <br />
<br />
On some of our client PC's, the little black triangle adjacent to the field does not appear, on an intermittent basis.  <br />
<br />
When you hold the mouse over the part of the screen where the triangle should be, the mouse pointer does change into the magnifying glass, and the display session appears as expected when the left mouse button is pressed.  However, I am still keen to find out why the black triangle is not displayed.<br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered this type of problem before?  Does anyone have any idea what could be the cause?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Is it always the same clients?  Or will it work one time and then not again?  Just wondering if someone has check the client configuration when it is not working, to one that is working.  Again not sure what to just, but just a thought I had after reading the post.<br />

But it doesn't seem to be because they are running a different version of the client software - I am told that they running the same version as on clients where it doesn't seem to be a problem (B40c.67).<br />

I was thinking more of the PC windows setup itself.  Maybe something with the pointers.  I am not really sure about the interaction between  Baan client and windows.<br />

Probably switching the cursor is a low priority and it gets missed if your CPU is busy? <br />
<br />
Kepe note this is an unscientfific observance.<br />
<br />
 You will notice that the cursor does not get &quot;switched&quot; quite frequently if you use an application like VNC or PC Anywhere and you are using the bw client on a PC and thus more overhead between the OS/display/software.  This is probably happening intermittently on some of your client PC's, but there is not much you can do about it - other than probably getting a faster system.</div></div><hr />

There is a check Box &quot;Graphical Form&quot;, check this. Help for this field says that one position should be reserved for the Zoom Indicator ( Black triangle) for zoom field, if this is not done zoom indicator may not be displayed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
