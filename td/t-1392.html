<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">15th March 2002, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a customized session that zooms to another session that allows you to select values for certain fields and then returns you to the original session, which now only displays the items matching your selection.  Kind of a filter session.  I get an error &quot;transaction is on can't continue&quot; error when trying to zoom to the session.  <br />
<br />
I had this problem a little while ago with another session and some suggested I recompile my script and that worked.  I have done that with this session and I still get the error.  I know its got something to do with db.retry and commit.transaction commands.  <br />
<br />
The error occurs when the script tries to run &quot;execute(find.data)&quot; in the script. <br />
<br />
Can anyone shed more light on this problem I have?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example in your case: If you are zooming to another maintain session, then you are trying to start another transaction without completing the first one. You have to find a way to not start another transaction or complete the first one before you zoom.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
  if you have code like:<br />
<br />
      db.retry.point()<br />
          ....................<br />
         db.retry.point()   ( at this point you will get a error)<br />
         commit.transaction()<br />
         .............<br />
         ...............<br />
      commit.transaction()</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you still having problems with the transaction is on?<br />
<br />
There is a check box on the maintain session (when setting up user defined buttons) that says something like &quot;Complete transaction&quot; (or something! - can't remember exactly what). Try checking that.<br />
<br />
What this does is complete any transactions prior to zooming to the session. When the session returns and you try to filter, you do not have any outstanding transactions.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how this goes.<br />
<br />
