  <br />
I am working BaaN Vc.  <br />
  <br />
I have a big problem with the dates in BaaN, It happens me because, one external application puts information directly in my oracle database, in this information that program is saving information with dates &amp; times, for example that external application save one row with 15/01/2009 16:27:00, but when I see in ttaad4500 appears me 11:27:00. I have looked for in BaaNBoard forums and I understand now that BaaN that it applies the difference with the greenwich meridian (I am GMT-05:00). But in this case I don't want that BaaN works in this way for this case.  <br />
  <br />
What should I do to fix this, without I change the baan configuration, and I don't damage the configuration for the rest of the application?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

The solution: the external application inputs the data with the GMT =P</div></div><hr />

  <br />
Thank you  <br />
  <br />
I don't understand you, because the external application makes a insert into on baan tables.  <br />
  <br />
What do you said me, when you told me &quot;The solution: the external application inputs the data with the GMT =P&quot;?  <br />
  <br />
How should the external application make it to obtain GMT =P in &quot;Insert into&quot; sql instruction?<br />
<br />
Thak you for your help........</div></div><hr />

You can then use some date/time functions to convert the time to your time zone or you could read time always with the time zone.<br />
I understand this sounds simple but involves too many changes as you have to modify all scripts which use the date to consider the time zone. But this should fix the issue forever :)</div></div><hr />
