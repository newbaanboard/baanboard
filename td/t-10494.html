When I migrate changes from one vrc to another, the release note is no longer attached.  I have to find the text and reattach it.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to migrate these components and the release notes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 04:29</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the (non)beauty of release notes.  They are basically useless.  It's pretty much an undocumented feature in Baan, but release notes DO NOT go over when you move an object from one VRC to another.<br />
<br />
You should be using TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION to document your objects and stay away from release notes.  Release notes are only good for an object which will stay put in the VRC.  e.g.  temporary notes about why the object is in the VRC or whatever.<br />
<br />
Tech docs go over whether you copy to existing VRC or copy the object to an entirely new object.<br />
<br />
I personally never use release notes and always use tech docs to document.  That and customization admin, which not many people use, but is great bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />
