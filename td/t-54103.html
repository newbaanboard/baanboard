  <br />
I am using in Baan Vc  <br />
  <br />
I am creating the sales orders by tdslsdll1234, but I am using a multi-thread processing and I got one error in this schema.  <br />
  <br />
I believe that the access is too quick to this table (tcmcs050) . When occurs this tcmcs050 returns me the same number to two different orders and obviously I am not able to record the row in the header (tdsls400). This error is random.  <br />
  <br />
I have tested with tcmcs0598m000, tcmcs0597m000 and putting the component in shared memory, but I don't get to improve this problem.  <br />
  <br />
Exists some way to control this, that is to say, that the tcmcs050 table can improve its performance.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Cache Size To improve the performance of sessions in which new order numbers are assigned, you can define a cache size for a series. The cache size is the number of new series numbers that BaanERP generates and puts in the user's cache. The users do not have to wait while BaanERP generates and checks the next series numbers.<br />
If you use the first free numbers cache, the order numbers can be nonsequential; the numbers that are still in the user's cache are lost when the user logs off.<br />
If you do not want to use the first free numbers cache, you must set the cache size to zero.</div></div><hr />
