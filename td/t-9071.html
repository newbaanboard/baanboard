<br />
  I'm trying to print a bmp/jpg/jpeg file from Baan. <br />
No.. not a logo, but a full size image. <br />
( I cannot create TTFs for each image :) )<br />
<br />
As soon as the production Planning is printed, we want to print the production sketches on a seperate page.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to print JPG files from Baan ?<br />
One way to look at it, is to do a application start from Baan.. bring up, say MS Paint or Word... But how do we get to print the file automatically ? Has anyone written a Macro to do that  ?<br />
<br />
Any new ideas ?<br />
<br />
All help is appreciated. Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

I found this in the BWprint help manual. I never used it, but you can try to play with it.<br />
<br />
Direct mode<br />
<br />
In direct mode, a report is printed without preview and without the need for user interaction. In this mode, only errors are reported to the user.<br />
<br />
BWPRINT is started in direct mode if it is activated with the option /p. This happens also if BWPRINT is started via the File Print-menu of the File manager.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertB</div><div class="date">1st March 2003, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting Word to print the file automatically is fairly straightforward using something like:Private Sub Document_Open()<br />
<br />
    ActiveDocument.PrintOut<br />
    ActiveDocument.Close<br />
    <br />
End Sub - but then you'll probably get that little window pop up which asks you whether you want  to activate Macros or not...<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd write a small VB/VC++/Delphi program to print the desired document/graphic in the background with no user involvement. Then you get exactly what you want...<br />

When printing documents, we also print associated drawings/documents (AutoCAD, Word, Excel, JPG, etc.).  In doing so, we keep the sorting intact so that all of one order's documents are kept together.<br />
<br />
As you suggest, getting the drawings/documents to print automatically without user intervention was the trickiest part...  :)</div></div><hr />
