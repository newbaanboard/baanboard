Can anybody explain how table boosters are implemented for BaaN sessions. Is it necessary that script should be written in some specific way?</div></div><hr />

There may be others but my supply to Baan Doc's is not as easy to get to as it used to be.</div></div><hr />

Are you trying to use table boosters in a script?  Or are you trying to understand how to write a script that will execute efficiently?</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing though, if you have a problem, be prepared for headaches. <br />
<br />
The table boosters work by removing some functionality in the scripts, therefore working only one the things you want and forgetting the rest. However, if you have a problem, it will first be linked to this and you may find yourself going round in circles trying to find a solution. <br />
<br />
Everyone that I know that uses them went through a lot of testing to make sure that they worked and carried on working.</div></div><hr />

Maintain Use of Performance Boosters (tcmcs0197m000)<br />
SESSION OBJECTIVE<br />
To link performance boosters to sessions, to users, or to a combination of these.<br />
NOTE: Wherever in an application a booster can be applied, but that booster has not been set in this session, the following will occur: table Use of Performance Boosters (tcmcs097) will be inserted with the booster concerned for the user and the session that is running and the validation in the field &quot;Booster Valid&quot; will be &quot;Not Active&quot;<br />
HOW TO USE THE SESSION<br />
Performance Boosters can be used at three levels, each starting with another identifier. The following combinations may therefore be made:<br />
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ <br />
| Session             | Performance Booster | User                |<br />
|---------------------+---------------------+---------------------| <br />
| Performance Booster | Session             | Performance Booster | <br />
| User                | User                | Session             |<br />
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+<br />
It is necessary to always fill in the performance booster which should be used and the session for which the booster is valid.<br />
<br />
Here is some information about the settings needed for using the boosters.<br />
<br />
Sessioncode	Number of Servers	Internal Memory	<br />
tpppc4411m000	3               	ttpptc050	<br />
<br />

Bien le Bonjour<br />
