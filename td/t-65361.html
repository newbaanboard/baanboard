I need to read data from another environment of Baan IV.<br />
We have two separate environments, one for each enterprise in the group.<br />
Enterprise A buys from Enterprise B. I need to read data from the invoice emmited by enterprise B while receiving it in enterprise A.<br />
Is there a way to do it?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
use internal EDI.<br />
<br />
Works between BaaN IV / BaaN IV and LN / BaaN IV<br />
<br />
Typical constellation :<br />
<br />
A --&gt; ORDERS (purchase) to B<br />
B --&gt; DADVIS (delivery) to A<br />
B --&gt; INVOICE to A<br />
<br />

How would that work?<br />
<br />
Do you have any documentation?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
if you don't have any EDI (ElectronicDataInterchange) knowledge, i think it is to difficult to explain how it works.<br />
<br />
We use this internal EDI between our sites with BaaN IV and LN for the process you've described.<br />
<br />
Company A purchases goods from Company B<br />
B delivers the goods to A<br />
A receives goods from B<br />
B invoices the goods to A<br />
<br />
All this is done with EDI Messages.<br />
<br />
In BaaN IV you'll find it under Distribution -- Electronic Data Interchange.<br />
<br />
I only have a inhouse documentation in german. This doc can't be shared.<br />
<br />

<br />
as mentioned by Bernd the EDI set-up and procedure is a bit complex and need some knowledge.<br />
<br />
For a start go to http://edi.baan.com/<br />
<br />
In the BaanIV documents (Document Definitions -&gt; BaanIV) look to the document &quot;EDI User Guide&quot; and especially to chapter 8 (Internal EDI).<br />
