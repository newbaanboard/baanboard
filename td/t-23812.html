I am trying to select unique sales order numbers from the table tdsls045 and in some cases the system is not doing so. I am not sure about the mistake in my code which is given below;<br />
select  tdsls045.orno :orno1<br />
from    tdsls045, tiitm001, tccom010<br />
where   tdsls045._index1 inrange {:orno.f} and {:orno.t}<br />
and     (tdsls045.orno between :orno.f and :orno.t<br />
         and tdsls045.orno not between 800000 and 899999)<br />
and     tdsls045.item between :item.f and :item.t<br />
and     tdsls045.cuno between :cuno.f and :cuno.t<br />
and     tdsls045.ddat between :ddat.f and :ddat.t<br />
and     tdsls045.item refers to tiitm001<br />
and     tdsls045.cuno refers to tccom010<br />
and     tiitm001.kitm = tckitm.manufacture<br />
and     tccom010.ccty = &quot;BAH&quot;<br />
group by tdsls045.orno<br />
selectdo<br />
           further process......<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Please let me know how can i get unique sales order number in the above code to further process after the selecdo option.</div></div><hr />

It will only group when the orders are in sequential order.</div></div><hr />

It seems superfluous.<br />
<br />
where   tdsls045._index1 inrange {:orno.f} and {:orno.t}<br />
and     (tdsls045.orno between :orno.f and :orno.t<br />
         and tdsls045.orno not between 800000 and 899999)<br />
I think this is also possible:<br />
where   tdsls045._index1 inrange {:orno.f} and {:orno.t}<br />
and     tdsls045.orno not between 800000 and 899999</div></div><hr />

I have made changes as suggested and problem still exists. Code is now as follows;<br />
select  tdsls045.orno :orno1<br />
from    tdsls045, tiitm001, tccom010<br />
where   tdsls045._index1 inrange {:orno.f} and {:orno.t}<br />
and tdsls045.orno not between 800000 and 899999<br />
and     tdsls045.item between :item.f and :item.t<br />
and     tdsls045.cuno between :cuno.f and :cuno.t<br />
and     tdsls045.ddat between :ddat.f and :ddat.t<br />
and     tdsls045.item refers to tiitm001<br />
and     tdsls045.cuno refers to tccom010<br />
and     tiitm001.kitm = tckitm.manufacture<br />
and     tccom010.ccty = &quot;BAH&quot;<br />
group by tdsls045.orno<br />
order by tdsls045.orno<br />
selectdo<br />
           further process......<br />
endselect</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also have very often problems with group by  :mad: . So I'm mostly using a &quot;complicate way&quot; without group by.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
<br />
select	tdsls040.*,<br />
	tccom010.*<br />
from	tdsls040,<br />
	tccom010<br />
where	tdsls040._index1 inrange {:orno.f} and {:orno.t}<br />
and	(tdsls040.orno &lt; 800000 or tdsls040.orno &gt; 899999)<br />
and     tdsls040.cuno inrange :cuno.f and :cuno.t<br />
and     tdsls040.cuno  refers to tccom010<br />
and     tccom010.ccty = &quot;BAH&quot;<br />
selectdo<br />
	select  tdsls045.orno,<br />
		tiitm001.kitm<br />
	from    tdsls045, <br />
		tiitm001<br />
	where   tdsls045._index1 = {:tdsls040.orno}<br />
	and     tdsls045.item inrange :item.f and :item.t<br />
	and     tdsls045.ddat inrange :ddat.f and :ddat.t<br />
	and     tdsls045.item refers to tiitm001<br />
	and     tiitm001.kitm = tckitm.manufacture<br />
	as set with 1 rows         | In this case the same result like group by<br />
	selectdo<br />
		   further process......<br />
	endselect<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe a little slower, but easier to handle.<br />
<br />
