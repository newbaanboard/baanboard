<br />
We have a C program that uses the Baan C interface to execute a function in a Baan DLL, which prints some Baan reports.  <br />
<br />
On our production server, the program will sometimes hang when the DLL calls spool.open().  When this happens, a zero length spool file is left.  No fatal error gets generated, but we get the following list of the bshell processes running when the hanging occurs:<br />

Baan support has not been able to reproduce our problem in their environment.  We have installed the latest portingset, standard and splopen/close solutions for them to no avail.  So I am getting desperate, and wondering if anyone has any insight as to what might be happening.<br />
<br />
The hanging occurs on roughly 1% of the spool.open() calls, and the frequency of the hanging might be related to server load (e.g. hangs more often during peak usage).  So it has been very diffulcult to reproduce in a test environment, although I have been successful in doing so.  Another interesting fact is that the DLL opens and closes the spooler multiple times, but the hanging always occurs on the first spool.open call in the DLL.  That is, if the first call succeeeds, the DLL will not hang for the rest of the spool.open calls.<br />
<br />
I welcome any ideas!<br />

Thanks,<br />
