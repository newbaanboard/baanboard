<br />
We have to export various tables to CSV in order to transfer to 3rd party systems. I decided for XCH, as this is a very convenient way of extracting data from Baan.<br />
<br />
Now found a strange error and need to get urgently around it (am under time pressure). Therefore any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Problem: When exporting (non-regular) the customer table (tccom010 plus some extra generated fields), the export run stops before writing the first line. I debugged the export script and found that it runs well through all the values and conditions in the main selectdo loop and then stops (BW Message &quot;Connection with server lost&quot;) in function<br />
function extern write.fld.vars.to.line.[batchline].[ASCIIFile](...) <br />
The line producing the error is<br />
line(lpos) = sprintf$(....)<br />
<br />
My Question: Is there any known limit for the line length to be written to an CSV file??<br />
<br />
Any ideas are very welcome, thanks in advance.<br />

I have 239 fields to export. <br />
Splitting the export to 5 batchlines (=&gt; 5 separate CSV output files) solves the issue.<br />
Leads to the assumption that there IS a limit for output line length!<br />
<br />
It is now a stupid piece of work to export 5 files and concatenate them back together after exporting...<br />
<br />
Any known ways to get around this...?</div></div><hr />
