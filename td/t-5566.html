<br />
I using Baan IVc4 with NT 4.0 and SQL Server 7.0. <br />
<br />
When I try to modify report field (Quantity ) of BOM (MultiLevel ) from 4 digit to 6 digit behind comma (because the number is ex: 0.00005 kg), the result is still 0.000000. I try with Maintain Report Field in Print Format and fill with ZZ9VD999999. <br />
<br />
Can someone help me</div></div><hr />

Use tcmcs0101m000 make sure it goes out 6 places for the Unit.  Not sure if the bom reports use itccom0007.qty.domain.round, but I have seen before where one session would let us enter .005, but the report would print 0.  The input session did not use the domain rounding.  <br />
<br />
You can also put the report in debug mode and make sure that .00005 is actually making it to the report.  This would let you know if it is the script or the report.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
I allready set in Maintain Unit for kg rounding is 0.000001 , but the result is just display 0.000000 for 0.000050 (Still 4 place behind comma). <br />
<br />
Any other idea everyone ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">21st June 2002, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I remember vaguely, was it not possible to just add 0.0005 kg and then tell the system that that was for 100 units? Effectively it would yield the same result.<br />
<br />
Another work around is: define an alternative unit grams which is 0.001 kg by conversion factor.<br />
<br />
I would say: telling the system to use an alternative unit when it comes to higher precision is a better idea than changing the (general used) unit kg into a higher precision. Because, what would your customers think when you tend to deliver 14.999954 kg instead of 15.0000 kg (which is the same in terms of the old domain defenition)<br />
<br />
I think 4 digits for kg in general is too much already... think of your use of the unit kg: if you tend to use it for heavy items: better use 2 or less digits in the crnd. If you need better accuracy, better use the alternative units grams or even milligrams.<br />
<br />
What scales do you want to use to weigh the 14.999954 kg anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The scenario for BOM in our company is like this, <br />
BOM is count for  1000 pcs of product. So if we use 1000 sheet paper; 0.5 kg ink; 0.05 kg glue for produce 1000 pieces of product. In Single Level BOM, the report count for 1000 pcs so there are no problem at all. But in Multi-Level BOM, the report count for 1 pcs product, so in 1 pcs we use 1 sheet of paper, 0.0005 kg ink &amp; 0.00005 kg glue. The glue allways display 0.000000 kg instead of 0.00005 kg. <br />
<br />
In Warehouse transaction, the glue is in 5 kg each tin; use for 100,000 pcs of product. So is it wise to change from kg to gram for glue ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">21st June 2002, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I am afraid it is the only way...<br />
5kg tin is 5000 g tin only.</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much,</div></div><hr />
