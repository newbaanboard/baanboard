<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jksandy</div><div class="date">11th July 2008, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We are in a situation where the development company is being refreshed with production data. Refresh is going on for days and will take another week most probably. We have to develop a very high priority customization in the development environment (where company refresh is going on) which involves creating a new field in one of the tables which calls for runtime dd. Will this runtime work while company refresh is going on. We are planning to create this table in another company (other than the one being refreshed) in the same package comb. Will this work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">11th July 2008, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume with &quot;company refresh&quot; you mean, you dumped the company with bdbpost on the life system and you load it with bdbpre on the test. If you use the baan session for this, its the same thing, since they start bdbpost and bdbpre.<br />
<br />
Now, if you simply add a table, then you are fine, because the running bdbpost read it's data dictionary information, when it started and it does not know of the change. Nor does it care, since the new table is not in the dump.<br />
<br />
But if you change an existing table, then you would run into trouble. For this case I would advise to derive a new PKG from the exiting one and customize temporarily there.<br />

P.s: Your profile says, that you use tbase on windows. This can not be the case, since tbase does not exist on windows. But if you use tbase on a Unix platform, then you can simply copy the tbase tables from life to test and avoid the lengthy load.<br />
If you are on another DB platform, then I would advise you, use the platform specifc tools like exp/imp for Oracle for a refresh. This will be around 3-5 times faster.</div></div><hr />
