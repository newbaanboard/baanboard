<br />
Is there a way to send print command from within (DLL) function<br />
or a (sub)sussion that take parameters as in &quot;Data Device&quot;??<br />
the same as I can activate &quot;stpconv&quot; with the appropriate agrument, but in most general way... in a way that I can run an printer device (or direct) from whin 4GL/3GL program??<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can explore these functions -<br />
<br />
long brp.open( string rep_name(16), string device(14), long mode )<br />
<br />
<br />
long spool.open( string reportname(15), string device(14), long mode )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to change the device selected in 4GL program of the report... can I?<br />
i.e. the user selected some device with 3GL/4GL program in this program I can change the spooler of the current report to different device??<br />
<br />
i.e. spool.open(spool.report, &quot;D66&quot;, 1)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - you can change the spool.device to someother device. I have not done this using a DLL, but I have done it 4gl programs.  I do this in one program where the user selects the report and the device.  I then change the device and the report to the one I need to run first - actually I run it to a file first.  Then read this file to generate the report.  I do this by changing the spool.device and brp.open.  Example<br />
spool.device = &quot;ASCIF&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muheeb</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">When I'm talking about changing the device I mean in general for some specific device that uses 3gl/4gl program.<br />
So when the user runs a report for this specific device, the 3gl/4gl program will be executed.... in this program I need get an output of some other device... the question can I run the wanted device in the 4gl/4gl program excuted from some specific device??<br />
<br />
i.e. I won't touch any sessions/reports in baan, but all I need is to write some device with 4gl/3gl program that handle all this.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry bout that.  Lets see if I under stand now: The user runs a session, selects a report and device.  This device then gets some output from another device.<br />
<br />
If I understand correctly you want to write your own version of ttstpconv.  There is an example in the Code and Utilities forum.  It shows were it gets its parameters.  It actually launches a subsession that lets you select what type of output you want.  This should give you an idea of what you can do with device drivers. Is this what you are looking for?<br />
<br />
This maybe an example of what you are looking for. I am sorry if I am still not understanding the exact problem.<br />

<br />
it's not that I want just to write stpconv of my own... I can run stpconv from 3gl/4gl program of a device.<br />
I want to run any device (espiaclly &quot;Direct&quot; to printer drivers)<br />
from whin a device that runs 4gl program.<br />
I need first to run the 4gl program and then the &quot;Direct&quot; printer driver device for the same report... cause as you know we can specify 3gl/4gl program when defining &quot;Direct&quot; or &quot;Printer&quot;<br />
in Device Type.<br />
That's my problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
