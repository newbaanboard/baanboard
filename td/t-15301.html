<br />
I need to change a session (tcedi7502m000).  It's default sort is on tcedi702 index_1.  I need to change the default sort to tcedi702 index_2 descending.  Is it possible to do this without source code?  And without switching the indexes on the table?<br />
<br />
I also need to add a field to a session from tdsls045.  The session is currently only reading tdsls040 and tdsls041.  Is it possible to pull in a field from tdsls045 without source?<br />
<br />
Thank you kindly.  I'll continue to look into this.</div></div><hr />

Depending on the type of session, and on which table fields are being retrieved in the program script, you can just add fields on form level. Go to 'Sessions', for the relevant session, click via specifics on 'forms'. You get the form(s) linked to the session. Go to Edit/Display form, and add the requested field. If this field was selected by the program, then it should be displayed in the session.<br />

Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">12th May 2004, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The index problem has also been discussed before, but the conclusion pretty intrusive, and not recommended unless extreme need.  This is because the Baan index system does not recognize 'DESC' at a database level.  The solution for Baan IV was that you needed to add field and index to the table, somehow trigger the field to be filled as the 'reverse' of the field you want to use as DESC, and use that instead.  Bad bad bad, but possible!<br />
<br />
In Baan V they have a query extension clause that allows you to set the session to use descending, but as of last check that was not part of Baan IV.<br />
<br />
If you need to get a field from a table that is not read in the script you can sometimes do this by playing with the 'Inp. / Ref. Expres.' field in Maintain Form Fields.   You can set that to tell the path to read your related table.  You can check the help it gives an example of reading a related table with just a single field index.  For example, if the main table on your form was 'tdsls000', and you wanted a field from the item master (tiitm001.dsca) that relates to the main table field tdsls000.item1, then you would put on the form the field:<br />
<br />
tiitm001.dsca<br />
<br />
And you would put in the Inp./Ref. Expres:<br />
<br />
tdsls000.item1<br />
<br />
Which means, get me the tiitm001 record that has the main index matching tdsls000.item1.<br />
<br />
In your problem - you have a multi column index, you may need to play with it a bit.  Try {tdsls041.orno, tdsls041.pono, 0} or something like that, not sure what would work for a combined index, if it's possible.  You would need to give it a sequence (I am guessing 0) or you would have a 1 to many relationship that may cause problems.<br />
<br />
If all this fails, or if you find you often need to 'nudge' the standard without having source, you may look into some wrapper utilities.  These allow you to add code to the standard without having the source.  Can't change, just add.  You can check out the 'rush' program on these boards (search for 'rush') for some freeware wrapper utilities, or consider RMCgen (My company) or QKEY (Fullscope) for non-freeware/supported options.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
