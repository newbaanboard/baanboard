<br />
<br />
I am try to modify the exixting report for Invoice. In this report there is multible layout like , 5 before fields , 1 detils , 8 after fields and 1 after report.<br />
In details line I want to give condition that it only print 4 lines per page. if i have 9 records then it should take 3 pages for printing ( 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 record  &amp; 3 pages ) .  details layour of each page will print only 4 lines but rest of the lay out will print based on above 4 lines for rest of the page,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know I have to control through report script but how - any idea<br />
<br />
With Regards<br />

Once you have printed 4 lines, use function page() to get a new page for the next lines.</div></div><hr />

thanks for reply. But it will not work . If u give page() then it will go for new page. Actually I does not want like that.  After pringing 4 line in detail layout it will pring after.field , after.report, footer everything will be print.<br />
<br />
I have to calculate the the record and have to use skip.to command , but dont know how<br />
<br />

It may help - plus there are other threads that include skip.to.  What I am thinking is that after 4 detail lines print you use skip.to(spool.pg.length) - I am not sure if you need to leave enough lines for the after.layout.  So it could be spool.pg.length - x.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for replying mut is is solving the problem . First I am printing header then before field and 4 line for details then after.field, I know i habe to use spool.pg.length - X , but how it works , means after printing 4 line of details i have to skip from details to After.field layout.<br />
<br />
Actually I am unsing the preprinted  stationary for Invoice Printing. That is why i can use limited space for details line . if records more then 4 line then it sould print next page . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I get it now - after printing 4 detail lines you then have to execute the after.field layout, EVEN if there are more detail lines.  Is it possible for you to move the after.field into a footer field?  Then you could use the page() command.  Since I am not familiar with the invoice reports I am not sure what is possible.<br />
<br />
The skip.to just moves to a specified line and would not cause the after.field to be executed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">You could manipulate as follows:<br />
Let's say the after.field is on field item. You define a variable let's say hold.item, you assign every time the value of your current item to it. count the number of detail lines; at the fourth detail line, you change the value of hold.item. Your after.field layout should be on after.field.hold.item so like this you force the report to print the after field section. Of course don't forget to after sending the layout (rprt_send() or brp.ready()), to put the counter back on 0 and change hold.item back to the value of item.<br />
<br />
Hope this is clear, and that it helps you!<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />
