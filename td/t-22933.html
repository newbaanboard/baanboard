<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">21st January 2005, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I need ot create a system to automatically create finance batches/transactions based on a list (ascii-file) with purchase orders. The idea is to clear up old GRNYI's, i.e. all purchase orders from before 2004, which never an invoice was received for, should be cleared from GRNI listings. <br />
<br />
The requirement is to create purchase invoice batches/records based on the list with GRNI - orders, give them an amount 0 (zero), match them to the relevant orders, and create a price difference. When afterwards posting integration transactions, the price differences will be booked, and the orders will disappear from the GRNI lists. We are talking about approximately 7500 purchase orders.<br />
<br />
I assume that the most efficient/easy way to handle this, would be by using Baan's AFS...? My problem however is, that I am handicapped in this field; I have not yet found the time to look in to the AFS api's, and have no idea of how to use them. <br />
<br />
Is there any other efficient/fairly easy way to create this process? Anyone an idea for me?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!!<br />

I really do not know of a better way to do this than thru AFS api's.  Of course I recommend starting on something easier, but sometimes that is just not possible.<br />

If you need the code or logic I can send. But this is customized to my situation. You will still need to figure out this for your own situation.<br />
Also, I know one more product- wise link from Fullscope, it is very simple to use and it can work on any Baan IVc4 and down version. I have used this and after a day or two I find it  quite simple to use. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">24th January 2005, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Marc, thanks for your post.<br />
Arvind, thank you to oo for yours. We are in Baan5.0b (Grieg), so I doubt whether Fullscope will be a solution for us (since you mentioned it works on Baan IVc and lower...?). Also, for us this is more about a one-time operation. We will not be using it continuously; so therefor I have to try to keep it easiest/simplest possible.<br />
<br />
I do think that partually our needs are different than what you do in your program/logic. We have received goods from long ago, yet never received an invoice for it. So what we have to do, is to start from a list (ascii or so) with purchase orders, and create 0 (zero) invoice, match them to the orders with amount 0, and create payment differences on the order-amounts; those will then be booked as intigration transactions.<br />
<br />
If you think your solution can - at least partually - be of help for me, then please do send me the documents.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />

<br />
That is what they said about the one I wrote - we only need once. :)  I did it quick and dirty - hard coded some stuff, etc.  It worked the first time and then the second, third and fourth time - just a few months ago.  It seems we continue to need this - I recommend making it a production session for the user.  I hope your users are better than mine. :)<br />
