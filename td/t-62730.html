<br />
I am using LN6.<br />
Just would like to know where these two fields are kept.<br />
In tssoc2110m000, in the Call page, you will see these two fields<br />
but they are not in tssoc210 table.<br />
Where are they kept?<br />
<br />
When I go to Edit Form in DFE, I see these two fields are variables.<br />
But they must be kept somewhere because when i exit and enter back<br />
a specific order, the values in these two remains the same.<br />
So it must be kept in a table too.<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks n regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the confusion<br />
<br />
The two fields are &quot;Reported Problem&quot; and &quot;Expected Solution&quot;<br />
When we go to DFE and edit the form, we see that these are variables.<br />
They are not table fields.<br />
But they must be saved somewhere because when we re-enter the same order, the values on this two fields remains the same.<br />
<br />
thanks n regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">searocket</div><div class="date">13th August 2012, 11:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I think you are referring to the &quot;Call&quot; fields.<br />
<br />
The design intention for service is that everything starts with creating a service call, then the call can be &quot;transferred&quot; to a service order.<br />
So you should find those fields in tsclm100.<br />
Also bear in mind that calls use tsclm180.<br />
<br />
hope that helps</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
have a look at the attachment !<br />
<br />
The tables are tsclm330 and tsclm335 !<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanspider</div><div class="date">14th August 2012, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi <br />
<br />
The two tables tsclm330 and tsclm335 are the master tables for problems and solutions.<br />
User zooms to the master tables to select the problem and solution.<br />
<br />
My question is where is the values kept for the service order line?<br />
<br />
In the service order lines table tssoc210, there is only two fields there<br />
- actual problem and actual solution.<br />
<br />
But tssoc210 does not have reported problem, expected problem and expected solution.<br />
<br />
Hope you understand better now.<br />
<br />
thanks n regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually we don't using the service in ERP Ln, but I think that fields must be filled based on entries in the clm (Call Management) module.<br />
Please check table tsclm350 - Service resolution and probability analysis<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Juergen</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
the data is stored in table tsclm350 with reference to the origin and order number and activity (Position).<br />
In your reporting, you have to read this table by reference fields.<br />
<br />
See attachment !<br />
