sessions to trespass purchase and sales orders from a<br />
company to another. For which I've read the orders from<br />
the first and wrote the corresponding offers. Now I should<br />
choose one offer field to point which order did it come from.<br />
Reference A and B are currently used so I was wondering if<br />
Length, Width, ... could be appropiate. Note that whatever<br />
the field it must be copied into the new order once it's<br />
generated ( in the new company ). Suggestions ?<br />
