<br />
at a customer system I have a very strange behaviour of the function client2server when the user works with webtop. The file gets transferred to the server, however the function returns -1, indicating an error. <br />
<br />
Same session with same user under worktop works fine.  It's an 8.8 porting set with a 7.6 a8 tools version and a 10.10 Webtop.<br />
<br />
I do find nothing in the Infor knowledgebase. Did anyone else encountered that phenomenom, too? Any ideas what could cause this?<br />
<br />
any input greatly appreciated,<br />
Uli</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are you using client2server() ?<br />
<br />
Try using this piece of code:-<br />
<br />
 exec_dll_function( &quot;ottdllbw&quot; , &quot;server2client&quot; , ret, source_file, destination_path, 0 )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give a try to 'client.upload.file' function.<br />
<br />
This should work in WebUI.</div></div><hr />

We had the identical problem with WebUI 10.5 AP0082, but Infor fixed it in 10.6 BL0074.<br />
<br />
I have just tried, if it is broken again, but it worked fine with 10.11 GU0029.<br />
<br />
What build of 10.10 have you been using?<br />
<br />
Note, it should be unrelated, but the programmers guide list &quot;#include &lt;bic_desktop&gt;&quot; as the include to be used for the client2server() function.  Bhushan's code shows 'ottdllbw', which was the old library, but still seems to work.<br />
<br />
