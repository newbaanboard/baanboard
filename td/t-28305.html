<br />
I'am stuck up with this strange problem. I'am working on LN6.1 SP1 with oracle 9i as the database.<br />
I'am trying to compile a program script and a report script and i'am not able to do that. I get the message that the compilation failed due to some {BSE}/include6.2/bic_tiv file not being opened. I have checked for the file and it doesn't exists at all.<br />
I tried with creating a new session as well and i'am getting the same problem.<br />
<br />
I'am attaching the errors i'am getting during the script compilation and report generation. Please look into this and assist.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

Also check if you have defined $BSE_REM and $BSE variables (you could cd $BSE etc to check if this is working), since that is what Baan is looking for during compilation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This problem is coming with each and every script or report i'am trying to compile.So, its not related to 'bic_tiv' being defined in a particular script.Also, i have check some scripts as well for the same.<br />
<br />
The variables ${BSE} and others also seem to be fine and not couse any issues.<br />
I tried by creating an empty 'bic_tiv' file in include6.2 and then compiled one script. It recongnised that 'bic_tiv' is existing and openable.But again gave the compilation errors as it couln't find anything in the file.<br />
<br />

<br />
I checked out LN system and there is no $BSE/include6.2/bic_tiv<br />
<br />
From LN series, some of the tools includes have been moved to $BSE/tools/tt7.6_a/ittbic/ and there is the file - ibictiv0<br />
<br />
From your screenshot, it appears that the compiler is searching for this file in ${BSE_REM} a remote host. Are you using the MAS (Master Application Server Setup)? If not, this parameter should be empty. Check the BaaN environment variables. <br />
<br />
Also, check in the fd6.2.&lt;package-combination&gt; for any BSE_REM entries and also for the following line:<br />
<br />
itt:${BSE}/tools/tt7.6_a</div></div><hr />
