<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st September 2012, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone resolved this issue before?<br />
<br />
Recently it was shown to me by our user that the output of the session ticst0401m000 (Print Actual Cost of Production Orders) is incorrect.<br />
<br />
On digging a bit into the complaint, I find that the production has multiple distribution lines, and the material costs are therefore multiplied as many times as there are distribution records.<br />
<br />
So, to take a simple example, if a production order has one component of $1, used one per parent, and the production order is for a quantity of 10, with 10 distribution lines, because each end item is for different unit series. Then the report shows material value of $100 instead of the correct value of $10.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st September 2012, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like it works on our system.  I found one where we ordered a qty of 10 and 2 each for each peg. Per piece price was 29.5 and total for the production order is 295.<br />
<br />
Does the display cost session work or is it the table is wrong? Sounds like it is multiplying the order qty for each peg rather that the peg order quantity.  Not sure what type ideas you are looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st September 2012, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The ticst001 table itself is updated with the inflated cost price - both estimated and actual are updated incorrectly.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the display session is also showing the same (bad) numbers.<br />
<br />
I will keep digging why.</div></div><hr />
