<br />
We are on ERP LN6.1 on windows server and database is SQL. <br />
<br />
I have a field on client and I masked it with inputfiled.password. I Want the same field to be masked(******) even at GTM level. If any one logs in to GTM they should be able to see the field as*******. And when authorized person logs in client level, system should let him to enter value by comparing user input and table value.<br />
<br />
I saw threads using crypt.password$(), but looks like its not available in LN 6.1. <br />
<br />
Can anyone help me with this.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

What makes you believe it is not available in LN 6.1? <br />
<br />
Refer to the posting - Encrypt/decrypt Password (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=26592&amp;highlight=password)<br />
<br />
I found it is being used in the source code of bc, dm and tg scripts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the user will be promted for pwd1 next time, when he enters the value, how can u validate both the values?<br />
<br />
crypt.password$ will crypt the password and when user enter pwd1, it would be a string? How can you compare these two values ?<br />
<br />
I tried to crypt.password pwd1 upon user entry, is.password.ok() is not validating both and returning false.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When user print a report next time, he will be poped up for password, there he has to enter the password that was saved. <br />
<br />
I didn't see any help/function to encrypt the password, so when I call is.password.ok() , its always false.<br />
because table filed has crypted value and user will enter normal password- so its returning false<br />
even when I crypt user password and compare with table value - its false again as bothe the crypted strings are not equal.<br />
can anyone have any idea</div></div><hr />

You have to implement with Role based security for the Session than using password way.<br />
The example program is simple and obvious. You have to check your code and re-evaluate your requirement and implementation approach.</div></div><hr />
