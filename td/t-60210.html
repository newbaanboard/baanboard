<br />
As many of you, we too find ourselves with an increasing need for generating xml files from BaaN. More and more interfaces will expect an xml file. <br />
<br />
As far as I am aware, in Baan you can only use the xml....() functions to programmatically and hard coded write the output from the Baan tables to xml files. This has 2 major disadvantages: <br />
1) Any requirement for any xml file needs to be fully programmed by a developer. Furthermore, any small change/addition to an existing xml file, needs to be adjusted in the program script. Again by a developer.<br />
2) Each xml file requires a lot of work = time = money.<br />
<br />
It is therefore that I would like to get to a generic solution for defining xml file tags and layouts from within BaaN. <br />
<br />
My conceptual idea in a nutshell:<br />
1) Set up some new tables + input sessions in which each tag, with their name, attribute, field value, etc will be defined. <br />
2) Possibly even adding tables to define the main tables per xml, with their selection fields (ranges). Alternatively this can be left out and per xml a small session has to be written with the main table, selection and data retrieval queries.<br />
3) Have one generic dll which generates an xml file (with the standard Baan xml...() functions variably, based on its definition in the tables mentioned in step 1).<br />
<br />
As I am sure that many of you face the same challenges, I'm throwing this into the board. My main questions:<br />
<br />
1) Does any of you know of existing, proper solutions for this?<br />
2) Has any of you developed a similar solution in the past? No need to invent the same thing twice...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your input!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
I am actually surprised that nobody gave me any input; I assume that many companies need to create XML files with data from within BaaN. I would like to hear from others how they handle this.<br />
<br />
Thanks again in advance!</div></div><hr />
