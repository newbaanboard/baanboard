Quicky here.<br />
<br />
We have a report for sales invoices.<br />
<br />
This report used to have seperator lines between layouts.<br />
<br />
Now they are gone.<br />
<br />
How do I find out why they have gone?<br />
<br />
I have put these lines back in by drawing them in, in the editor, but I thought that there was a way to insert a seperator line without having to use the editor.<br />
<br />
Is it in the output expression?<br />
<br />
This would be very handy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

Probably you can get some more information by checking the unix permissions/owner ship of the report itself.<br />
<br />
You should be able to restore the latest one back from your backup, the problem you will have then is that it is not the same as the one defined in your dictionary.<br />
<br />
If you have to change the report I can only recommend to attend a training. At least copy the current report before changing it in order to be able to get the latest back.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
thank u 4 ur input.<br />
<br />
what i am trying to determine is why these disappeared in the first place.<br />
<br />
if we can determine this then I will be able to stop it from happening again.<br />
<br />
also what i ahave done is drawn the lines in the report myself.<br />
<br />
in the future is there a way that i can add these seperator lines without having to go into the editor?<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />

To prevent this you could modify the unix permissions but that won't prevent modifying the reports so restricting the rights to the tools tables and/or tools menu is also necessary.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">18th December 2001, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">From within Baan make sure that only your developpers have  developper authorizations BUT take the All developper authorizations from all of them and implement dev. auth. per package and pVRC - it's more work but avoids a lot o trouble: this should be even mandatory on the live systems!<br />
<br />
Also, to speed restores and avoid data dictionary incompatible with runtime, you could use your job user for company 000 to dump your customizations on a regular basis. If anything happens, you just import them!<br />
<br />
Also, if you want to restrict even more, own yourself the bsp login and change the permissions of the reports to readable only for the group bsp and read/write to bsp only.<br />
<br />
Just remembered something, you are doing the development and themn copy the tested reports to the live pVRC, all as higher layers than the update?</div></div><hr />
