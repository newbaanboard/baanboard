Is there some way to identify and recover some missing records from this table? I tried comparing with financial integration transactions, but I think I may be on the wrong track.</div></div><hr />

Just curious.  Some transactions write directly to the PCL tpppc215 - I do not know what those are.  Next if they were tcl transaction I thought the users just recreate them manually?  I am not an expert on these tables.<br />
<br />
Are these tables used by any extensions besides A&amp;D?</div></div><hr />
