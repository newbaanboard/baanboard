I am facing an issue in which if date and time domain is used for an input date,time gets defaulted as 23:59 in webui/html ui whereas time gets defaulted 00:00 in LN worktop.The issue is when user enters maximum date i.e 19-01-2038 it defaults 23:59 in Web/LN ui due to which it does not allow to save the date as it exceeds the maximum date and time i.e 19-01-2038 08:44:07.I have tried converting the time in Ui script but control does not go through the field section as it pops the error on input of date itself.<br />
Please note time field is hidden in the session due to which user is not able to input time.<br />
Please suggest on the same</div></div><hr />

Please suggest on the same :eek: Sounds like a severe one! Log an Incident (meanwhile you could try to set a default value on the formfield.time segment as 0:00)</div></div><hr />
