Hello,<br />
<br />
BaaN / Infor DEV language is called 4GL.<br />
The &quot;scripting&quot; has to be done with the BaaN Tools.<br />
As external editor something like Notepad++, Ultraedit a.s.o. can be used.<br />
<br />
For developing your own Sessions/Programs, you must own a DEVELOPMENT-License.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd July 2012, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - what I do is log into baan using the windows client.  Then drill down into the menu - tools/application development/sessions.  I start maintain sessions. Then go to form 2 and hit the scripts button.  Then I can edit or change the script.  Then compile it or compile it in debug mode.<br />
<br />
ALso you must have developers access(and VRC access) and understand the VRC's.  Don't you have a coworker that can walk you through all of this?  It is not as easy or intuitive as one would think.  You can look at the help attached to the board but it is for LN.  You can go to infor and download some of the guides they have available.  Training would really be best.</div></div><hr />
