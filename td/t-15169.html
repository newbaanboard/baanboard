<br />
I added a new form tab on the Buy from buss partner session. I added 6 new table fields to this new from tab called &quot;Misc.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would like to put all these 6 fields in a Group Box called &quot;SBA Details&quot;. <br />
<br />
When I go to the properties of the SBA Details and check that 'show group box', it shows it to me in the preview details. But when I compile the form and run the session, it does not show it to me on the form.<br />
What am i doing wrong here. Please find attached the screen shots.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

I have seen that happen. But this is Baan V stuff and I do not have a clue about that version.<br />

I've logged a case with Baan (i know its silly... but)... lets see what they come up with :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">3rd May 2004, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe they can help, maybe a bug of some sort, something slightly different in what you have done.  I have used the groups and grp boxes without issue before.<br />
<br />
Just noticing though, that on your preview the group is on the same page as the Terms of Delivery and other fields, and when you run that session they are on a different form.   That seems like more than just not seeing the group box change you made.  I am wondering, as Mark said, if you are not seeing your changes.   Seeing them in preview does not meet that they are compiled and in the correct VRC for you to see when running for real.  Did you try just making a label change or something, dumping, and then seeing if you can see that change?   Just trying to figure out why the preview is so different from your run.<br />
<br />
Nothing is too silly for us!!</div></div><hr />
