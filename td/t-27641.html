<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a display session with several forms, displaying (item) data from several tables. First few forms are type 1 (single-occ). Now I added a multi-occ form (type 3) to display the bom of the item (table tibom010). <br />
<br />
When activating the session, I get fatal error &quot;Index 0 out of dims [2] 210&quot; and &quot;can not continue etc...&quot;<br />
<br />
When I set the nr. of occurences for this form to 1, the session starts fine, but only the last record is displayed on the screen..<br />
<br />
How to get this working?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think that your requirement is feasible, i'll check it out in detail tomorrow.<br />
However as a quick alternative why dont you call a multioccurence session for BOM thro zoom.to$() as soon as the 3 form is activated.<br />
<br />
The called multioccurence session can be programmed to display the records for current item only thro query.extension.<br />
<br />
I dont think this is the best solution as it will call a different session, but who knows your users might like it :)<br />

<br />
I've a better solution, generate your display session as (multiocc+view+main) form type 3 session based on main table of BOM. You can then use the other forms as single occurence forms. However this approach will make it mandatory for the item to have its BOM maintained.<br />
<br />
Let us know your findings<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">20th July 2006, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Bigjack for your suggestions, however:<br />
1) Indeed I want to avoid having a new screen popping up. I wanted to have the data displayed on a seperate form (tab), within the same session.<br />
2) a: a session is not defined with form-type. A session only has definition of session type and window type, where session type is display in this case, and window type can be list window (multi-occ) or modal with menu etc. Even when I changed session type (from modeless window with menu) to list window, the result is the same.<br />
    b: Only the items with BOM (i.e. with record in tibom010) is indeed not enough. I have to display all items from general item data (tcibd001) and relevant info for exists from other tables. But anyway I don't think this point is the issue....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th July 2006, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">En - I do not know about Baan 5, but I thought you could actually do a subsession that would look like it was form 3, but could really be a different session all together.  I know somewhere on my system there is at least one session where you click on the form it activates another session, but still looks like it is form 3.  Wouldn't that be sufficient?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">24th July 2006, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, sorry for late response, I've been away. What do you mean with &quot;where you click on the form it activates another session, but still looks like it is form 3. &quot; ? You mean that the new session would be opened/activated as a tab on main (parent) session? That for sure would be sufficient, but I wouldn't know how this could possibly be done. If you mean that a new screen (form) pops up for the new session, then - as already explained - this will not be sufficient. To the user it has to be just another tab (=form) in the open session.<br />
<br />
I somehow have the feeling though that this must be doable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th July 2006, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been looking for the session.  I believe in the init.form section it did an activate on the sub-session.  It worked kind of like Maintain Production Orders(tisfc0101m000).  You know how the multi-occurrence display session at the top and the single occurrence maintain session at the bottom.  Only in this case it was just a multi-occurrence session.  The only thing I remember is activate - not sure how they handled killing the sub-process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">25th July 2006, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi En,<br />
<br />
I simply couldnt resist from doing some R&amp;D on your requirement.<br />
By using Mark's idea i propos following solution,<br />
<br />
Ive created two sessions, One is order header (single occurence) and other <br />
for order lines(multi occurence).<br />
<br />
The single occurence consists of 4 forms wherein the fourth form is a dummy form(no relevant data)<br />
<br />
I've coded following code in the script of single occurence session,<br />
<br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
init.form:<br />
	max_window() | Maximise the working session window to full screen<br />
	<br />
form.4:<br />
before.form:<br />
	chld.proc = wait.and.activate(&quot;multioccurence session code goes here&quot;)<br />
	to.form(form.prev) | To return to previously viewed form<br />
<br />
functions:<br />
<br />
function max_window()<br />
{<br />
	long My.Win<br />
<br />
	My.Win = current.mwindow()<br />
	change.object(My.Win,DsNheight,800,DsNwidth,1000,DsNx,0,DsNy,0)<br />
	update.object(My.Win)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Explanation:<br />
<br />
Im forcefully making both sessions to open in maximized mode, this is done so that whenever the multioccurence session is called the transition between two sessions is smooth.<br />
<br />
As i said before &quot;form 4&quot; is dummy form and is used to activate multioccurence session.<br />
The funcion to.form() will help user comtinue with the earlier form after the multioccurence session is closed.<br />
<br />
Similarly in the multioccurence session i've created a dummy form to facilitate exit to single occurence seesion tabbing to next form. Ive written following piece of code in script of multioccurence session,<br />
<br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
init.form:<br />
	max_window()<br />
	<br />
form.2:<br />
before.form:<br />
	exit() |End the multi occurence session as soon as form 2 is activated. No need to press &quot;save &amp; exit&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This solution may look complex but it works fine. As far as user point of view , he just has to press the tab keys(as was your requirement) to browse thro two different sessions.<br />
<br />
I request you to try this solution once(inspite of two sessions being used) and let me know about your feedback.<br />
<br />
we will discuss further improvements after you find this method OK.<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">25th July 2006, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Mark &amp; Bigjack,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestions. I originally wanted to refrain from such kinds of workarounds, but ok, will do it this way then.<br />
<br />
BigJack, I will do more or less what you suggested. I will probably make a few beauty-changes, especially as for the maximize_window function and the forms of the second session, so that users will really not have a clue that they switched to another session, unless they go look at the bottom of their screen at the toolbar..<br />
<br />
Will have a look at it soon, and let you know the result..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">25th July 2006, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have created this logic, and it works quite ok. I have created the same amount of forms in the activated session as in the main session, and named the forms the same in bith sessions, so that you don't see a difference in that. Even the session name and description are equal (via program script). In the activated sub-session in the init.form of form.1 I force it to form 3 which is the relevant form. All other forms have exit() in their before.form section. Also important: in the choice.abort.program before.choice I also added an exit(). This all works fine.<br />
<br />
I only have to still add the import and export of the data so that the data will be displayed to the correct form and the correct item. No time to elaborate now, got to run to a meeting...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been working on something like this - upto 5 forms(soon to be seven) and maintables.  The question I have is in each of the programs I have a routine which is named the samething in each program, but it does something a little different with each main table.  Now I have a series of events that need to be the same in all 5 programs(like after.next.set or after.next.view).  So I want a place I only maintain it once for all programs - includes files and DLL's do not work.  Is there something else that I can use to move code from one common place?  Something easier than cutting and pasting it in each program - only one spot to maintain it.  See below - I use this to help keep each program in sync with the item number.  Drawing a blank on how I might do this.<br />
<br />
 choice.def.find:<br />
 after.choice:<br />
 	get.next.item()<br />
 <br />
 choice.first.set:<br />
 after.choice:<br />
 	get.next.item()<br />

 choice.next.set:<br />
 after.choice:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Would it work to use the '#pragma used session session code' ? Declare your function as external in one of the sessions, then use the #pragma used session to include that session in the other codes, making the external function callable...?  Have not tried, but makes sense to me..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me try that with the after.choice.def.find section.  I tried declaring functions for the event in a include file and in a DLL - but would not work. DLL was replaced with the local program event.  The include file just skipped the function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">What does the proper format look like?<br />
<br />
I have declared an external function in one program like this:<br />
<br />
function extern	after.choice.def.find()<br />
{<br />
	get.next.item()<br />
}<br />
<br />
Not matter what I use in the pragma used statement it tells me the get.next.item is not used.  For example I trie #pragma used session tifix0101m000 looking for after.choice.def.find().  The new tifix program compiles but with out the after.choice.def.find section.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">8th January 2007, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello - I was wondering if I would be able to something similar to what's being discussed here only I need to add another form to the Maintain Customized Item session for which I do not have the code.  I would like this new form to be multi-occ and the main table be a new table I created.<br />
<br />
Is this possible?  I was going to zoom to a new session where the user could maintain my new table but the field on the Customized Item session would have to have autozoom and I'm not going to always want to zoom to this new session.<br />
<br />
Any info would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th January 2007, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what I typically use Qkey for - additional table fields linked to a main table in standard Baan session.  In your case I think you can do the same thing using references on the new table.  Don't forget you need to CRDD for both the new table and the customized item table.  Then I believe you can just add a new form with the new table fields.  I am not exactly positive about this since I have never done this.  <br />
<br />
Of course if you do not mind you could always add new fields to the customized item table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">9th January 2007, 21:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply Mark.  I was going to go the way of having my new table referencing the Customized Items table.  When I decided to try it, I went to the item field on my new table and put tipcs021 in the reference table field and I get an error that the primary key field on table tipcs021 must be tcitem.  I see the primary key on tipcs021 is cprj and item which is then cmba.  Do I need to add cprj to my table in order to make this work somehow?  I don't really need cprj in my table for any reason.  Thanks.<br />
