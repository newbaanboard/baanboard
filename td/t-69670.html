Did not find anything in the dev. guide. Basically the solution should work in LNUI and Becs<br />
<br />
I have tried following thing .<br />
<br />
1) created  check boxes and made them to behave like radio boxes .  Its working in LNUI  but in BECS  when i click ok button the function under DLG_FIELD_CHECK is being excuted in sequentially and ending up as last option being checked ( used functions under DLG_FIELD_CHECK  to set the current check box and clear rest) . its like checking all field on save and exit.( if there any predefined or global variable that can change this behavior ?)<br />
<br />
2) tried creating my on object using create.object --&gt; works only in BECS<br />
<br />
3) tried adding my own button ... and in its function i have set a variable and tried sending a save.and.exist even  --&gt; work in BECS  -- &gt;  throw a error in LNUI<br />
<br />
I am thinking if i can know the standard event array , i can skip checking functions on save and exist.  but could not succeed.<br />
<br />
Lastly the only solution left is to store the  .. when the 1st DLG_FIELD_CHECK is executed on ok ( save and exit) if not LNUI .... ( this seriously doesnt look like decent logic)<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest something ( i know drop down is possible that my last resort )</div></div><hr />
