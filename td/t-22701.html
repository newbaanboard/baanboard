     I am completly new to BaaN, can any one explain what is meant by VRC in detail.</div></div><hr />

C, as far as my knowledge is concerned, BaaN is made up of layers of Versions i.e. BaaN std, BaaN Localization and Co. specific. <br />
To sagrigate this std. in our Co. we have defined 6 package Combinations to maintain such things<br />
B40Sc4  - BaaN Std.<br />
B40USc4 - BaaN Std. Updates<br />
B40lc4  - BaaN Std. Localisation.<br />
B40luc4 - BaaN Std. Localisation Update.<br />
B40Ec4  - BaaN Std. Live VRC<br />
B40Ec4  - BaaN Std. Test VRC<br />
<br />
I think,this is the backbone of BaaN software and even major advantage to use such inheritance property of VRCs while &amp; after loading a new patch from BaaN.<br />
<br />
Hope you will underastand this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">27th December 2004, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
short question, good question ... lets see what I can do to make that clear to you.<br />
<br />
Ok, first thing to know is that there are different SW-'packages' in Baan ... lets pick one .. tf for finance as an example. In this package you will find programs, menus, reports AND tables, all their names beginning with 'tf'.....<br />
Another package is ti..... loads of stuff (again programs, menues AND tables)concerning items, beginning with 'ti'. <br />
Next thing to understand is the derivation structure. Lets assume there are 2000 objects delivered by Baan in the package tf (just a number, ok?). This version of the package may be called tf B40S ... (S .. like standard). All the related objects of this version will physically be found in one folder (and its subfolders).<br />
Now, no SW is free of errors, so soon Baan will deliver corrected/enhanced versions of some of these objects .... into a next version (=derivation) of the package .... this version will usually be called B40U (U .. update) and again is a folder where objects belonging to the package tf will be put. But (this is why it is called a derivation) ... this version may only contain some of the above mentioned 2000 objects.<br />
Perhaps you are going to build programs too .... so you would create an next derivation B40C (C .. customer) ... again a folder which will contain your objects, which are different from B40C / B40U ....<br />
What basically happens if you will call a program in Baan in the packet tf ... first your folder will be searched, then the one with the updates and last the original one ... first match wins, so the right object will be taken.<br />
With the above scenario, you could choose whether your individual objects will be ignored (VRC=B40S/B40U) or shall be active (VRC=B40S/B40U/B40C). There are different releases available for the package tf now. This applies to each and everey packet in Baan.<br />
So, to come to an end .... if you create a package VRC, you simply choose one of the available releases for every packet .... thus describing which objects (VERY IMPORTANT HERE: this includes the description of the tables!!!) will be taken.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped <br />

<br />
VRC stands for Version Release Customization. It is basically a directory tree that allows you to maintain different versions of the same object (program, form, session, report). It's inventor, whose name won't come to me, left Baan over a religious dispute and started the company Profuse.<br />
<br />
Packages are linked to nodes on the VRC tree (hence the term package VRC). Companies are also linked to different nodes. Therefore, users in a low-level company may not have access to high-level objects. This makes the VRC structure an ideal tool to have testing, development and production all on the same server which was practically undoable before VRC.</div></div><hr />
