<br />
We have a session where the user can enter an order number, a quantity, click a &quot;process&quot; button and it books production. After the process has run we want the reset the form fields and move the cursor back to the order number field, ready for them to enter a new number.<br />
<br />
The only way I have found to move the cursor back to the order number field is by using to.field() and it works however, when the user types in the order number and presses tab, the actions in the when.field.changes and check.input sections are not executed which causes the rest of the process to fail.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a clue as to why this is happening. I have tried execute(modify.set) instead but this doesn't resposition the cursor to the order number field.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

Try :-<br />
<br />
field.field_name:<br />
<br />
after.input:<br />
<br />
|....your code here.....<br />
<br />
As per the Prog Guide:-<br />
<br />
 In this subsection, you can use the to.field() function if the sequence deviates from the default. <br />
<br />
Also, in LN Tools , if you have a DAL for a tablefield, then the UI check.input section is skipped.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind, to.field is not supported in Webtop.</div></div><hr />

Are you using input.again() inside the section?<br />

<br />
There are other sections too which can be used:-<br />
<br />
before.checks, after.input, on.input,check.input,when.field.changes.<br />
<br />
The sequence goes like this:-<br />
<br />
before.checks -&gt; check.input - &gt; on.input -&gt; when.field.changes - &gt; after.input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">13th January 2014, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Try moving your code from check.input: to after.input: section if it works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
All of the current sections work fine when the user opens the session and inputs the first production order number, if they then execute the function prnt.label then I need the system to move the cursor back to the pdno field and re-execute all of the sections for the field &quot;pdno&quot;. Unfortunately, it executes none of them. This leads me to believe that using the to.field is not the correct way to go but I have tried modify.set and add.set but this doesn't work either. I was hoping that somebody out there could give me the correct way to do this. <br />
<br />
I wish I could think of another LN session which has similar behaviour, then I could take a look at the script and copy it.<br />

<br />
As per the Prog Guide:-<br />
<br />
In a well-designed GUI, users (and not the application) select and initiate the actions to be performed. Using to.field() removes control from the user. Therefore it does not conform to good GUI design principles.<br />
<br />
And yes, do check if you have solution #1464790 installed. It's related to to.field() function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">13th January 2014, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I just checked it on one of my forms and it works fine. Try commenting these 2 lines from your before.input: section.<br />
<br />
display.all()<br />
	execute(first.set)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">13th January 2014, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the pointer towards that solution. That will surely be worth a try. I'll see if commenting out the lines helps too. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">13th January 2014, 23:26</div></div><div class="posttext">pdno = &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I am curious why you do not get any compilation error message for setting pdno to &quot;&quot;, since pdno is a numeric domain field. Let us say that you have defined pdno in the program as character, then the select from tisfc001 should give an error.<br />
<br />
Having said that, in order for a when.field.changes to trigger, the field should be 'seen' to have changed by the standard program. What you could try is to set it to a value of a non-existent production order number (say 99999999), so that when the user enters the next value, the field has really changed.<br />
<br />
I do not remember now exactly if it was related to the to-field() function, but it is possible that the display statements are interferring somehow with the under-the-hood working. So, [similar to what  bhushanchanda  recommended] maybe try commenting those out first to see if it helps - although this is not a very strong solution, because it is possible for a display statement to be added back in a future modification.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In LN, its a string.</div></div><hr />
