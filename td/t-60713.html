<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hmbmeister</div><div class="date">16th June 2011, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We ran into an issue where users were adding and deleting items from Items General.  We had auditing turned on but had to be able to find a specific item on a specific day and be able to answer who added or deleted it.  So, we made a customization to insert the item, date, time, and user ID into a custom table everytime an item was changed.  It worked great.  If you are interested in this customization, please let me know.</div></div><hr />
