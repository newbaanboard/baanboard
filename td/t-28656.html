Is there a way to generate report layouts from the report object?  We have a report that was exported from our test server to our production server with only the report object.  The report works fine, but the layouts are not present.  We now need to make changes to the layouts and there is nothing there.  We have also refreshed our test server with the production data so the original layout has been lost.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

You can get any report script that way, but I think you will have to rebuild the report.</div></div><hr />
