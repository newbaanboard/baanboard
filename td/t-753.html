You can order a Streamserve Demo cd from www.streamserve.com.  I warn you, their stuff is not easy to set up - there is usually a consultant to go along with the setup and initial training.   But, it's rich in functionallity and you can do all sorts of things with the baan reports, not just email.  It allows you to reformat the entire report.   For email, it will take a set of reports and email some based on an email address, or fax other, etc.  (Additional Fax software is needed...)  You can have different report formats based on where your sending (one for email, one for faxed copies...) This all works by the user choosing the &quot;Streamserve&quot; device to print to, and inputting the correct email and fax numbers on the Customer files.  Optio has a similar product that also interfaces to Baan.   <br />
<br />
For a simple (less expensive :p) email only solution, you may consider B2Email as Ehab suggests, but I have never used that product.  That may use the mailx command during it's processing - what do you have against that command?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">A VERY inexpensive way, if you running on a Unix server, would be to set up a device to write to an ASCII file and execute a Unix script. The script would take the ASCII file and using the Unix mailx command, send the report as an attachment. You could supply the e-mail address as part of the file name.  <br />
Options are limited here, but at least you are not having to setup or support another third party vendor's software.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For my customer, I used it quite successfully, until it was required to replace it with the 'sendmail' command, which was also equally successful.  The email would go to a network based on MS Exchange or Outlook. So the UNIX Admin had to set up mail address aliasing in UNIX for sendmail to redirect (actually, forward) delivery failures to the MS Exchange eMail ID (or Outlook eMail ID), instead of sending it to the  UNIX email ID of the User.<br />
<br />
(To complete the picture: in all the cases where my customer requested emailing facility, there was a program script modification involved.)</div></div><hr />
