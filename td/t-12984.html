<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">15th September 2003, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two display sessions:<br />
<br />
1) main session, multi-occurrence, main table a.<br />
2) subsession, also MULTI-OCC, main table b with index containing same fields as index of table a.<br />
Table b is a detailed version of table a.<br />
<br />
I want to enter the subsession via double-clicking the main session. How do I do this? Is this possible with child synchronisation or is that only possible for single-occurrence child? If it should be done via form command: how can I assign this command to a double click? Is there a standard command choice assigned to double-clicking a record in multi-occ? <br />
<br />
Please give me an actual example of the settings for both sessions (start command, type etc) and what should be programmed in the parent session and what in the child session so that the data will be displayed correctly and fast in the child session.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance!<br />

Pretty sure you cannot use synchronization if you have 2 different main tables.   The synchronization is on the toolbar / db.calls - so, choosing insert on the Parent causes the child to go into insert mode.  I don't think that would work well if they are not the same main table (but feel free to try &amp; post back the results :)<br />
<br />
So, that brings us back to your double clicking - if they are synchronized, this happens automatically.  In Baan IV, the default button activates if you double click, but I have not tried specifically in Baan V.  Try setting that in Baan V, set the Default Button on the Form to call your exec.cont.process section, and write a zoom.to$ in that function.  <br />
<br />
First, make sure you have a Form Command button set up on your form for exec.cont.process.  Then,<br />
<br />
&gt;Maintain Forms:  <br />
&gt;Default Button:<br />
   Command Type:  Form Command<br />
   Default Button:  exec.cont.process<br />
<br />
<br />
In the program script of the parent, try:<br />
<br />
<br />
function extern exec.cont.process()<br />
{<br />
     zoom.to$(&quot;your.child.session&quot;, &quot;z.session&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;return.field.if.needed&quot;, &quot;&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />

This  looks similar to your other posting -<br />

child synchronization  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12967) <br />
<br />
Is it the same issue? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">15th September 2003, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">a ha, already answered!  I read the help on that synchronize.with.child() does seem exactly for that - synchronizing different main table sessions.   So..I agree with Rao - did you try that first?  That help he gave leads to a nice sample program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">15th September 2003, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry guys, yes indeed, i had posted the previous message just before leaving for the weekend. Guess I have cleaned my mind from work extremely well over the weekend... :cool: <br />
<br />
I just started playing around with it, but so far I don't get much 'synchronization' done. I tried with the child synchronization as described in the manual. But it doesn't really seem to be working for me. I just didn't get my data. Maybe because a) there is no reference from the index field in table a to table b (parent/child main tables) and b) all the index fields present in main table a of parent are indeed present also in main table b - child - , however table b has more fields in its index in addition.<br />
[i.e. parent, main table a, contains 5 index fields - child, main table b, contains all 5 of table a, plus another 3]. I don't know if this stops it from working, but somehow I didn't get in running. <br />
<br />
So far what i just did, is still using the child synchronization from parent, as follows:<br />
<br />
function extern synch.details()<br />
{<br />
	if synch.id then<br />
		synchronize.with.child(synch.id)<br />
	endif<br />
	if not synch.id then<br />
		synch.id = start.synchronized.child ( &quot;tdrom9505se00&quot;, <br />
		&quot;form.curr&quot;, &quot;from.form&quot;,<br />
		&quot;rel.field.f&quot;, &quot;rel.field.f&quot;,<br />
		&quot;rel.field.t&quot;, &quot;rel.field.t&quot;,<br />
		&quot;tdrom991.year.c&quot;, &quot;imp.year&quot;,<br />
		&quot;incl.free&quot;, &quot;incl.free&quot;,<br />
		&quot;incl.cost&quot;, &quot;incl.cost&quot;,<br />
		&quot;perd.f&quot;, &quot;perd.f&quot;,<br />
		&quot;perd.t&quot;, &quot;perd.t&quot;)<br />
	endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
In the child session I use more a regular import model, like this:<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
.......<br />
	import(&quot;form.curr&quot;, from.form)<br />
	import(&quot;rel.field.f&quot;, rel.field.f)<br />
	import(&quot;rel.field.t&quot;, rel.field.t)<br />
	import(&quot;tdrom991.year.c&quot;, imp.year)<br />
	import(&quot;incl.free&quot;, incl.free)<br />
	import(&quot;incl.cost&quot;, incl.cost)<br />
	import(&quot;perd.f&quot;, perd.f)<br />
	import(&quot;perd.t&quot;, perd.t)<br />
<br />
	query.extend.where(&quot; tdrom901._index1 inrange {:from.form, :rel.field.f,&quot; &amp;<br />
			&quot; :imp.ncmp.f, :imp.itbp.f, :imp.creg.f, :imp.cbrn.f, :imp.cofc.f,&quot; &amp;<br />
			&quot; :imp.year, :perd.f} and&quot; &amp;<br />
			&quot; {:from.form, :rel.field.t, :imp.ncmp.t, :imp.itbp.t, :imp.creg.t,&quot; &amp;<br />
			&quot; :imp.cbrn.t, :imp.cofc.t, :imp.year, :perd.t} and&quot; &amp;<br />
			&quot; (:tdrom901.free.c = tcyesno.no or :incl.free = tcyesno.yes) and&quot; &amp;<br />
			&quot; ((tdrom901.kitm.c = tckitm.purchase or tdrom901.kitm.c = tckitm.manufacture)&quot; &amp;<br />
	   		&quot; or :incl.cost = tcyesno.yes) &quot; )<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, this does seem to do the job, however, I don't think this is the regular flow of synchronizing?? Is import still meant to be done in the child? Isn't everything supposed to be 'synchronized' automatically? <br />
<br />
Would appreciate any advice/opinions.<br />
<br />
<br />
