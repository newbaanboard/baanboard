<br />
I have never worked on BDE, however can try to explain it to you.<br />
<br />
To expose the business data from SSA enterprise application servers to the<br />
outside world in a uniform and consistent way, SSA Global introduced a software architecture called SSA Uniform Connectivity. Business Data Entities (BDEs) are the cornerstones of this architecture. BDEs are business object<br />
representations that abstract the business data away from the application's<br />
modules and data models and that completely encapsulate the physical<br />
implementation in the business application. BDEs are consistent across all the<br />
SSA Global applications, which means they show the same appearance and the same behavior everywhere, irrespective of the underlying application. BDEs are used to integrate an SSA enterprise application with other applications. Ideally, changes in the application will not affect the integrations through the BDEs, because the BDEs are completely uncoupled from the application.<br />
<br />
You can use it for migration, if all required DD is been BDE compliant.<br />
