<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DavidDevelopor</div><div class="date">8th December 2010, 23:48</div></div><div class="posttext">In the past, all the programming I needed to do did not require any source code for my Baan 4 environment.   <br />
<br />
Now I need to make a number of changes to some existing forms and programs which require source code which I don’t own.  <br />
<br />
I contacted my sales person and he told me that I needed to hire Infor and they will send it to their Center for Excellence and can have it done in a few months.  I can’t wait that long and need something done ASAP.  <br />
<br />
Are there any alternatives?  My sales person tells me that there are no other options and want to confirm.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">9th December 2010, 10:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor sells source code licenses. The thing is, they only sell it, if they loose or do no not win a contract otherwise.<br />
<br />
Really, I do not understand how one can buy an ERP system without negotiating sourcecode. Now, since Infor can gain nothing from providing you with a sourcecode license, your options are limited:<br />
<br />
1) Do not do the development you are requested to do. Tell your boss: Sorry, folks, you bought a standard software, use excel for whatever the request is. In my point of view, from an IT strategy, that's the best option<br />
2) Let Infor do the programming, wait a couple of month till they're done, and then wait another couple of months til they removed the bugs that so called &quot;center of excellence&quot; put into the software they delivered.<br />
3) Find an Infor partner that has a source code license and can do the programming. It might be faster then doing it via Infor.<br />
 <br />
Options 2 and 3 are likely to put you *completely* out of maintainance eventually (depends on the functional area of the modified sources), since installing solutions might break the modified sources without you having a chance to fix it within reasonable time (since you have to go to Infor/Infor partner and let them modify their code. Which is hard for them to do, since they need to have the same patch level on their development system, which they do not have normally). Since solutions are dependend on each other, this might stop you from the ability of installing *any* solution.<br />
<br />
Option 4) Migrate to some other software. If it's Infor ERP LN or any other software, BUY THE DAMN SOURCE CODE! If they don't sell it, go to another vendor who does. Never ever again use an ERP system (which controls the most critical workflows in your enterprise) without *you* having the final control on it's algorithms. <br />

<br />
See ~vamsi's extend source code option in the Code and Utilities section.  It may not solve the problem since I do not know what changes need to be made.  RMCis has an identical type tool - I use qkey which used to be supported by fullscope, I do not think they support or sell it anymore.<br />
<br />
While this technique does not truly replace having the source code it does allow you to remain under maintenance.  Since this code wraps around the source object you can remove your code and test the standard baan option and get support from them.  The other issue is that you can replace like 1 line of code in a function - you have to write the whole routine.<br />
<br />
The way we use this tool is to extend tables to hold additional information, to add additional checks or functionality to a session, or to do additional logging based off events.</div></div><hr />

[Not that this helps DavidDevelopor] but I have to say this - I completely agree.</div></div><hr />

It depends upon what changes you want to make to existing functionality.<br />
<br />
There is a way (which obviously is not advisable) to do small changes like adding validations on existing or new fields. But it will cause you problems in future, and will add difficulties in further maintenance.<br />
<br />
But, it is always recommended to get these changes done by Infor. Its better to wait for some time, if you want quality of software.</div></div><hr />

I tend to disagree with the second part of that comment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please PM me with your contact name within Infor, the Base VRC for your customisation and your emailaddress.<br />
<br />
Haven't had any response so far, so a bit clarification: I've set up customisation environments internally and installed solutions to these environments to match the customer. If I have the info as requested, I might be able to improve your situation.  <br />
