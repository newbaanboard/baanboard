<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">15th March 2004, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All<br />
I have a session with two forms. There are no form options on each form (I want to disable form switching). And user cannot switch forms with mouse. That's good<br />
But the problem is that they can easy switch forms using left/right keyb. keys<br />
How can I disable this feature without programming?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Disabling these will prevent form switching (not just list of forms) too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">15th March 2004, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I've disabled this options (The other form's header is displayed with gray color)<br />
But with the keyboard left and right button I can switch forms!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th March 2004, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a similar session with similar requirements. It works fine here. In our case the other form tab is greyed out . This is not the case at your end . So just check out if 'list of forms' choice is disabled at the form level or not , and form has been dumped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">16th March 2004, 07:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hitesh Shah<br />
Can you try this: select form label (on top) (i have one or two mouse click on label in order to select form) and press keyboard left or right. Has the switch occuried?<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Is there any standart session with disabled form? I cannot find one</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMHO it's feature</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks indeed a bug . When I tab , the form switch does not occur. But when I press left and right arrow keys , form does switch to other form. The confusion arose because earlier I tried tab key only  instead of arrow keys (told specifically by you) .<br />
<br />
All code written in after.form and before.form code are executed. However choice change.frm does not get executed when it should have been executed. <br />
<br />
I think writing to.form statement in the program script can give us a workaround .</div></div><hr />

<br />
We also decided that's a bug and will take a support to solve it<br />
If anybody is interesting I can put their answer later (in month(s) maybe :))</div></div><hr />
