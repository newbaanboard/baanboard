<br />
In Baan IVc4, is it possible to change the device path in the program script. I am printing a report using ASCIF (with a default path of &quot;Fileout&quot; in device data). <br />
<br />
However, I need to create the file in a specific user directory. How can I accomplish that within the program script?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. <br />

<br />
Works just great. I looked all the pre-defined variables except the &quot;spool.*&quot; ones. Those slipped my mind. <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">4th January 2007, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to specify the directory for an ascif in a job setup.  I'm running in a windows env and I'm having difficulty.  I used to use Baan in a HPUX environment and this was a pretty easy task.  I'm sure it isn't much different I'm just not getting the syntax right or something along those lines.<br />
<br />
I would like to put the report in a directory on our baan server d:\baan\AutoReports\file  I've tried $BSE\AutoReports  {$BSE}\AutoReports  neither are working.<br />
<br />
Also - another difference I've noticed between the Windows and the HPUX environment, and I'm not sure if it is just the way the implementation of Baan is done, is all the files the users print, the temp files if anything goes through the ascif device ends up in the tmp directory in the Windows environment.  On the HPUX all these files went in the users home directory.  Is this just the way our systems were implemented?  Can it be changed?  It was nice with each user having it's own directory.<br />
<br />
Any insight is greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
In the path of the device you can specify a full path of the file and not just a directory.<br />
<br />
I advice you to write your own script that will take a directory and copy the file to the directory with anyname you want. You can do that in the tools script or using a batch file.<br />
<br />
You will have to print the report to your script (device) instead of ASCIF<br />
<br />
There is a nice example of a batch file here:<br />

I hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">4th January 2007, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks george - I was able to just put in \baan\AutoReports\filename and the file was created.  This was just when I ran the session myself though.  When I try to run the job I'm having difficulties.  First, I'm not even sure if the job setup is correct because like I mentioned before I've done job in the UNIX world so Windows process is new to me.<br />
<br />
According to documentation from developers previous to me we use the Task Scheduler on the Baan server and have it call .bat files.  Is this correct?<br />
<br />
It seems to run my job but I'm getting No Data in Selection errors everytime and I know that is not correct.  I checked the params for the job and session in ttaad503 and they are right.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
