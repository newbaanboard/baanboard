<br />
We have developped a Barcode application (BaanV - Oracle) and it works fine.<br />
<br />
However, we would like to program a beep (on the client machine) each time a barcode is read and displayed on the form.<br />
<br />
Could you please give me some advices about the way to do it?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

Have you checked your hardware manuals?  I do not have access to any barcode equipment right now, but I know our test guns beep.<br />

Does it work on your computer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesnt work on my computer or on the BaaN-5 series.<br />
<br />
That was an old function from the BaaN-4 series.<br />
<br />
I guess Bastien or Mark have to validate if it works.</div></div><hr />

It prints #7 to the terminal window, which is translated to a bell by a good emulator.</div></div><hr />

I've checked on Baan5 and it doesn't work, although the compilation and execution doesn't send an error message.<br />
<br />
I'm still searching ...<br />
<br />
I also thought of &quot;launching&quot; a windows event, such as &quot;exclamation&quot;, but I have no idea of how to do it ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have tried yesterday with an ASCII interface, and it works fine, but unfortunately not in a Windows environment ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure to see clearly what you mean. Could you please explain a bit more?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

I think what Mark means is that the bar code hardware usually has the option to beep on successful bar code read.  This seems to be not what you want though, but is how it is usually accomplished.   If you let us know the hardware you have reading the bar code, maybe we can help more.  Are you using a scanner / wand / swiper attached to a PC?  If so, what make &amp; model, and does the manual say anything about this?  Or a handheld device of some sort?  A Palm?</div></div><hr />

It works fine, but the sound produced is hardly hearable!<br />
<br />
I guess it should be possible to launch an identical sound as &quot;ding.wav&quot; or something like that, sent by windows for an error event.<br />
<br />
We are in a good way, thank you again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, I tried to describe rapidely our need, and I see now I wasn't clear at all; moreover, the original request has moved to somthing slightly different ...  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
You're right, the gun used to scan the barcode produces a sound.<br />
<br />
The request is to send a sound at the end of the scanning session, if errors occured. Technically, it means, how can we send a sound on the client machine when we program a &quot;set.input.error&quot; for example?<br />
<br />
Robert's suggestion is very close, but the sound produced is not lound enough.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help, it was much appreciated! <br />
<br />
Of course, you can still suggest anything if you know how to do that ! ;)</div></div><hr />
