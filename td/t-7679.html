<br />
I'm having a problem in our Baan IVc4 + Sql Server 7 probably because a mistake I did.<br />
I was building a new view session for the tdpur030 table (prices by supplier and item) and I created a new index in the table session with just the item. After this I converted it to runtime DD and did some tests in development that revealed it was working ok.<br />
The problems started when I copied the table definition and session to the users VRC. <br />
After converting the table to runtime DD (with reorganizing table indexes on) I lost all information for articles with more then one supplier (only one supplier remained). I understand this is because of the index definition I used but should this lead to data loss even when the other indexes are still defined or is the information still in the table?  :confused:<br />
Also after doing the copy to the user VRC I'm getting 512 errors on the sessions that work with tdpur030. Even after I reorganized the tables.<br />
<br />
Now I did all this &quot;mess&quot; :o because I wasn't able to set numeric fields for a search with no value. I mean in the current indexes I had supplier, item, quantity, price. How do I tell Baan I want the search items quantity and price to be blank (equivalent to having no value specified in the numeric fields in find box).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">16th November 2002, 13:15</div></div><div class="posttext">All the indexes should have the primary Index as a subset, except when duplicates are allowed.<br />
<br />
So your new index &quot;supplier,item,quantity,price&quot; is it a modification of  primary index or an addition of a field to the primary index?<br />
Are duplicates allowed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pedromrs</div><div class="date">16th November 2002, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">baanprog,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick reply. <br />
The new index is not supplier,item,quantity,price (that is one of those already defined). The new index is just &quot;item&quot; (that is index 3). Index 1 and 2 are item,supplier,date,price,quantity,discount and item,supplier,date,price,quantity.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">16th November 2002, 13:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You cannot have the new index just &quot;item&quot; bcos, the primary index is storing differently and if u have just &quot;item&quot; in your new index, there is a possibility for duplication.<br />
<br />
Index 1 item,supplier,date,price,quantity,discount <br />
Index 2 item,supplier,date,price,quantity.<br />
Index 3 Item(your new Index)<br />
Index 1 ,which is a primary index means for a Item, Supplier, Date,price,quantity,discount there will be one unique record.<br />
<br />
You are trying to say Item will be unique using the Index 3, which is neither a primary index nor duplicates are allowed in the Primary Index for your table, so it will not work along with your Index1 , which is by default the primary index.<br />
<br />
I also see even Index 2 is not correct, Discount should be there in Index2, or duplicates should be allowed in primary Index or the same problem you created applies with Index 2 also.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is the reason why its giving corrupt data dictionary problem.<br />
<br />
One solution is to allow duplicates, but to increase search capability this is NOT suggested, this decision should be based on a business need.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why dont you start using BaaN Query option in the menu in Tools?<br />
<br />
or give me your requirement clearly , I will try to suggest a solution.<br />
<br />

<br />
I understand I cannot have that index. I have deleted it already.<br />
My problem is getting data back and cleaning all those indexes links.<br />
Do you have a suggestion for that?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">16th November 2002, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Most probably it should have not been converted correctly, but if it did corrupt, I dont know how you can get it back, probably some database person should answer that.<br />
<br />
Try Running Convert  to Run time Data dictionary.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">16th November 2002, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that you do have a problem of lost data,<br />
  your options are :<br />
  get the data from daily/weekly back ups.<br />
  may be you dumped the table dat b4 you did this change.<br />
  Try to probe in the dumps.<br />
<br />
  However,I have read earlier elsewhere that depending on the<br />
  stage where your reconfigure failed,there is a possiblity to<br />
 get back the data files at the database and  os levels.<br />
 <br />
 I can post that information on Monday.In the mean while,<br />
 I suggest you post this question in the admin threads.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.<br />
<br />
Have you already checked with Baan Support?<br />
I think the solution 453 in the KnowledgeBase explains the<br />
possible places to look</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
We do daily backups to SQL Server tables using Veritas Software. I'm not sure how to recover the data from those tables only but I will ask in the admin forum.<br />
Meanwhile if you can post that information on Monday I will be very thankfull :) <br />
<br />
I still don't understand something. If the table definitions are Baan objects (work across the whole VRC) and I kept the existing table indexes I had the impression it would not damage the data at the database level (I tought the table index was fixed at the database level and that these indexes where Baan logical indexes that optimized the search).<br />
<br />
Thanks :cool: ,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">16th November 2002, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">When you create Indexes in Baan they are Logical, But when you create the table or Run Convert to RDD, it does make changes at database level , that is how the data you enter in Maintain Sessions will be updated in the Database by the Standard program or Custom program.<br />

Read more about Three-Tier Software architecture you will understand better.<br />

<br />
I understand converting to Runtime Data Dictionary makes changes at the database level. Just to clear things in my head I will try to explain what I tought it did<br />
<br />
Suppose I have a table with 3 fields item,supplier,price. <br />
And an index defined with Baan (ITEM and SUPPLIER).<br />
<br />
I fill it with data like:<br />
<br />
ITEM | SUPPLIER | PRICE<br />
267            1            100<br />
267            2            200<br />
281            1            78<br />
291            3            50<br />
<br />
Now I keep the first index and I define index 2 just like (ITEM).<br />
From what I understand now when I convert it to RDD it will delete entry 2 in the table! (at least this is what I understand happened to me).<br />
From my experience with databases an index is not the same as a primary key. Indexes exist to make searching faster and it looks like Baan treated it (at least in this case) like a primary key.<br />
<br />
Thanks for you patience,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">17th November 2002, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, What you are saying is correct.<br />
<br />
But I know that Secondary indexes on a field other than Primary indexes have disadvantages like:<br />
<br />
Slowing down updation and increasing record pointers.Probably this is a bargain BaaN has adopted to suit business needs.<br />
<br />
I will research and find out why Baan doesn't allow Indexes just for searches.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what I read elsewhere a while ago.Hope it helps you<br />
understand the situation you are in.<br />
=============================================<br />
<br />
When reorg'ing a table in Baan and it errored out, Does it harm anything else??? I mean do we have to do anything to roll it back or it automatically roll back to the way it was????<br />
<br />
: thanks for any info.<br />

Hi,<br />
It depends where the session crashed... Check the R.txxxxx files in the TMP directory, for example. You may have lost data !!!! Reorganize is in fact:<br />
1. create seq dump<br />
2. delete table<br />
3. upload data<br />
<br />
if the step 3 fails, you will loose data !<br />
<br />
This was not written by me, but it is useful:<br />
<br />
Background info for using bdbreconfig6.1 <br />
Keyword: Reorganize tables were killed while busy <br />
<br />
Class: Error Session: ttaad4225m000 Object: various <br />
<br />
Description: <br />
Situation Description: <br />
The session 'Reorganize Tables' [ttaad4225m000] were killed or stopped while the job were busy. <br />
The system may not able to be started any more. <br />
<br />
Solution Description: <br />
While running, the session first creates a file called R.. Then the table will be rebuilt using this R. file. When everything runs well, when the table is reorganized, the R. is removed from the system. After the session is killed (while running), the original table will not be complete - it is not suitable for use anymore. <br />
In this case you will have to rebuild the table using the R. file manually. Shell down to Unix or DOS level and go to the directory where the reorganize session started from, search for the R. file(s) and run the command given below: <br />
<br />
Unix: bdbreconfig6.1 -N + <br />
NT: bdbreconfig -N + <br />
<br />
Example: In most cases the file(s) can be found in the TMP-directory of the root-path. The name of such a file could be 'R.tibom000822'. If you have a NT-System the command you will have to run will be: <br />
bdbreconfig -N tibom000822+ <br />
<br />
This command reads the tablename and company number given as arguments and converts them <br />
into a new table definition matching the new data dictionary definition. It requires a new data dictionary with a '.new' extension, the current data dictionary and tables matching those in the current data dictionary. After successful completion, old tables are deleted and new are generated. <br />
The command finds the optimum way to reconfigure and if there is no real change in two data <br />
dictionaries it prints the message 'No conversion required'. Furthermore it sees to it that a database remains consistent. When more than one table is given to be reconfigured and if an error occurs in the middle of the operation, it reverts to the orriginal state. <br />
<br />
Warning: make copy of the dump/file(s) before doing this<br />
