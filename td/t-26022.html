While compiling mentioned code getting 4 error messages for columns of tisfc001 table. One of the example as below.<br />
Error SQL: Column 'tisfc001.pdno' is not used as group identifier<br />
<br />
In the Query, table tisfc001 contains unique records for item where as table ticst001 contains multiple records for one item. I want summation of field ticst001.qucs for one item.<br />
<br />
Required your HELP !!!<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />

The field tisfc001.mit is missing a letter in the order by clause  ;)<br />

<br />
Is it reqd to use tisfc001.pdno field in Group By statement in addition to ticst001.pdno. Is it allowed ?<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />

If your relations are OK, I think you only need tisfc001.pdno (or the other one. I would try both and look if there is a difference in the result and the performance). <br />

Why include the ticst001.pdno?  You already have the tisfc001.pdno.  As far as I know when you to queries with sums you have to group by all other fields.  You can also always separate the queries and do the sum of ticst001 in a query inside the selectdo on tisfc001.  Also notice I removed the : infront of the tisfc001.pdno in the where clause.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanx I will check the results by applying your suggesstions. As mentioned by you, plz tell me the sub-query syntax by considering my posted SQL. It will be helpful to me.<br />

The code suggested by you is working fine. Plz let me know the sub-query logic for the same code so that I can check the performance also.<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th January 2006, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes I find separating queries to be quicker and sometimes I separate queries just to make it easier for me to understand what is happening.  In this case I am not sure separating the queries would increase performance.  Reading the performance guide (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7665) can help in determining when to separate queries.<br />
