<br />
BaanERP only stores YEARLY beginning balances. To get monthly begininng balances so often needed in financial statements, you'd have to use those yearly beginning balance (as mentioned by Monica) as a base, then work your way up to the month in question using, preferably, the &quot;history&quot; family of tables: tfgld201, tfgld202, or tfgld205. It's not going to be straightforward, since the &quot;history&quot; tables may store history per currency for certain accounts<br />
