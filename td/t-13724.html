<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lesperancer</div><div class="date">26th November 2003, 00:32</div></div><div class="posttext">we have a business rule when setting up a PCS project that requires the user to add a 'cost' item to capture extra engineering / design cost<br />
<br />
this is not required on all projects, and the project creator knows which projects the rule applies to, but sometimes they forget (darn humans)<br />
<br />
we need an audit capabiity to allow accounting to check <br />
that the correct costs are being captured, and, accounting doesn't know which projects require the extra cost item<br />
<br />
we'd like to add a 'required' field to the PCS project where the project creator can indicate the type of project, which can provide accounting with the list of projects to audit<br />
<br />
can this be done ? how easy is it ?<br />
<br />
in general, if we want to add fields to any module in baan to capture business information, what is the best approach ?<br />
<br />
we're running baan4c2 on sql server, and use ms-access to provide reports / queries to the business user</div></div><hr />

If you have them, you can just add a field to the project table (tipcs020) and declare it mandatory. Afterwards, you need to convert the table definition to runtime.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should consider to follow a development course if you do not feel comfortable with making changes in tables.<br />
