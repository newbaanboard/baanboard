<br />
We are currently using Business Objects XI with the Business Objects Baan Integration Kit. Both products are no longer supported and I have been asked to look for a replacement.<br />
<br />
The Business Objects solution is very good for the end-user as they can easily produce reports using Crystal Reports and the Baan Integration drivers. We could upgrade to the latest Business Objects but you can no longer get a Baan Integration product. This would mean using ODBC connections to Oracle views which increases the admin overhead.<br />
<br />
So now seems a good time to maybe look at the alternatives. Which reporting solutions are other companies using? <br />
<br />
The key requirements we are looking for include -<br />
<br />
1. Easy report writing application or something that will work with Crystal Reports.<br />
2. Ease of connection to the Baan data without the requirement to manage large numbers of Oracle views.<br />
3. The ability to schedule reports.<br />
4. Reports can be output in different file types.<br />
5. Able to schedule reports and send out as email.<br />
<br />
We are using Baan IVc4 with Oracle 11.2<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
