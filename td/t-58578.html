<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">8th June 2010, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I have trouble activating a table field help. <br />
What I did: <br />
1) Create Help Topic in session ttadv1560m000, type table field.<br />
2) Link this help code to table field through 'Help Information Input' field in session ttadv4122s000 (Table Fields). Note: I tried 'Help Info 1' &amp; 'help Info Display' as well...<br />
3) Convert table to RDD + reconfigure table<br />
4) Create Runtime Help<br />
5) Re-start bshell<br />
<br />
I don't seem to get it working. Please advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th June 2010, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Where are you trying to get the help to appear?  It seems like those are the basic steps we followed when we created text (well ttadv1160m000, but I figured just a typo).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">8th June 2010, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I want the help to appear when clicking F1 or 'help' on the specific form table field in the session. The help contains explanation about how to fill the field.<br />
<br />
This explanation is rather long, I therefor wanted to neatly put it into a help file, rather than just adding 10 lines of explanation text on the form...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th June 2010, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me try it on a table I am just creating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">8th June 2010, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks mark! Will hear from you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th June 2010, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Well here is how I got field help to work for me:<br />
<br />
(1) Use ttadv4126m000 to create the table field text.  I did all three of the texts.<br />
(2) Use ttadv5210m000 to Create run time DD.  Not I had to check create runtime help.<br />
(3) Log out and back into baan.  The help would work depending on type of field.<br />
<br />
I tried doing it manually, but it did not work.  The create runtime help session would not work for this specific table.  I do not know why.  It seems to me the last time I did this I always had to run create runtime help wide open.  I remember it was not as easy as it seemed and I pretty much quit using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">8th June 2010, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, thanks for testing it on your system. <br />
I tried again but don't get it to work. <br />
2 remarks:<br />
1) in Baan Vc I cannot enter table field help in session ttadv4126m000. This session is display only and gives an overview of the help fields linked to table fields in session ttadv4122s000 (Table Fields). <br />
2) in the Create RDD session on Baan Vc there is no option 'create runtime help'. I do however have a separate session ttadv5230m000 for that. <br />
<br />
Will give it a few more shots with larger/wider selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">8th June 2010, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I just ran the session Create Runtime Help with open selection for all components etc, and it works now! <br />
<br />
Strange!<br />
<br />
Thanks Mark anyway</div></div><hr />
