<br />
With &quot;a detailed report should open up of that particular sector&quot; do you mean you want to call another LN report for that particular sector?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sapna20</div><div class="date">21st November 2014, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I want to call another report.<br />
Is this possible?????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">24th November 2014, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it can be done. I assume you want to use the same dataset coming from LN in the 2nd report. Follow the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Create the SSRS design for the LN report and add the chart to it. Do not add the action for the pie chart yet.<br />
2. Ensure that it works as required, but still only in design phase. Don't deploy it yet.<br />
3. Copy the SSRS design.<br />
4. Remove the chart, create a list and make a row visibility expression based on a parameter. This parameter will be passed from the first report later.<br />
5. Test this report; because the dataset is copied from the first design, the same input file will be processed. Based on the parameter value you give the data is filtered. Note that you should NOT convert this to a subreport using the configurator.<br />
6. Go back to first report and create the action in the pie chart (in the series properties)<br />
7. Pass the category value as parameter to the 2nd report.<br />
8. Preview the first report. Clicking a pie will open the 2nd report for that category.<br />
9. Prepare for deployment (both reports)<br />
10. Add manually the parameters jca_uri, jca_ticket and datafile to the action properties in the chart report. The values of the current parameters (e.g. =Parameters!jca_uri.Value) need to be passed.<br />
11. Deploy the reports.<br />
12. Run it from LN.<br />
<br />
Note that 'prepare for development' will not completely work. After you did this, you need to remove the parameters in the action link manually (see step 10).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I followed your steps. Now what i observe is as follows:<br />
<br />
1. I develop the report using infor ln as data source  but didnot deploy it then if i preview the report then it gave me the error which states that xml of report is not present which is not true.<br />
<br />
2. After this I develop both the reports using the same data set and deploy it<br />
and I also create the hyperlink which is pointing the parameter of second report.Now the reports is running successfully in infor ln and the hyperlink is also working fine but when it opens the second report it just shows the header and footer not the detail part(which is executing as per parameter).<br />
<br />
3.If I remove the parameter of second report and create the hyperlink by giving the report inbuild parameter i.e. jca_uri ,jca_ticket,datafile then also the detail layout is not printing.<br />
<br />
I didnot get where i am missing.Please help me in this context.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
Its working fine now.<br />
Actually I have done the grouping on the second report.After removing the grouping the detail layout is printing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx Jaap for helping me in developing this report.<br />

You are welcome! Would be nice if you could post some screenshots here of the chart and detail report. I'm sure other SSRS report designers will like this idea and are thinking already of reports where they want to apply it as well.</div></div><hr />
