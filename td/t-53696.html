<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">merian</div><div class="date">17th September 2008, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">We print order acknowledgement (tdsls4401m000) every 2 hours in each of our 4 companies, this session is getting slower and slower since we have more and more sales orders, and we are experimenting bad performance because of that.<br />
We only print the acknowledgement as a confirmation for new orders automatically as a task, so we put &quot;excl. printed lines&quot; in the field &quot;order line types to print&quot;. I have seen in the program that the session &quot;ignore&quot; this field when executing the main query, it only exclude the records when printing. This makes the session to go along each and every sales order line positions (a huge lot).<br />
Any sugestion?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try usingh Boosters tcmcs0197m000 &amp; tcmcs0198m000 for the tables tdsls040,tdsls041,tdsls045 and for the session tdsls4401m000 .<br />

You can use them when you have to read many times some master tables (warehouses, item groups, etc) but if you try to use in the transaction tables you can even have worst performances and a waste of memory to read all tables...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">18th September 2008, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Zardoz,<br />
<br />
Logically , you are true - i had similar issues long back with &quot;maintain transactions &quot; (tfgld1101m000) getting worser and worser (only session open used to take 20-40 min).<br />
<br />
I tried boosters for tfgld102 , tfacp200 .<br />
It gradually increased the speed and performance.<br />
<br />
Even though tfgld102 and tfacp200 are transaction tables not masters - no reason and idea how it boosted the performance and speed.<br />
<br />
in case , if some other could throw some light on the same shall be appreciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">18th September 2008, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">About  boosters, there is an important remark... <br />
<br />
If the session isn't written to make use of table boosters (I don't remember the name of the DLL, but refers to all functions calls like idb*), there is no difference at all... simply they arent used in the session. <br />
Using table boosters in a session designed to use them can increase the performances slightly, because the table is loaded in memory (all at the start of session or incrementally when a new record is read).<br />
<br />
For performance boosters (specially 'number of servers') the same applies... you can use it in some session, like MRP or PRP but again is useless if the session isn't designed to meke use of it. Again, the use of performance boosters in MRP by example can icrease performances.<br />
<br />
Order Ack printing doesnt use tabel or performance boosters at all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">18th September 2008, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand correctly, from what you say in the first post, you do NOT really need to run the Print Order Acknowledgment report - it is being done just because it is part of the order steps. [If my understanding is wrong, ignore this suggestion.]<br />
<br />
SO, here is another possibiliy - but first (because this is not really a 'programming' issue but a 'process change' issue), you must consult with the functional persons responsible for Sales Orders to make sure they agree and then run a test run to make sure everything works correctly. <br />
<br />
HERE is the suggestion: In standard BAAN Demo company, there is a Sales Order Type SN2 that does not have Print Order Acknowledment as an Order Step. SO, if it is possible to create the Sales Orders in future with SN2 (or create a new code according to how your company has standards for such things) as the Order Type, then you do not even have to run the Print Order Acknowledgment.<br />
<br />
I am attaching the screen image of the Order Step for ready reference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">merian</div><div class="date">19th September 2008, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">That could be a solution, but we do send this confirmation to the customers automatically via a fax server (rightfax) so we should do many changes if we don't print the acknowledgement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">19th September 2008, 11:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Another solution for you is to customize sales order session to keep track if a new order or some line changes, and call the print order acknowledge from this session. <br />
The print has a order number, so the select is done by index and it takes no so much time to print.</div></div><hr />
