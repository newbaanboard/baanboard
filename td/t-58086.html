How can I use Baan to add the bar code to the PCL document as a graphic?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
are you using pcl2pdf ?<br />
Embed the barcode in the BaaN pcl stream.<br />
<br />
In report, add the desired field and assign &quot;barcode typexx&quot; to the field.<br />
($BSE/lib/barcode/hp)<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

If you are referring to ghostscript, pcl2pdf was not meeting some requirement and we ended up using JetPCL instead. We are investigating if fonts can be added to JetPCL to print the bar codes with the method you suggested above. If this does not work, I will look into pcl2pdf. Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
the ghostscript solution is based on Postscript (PS).<br />
I'm using direct PCL2PDF (from Lincoln Software) in combination with ELP (EnhancedLaserPrinting).<br />
<br />
Works like a charm.<br />
<br />
Enclosed you`ll find a PDF example generatet from BaaN with PCL2PDF<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PageTech</div><div class="date">26th March 2010, 01:29</div></div><div class="posttext">PCLTool SDK can capture and analyze PCL at the page level to determine which require a barcode and what to barcode based on the rules you provide.  It can either just point to the barcode font that you want to use (as if it were in the printer buffer) or you can use barcodes fonts that are internal to the program or it has barcoding functions that can generate any barcodes or OMR marks.  After the barcode is inserted, the PCL can be converted to a very small JBIG2 compressed raster PDF, routed and archived.<br />
