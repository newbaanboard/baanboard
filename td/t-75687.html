If one record is selected, delete button is disabled because DAL checks that one selected record for delete conditions. If multiple records are selected, conditions are not checked at moment of selection, so command is enabled. Then the DAL check is executed as soon as the real delete starts. Then, if the conditions to delete the record are not satisfied, the delete is skipped.</div></div><hr />
