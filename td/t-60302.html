<br />
I am working with Baan 4 b2. I wanted to know, is there a way that i can control access to the software components  by user ID's ?<br />
<br />
I meant, i am the developer (super user), i have to modify 2 forms and 1 script and hence i have copied them to development vrc, but sometimes other developers will edit these forms and scripts, so is there a way to control this by login ID's ? <br />
<br />
I wanted nobody to access the components (from, scripts, reports ...) which are copied by me to the current VRC. Usually we maintain all the components copied into current VRC at Customization administration &quot;ttadv1176m000&quot; . so based on this can we create a lock for applications ? like, what all components are added to this session by me should be accessible to other developers until unless i release them (check out) ..?<br />
<br />
Kindly guide me how can i achieve this request in Baan 4 b2 ?<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

For that you need at least BaanERP 5.0 or ERP LN. However, you can achieve this in the session &quot;Maintain Developer Authorizations by Package VRC&quot; (ttadv0141m000). If you uncheck the option &quot;Authorization for Components where no Designer&quot;, you can prevent other users to work on your components in the specific VRC. Note that this does not work for all components, because not all components have the designer attribute.</div></div><hr />
