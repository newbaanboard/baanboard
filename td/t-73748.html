I have a question.<br />
<br />
How to add many components to one solution. For example, I have 100 expired scripts that I would like to add to solution and move that to another environment in LN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">24th February 2021, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">In theory, there is no limit as they are entries in the ttpmc tables, however there might be a OS limit for the tar.gz file that is created.<br />
I added ~10,000 components to a single PMC solution and it worked fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are talking about the limit of number of components, you can refer to Mr. NP Rao's reply,<br />
according to your example, if you are trying to add expired scripts into solution, it cannot be happened. You will have to activate those scripts and then add it into a solution.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kacbar</div><div class="date">25th February 2021, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that unexpired scripts can be added, I know, but what I meant was that when I expired 100 scripts on one environment, I would like all the extinguished ones to move to the other environment so that I would not have to manually extinguish them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">25th February 2021, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you can add a bunch of expired components to a PMC solution using the session ttpmc1221m000.</div></div><hr />
