Hi everyone,<br />
Ever wanted to see  Logo on your BaaN screens?? Do all this and more with the steps given below. The code for this is <br />
there in BaaN Tools itself!! Read the section on Create.Object (3 GL function), the example given at the end can be copied almost as it is , with a few changes. Works for NT as well as UNIX.<br />
<br />
PUT THIS CODE INTO INIT.FORM for ANY SESSION. THE GIF WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE XPOS,YPOS THAT YOU SPECIFY.You must have source code (program script) for that session. <br />
<br />
    long     cmap(256)<br />
    long     cmap_sz<br />
    string   imap(1)   based<br />
<br />
    long     icon_w<br />
    long     icon_h<br />
    long     valid.icon<br />
<br />
    long gwin<br />
    string file(128)<br />
    string bufr(1)  based<br />
    long buflen, fp<br />
    long idc, idp, image<br />
  <br />
    gwin = create.object(DsCgwindow,current.mwindow(),<br />
    DsNbackground,    &lt;Long Color&gt;,<br />

    DsNpointerCursor, DSCHAND,<br />
    DsNeventMask,     EVTALLEVENTMASK )<br />
<br />

    fp = seq.open(file, &quot;r&quot;)<br />
<br />
    buflen = seq.seek(0, 2, fp)<br />
    alloc.mem(bufr, buflen)<br />
    seq.rewind(fp)<br />
    seq.read(bufr, buflen, fp)<br />
    seq.close(fp)<br />
<br />
    if get.pixmap.info(bufr, cmap_sz, icon_w, icon_h) then<br />
    alloc.mem(imap, icon_w * icon_h)<br />
    valid.icon = decompress.pixmap(bufr, cmap, imap)<br />
    cmap(1) = rgb(128,128,128)<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
    free.mem(bufr)<br />

    DsNx,             0,<br />
    DsNy,             0 )<br />
<br />
POINTS TO REMEMBER: <br />
Copy your GIF file to any of the subdirectories under $BSE/GIF..such as desktop.gif, etc. Remember thses are directories, not GIF files. Then, RENAME your .GIF file such that it does not have the .GIF extension..ie rename VIN.GIF to VIN, even for NT. <br />
<br />
Its surprising , you can do things in BaaN you never thought possible, and the code is there , hidden away in BaaN Tools Help. <br />
If any of you have any such stuff to share , please share it with all of us BaaN developers. It makes our normal mundane BaaN lives much more interesting! <br />

Thats was great posting...!!! :p <br />

However, I am getting compilation error for the 1st coding you posted -<br />
<br />
<br />
pzmadmtest0( 140): Error: Unresolved reference to function 'load.pixmap.file'.<br />

I usually have no problem accepting laurels. But in this case I must decline :). The original posting was from IIS (Ivan). Then Vineet posted a different piece and finally Ulrich posted some more code. I have reposted some of the code earlier too and each of those gentlemen may have used each others ideas.<br />
<br />
Why does the code not work? I have no clue :). This code does not have much interest for me at this moment.<br />
<br />
Grzegorz had a similar piece of code working which he showcased on his website. He was willing to share his code with the lady who offered kisses all around ;).<br />
<br />
Now that folks have a starting point for this code, will someone make it easy to link pictures to records. For example product pictures on Items session and employee pictures on Employees session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but that is not actually what i want<br />
<br />
<br />
suppose if i have 100 employees and i want to display 100 photes of employees with their details according to ur code i will have to saperately write the code for each employee<br />
<br />
i want to change the photo of emp. as soon as the details changes for different emp.<br />
<br />
like when i click on next record of next employee the picture of next employee should display automatically<br />

i will be very thankful if any one provide me solution.</div></div><hr />

You have to code as below to handle the current record of the table and get the picture info in your function to display -<br />
<br />
<br />
for i=1 to filled.occ<br />
	if mark.table(i) then<br />
		do.occ(i, some_function)<br />
	endif<br />
endfor<br />

<br />
Prashanth - if you were to display the picture it will have to be in the single-occ and not on the multi-occ session. So there is no need to do the stuff you outlined. Perhaps you are thinking of launching a picture from the specific menu. The ideal solution would be that the picture just appears just like any other field on the single-occ.<br />
<br />
Jaishni, the base code is already provided. If you name the gif files same as the primary key of tccom001 you should be pretty close to the solution. If that does not make sense, please contact www.dst.com.pl or www.rmcis.com and they will probably be willing to provide you with a solution for a fee.</div></div><hr />

I think that been enough by passing each and everybody thoughts ,<br />
<br />
I have an idea and feel that it would be nice punch if we try that<br />
<br />
like i create a program for photo display with employee's detail IN VISUAL BASIC and intigrate that program with baan <br />
<br />
exp:<br />
<br />
if i go through baan module i should be able to open it in BaaN Menu not in external resources.<br />

if any one has idea upon this matter plz send me immediately<br />

<br />
I wouldnt extend any more functionality if its already available in standard BaaN.<br />
<br />
<br />
New functionality in BaanERP 5.2a<br />
Difference Study iBaanERP 5.0c - 5.2a3-19<br />
<br />
3.4 Dynamic Form Editor (DFE)<br />
<br />
This section describes the DFEs new functionality in BaanERP 5.2a.<br />
<br />
3.4.1 Pictures on forms<br />
<br />
In BaanERP 5.2a, you can use the DFE to insert a picture (gif format) on a sessions form. The picture you insert must be in the Icon Groups (ttdsk9100m000) session in the icon group form_&lt;pp&gt;, where pp is the package code of the session whose form you want to insert the picture on.<br />
<br />
To insert a picture on a sessions form with the DFE:<br />
<br />
1 Select Insert &#9658;Picture, or click the picture icon on the toolbar. The picture properties dialog box appears:<br />
Figure 3-19 The DFEs Picture properties dialog box.<br />
<br />
2 Click the zoom button on the Icon field. The ttgbf0005m000 window appears with the icons available to you. Select your icon.<br />
<br />
3 You can select the:<br />
&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;Details Session check box for the picture to appear on the details sessions form.<br />
&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;Overview Session check box for the picture to appear on the overview sessions form.<br />
&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;Child Field(s) Behind check box to place the pictures child field(s) (if any) immediately behind the picture.<br />
<br />
4 If you want a label for your picture, enter the required details in the fields of the Label box.<br />
<br />
5 Click OK.<br />
<br />
You can use the programming function long.change.picture()to<br />
change the picture on a form at runtime. The picture you use to replace the existing picture must also belong to the icon group form_&lt;pp&gt; in the Icon Groups (ttdsk9100m000) session.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess Vamsi has give good ideas and *timed out* this discussion. :p</div></div><hr />

But when changing the gif with my proper gif file, the gif was displayed 3 or 4 times.<br />
After a little research i discoverd that you have to save the gif files in the normal way not in the interleaced way. <br />
In photoshop MS i did not found the option, using acrobat photoshop it is asked when you save a file in the gif format.</div></div><hr />

In name of our programmers, I have to thank you for the coding you posted. I passed it on to them, and they've not been doing their job until this moment, being happy as children with all kinds of pictures on their forms.<br />

As for thanking me ... wish I could accept the laurels. I have quoted all the sources. But here they are again. The following people had posted the source at various times - either they were the authors or they were just reposting after refining the code.<br />
<br />
 Ivan Simeonov<br />
 Vineet Sawant<br />

May the thanks I expressed spread out over the people you mention...<br />
<br />
Our programmers are, as I said earlier, experimenting with the coding. Any interesting improvements they might stumble upon I will ofcourse share with those who love BaaN or who are, in any way, forced to live with it.<br />

The name of the image is stored in table field.  I am expecting the image to change when navigating from one record to the next.  The form type is a single occurrance.<br />
<br />
The problem that I am having is sometimes the image is displayed as a black block on the form.  :confused: I have posted an example.  The attachment is a screen image of the same record.  On one, the image is correct, on the other, the image is displayed is a block rectangle.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what might cause this?<br />
<br />
This may not be pertinent but I have observed when I navigate from one record to the next quickly, I see more black rectangles.  When I allow some time to pass; I count to 6 slowly; then I see less black rectangles.</div></div><hr />
