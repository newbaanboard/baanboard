<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">11th December 2001, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I programmed in a reports after field section a &quot;need()&quot; function call. I retrieved the argument for need from tttxt002.nlin (The number of lines, which the current text needs). I tried also with a fixed number as argument, but that doesn't help. The report crashes sometimes with the message :&quot;Function need; Recursion not possible refcount=2; Can not continue in &lt;reportnp&gt; in DLL: ottstprepdll(get.company)..&quot;<br />
<br />
Is it possible, that this is a problem of the report DLL?<br />

Thanx<br />

Is it in the after.print or before.print section?  From a quick glance at my knowledge quest CD it mentioned that you would use this function in the before.print section on a text field. I am not sure if that makes a difference.  Just a guess - I really thought Han had solved it.<br />

<br />
thanks for that hint, but I used it in a &quot;before.print&quot; - section.<br />

If you can I would suggest that you debug the report script, I don't have a clue why it happens. For sure Baan doesn't support recursive calls so you have to find out by debugging what exactly is happening.<br />

<br />
I can not debug, because at the moment I have no access to that system anymore. <br />
Due to a lag of time I programmed the &quot;need()&quot; manually, with spool.pg.length and the actual line number. That works fine.<br />
<br />
The report which is concerned is a cust of one of the tisfc0408m000 reports. In the program-script of this session the reporthandling is realized with brp.open, brp.close......  (IMHO a little complicated). Maybe the reason for the problem with <br />
&quot;need()&quot; is related to that.<br />

I had encountered same Probelm of Recursion not possible for function say &quot;need()&quot; ref count = 2 <br />
I think that in Baan Resursion is restricted or not allowed [ i might be wrong to say that ]<br />
but what i did to solve this proble is to have two functions calling each other <br />
ie <br />
<br />
|        calling need.one() function from main body <br />
         need.one()<br />
...<br />
function need.one()<br />
{<br />
    if condition then<br />
         need.two()<br />
    else <br />
|    Exit through the function<br />
    endif <br />
}<br />
<br />
function need.two()<br />
{<br />
    if condition then<br />
         need.one()<br />
    else <br />
|    Exit through the function<br />
    endif <br />
}<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards <br />

So in the example above: it is not because you use two functions that makes it possible, it is because you don't have local variables and no function arguments.:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pcolombo</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 03:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi , Just Today i had the same problem. It occurs when you have a text field in a footer layout ( in despite you have text fields defined in details layout). you can discover where is the problem , running the report in debugger, entering &quot;c&quot; in the debugger session. Once the program stop pointing the line who caused the problem you can determine ( by the name of the function in generated script), who were the format/s where the text field is placed.<br />
<br />
Hope this post can helps you and sorry about my english</div></div><hr />
