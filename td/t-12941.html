<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I followed the directions given by Baan to send an email from Baan.  What I get is another instance of Outlook (already one running) with a word doc being opened up (not an outlook message).  <br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
<br />
Using session &quot;Device Data&quot; (ttaad3500m000) create a new device, called EMAIL for example.<br />
Fill in:<br />
Device Type: Rewrite File<br />
4GL Program: ttstpconv<br />
Argument: RTF:outlook.exe %s<br />
Path: outlook.rtf<br />
Page Length: 66<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
&gt; Take care that the PATH variable at the client computer is set correctly, in that way that the executable &quot;outlook.exe&quot; can be found. To test, make sure you are able to go to a DOS prompt and type outlook.exe &lt;filename&gt; from several different directories. It should bring up a new message window with your file attached. <br />
&gt; In stead of RTF conversion, it is also possible to choose ASCII conversion.<br />
&gt; The file outlook.rtf is created in %BSE% at the client pc<br />
&gt; The following command is executed on the client pc (in this case): outlook.exe ${BSE}\outlook.rtf<br />
So, in case the BSE path at the client pc = c:\Program Files\Baan, the command is:<br />
outlook.exe c:\Program File\Baan\outlook.rtf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">That looks right... we have the same setup exactly ( ok... the line length is 76 ).<br />
<br />
And what you put at the bottom seems right as well.  I never really worried about where it puts the outlook.rtf file, but I just went to look and there it was.  <br />
<br />
What I get is a new e-mail message with the word document attached to it.<br />
<br />
Just for the heck of it, I went to my PC's &quot;Run...&quot; command and typed &quot;outlook.exe c:/baan/outlook.rtf&quot; and the same thing happened.  Maybe try that with your comptuer too?  If it does not work then maybe work that end of the problem with a PC setting or two (Yeah BILL GATES and that wonderful product we all know as Windows!!!)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

Maybe that's an easier way of email, since you're on Unix anyway!  Use the UNIX tools, and bypass M$ Exchange! (Give Bill a headache by NOT using his product... :D)</div></div><hr />

I'm sure you've already tried the attached but both these options work for me, although I'm on Win2000.<br />
<br />
The top screen shot is sending mail via Unix.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">29th September 2003, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">pjohns, does the unix setup need additional coding/setup down in UNIX ?  what was needed in UNIX to make this work ?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, there was nothing extra done from the Unix side. <br />
<br />
I presume you can use mailx from the Unix system prompt? Do you get any error messages?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">17th December 2003, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
 I did the same setup as suggested. I'm able to start outlook from any place thru the DOS prompt. The device works just fine.. and Outlook comes up with the attached report in RTF.<br />
<br />
The only problem is, The file is being created on the C drive of the Baan server. (Baan on the server is located at d:\baan.)<br />
<br />
Is it possible to create the file on the client machine itself ?<br />
As suggested below....<br />
<br />
&quot;The following command is executed on the client pc (in this case): outlook.exe ${BSE}\outlook.rtf<br />
So, in case the BSE path at the client pc = c:\Program Files\Baan, the command is:<br />
outlook.exe c:\Program File\Baan\outlook.rtf&quot;<br />
<br />
Where do I give this command ? Do I have to change the Baan Configuration file ? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />
