<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mlarocca</div><div class="date">3rd October 2002, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
one of my clients had a request to eliminate the cover page that prints the user name, date, time, etc.. before every report that the users send to the printer but have that information printing instead on the top of every report page.<br />
The solution to the problem was not to customize every single baan report of course.<br />
<br />
I then built a &quot;rewrite file&quot; device that feeds the report output to a 3GL script that I wrote to add the required information at each page break.<br />
<br />
I added a line at the top of my work file with the setup informations that appears on bwprint files (.bpf) for font, with/lenght of the page, protrait/landscape, page from, page to, etc..).<br />
<br />
EX:<br />
@ -p &quot;&quot; -c  2 -f      1 -t 999999 -l  66 -m   0 -L ISO-8859-1 -a      1 -r rttadv240001000 -w 232 -d L  -B &quot;WINDOWSL&quot;@<br />
<br />
<br />
The modified report output is then ready and I just need to execute a server2client() and app_start() to open the file with bwprint.exe.<br />
<br />
My quesiton now [ finally you may say...... :D ]: Does anybody know how to specify &quot;legal size paper&quot; in the setup line of a bwprint file or any other way to reach that result?<br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />
