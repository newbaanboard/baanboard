<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">6th August 2008, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I don't think that such document exists.Here my knowledge<br />
In Baan IV ( and also I think in Baan ERP) the pmsk contains the different steps that must/are executed.<br />
<br />
starting from maintain order step. (tcmcs0139m00 BaanIV )or activity in Baanerp(table tdpur060):<br />
for each session you have there a unique step number (activity number in BaanERP).<br />
<br />
Next you have you order type (table tcmcs042 Baan IV and table tdpur094 in Baan ERP)) that contains some steps (sessions) and you find therein the unique step number (or activity)<br />
<br />
This build a default order type pmsk field (table tcmcs042/tdpur094) that contains a character &quot;y&quot; for each step number that must be executed. all other characters are &quot;n&quot;. When you select an order type the default pmsk from tcmcs042/tdpur094 is used to fill the order line pmsk field.<br />
<br />
When one of the sessions is executed then the related character is changed from &quot;y&quot; to &quot;e&quot; (and the purchase status is also updated.)<br />
<br />
In LN6.1 this has changed  :)<br />
<br />

<br />
thank for your answer. I asked this question to get rid of this &quot;in my opinion&quot; or &quot;I think&quot; .....<br />
<br />
Every time I have something to do with that think I have to think over again: What ist the meaning of the letters? Why is the mask not like the default? What about the cycles? Is the session in the status-field the last or the next session?<br />
<br />
;) Please don't answer this questions :D<br />
<br />
I hate it, to work with that, maybe every second year and investigate this things again and again. An if you finished, you think: OK now I know it, its easy, why should I write it down? (Or you just don't have the time) And then, one year later, the same problem again. :mad:<br />
<br />
I think also, this is a basic function, why the hell is there no description?</div></div><hr />
