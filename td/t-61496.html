<br />
We started to explore the MS Reporting and first problem we cannot solve is importing deployed report by ttrpi1200m100. Does not meter what I am trying to do, I am getting the message “zero imported, zero skipped and zero failed reports”.<br />
What I am doing wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st November 2011, 08:56</div></div><div class="posttext">To succeed with the import you need to have the following in place (based on your screenshot):<br />
1. The 'classic' report tcmcs043911000 should be present in VRC B61O_a_dvl or in a lower one.<br />
2. In your project you need a report design with the name tcmcs043911000.rdl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ysovva</div><div class="date">21st November 2011, 10:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jaap,<br />
Renaming the rdl file is helped to make the import. Thanks a lot.<br />
Now during the printing I am getting the message that report is not present on the report server. From attached images you can see that the report indeed present on the report server. The U9656A US and U9657A US documents are not helping with this problem. What I did wrong?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st November 2011, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Restarting bshell may help. Bshell is caching the information about the presence of the reports on the SSRS server. Instead of restarting bshell you can also kill the ttrpissrssrv process before printing again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ysovva</div><div class="date">6th December 2011, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I have another question about MS reporting.<br />
Creating a main report with subreports: I'm using the same example that was used in Document code: U9657A US (Print Production Order Documents). According to this document I created 3 subreports and it worked fine with their view. The problem is the main report. The document says:<br />
&quot;Add these components to the report: • Header • Footer • Tablix&quot; - when I'm trying to create tablix it is asking to define Dataset. But there is no dataset for the main report. When I'm pressing the &quot;Cancel&quot; button the new emty table is created and I continue with adding subreports to any first cell in every row. Totaly I have 3 subreports. At the end I'm getting the following error in the view tab:<br />
&quot;An error occured during local report processing.<br />
The definition of the report '/tisfc040801000_main' is invalid.<br />
The tablix &quot;Tablix1&quot; in the report body but the report has no dataset. Data regions are not allowed in reports without datasets.&quot;<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">6th December 2011, 12:16</div></div><div class="posttext">If you print the order documents to a designer device you will get also a ier_&lt;user&gt;_tisfc040801000_main.xml. The query in the report should be tisfc040801000_main. In that case you will get a small dataset with a few fields that is a kind of TOC for the complete report.<br />
But if you install solution 1055781 you would get the standard production order reports and you can modify those if you want, rather than starting from scratch.</div></div><hr />

The latest solution (1051476) is downloaded today and installed on client where I am trying to create the reports. No changes. The additional file image still appears as unfound image.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">8th December 2011, 09:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things to check:<br />
- Did you restart BIDS after installing latest plugin?<br />
- Are you sure you login to the correct package combination?</div></div><hr />

If your user data contains another package combination (and you don't want to change that), you can set the PACKAGE_COMB in the command parameter of the Connection String.<br />
You can also activate some logging to see what is happening. In C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies (or similar) you can find log4net.config. If you set the level to Info, you will find the logging in the ..\Logfiles directory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st June 2012, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably there is no SSRS report design for report tibom141001000 present in the dictionary. You can check that in session ttadv3530m000. Is column SSRS checked for this report?<br />
So, you can only export the designs that are already present. Infor delivered a number of SSRS report designs, see KB http://www.inforxtreme.com/espublic//EN/AnswerLinkDotNet/Solutions/ViewSolution.aspx?SolutionID=22947060 which report designs are available for SSRS.<br />
You can also design your own SSRS report designs. See KB http://www.inforxtreme.com/espublic//EN/AnswerLinkDotNet/Solutions/ViewSolution.aspx?SolutionID=22944939 for the development guide.</div></div><hr />
