<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francis</div><div class="date">21st April 2018, 03:45</div></div><div class="posttext">First time that I come across this type of print expression and print condition for a report field. The print expression is for determining and printing the percentage result of the 2 aggregations (total), whereas the print condition is the aggregation of one of the 2 columns. The 'total' seems to me is a Baan internal variable as it is used in here but not declared anywhere in the report. The number after &quot; total..&quot; seems to be using to address the aggregation of the specific column.</div></div><hr />

i'll try to explain :<br />
<br />
Your example says ;<br />
use field total..20 / total..19 * 100 only when total..19 is not zero.<br />
<br />
The total.. fields are maintained in order of using the aggregate function TOTAL in a report field.<br />
The total.. fields must not be in order of reportfields.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Report with 3 after.. layouts.<br />
In 1st layout you use the aggregate function on 1st and 5th field, so totall..1 and total..2 ist used. After this you set the aggregate on 3rd field in this layout, total..3 is used.<br />
<br />
