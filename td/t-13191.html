<br />
We are wanting to receive some basic training in Baan 5.0 tools development (eg amending forms, new reports, program scripts, generating new sessions, SQLs, understanding VRCs, etc).<br />
<br />
Ideally we want to go on the introductory course run by Baan, but as we only have 1 member of staff needing to attend this is not enough to justify Baan running the course. <br />
<br />
Is there anyone else in the UK who would like to attend this course - even if there was only 3 or 4 people this would probably be enough to get Baan to run the course ?</div></div><hr />
