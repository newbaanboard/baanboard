<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">25th February 2004, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">You could probably write a 3GL program and activate that object in the &quot;after.field&quot; or &quot;after.input&quot; of the Device selection.<br />
Once you know which company you are in, you can change that path accordingly in the ttaad300 table (presuming you are on BaanIV &amp; &quot;tt&quot; tables have not changed in BaanV).<br />
Once the printing is done, you can change it back.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

If not that device name field, you can call it in the Device path field itself.<br />

Actually I didnt get the part where u mentioned that it is possible to make changes at form level of the device selection.<br />
<br />
As of now I have found a solution wherein I have written a 3GL program and called it in place of ttstpconv..At the end of the 3 GL program I have written a shell which calls the object of ttstpconv which takes in parameters as the input file (which is the tmp file generated ) and the output file(which is the filename where the company parameter can be included)<br />
<br />
If the solution u have given is simpler than this do let me know<br />
