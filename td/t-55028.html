you need to copy it to your package vrc. Then you must be able to compile it(you can not modify/compile programs on standard vrc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th February 2009, 05:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually you need to own source code.  On some of our issues we just ask Infor for a debug object - they provide and we run it.</div></div><hr />

Infor has eliminated that option with new SP upgrade....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apurv_iitr</div><div class="date">12th February 2009, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, I wanted to know if there is a method without contacting Infor we can compile the script... you know some kind of cheat code or something....:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th February 2009, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand, but even if there is something like that then I would not want it posted on the board.  Nothing that might jeopardize the board.   If something like that was posted I would have to delete it. Infor has worked with us in the past for critical issues that needed to be resolved and that is why I make this recommendation.<br />

One thing I have done(just to check what happens) is to use qkey to wrap session code.  Then put it in debug to step thru what steps might occur - you can't see the code or debug it very well, but it has helped me understand the steps(or events) a session might go thru.</div></div><hr />
