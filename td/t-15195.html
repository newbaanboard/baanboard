<br />
Well, I have a form type 3 session.<br />
The user wants to select certain rows and update certain information of the selected rows to a table.<br />
<br />
I achived this by using<br />
<br />
choice.cont.process:<br />
on.choice:<br />
             for i = 1 to filled.occ<br />
                  do.occ(i,insert.table)<br />
             endfor<br />
<br />
it inserted records..... But if the user chooses the down arrow key the previous occurances are vanished.... How do I solve this problem????<br />
<br />
Also If I try to sue arrays.... say for example... the user choosesfirst 5 records and scrolls to the end of the screen ... toand chooses another 5 records... and now I decide not to choose the first 5 records.... whats happenning is it retains the last the ones that are unchked  but the data is lost. If I choose 10 and  say I change my mimnd before hitting the cont button to go back... and cancel one of them... it stores... 5 records instead of 10 how do I solve.. anyone pls help</div></div><hr />

<br />
in such cases and exactly for the reasons you mentionend I use a temporary table. This table then has all the fields of the main index on the table you want  plus one extra field with tcyesno domain. <br />
<br />
I then generate a maintain session for this temporary table where the user can do his/her selection using the tcyesno field. I can also display other fileds of the real table in the session so that the user does not have to notice anything amiss.<br />
<br />
When the user then makes a choice or presses a Button then I go thru the table and process all the records with the tcyesno field set to yes. <br />
<br />
This is not as complicated as it sounds and works always like a charm :) <br />
<br />
[PS: you could if you wanted add this extra field to the main table but some people don't like the idea of changing standard baan tables :rolleyes: ]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanuser2003</div><div class="date">30th April 2004, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I tired using the temporary table concept. It does not work...<br />
<br />
Well, it has to be done on the choice.mark.occur .....<br />
<br />
Its like the user will open up the display session.... he will see all the records...<br />
<br />
then presses the CTRL KEY AND Highlights... one after the other...<br />
<br />
all these can be captured....using mark.occur ... but since the filled.occ has the value of 11 ... its very confusing and cumbersome... Hope u understand my problem....</div></div><hr />
