<br />
I created a new print session:<br />
session type: print<br />
form type: 1(single-occ + main)<br />
st. command.set: P40 (standard print sessions)<br />
<br />
The session is under package td. The users linked to a role that has authorisation level print/display for package td (there is no lower authorisation system for modules or sessions; package is the deepest level), cannot enter data in the selection fields of the form!!! Only when they have full authorisation, or at least insert/update, then they can insert data to be printed!!! So I assume by mistake I somewhere have a setting on the session/form that makes it be considered to Baan as an update session and not a print session... but where? How do I correct this??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Refer to the link - Authorisation group of form command? (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8511&amp;highlight=authorization) <br />
<br />
You would still need atleast Insert/Modify authorization for the session level in the role for the user to enter the input values on the form fields.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your responde. I think however you misunderstood the issue. The problem was not a form-command problem, yet that when the session was called - even directly - the selection fields are greyed out.<br />
<br />
Why is it not enough to have print/display authorization for printing a report?? Does it maybe have to do with the save.defaults() and get.screen.defaults() that are being used..?? That because the defaults have to be stored in ttadv990 they cannot run it?? <br />
<br />
I noticed that when the table authorizations are set to 'read' only, the fields will not be greyed out, yet input will not be recognized. When filling in a field, and then hitting the 'tab', the cursor moves to the 'continue' button, instead of to the next field. When giving full authorization, it works fine.<br />
<br />
Will anyone shed some light on this for me please?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />

I checked the table authorizations issue. I gave full authorizations to company 000 and read authorization for the other companies, expecting it to work, but it didn't. When I do the other way around, i.e. read only for 000 and full for other companie, then it works fine. <br />
<br />
So the conclusion is that I don't need authorization for the tools company, yet for the others. Then my theory that this could be due to writing the ttadv990 records is incorrect...<br />

??????????????</div></div><hr />

I understood the issue now.  When you are using a session which is does not belong to tools, then you would be using it in a company which is not 000. So you would atleast need read authorization for the tools table ttadv990 in company-000. Hence, you would need more than read authorization, to change any input fields values in the session executing in that non-zero company.<br />
If the save and restore window defaults is turned on in the user data you would need the write authorization to the tools table.</div></div><hr />
