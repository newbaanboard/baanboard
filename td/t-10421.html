<br />
You should not have a problem in general to send emails using the command you gave. Some email systems do not like the UU encoding since it is not the same like Mime encoding which should be okay with all email systems. <br />
<br />
You may want to look at using mime encoding. More about this subject has been discussed at this thread:<br />
