What is the max number of caracter we can put on a line of the report ?<br />
We've tried to put more a Page width &gt; 256; Baan  send an error message if we try to put 300 for example.<br />
We want to see the result on the screen, not in a file.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The limit is 255.  I usually use mutliple detail layouts for those that are greater than 255.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">The only alternative I found was to use the spool functions -<br />
<br />
<br />
string	temp(257)<br />
temp = string.set$(&quot;x&quot;, 257)<br />
temp(256;1) = &quot;y&quot;<br />
if spool.open(&quot;&quot;,&quot;D&quot;, 0) then<br />
	spool.pr.line = temp<br />
	spool.line()<br />
	spool.close()<br />
endif<br />
<br />
<br />
But we loose the options which reports provide - sort, conditional printing, header, footer etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">No, or you can also redirect to other device options like - notepad, word etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 22:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Darn! Forgot about that.  When I use spool commands it is almost always for Excel reports and that would certainly qualify as a display device. :)<br />

<br />
I need developpe one session that allow to print to a text file but the witdh of the text file must be greater than 255, I mean, lines in text file have a witdh greater than 255 and is necessary to show completely the line.<br />
<br />
I don't know if is possible to do something in report layout in order to allow more fields for text line.<br />
<br />
I prefer don't work with seq file functions...<br />
<br />
Best regards and thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th December 2004, 00:29</div></div><div class="posttext">As stated above the only other option is the spool functions like NPR suggested.  I do not know of any method that will extend a report layout.  Depending on what you are attempting to put in the file and how you want this file.  Then mutliple detail layouts may work.  Is there something specific you are looking for?Others may have different solutions.<br />
<br />
Also please do not post duplicate threads.  I will delete the other thread.<br />

<br />
I need a function that allow one way to extend layout report and by example, in two or more lines of layout can view in text file only one line... <br />
<br />
Sorry for post twice the same thread...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">10th December 2004, 02:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I do it by using one layout with multiple lines but make the last line of the script a backslash &quot;\&quot;.  The report is then parsed through a script to merge all lines ending with a backslash into one line.  This works great for exporting to Excel, but I don't think it will help if you're wanting to display it to screen within ttstpdisplay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanfans</div><div class="date">10th December 2004, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
This way is very useful for me, but I don't understand very well:<br />
<br />
&quot;but make the last line of the script a backslash &quot;\&quot; <br />
<br />
I remember that in the last position of the line must be one character ... but I tried with backslash and it doesn't work, is for Baan V.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">10th December 2004, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">There's nothing in standard Baan that will join two lines ending with a backslash, you need to write a custom script to join them as part of the post-processing script once the report has been run.</div></div><hr />
