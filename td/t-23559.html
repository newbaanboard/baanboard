If you are sending the names to a report you can do the formatting there.  Or if you are using this in a script you could just do something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
     name = strip$(lname) &amp; &quot;, &quot; &amp; fname<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not sure you can do it in the query itself, but I have been wrong before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don want create any session.</div></div><hr />

but<br />
<br />
tjbyfield i don understand what you were trying to say.<br />
<br />
By the way i am having limitation accessing to oracle Database directly. :mad: <br />
So i only have Baan as a medium to access to database ... :eek: <br />
how can i make life simpler?  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">30th March 2005, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) tjbyfield i don understand what you were trying to say.<br />

<br />
(1) I thought I said what I had to say very clearly but I will use different prose if that helps.  I suggested that you could look to use the Baan provided SQL Query which would require only a little more effort to use than using qptool. Within the SQL query you could make a report that could present the data in many different layouts. <br />
<br />
(2) If you have a problem accessing Oracle directly I presume you are referring to accessing the baan oracle DB. Thats okay, you should have no need for that if you use SQL Query or qptool.<br />
<br />
(3) The general suggestion to make life easier is to use baan in the maner that it is intended to be used and not try to take short cuts or try to make it behave differently to the way it is set up. Baan is a wonderful product that has enormous functionality and flexibilty and is configured by means of parameters. Most A class implementations require little or no work outside the provided baan code. <br />

Hi terry<br />
<br />
1. sorry but am still new to baan so do u mean using easy sql?? <br />
2. i tot that u are refering me to accessing the db instead of using qptool<br />
3. thank u</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">31st March 2005, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Suwens<br />
<br />
Baan has a very good query tool (SQL Query) that is normally in the tools section of a super user menu. It is very easy to use and accesses the baan data dictionary so that you can see descriptive field names and table names and you do not nned to know much if any thing about sql unless you want to fiddle with the generated sql code.<br />
<br />
qptool is not at all friendly and requires knowledge of baan sql systax and unix.   I assummed that if you had access to qptool you would have access to SQL query.<br />
<br />
Hope this explains a bit better<br />
