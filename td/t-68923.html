<br />
i created query to print list of lot no. that have same first 9 digit with lot no that link with certificate no. entered by user.<br />
User will insert certificate no. in query form.<br />
In report, system is required to print out any lot no. and item that have same first 9 digit lot no.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
user insert Certificate no: B-11<br />
then in system, the cert no. link to lot no. 2312-0516-001<br />
so system will print;<br />
2312-0516-005<br />
2312-0516-010<br />
2312-0516-011<br />
<br />
i hv put a script in the report, but not print at all.<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
<br />
extern domain tcmcs.st10m a<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
a = whltc100.clot (1;9)<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	if whltc100.clot (1;9) = a then<br />
	lattr.print = true<br />
	else<br />
	lattr.print = false<br />
	endif</div></div><hr />

Are 1-9 really equal - I have seen people confuse a 0 and upper case o when typing.  I also notice that a is length of 10 - maybe just make it 9.  Nothing else really jumped out at me when reading this.</div></div><hr />

e.g tcmcs.str9<br />

change if statement to<br />

<br />
however, i would like to have report that will print all lot no. that have same 9first digit with lot no. that link to certificate no.<br />
<br />
i'm not sure if i need to assign the variable at query or at report.<br />
do you have any idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st June 2016, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You should be able to do it either way.  You can assign the value in the session for the first 9 and pass it to the report or assign it in the script.  Both ways should work.  If you did it in the session script you could actually use the layout print expression to test the value or use it in the report script.  I have done it several ways to filter data into a report.<br />
<br />
In your case I would put it in debug mode and check what the variable &quot;a&quot; was being set to when the report first runs.  Also run the report at least twice consecutively to make sure &quot;a&quot; gets set to a new value.  Then step thru and make sure the if statement is also working.  If you know some lots are not being printed run them one at a time to see why.  I think the method you selected is fine you just need to step thru it a few times to see where the issue might be - data or coding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm now trying the other way around.<br />
In Query user will insert certificate number.<br />
<br />
select<br />
       whltc100.cert,         | Certificate Number<br />
       whltc100.clot,         | Lot<br />
       whltc100.item,         | Item<br />
       whltc100.orno,         | Order<br />
       whltc100.ldat          | Lot Date<br />
from<br />
       whinr110,              | Inventory Transactions by Item and Warehouse<br />
       whltc100               | Lots<br />
where<br />
       whltc100.cert &gt;= whltc100.cert.f and<br />
       whltc100.cert &lt;= whltc100.cert.t<br />
<br />
<br />
In report, sys will print all lot no that have same first 9digit with lot no that link to the certificate no.<br />
below is the report script.<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
<br />
table twhltc100<br />
<br />
extern domain tcclot 		whinr110.clot<br />
       domain tcclot		whltc100.clot<br />
       domain tcclot		lot.no<br />
       domain tcmcs.st10m	lot.ref<br />
<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
lot.ref = whltc100.clot(1;9)<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
select whinr110.*<br />
	from whinr110<br />
	where whinr110.clot(1;9) = lot.ref       |whltc100.clot(1;9)<br />
selectdo<br />
	lot.no=whinr110.clot<br />
selectempty<br />
	lot.no=&quot;&quot;<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
but i got error unknown column &quot;lot.ref&quot;<br />
<br />
may i know where is my mistake?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juergen</div><div class="date">3rd June 2016, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">please use<br />
where whinr110.clot(1;9) = :lot.ref</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">3rd June 2016, 11:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
It might fail as well.<br />
<br />
You might try using<br />
<br />
where whinr110.clot(1;9) = {:lot.ref(1;9)}<br />
<br />
But, it might fail as well. Looking at you code, it seems you are trying to print all the lots from table whinr110. But, your code will just read the records and will print only one lot. You will need to call layout.again() or r.s.after.detail.1 (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=27794)() in order to print all the lots which related to the certificate number coming from whltc100.<br />
<br />
Also, you will need to use a sorted field i.e. before.field layout on your report to avoid printing duplicate lots.<br />
<br />
Instead, what you can do is, simly put your whinr110 and whltc100 in your main query and print both certificate number and lot number on your report.<br />
<br />
User can sort the data as per their requirement on excel.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
select<br />
       whltc100.cert,         | Certificate Number<br />
       whinr110.clot,         | Lot<br />
       whltc100.item,         | Item<br />
       whltc100.orno,         | Order<br />
       whltc100.ldat          | Lot Date<br />
from<br />
       whinr110,              | Inventory Transactions by Item and Warehouse<br />
       whltc100               | Lots<br />
where<br />
       whinr110.clot &gt;= whinr110.clot.f and<br />
       whinr110.clot &lt;= whinr110.clot.t and<br />
       whinr110.clot refers to whltc100<br />
       whltc100.cert &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pegaga1979</div><div class="date">6th June 2016, 08:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Bhushan,<br />
<br />
At first, i hv tried to persuade my users to sort out from Excel and just download from query the lot and cert no.<br />
But they rejected and would like to have a simplest method to track the lot no based on cert no.<br />
<br />
So that's the reason i hv to create this query :(</div></div><hr />
