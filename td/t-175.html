<br />
I have come across an irritating problem and I'm not sure how to get past it.   I have a new session which is a Maintain session, with a single record per screen.  The last fields are fields which are calculated automatically in the program, but these may be overwritten but the user.  <br />
<br />
Every thing works fine when you insert a record for the first time.  However, on the second insert the calulated field values are defaulted into the new record from the previous one, and no matter how I initialize these fields I cannot get rid of this.<br />
<br />
Any bright ideas will be greatly appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you give more details ?<br />
Fields witch are calculated are declared with simbolic names (program variables) or as table fields (eg. tiitm001.item) ?<br />
In what program section are you initializing these fields?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">15th September 2001, 00:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan has reverted to a previous GUI standard that was in their early versions. Everytime someone complains, an unexperienced Baan Developer takes it out, then it is caught, and put back in. To shut off the previous value option, select &quot;Default&quot; on the form for the field and do not put in a value. This will either use the value from the program script or place a blank/zero in the field. This is the way it was designed so that you do not need to have source to customize the default.<br />
<br />
The way it works is if you have a blank/zero value from your programs script, the standard script replaces it with a previous value, unless you have overriden it on the form. The form does the same test, if the value comming into the form is blank or zero, put in the default value from the form. In our case blank or zero.</div></div><hr />
