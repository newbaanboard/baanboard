<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steveauckly</div><div class="date">1st May 2009, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a device set up as a &quot;Rewrite File&quot; device type in both our test and production systems.  It is working as expected in production.  In our test system, no matter what you put in the output path, the report does not go to the folder specified.  Instead, it goes to the Baan Temp directory.  Yes, the folder we are trying to write to exists and the user has security to write to it.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Can you put it in debug mode run through the report to see what happens?  Do you get any log messages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steveauckly</div><div class="date">4th May 2009, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Mark, we have a few Solution Packs in test that we haven't put in production yet.<br />

I found the solution to this problem, solution #218333.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steveauckly</div><div class="date">4th May 2009, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently solution 218333 is a part of Service Pack 23 which we installed.  The problem is, when you install Service Pack 24, 25, and 26, the problem comes back.  I opened a case with Infor, and they confirmed it as a defect because it is happening on their system too.  I will update this again when they fix it.</div></div><hr />
