The easiest solution I can think of is to copy the layout that you want to repeat to a new layput position. Say 40. Give it a Output Expression so that the repeated layout will print as per your requirements. <br />
<br />
I am not sure if this helps. But this was the approach that struck me as soon as I read ur prob. description.<br />
<br />
If this is not what you were looking for then kindly explain ur scenario in detail may be with an example or a screen shot. I will see if I can help you out.</div></div><hr />

My problem is that I need to print it in a different position, problaby 20 rows later..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th November 2007, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Your going to need to provide more details of exactly what you are trying to do.  Are you saying you need to print 20 lines of detail data and then 20 lines of copied data?  How about a sample layout of what the data contains and how you want the layouts to work?  See this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=44054) to see if it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danielv</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to format the check report from session tfcmg1260s000. The check format has 3 parts. Top part is the invoice details, second part (middle) need it to be a copy of those invoice details. Third part is the actual check.<br />
The Check Layout (US) currently only prints 2 parts (invoice details and check).<br />
<br />
My issue is to figure out how to print the detail again on the second part.<br />
<br />
I'm attaching a copy of the check format..<br />

Thanks for all your help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlluRajasekhar</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 09:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Your attachment gave us proper insight to the problem. Please try out the following...<br />
<br />
As per the attachment I am assuming that you will have three layouts.<br />
1. Actual Invoive detail [detail 10]<br />
2. Copy of the actual invoice detail [detail 20]<br />
3. Check detail [detail 30]<br />
<br />
I am sure you would know when the program is done with the printing of actual invoice details. Once it does call a another function to repeat the same databse read. Then control the printing of actual and copy layouts printing by using boolean variables. <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
For layout 10 use variable &quot;actual = true&quot; in Output expression<br />
For layout 20 use variable &quot;copy = true&quot; in output expression<br />
<br />
While the program reads actual invoice the variable actual will be set to true and copy will be set to false. And when the program reads invoices again then the variable actual should be set to false and copy to true. This way you will get Actual Invoice details first followed by a copy of actual invoice details.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">2nd December 2007, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Another idea: You could use a group inside the report for printing the details twice.<br />
<br />
A (short) example in pseudo-code (its easier then writing it in words).<br />
<br />
Program script:<br />
<br />
	extern	domain	tcsrnb		group.var<br />
	extern	domain	tcbool		print.detail.30<br />
<br />
	...<br />
	print.detail.30 = TRUE<br />
<br />
	...<br />
	<br />
	selectdo<br />
		...<br />
		<br />
		group.var = 1<br />
		brp.ready(brp.id)<br />
		<br />
		group.var = 2<br />
		brp.ready(brp.id)<br />
		<br />
		if  print.detail.30<br />
		then<br />
			goup.var = 3<br />
			brp.ready(brp.id)<br />
			| Print the check layout only once<br />
			print.detail.30 = FALSE<br />
		endif<br />
<br />
		...<br />
	endselect<br />
	<br />
	...<br />
<br />
In the report use group.var as an ascending sort criteria and put your detail lines inside the group. If you have less invoice positions then you have to fill up the missing lines with an empty layout (i.e. data in detail.10, an empty layout as detail.20 with a corresponding print condition. detail.30 would be your check).<br />
Not a complete solution, but maybe an idea.<br />
