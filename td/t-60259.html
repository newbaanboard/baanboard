<br />
I am very new to the Baan world. Currently we are developing LN reports on ERP LN 6.1 FP6. We have 2 environments being setup namely development and production.<br />
<br />
The issue is here. We had developed invoice report that printed on pre-printed format and everything are fine and tested properly which include printing on pre-printed form on a dot-matrix printer.<br />
<br />
However, when we deployed the report onto the production environment. When we test print it or even show on display, the report page break seem to be wrong and misaligned. Furthermore, there is a line being added after the after fields layout and before the footer layout. All this does not happen when we re-test it on development environment.<br />
<br />
So please kindly enlighthen me where exactly had gone wrong? Could it be the system configuration or the report layout had gone wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for all the advices and guidances.</div></div><hr />

You will need to wait for someone who works in LN.</div></div><hr />

When you said printer setups, do you mean device data or are you referring to something else? Apologise for my ignorant as I am very new to Baan/LN.<br />
Looking forward to other experts advices. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which are the device settings at OS, by the way we are using HP-UX that you are referring to?<br />
<br />
I had compared and check the LN device data settings and paper settings at LN.<br />
<br />
Yes, I used PMC to transfer my development from development environment to production.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
device setting at OS:<br />
1.<br />
Check &quot;$BSE/lib/printinf/....&quot; if devicescript is the same on both systems<br />
2.<br />
Check if &quot;/var/spool/lp/interface/...&quot; modelscripts are identical.<br />
<br />
