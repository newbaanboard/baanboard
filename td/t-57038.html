  <br />
I am working in a LN Partner.  <br />
  <br />
We have a new customer that actually they work with Bipcs, they want to take LN how their ERP; but They have a special requirement, actually they have several satellite systems that It update the BD directly; that is, They know the update sequence of their ERP; they need with LN does it the same.... my question is:  <br />
  <br />
Which considerations should we take into account in this project?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
the question is what functional updates are triggered from the outside. Do they create orders or do they update stock information .....................<br />
Once these requirements are clear, you can do the same operation manually on the LN system. But being clever, you started the bshell with appropriate debug options (on DB level) turned on ... then you can monitor which operations on DB level are taken.<br />
This is the really tricky bit, as one mustn't forget to test out all possible variants, but the data currently processed should give you clues which variants are used nowadays.<br />
The last step is to write a little proggy that will create and process the necessary sql-satements from the data that has been sent from the subsystems - somehow this is done today as well, isn't it?<br />
<br />
They know the update sequence of their ERP<br />
<br />
But a very important question should be whether it really makes sense to rebuild the old scenario exactly as it was. Try to loosen the focus a bit and watch out whether there are different solutions available, too.<br />
