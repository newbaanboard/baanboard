<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">searocket</div><div class="date">3rd November 2015, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an exchange condition to update the tracking reference in shipments.<br />
Our source file has the barcode box  reference number and the tracking reference.<br />
We can look up the shipment number from the barcode table brpac903<br />
This is working fine as long as there is only one shipment, but there are often multiple shipments and only the first shipment gets updated.<br />
This is our conditions script - could anyone suggest how we should write this to return all the shipment numbers?<br />
thanks<br />
bob<br />
<br />
shpm is the ascii file field name that has the box reference<br />
brpac903.shpm is the whinh430 shipment number<br />
brpac903.shln is the whin430 shipment line number<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
table tbrpac903<br />
select 	brpac903.*<br />
from	        brpac903<br />
where	brpac903.boxn = :shpm<br />
and          brpac903.ptyp = 2<br />
<br />
selectdo<br />
	return(brpac903.shpm)<br />
endselect<br />
<br />

TNT tracking reference<br />
Barcode/Bridgelogix Box reference <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th November 2015, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Well what I was thinking was if you load it like in a batch job or something - you could take the input flat file and add the line number into it.  Then process it through the exchange scheme.  Honestly I do not know enough about exchange schemes.  I have only done simple ones and nothing too complex.  Maybe someone else will see this and have another better suggestion.</div></div><hr />
