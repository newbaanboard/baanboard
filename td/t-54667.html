I have a seesion that opens a sub session. The sub session opens the Sales Order Lines, filtering them by Item Group passed by the main session. If the main session is open by two different users and call the sub session for two different Item Groups. These two sub sessions present completly different set of records but, when one of the two users start updating any Sales Order Line, the other user when he/she tries to click in any field gets a message &quot;Lines are being updated by other user&quot; .<br />
<br />
Do you know why is this happening?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you know why is this happening?[<br />
<br />
Is this is a customised session ?<br />
If it is a customised session , what i doubt is an application lock is set on the subsession , irrespective of what record is selected .<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">7th January 2009, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you are right it was an application lock. Also it is a customized session, where I was missing to read a table before modifying a record.<br />

Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">almira</div><div class="date">18th February 2009, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We have the same problem but ours is not a customized session.. i'm processing a Purchase Order or Sales Order and suddenly that message appears &quot;Lines are being updated by Other User&quot;.. I  was suprised of the message since i'm in the process of entering the data when that message appear.Why is that happening although i'm the only one using the order? There are times also that order is not in the session of application lock to unlock the application. <br />
<br />
Btw, I have noticed it once we reached 95% to 100% of the total user license. Is there any problem with that? We have lot of users asking why those things happen which we cant explain. Pls. help.<br />
<br />
Thanks. :)<br />
