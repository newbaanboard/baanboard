is there a way to switch to a different user before running a session?<br />
i'm trying to create a process where a few sessions will run in the background.  Problem is some users does not have the right to run the sessions.  i do not want to give them access because they could run it manually (do not want that).<br />
i want to call the session by using a different login (like bsp).<br />
<br />
doable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th December 2021, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We looked at this about 20 years ago and could not find a way to switch users, or to prevent DEM flow generation to keep from adding permissions for sessions that they were allowed to access.  Even though some of these sessions were not part of the DEM flow they could just use run program to access them directly.  So our work around was to remove run program - add our version of run program we developed.  The new run program basically made sure it was part of their DEM flows before they could run it.  <br />
<br />
This worked out good when we got into creating a lot of function servers.  So for example they might be able to run our AFS code for receipts, or complete production orders, etc - but they could not run the baan standard sessions.  It was not an elegant solution but it worked for us.  One issue was when they re-gen'ed desktops the admins had to remember to add the other sessions the users needed.</div></div><hr />
