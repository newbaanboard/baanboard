<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camilla</div><div class="date">21st August 2012, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone,<br />
i have a problem with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) report design.<br />
 I did all the steps to create a new project in SQL Server Business Intelligence Development Studio. I checked the report with &quot;preview&quot; and everithing is ok. <br />
Then i used the LN configurator under tools to prepare the report to be deployed in LN. No errors found.<br />
I modified the Solution Explorer / Properties, as shown in document U9657<br />
I copied the file under:$BSE/application/tf&lt;vrc&gt;/btfgld<br />
Then i went in LN to see if the rport works. But the message is that thre is no report on report server. I didn't know how to set the field &quot;SSRS design present&quot; in &quot;Maintain reports&quot; session.<br />
How can i run a report using  SSRS? How can i &quot;import&quot; the report in LN ( i tried also to import it using ttrpi1200m000 even if i know that it's not necessary). <br />
Thanks in advance for your help<br />
best regards<br />
Camilla</div></div><hr />

This is something you should not do manually, but leave it to session ttrpi1200m100 (Import SSRS Designs). Then also the flag &quot;SSRS design present&quot; is set in &quot;Reports&quot;.<br />
Use session ttrpi1200m000 (Export SSRS Designs) to send the designs to your report server.<br />
<br />
Summarized the steps are:<br />
1. Develop the design in BIDS<br />
2. Prepare for Deployment<br />
3. Import with ttrpi1200m100 from client project folder<br />
4. Export with ttrpi1200m000 to report server<br />
5. Print the report to the MS Reporting Services device which has your report server as the -server argument.<br />
<br />
You can do an alternative route for step 3 and 4. Actually you don't need to have the report designs in the LN dictionary. This is only needed if you want to distribute the designs to other environments by means of a patch or PMC solutions. You can also deploy the report designs from BIDS directly to the report server. In the project properties in BIDS you need to define your report server and the target folder (the same folder you defined in ttrpi1500m000, but the placeholders like $pacc must of course be substituted by the real values). Then you can deploy from BIDS. After that you will be able to print the report from LN. Note that it may be necessary to restart the bshell in this case, because the result of the check whether a report exists on the report server is cached within the bshell.</div></div><hr />

i solved the problem!<br />
I imported the report from the project itself, selecting &quot;client&quot; in the session:<br />
ttrpi1200m100.<br />
After the import i was able to print the report using the printer MS_SSRS1<br />
Thanks in any case!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best way to start working on SSRS is to follow the standard documentation available on InforXtreme.<br />
<br />
U9656G US is the code. All the necessary steps are properly documented. In case of any issues, you can post on the board. Basically, you need to create a device in LN. When you print a report, select that device. It will generate an XML file which needs to imported in BIDS. When you connect LN with SSRS, all the generated reports will be viewed from SSRS and you can just select it and import it. Later, create the design for the same.</div></div><hr />
