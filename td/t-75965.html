<br />
I am new to working with Baan and Infor. I have a task to create calculated fields and insert them into report designer. <br />
The report was already done by someone else, I have just to insert new fields and redesign the layout.<br />
<br />
I created several calculated fields that I need to fetch the value from tdsls401 and assign it to my fields. I do have fields for: 'desc', 'item', 'number', but only the last value is getting printed in report designer when I Press 'preview'.<br />
Checked with debugger and it seems to be working good since I can see that it is starting from the first line and assigning the value to my field, but as a result I am getting only the last line.<br />
There should be 2 lines printed in the report, but only line 2 is printed.<br />
<br />
I tried to do with dataset but when tested with debugger it seems like it is not entering the dataset and the values are empty. Maybe you could also guide me through that as well.<br />
<br />
Just started with this few months ago, apologize if the question does not seem understandable.<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
I managed to fix. When I printed the original report and disabled report personalizations for user level, found out that the standard layout is getting printed only once, hence only the last data was printed.<br />
<br />
So I made a new layout which will print the dataset and inserted all the fields I want to be printed and it worked.<br />
<br />
There are some things that I still do not understand how they work, and Infor LN itself.</div></div><hr />
