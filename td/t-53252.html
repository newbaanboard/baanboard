Hi Friends,  <br />
  <br />
I am working with Baan Vc  <br />
  <br />
I have made a program that is converting a baan report to a postscript report and next this it converts in a PDF format. This I do it with ghostscript application, but I have a problem, because the work consists on also including the logo of the company, that is to say, I have a problem because I never call to BwPrint that is program in where I include the logo of the company when I work with the normal functionality.  <br />
  <br />
My question is:  <br />
  <br />
Exists any way to include the logo without I have to call BwPrint ? that is to say, I doing it by postscript format with ttstpconv....  <br />
  <br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

You can use open source itext (java) to place images or watermarks on the PDF at the conversion point.   We use it now to place reports on company letterhead. Do a search on itext on this forum.</div></div><hr />
