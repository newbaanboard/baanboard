<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">19th June 2003, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
This is probably a stupid question on my behalf but my brain is not functioning.<br />
<br />
I have two tables.  I am trying to link them via 2 fields to get another field off the table. ie <br />
<br />
select	whinh210.*, whinh302.*<br />
from	whinh210, whinh302<br />
where	whinh210.oorg = 2	<br />
and	whinh210.ardt &gt;= :rdate.f<br />
and	whinh210.ardt &lt;= :rdate.t<br />
and	whinh302._index1 = {whinh210.bpid, whinh210.orno}<br />
selectdo<br />
<br />
I need a field off the whinh302 table but if it does not exist then still print out the record anyway.  It keeps coming up with no data found, yet when I remove the whinh302 table I get data.  I guess this is because I am only allowing it to print if all conditions are met.  <br />
<br />
Would I use the &quot;refer to&quot; instead to work around this, or create a seperate select statement under the selectdo section?<br />
<br />
Sorry I should know this but am not thinking today.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">19th June 2003, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Try something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
select	whinh210.*, whinh302.*<br />
from	whinh210, whinh302<br />
where	whinh210._index1 = {2} <br />
and	whinh210.ardt &gt;= :rdate.f<br />
and	whinh210.ardt &lt;= :rdate.t<br />
and	{whinh210.bpid, whinh210.orno} refers to whinh302 unref clear<br />
selectdo<br />
<br />
<br />
Using &quot;refers to&quot; with &quot;unref clear&quot; allows the join to happen even if the reference does not exist.  In that case, the fields to the referenced table (whinh302) are filled with spaces or 0's as appropriate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If there is a reference between the tables, use it.  If not, you'll have to use a second select:<br />
<br />
<br />
select  whinh210.*<br />
where   whinh210._index1 = {2} <br />
and     whinh210.ardt &gt;= :rdate.f<br />
and     whinh210.ardt &lt;= :rdate.t<br />
selectdo<br />
           select  whinh302.*<br />
           where   whinh302._index1 = {whinh210.bpid, whinh210.orno}<br />
           selectdo<br />
           selectempty<br />
                 &lt;fill the print fields with blanks&gt;<br />
           endselect<br />
           &lt;print...&gt;<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
:( By the way, this style of SQL is bad for performance!  Rather replace &lt;table&gt;.* with &lt;table&gt;.&lt;field&gt;, &lt;table&gt;.&lt;field&gt;, etc...<br />

Maybe it improved over time. but I am used to seeing the statement result in poor performance.<br />
<br />
What you are trying to do is create a so called 'outer-joined' relationship between the two tables.<br />
Now I believe that there is some archaic method in Baan to actually accomplish this, but in your case there is a simpler solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
select    *<br />
from       whinh210<br />
where   whinh210._index1 = {2}<br />
selectdo<br />
    select     *<br />
    from        whin302<br />
    where     whinh302._index1 = {whatever}<br />
    selectdo<br />
         | print info from 302 table<br />
    selectempty<br />
         | print info from 210 table only<br />
    endselect<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
It may not be the most elegant code, but this way you stick to indexed queries and you'll keep your overhead low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as a general idea, isn't it possible to make the state of a thread known in the board's software?  So you can see whether somebody else is busy replying?<br />

Let's not forget that we all just post here on our self-proclaimed authority (kinda like consultants ;) ). <br />
I would never trust myself without a second opinion. Does anybody concur to that? :D</div></div><hr />

The only problem is that some users stay hidden and you can not see what they are doing.

I have to admit I have asked a lot more questions that provided answers, but my knowledge has increased through this board so hopefully soon I can contribute more.<br />

Above, you mention a possible method of performing an outer join... do you have any idea what it might be or where to point me?  I find that I use qptool6.1 frequently to perform nightly queries that get e-mailed to my staff.  Sometimes the 'refers to' w/unref clear is not possible due to lack of index.  I then end up having to send the results of one query to a file and then use that as imput to a second query and that is, well ... messy!<br />
<br />
Any pointers as to a direction for research would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
