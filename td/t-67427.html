Can I customize the screens with these fields from the dynamic form editor or should i customize the display only from the WEB interface<br />
<br />
<br />
You can add them on forms using DFE.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Creation of a secondary table, bound by the same key as the standard table and use specific features sec.add.table ...<br />
Is archiving takes into account these kind of  tables. How can i do otherwise ? What then is the impact in case of new feature pact installation.<br />
<br />
Handling secondary tables is a critical task. You need to take care that you have a DAL2 for the secondary table. Go for it only if you have standard source code (in case if you are looking to handle standard session) I do not think archiving will take care of standard tables. When a main table record is deleted related secondary table records are not automatically deleted by the 4GL-Engine. The DAL of the main table is responsible for cleanup of related secondary table records. <br />
<br />
<br />
Customization of screens:<br />
- What is it desirable to use  personalization features in web IU / LN UI or make changes to the dynamic form editor<br />
<br />
<br />
Personalization features and DFE are two different things with each having its own features. Not sure how to compare them. Offcourse end-users can use Personalization Feature but not DFE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Specfic developments:<br />
- Is it desirable to develop in the same package td, ti ... or create a specic package repeating the same module Coding?<br />
<br />
<br />
You can either have your own module code or you can have your own package. Development wise, having your own package is better. The directory structure is better with your own package. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Is it not make more sense to focus on DAL 2 for behavior management screen fields?<br />
<br />
<br />
With DAL and Extended DAL (DAL2) with UI Template, you can have a better control over your session fields.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Are there any standard functions for exporting to Excel ?<br />
<br />
Depends - If you want to export your form into excel, you have export to excel option. If you want to output your report to excel, you can create an Excel Device. You can create your own Device and code your own ttstpconv else you can programmatically create a csv file and open it with Excel on client. Search on board and you will find many threads.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Should we use API reither than use diorect call to library often used in scripts. What is the impact on performance ?<br />
<br />
 <br />
If on LN, you can use DAL for record insertions. API has issues sometimes with MMT Sessions. DLL's are faster if you understand a proper usage. Generally, you should prefer combination of DAL and DLL's and use API only if nothing else is possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
- What are the best solutions for use in the case of realization of inbound or outbound interfaces with third party applications: ION, Web services, files, exchange ...<br />
<br />
ION comes with a lot of value added features with ION Connect, BOD's, BDE's. If you are good with developing SOAP based webservices, LN has inbuilt functions to call Webmethods of the webservices. So, again depends on you. But comparably, ION gives wider range of functionalities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other:<br />
- Is it possible to activate SCM without  having a development license?<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess you will need a development license. SCM with Application Studio will need an additional license. Though not sure about this.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Does the launch of outdoor application Baan is always possible since the WEB UI and UI or LN, for example run Excel directly from a session<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, inbuilt function start.application.local() can launch outdoor applications on client machine.<br />
<br />
<br />
- How works the Workbench  sessions ? eg tssoc8351m000.<br />
<br />
Could you share with me your best practices.<br />
