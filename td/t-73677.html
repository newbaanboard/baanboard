<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertP</div><div class="date">12th January 2021, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello gurus,<br />
<br />
I'd like to know whether a predefined function exists which, simply, would return the VRC of the current active table definition.  <br />
<br />
For example:<br />
- a company has 20 package comb. and many VRCs.  <br />
- a table &quot;x&quot; is present in many levels.<br />
<br />
I don't want to evaluate each level via derivation structure.  Surely Baan/Infor LN doesn't do this every time a table is accessed?  <br />
<br />
So, in a perfect world, a predefined function might exist which returns  VRC of the current / active table.  Alternatively, could it be that the current/active table's VRC (CRDD) is declared in some tools table (e.g. Runtime Components)?  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know of any functions but I think the standard program &quot;Print Current Table Definitions for Package VRC (ttadv4421m000)&quot; does give you exactly the information you need. That is the actual Table defintion VRC for your Customer-VRC.<br />
<br />
Here for exampla I see that the Table definition for tdpur100 for my customer VRC 106C_0_dev1 comes from the standard VRC 106U_0_a000</div></div><hr />

Mark - vrc_search_table requires traversing the derivation structure - in order to finally find the correct (and current) tabeldef's VRC where I can then analyze the components) . In my case these are many.  To many in the structure.  All I want is the current, active table definition being used by the system (on which data is present in the database.   How could this be achieved?  I had in mind the exchange package. It generates asci file formats - based on current table def.  Any idea which function is called?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th January 2021, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure what exchange or anything else uses.  There could be another library in LN (or even 4c4) for that matter that would return the VRC. There were 3 or 4 VRC dll's but I did not see anything that would work.<br />
<br />
What I do know is that in 4c4 there is a data dictionary directory for the VRC the company is in.  This is built based off all the tables no matter which VRC is the home VRC for that table. I am not sure it is in any table in the system that says - hey here is the current VRC the table is in that this VRC uses.   I know I could read the dictionary file out on the file system to see what makes up the table. I can't imagine even with 20 VRC's it would like long to walk up the structure.  Actually with my code what I did not was eventually write the table name and VRC it was found in into a table.  I never found a use for it after that one flirt with VRCs and the tables.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - You have to analyze why do you need 20 levels of VRC, Package Combination, it is an overhead in process, disk, execution time, confusion in understanding the derivation structure etc.<br />
2 - The current versions of domains, tables are taken from the user's package combination setting, and you can refer to the dictionary of the tables from the $BSE/dict/dd&lt;package-combination&gt;/d&lt;package&gt;&lt;module&gt; directory and the files d&lt;tablename&gt; have the table definition.</div></div><hr />
