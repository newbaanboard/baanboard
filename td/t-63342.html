<br />
I'm currently working with Infor LN FP3.<br />
<br />
We are facing the start of a big project and we have the following problem:<br />
The process of shipping confirmation when it launches concurrently shows an error 201 controlled by the application, we have continued to debug mode program but the problem does not occur in this situation.<br />
<br />
The question is whether there are any log or trace statements I write the program or library through which the process and let see where I presented this message.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
If host is on Unix, check if you able to get log.bshell using session &quot;ttstperrlog&quot;<br />
Start this session from directly from browser (start session).<br />
This log should give you the program flow.<br />
<br />
If host is on Windows, you can check event viewer of host, but this log is not that in details as that of UNIX logging.<br />
<br />
Also you can put bshell in debug and get a tracefile. Search BB for the same.<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
