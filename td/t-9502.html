Specifically, user management.  The goal is to stop some super users from accessing this option.  Changing them to a normal user is not an option.  PLEASE HELP SOON:mad:</div></div><hr />

Can you please fill up your BaaN/OS/Database info ?<br />
<br />
Refer to the link about discussion on system security - Stop Shell (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1948&amp;highlight=boss) <br />
<br />
Unless its very much justified we dont give any SuperUser access to anyone beyond administrators and not even to the BaaN support account we have on our systems. Everyone has Role Authorization Templates including our Development Team. <br />
<br />
We have our enduser support group, who can create/delete/modify Users only Normal user but not Super users.<br />
<br />
I think it has to be justified why those users are SuperUsers and based on their requirements you can create role authorization templates which restricts their authorizations.<br />
<br />
Good Luck! :)</div></div><hr />
