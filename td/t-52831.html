<br />
I imported, by mistake, sessions (with forms, reports, and scripts) in wrong VRC (B61U-a-lvd).  I imported again the components in the right VRC (B61U-a-rom), but now I have to delete the components from first VRC (B61U-a-lvd). <br />
[B61U-a-lvd is derived from B61U-a-rom]<br />
<br />
In this machine I don't have the Development rights and I cannot access session ttadv3530m000 (Reports). In that case I deleted reports from tools tables ttadv330-ttadv337 with VRC B61U-a-lvd. <br />
When I'm printing one of those reports I still see the wrong version, imported first time in a wrong VRC, that means the that was not enough to clean the tables ttadv330-337.<br />
There is any way to clean the reports from the VRC B61U-a-lvd ???<br />
<br />
The same problem is for Scripts, I deleted from tools table ttadv230 scripts with VRC B61U-a-lvd. (Probably for scripts is enough this action.)<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance.<br />

<br />
The objects of the reports and scripts are always present (and still used by bshell), you have to remove them from $BSE/application directories.<br />
<br />
In particular:<br />
$BSE/application/PPB61U-a-lvd/oMMM (directories of the scripts object)and<br />
$BSE/application/PPB61U-a-lvd/oMMML (directories of the report object<br />
<br />
where PP is the package<br />
         MMM is the module<br />
         L is the language</div></div><hr />
