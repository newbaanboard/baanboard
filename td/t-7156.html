<br />
I have a session which opens a file and reads in the contents line by line and then goes on to work with each line in turn. No problems. However, as soon as we let this session run as a job I keep getting an error opening the file. The file name is read in from a seperate owner parameter table via a function call.<br />
<br />
Anybody have any ideas   ?<br />

Check the file access permissions of the job user on those files/directories.</div></div><hr />

well, the job is being run with user Admin. No permission problems there.<br />

Is there an error number for opening the file - maybe that will tell someone where the problem is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">15th October 2002, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">When a session runs as a job, not all program script sections are invoked. I had a similar problem once. Path and filename were determined in init.form section. In background mode that part of code was not invoked, so my function (present in choice.cont.proces ) tried to open a file with blank name and path, with no success of course. Maybe it is something like that in your case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">15th October 2002, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Gentlemen.  The path I chose was on the same server as the Baan application. <br />
<br />
I would like to dynamically build the file name, and have the following snippet.  <br />
<br />
                domain  tcmcs.str132    filename<br />
<br />
...........<br />
<br />
        cwd = getcwd()                        |LSS 021014 n<br />
        x = pos(cwd,&quot;\&quot;)                      |LSS 021014 n<br />
        dir = cwd(1;x) &amp; &quot;ship_data\&quot;         |LSS 021014 n<br />
|*  e:\shipdata\         is the result<br />
<br />
        secondstamp = secs.now()                        |LSS 021009 n returns hhmmss as long<br />
        filename = sprintf$(<br />
                                 &quot;%s%d_%D(%02y%02m%02d)_%06d.txt&quot;,<br />
                                  dir,suno.f,date.num(),secondstamp)<br />
<br />
secondstamp is the time as a long with value hhmmss <br />
<br />
When filename is opened manually (debug or manual run, it is fine. Directory permissions are r/w for everyone.<br />
jobdaemon is the other user .<br />
<br />
Any more Ideas please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">15th October 2002, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Try to determine, if filename during job contains what you expect. You may for instance open another file with constant name as a log and write filename variable into that file. Then you will see what is the filename without debug or manual run. I think, that your problem is not with permissions, but with filename itself, and filename you build is somehow different during job and during manual run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">15th October 2002, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">The files are being created in e:\baan\tmp<br />
<br />
The files should be created in e:\ship_data<br />
<br />
The file names are faultless. And I am also creating a static file name and it too is being created in the wrong directory.<br />

<br />
a big thank you to everybody for the tips and tricks ...<br />
<br />
My file open access problem has been solved. The job user did not have the correct directory access permissions.<br />
