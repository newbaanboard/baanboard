I have the following problem with reports:<br />
Suppose you have a report with a before.report, several before.field, some detail, some after.field and a footer layout. The before.field layouts should be printed on change of the sort field or if a page break is forced.<br />
Everything went perfect so far.<br />
Now in a special situation the printing of the before.field layout on top of a new page is suppressed and the following layouts are printed as if no page break is forced.<br />
This happens in the following Situation:<br />
When the detail layout which has to be printed before the before.field layout<br />
incorparates a text field as last field (last line in layout) and the last line of the text is the last line which can be printed on that particular page (as for defined page length in font by paper type), then the before.field layout on top of the following page is dropped.<br />
If i enter one more line to the text then every thing works fine. This additional line is printed after the before.field layouts on the new page.<br />
<br />
Has anyone encounterd the same behaviour so far?<br />
How should i work around that?<br />
<br />

<br />
I have resolved similar problems in Baan IV by adding a need line for layouts with text. I assume the same will also be the case in Baan V.</div></div><hr />
