It almost sounds like you want to send two sets of records - one for the headers and one for the details.  So with a better description I am sure someone can recommend a solution.</div></div><hr />

 I want to send two sets of records - one for the headers and one for the details,the count of the one for the headers is n,the count of the one for the details is only one,how can i print n page report</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th October 2007, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I do not understand completely yet.  But what you could do is declare all the fields you need for both types of records.  Then do two detail layouts (detail.1 and detail.2) Then for the output expression use something like k.of.data = 1 and k.of.data = 2.  In your program script just set k.of.data to 1 or 2 right before sending the records.  Since there will be mutliple records for what you are calling &quot;headers&quot; I do not think you can use a header layout(well probably could with a layout.again() statement, but I don't like that).  So two detail layouts each printing for the different type of records.  This is the type of logic Baan uses for printing BOM's.</div></div><hr />
