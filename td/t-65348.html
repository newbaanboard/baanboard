But is this a simple query in something like easy-sql or is it a session?  For easy sql what I have done is go into the report, create a script and just go look up information.  So for example if I wanted to know the last receipt on a item my easy sql would put item information only, then in the report go get the last receipt for the item.  This way the easy-sql did not link in a bunch of receipt records.<br />
<br />
If it is a session then a lot of options are open - from using the report, to just building in the session script what is needed to get the correct info.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for the reply.<br />
It is a simple query that we design from session ttadv3580m000. Im not good in designing a session :)<br />
can u guide me how i can create the script?<br />
because in report the design is as below:<br />
Item | Description | Receipt | Issue<br />
<br />
In column receipt and issue the field is whinr110.qstk. But i have put print condition such for Receipt: whinr110.kost  = tckost.receipt and for Issue: whinr110.kost  = tckost.issue</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you need all the records of whinr110(means if there are 5 issue lines and 5 receipt lines in whinr110 - then output of your report should consist of 10 lines<br />
If this is the case then you need not to give conditions because quantity either will print in issue or in receipt.<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
A single line for item and sum of their issue and receipts.<br />
For this case you should create a after.field layout for item and then gave aggregate function total for both quantity columns with condition which you have specified.<br />
<br />
Might be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Today i worked on a very similar issue for a customer. They have not defined whinr110.kost as report input field and that's why there was no value for this field available in the report and it was not printing data properly. After defining whinr110.kost as report input field report printed as expected.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.<br />
<br />
Other wise i don't see any reason why it will not print the report correctly.</div></div><hr />
