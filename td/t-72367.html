I want to apply a functionality for FIFO lot in Outbound Advice where a user is restricted from Selecting Lots . The Lots should appear automatically but expired and near expired lots say 30 days should not get selected.<br />
<br />
Any idea...</div></div><hr />

Not using UE scripts.  The user exit is only executed when a record is to be added, changed, or deleted in the database.  Any logic for selection, including handing of records read from the database, is done before the UE is executed.  You can check fields and disable the insert/update/delete of a lot and post a message, but not very user friendly.</div></div><hr />
