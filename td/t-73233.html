<br />
But if a 30 day interval will work to represent 'one month', then, then the following is possible without any programming: <br />
<br />
this is based on BAAN IVc3 but I believe they would not have done away with the feature in newer versions.<br />
<br />
This has to be done logged in as the BAAN User ID that will be executing the job, because the setting is user specific.<br />
<br />
In the From side of the date, enter a +0 instead of typing in the actual date. In the To side of the date, type +30 to represent 'one month'. (of course, the form will display today's date for the +0, and today + 30 date for the To side, but the session knows how the values are entered, and will save the 'formula' in the next step: Then in the menu bar of the session, select Options -&gt; Save Defaults. It will ask if you wish to save the difference between entered date  and System Date, as many times as there are date type fields on the form, even if only one or two of them have been changed, and each time answer 'Yes'. With this done, when the job starts on the first, the values will 1st in the From side and +30 days in the To side.<br />
<br />
(of course, if the job starts on the second then it will go from 2nd to 2nd plus 30)</div></div><hr />
