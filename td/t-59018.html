In all standard reports of ERPLn, the date is being printed as YYYY-MM-YY. How can we change the date format as DD-MM-YYYY in all reports. I hope it must be picking from some tools date format setting.<br />

<br />
I logged incident with Infor and Infor technical consultant guided to use session ttaad1510m000 (Software Languages). In this session we have to specify the sequence of each date part and do CRDD from specific menu, so that these settings are saved in datecurr file.<br />
<br />
Further to give effect for all users, it is required to do CRDD for all user profiles. This brings desired date format in all reports without any modification.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Our company is using LN6 with UNIX, and need your help.<br />
After setting using session ttaad1510m000 (Software Languages). In this session we specified the sequence of each date part and done Convert Run Data Dictionary (ttams2200m000) from specific menu at Maintain User.<br />
But the display for date format still fail to follow the date format Software Languages and also done setup the UNIX date format.<br />
<br />
Are there anyone successfully using LN6 with UNIX OS for the mentioned steps above (i.e without setting all pc clients' date format)?<br />
<br />
Please advise and thanks.<br />

First the one after you change the date format.  Then you have to crdd on the users profile.  Never done this myself - but did you do both CRDD's?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your prompt reply. Do you use LN6 with UNIX?<br />
In LN6, what is CRDD for user profile?<br />
Isn't the &quot;CRDD for user profile&quot; same as the &quot;Convert Changes to Runtime Data Dictionary (ttams2200m000) from specific menu at Maintain User&quot; (which was performed)?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how many are using LN6 with UNIX but successful do the above date format without setting it in every computer client. <br />
Hope those gurus or others can help me.<br />

I just know some sessions like this update some runtime data dictionaries.  Then there is CRDD - which creates run time files for the users profiles.  Again this is only what I know from the 4c4 side and ln could be completely different.  Just reading this thread made it sound like 2 CRDD needed to be completed - one to make the change.  Then another to make it active for the users.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for all your suggestions even though I had in fact done all the suggested method (I actually followed one suggested earlier in this thread which need to run the 2 CRDD before I posted here).<br />
<br />
Look like for LN6 UNIX OS, all pc windows clients need to be setup  through the windows regional date format.<br />
If anyone have solved it without setting it in all the pc clients, please let me know.<br />

<br />
session Software Languages where you initially set the date format also has Specific/convert to runtime DD option, which in fact crates new datecurr file.<br />
<br />
I just had the same problem today and succesfully solved it. Ijust edited format, then did above procedure on Software Languages session, logged out and logged in again. I didn't even CRDD users or profiles. It seems to me that the system reads datecurr file, which is currently on disk.<br />
<br />
VishalMistry already described procedure, it works on ERP LN FP6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brad997</div><div class="date">28th October 2011, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Justone<br />
<br />
Do you really solve it but is it on UNIX server or Microsoft Windows server?<br />
Also do your LN6 date format (what format date?) doesn't really follow your PC client windows regional date (what format date?) setting?<br />
In Session Software Language date format ,  I key-in Day,Week, Month, Year but what did you key-in? <br />
<br />
<br />
Currently in Baan4 running on UNIX is OK but in LN6 running on UNIX OS will the date problem.<br />
Mine are still same problem, I need setup to all pc windows clients through the windows regional date format.<br />
<br />
The datecurr file (both existing Baan4 &amp; LN6) showed similarly contains :<br />
D|0012|DMY|%02d-%02m-%02y|<br />
D|0022|DMY|%02d-%02m-%04Y|<br />
D|0032|DMY|%d-%h-%04Y|<br />
D|0042|DMY|%d-%h|<br />
D|0052|DMY|%02d/%02m/%02y|<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
The $BSE/lib for all users in (both existing Baan4 &amp; LN6) showed similarly contains following:<br />
imeam: am  <br />
timepm: pm  <br />
dateformat:DDMMYY<br />
<br />
But why Baan4 running on UNIX is OK but in LN6 running on UNIX OS will the date problem?<br />
<br />
Since you successful solved in UNIX OS, appeciate if you can please help me?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justone</div><div class="date">28th October 2011, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I had problem with fomat mm-dd-yyyy setting in english language since our local setting is dd.mm.yyyy.<br />
<br />
Despite local Windows settings (which is dd.mm.yyyy), worktop displayed dates in mm-dd-yyyy format.<br />
<br />
I did the change in attachment and converted it to runtime. <br />
<br />
But as I'm thinking further you might have a different problem, where you want your local PC's to behave like LN does. Mine was quite opposite, since I only sinchronized LN with existing local setting.<br />
<br />
What is you local PC (windows) setting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justone</div><div class="date">28th October 2011, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I was a bit misleading, I just checked once agian, and it looks like there is na influence on the report, but not on form. I changed format on test system back to mm-dd-yyyy and did convert to runtime.<br />
<br />
Attached is the influence on such setting on form and report. Obviously on fom level local (windows) setting is taken, but on report level unix setting is stronger (probably since report is created on server).<br />
<br />
So in fact it should work, at least on my server, report is taking datecurr setting and ignoring local windows setting. But I didn't check the behaviour of BW print</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brad997</div><div class="date">30th October 2011, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Justone<br />
<br />
Thanks for your 2 replies. <br />
In our local country, we use dd/mm/yyyy which is similar to yours.<br />
I'm more concern on the PO, SO, Production and Inventory display (i.e not concern on report).<br />
User may key-in wrongly in LN6 because 3/4/11 may means 3 April 2011 or 4 March 2011 depend on the local client PC setting.<br />
In Baan4, it is not a problem.<br />
<br />
You asked me what is my local(i.e client) PC (windows) setting?<br />
There is no one my setting but many local client PC setting depending on the user.<br />
We have many various for MANY local client PC(s) (windows) as it depends on whatever setting by users themselves.<br />
But in Baan4, it is not a problem as all the local client PCs follows the Baan4 systems whereby Session Software Language date format which key-in as Day,Week, Month, Year.<br />
Also in Baan4 HP-Unix server OS is setup for our country date format of dd/mm/yyyy.<br />
Outcome: OK as all the Purchase, Sales, Production Orders and Inventory dates are displayed as dd/mm/yyyy.<br />
<br />
<br />
But in LN6, which setup is exactly as Baan4 (including  Session Software Language date format  which key-in Day,Week, Month, Year).<br />
And even the LN6 HP-Unix server is setup for our country date format of dd/mm/yyyy.<br />
Outcome: FAIL as all the Purchase, Sales, Production Orders and Inventory dates are NOT displayed as dd/mm/yyyy.<br />
It display in many various date format which according to whatever the users' local(i.e client) PC (windows) setting.<br />
<br />
Based on your 2nd reply subject, &quot;one more detail&quot;. <br />
Correct me if I'm wrong that yours (for PO,SO,Production,Inventory &quot;display&quot; date) is actually not working (similarly to my condition)?<br />
<br />
If yours really work using UNIX OS for the LN6, I hope you can further help me by explaining more detail to me.<br />
(i.e all local client PCs to follow LN6 system, will display date dd/mm/yyyy in PO, SO, Production and Inventory date so that it can prevent user key-in error).<br />

<br />
I would like to pick up on this old thread as I am facing a similar challenge now. <br />
<br />
We would like to set up the date formats per country rather than per language which seems impossible in LN (FP7). <br />
<br />
Brad, or anyone else, were you able to find any solution for this?<br />
