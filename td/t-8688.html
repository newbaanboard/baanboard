<br />
I need some help from fellow baan expertise in this board. ^_^  I need to set up printing to a Dot Matrix printer via Unix.  I know that Baan only have 1 type01 driver for HPLaserJet 4 that can be use for any HP Laser Jet 4 or above.  <br />
<br />
I also already able to print via Baan to any printer via Windows BW print, so this is not my question.<br />
<br />
Here are my questions: ^_^<br />
1.   Anybody have any experience with printing dot matrix printer via Unix?  How did you obtain the drivers?  What kind of printers are you using?<br />
<br />
2.  Anybody have a list of good dot matrix printer to be used with Baan?<br />
<br />
3.  Anybody know how to make/create a type06 barcode driver (emulates) that can be used for any printer?<br />
<br />
 Our company have a DFX 5000+ which does not have a barcode font build into it, nor does it have barcode font to be added.   So I really need to know which one is it outthere that will be good for our company.<br />
<br />
Thank you all<br />

<br />
1. creating printer drivers for matrix printers is not that difficult but you need to have a programmers manual.<br />
2. check the printers documentation if it can emulate e.g. an epson printer for which Baan does provide drivers<br />
3. existing drivers can be found in $BSE/lib/printinf/&lt;first character&gt;/&lt;drivername&gt;<br />
4. More information can be found in the online tools help. <br />
<br />
I have never implemented barcode on a matrix printer. But will it much differ from a laserprinter?<br />
<br />
