I find that many times I have to click the previous record choice of the form to get to the record I want. Why does Baan work like this.</div></div><hr />

But, if there is more than one field in any index, and if you are searching for a record which occurs (in index) before the current record, on form, then it behaves the way you have described. Also, this will happen if search criteria is not completely defined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">5th February 2003, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">To expands on morpheus' last point, in order to ensure that you hit the right record, you need to fill all of the fields on the index in question.  Often what happens is that a user will fill the first couple of fields of the index and not fill nor blank-out/zero-out the other &quot;less interesting&quot; fields on the index.  The values used for these fields in the search are then the values of the record from which you started the search.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: fill in all of the fields, blank/zero those that are of no importance, or be prepare to possibly back up a record.<br />
<br />
I hope that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

I observed the same behavious as Ken did. Sometimes even if you filled up all the fields in search form, BaanERP still can't find it. One example would be whinh3520m000 Receipts. There are few other sessions that exhibits this anomaly, and if you're experienced with AFS you sure will know which sessions they are. If you're experiencing problem with &quot;find&quot; in AFS, pls look at AFS forum in this board for some workarounds<br />
