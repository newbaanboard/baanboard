THere exists a C interface for Baan. I am wondering if there exists a similar for Java. We don't have open world and we are on IVc3. I saw some java classes under one of the baan directory. I inquired with Baan support and they gave me a documentation of of how Baan classes interact. <br />
If any one could help me in figuring out- What is the process of making connection to Baan? How do we call a Baan DLL from a java program that will help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I see you are on the BaaN-4 series. <br />
<br />
I found this is valid for the BaaN-5 versions -<br />
<br />
Java VM integration - Baan Tools 3GL (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_javavm_overview) <br />
<br />
You might have to contact BaaN support for more information. I found this on our system -<br />

Thanks for your reply. I foud some example like calling Item data from an applet. But I was not sure of how to go about. And as  mentioned I don't have Open world. I am planning to implement some Inbound webservices like inquiring of item pricing, inventory order status etc. I am able to implement outbound webservices through a work around like calling a java program from Baan (by selling out), pass the value through ASCILL files and get back the response. It works even though may not be the best, but I have some webservies that I have implemented useing this.<br />

<br />
just an idea, you might consider to use the sockets/ports?<br />
<br />
Refer to -<br />
<br />
 communicating with Com port in Baan IV (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7179) <br />
<br />
sock.connect() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_interprocess_communication_cross_platform_sock_connect)</div></div><hr />

Thats sound intresting.<br />
Could you throw some more light? I went through the thread, but not able to follow.<br />
Say if I have Java program that I would like to call a Baan program (may be a DLL or may start a Bshell that can invoke a Baan program), how would I do this? The socket.connection() example assumes Baan wants to commiunicate with external application like a device attached. <br />
If somekind of mechanism works like calling a Baan dll using a socket connection then it will be really helpful.<br />
Thanks for yiur replies.<br />
