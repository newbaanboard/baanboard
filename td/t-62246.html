<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bender</div><div class="date">24th April 2012, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently i have noticed a difference between SP1 and FP7 that represents a big problem to me.<br />
<br />
I am printing a Billing Request (reprint Invoices) to a printer, which has been configured as an XML-Printer<br />
[&quot;Intermediate File in XML Format&quot; and Argument &quot;XML&quot;]<br />
<br />
When i'm printing this Billing Request in SP1 then one xml file will be created per Invoice.<br />
When i am printing the same Billing Request under FP7, only one huge xml file for all Invoices will be created.<br />
<br />
So when i print this huge Billing Request in FP7, it is not possible anymore to read the xml-file and parse it because i get the &quot;out of memory&quot; error in erpLN.<br />
(There are mostly over 50000 Invoices in one Billing Request...)<br />
<br />
My Question is: can i configure anything in FP7 to get the old behavior back? <br />
So one xml-file per Invoice will be produced instead of one xml-file for all Invoices in this Billing Request?<br />
<br />
Info: both Systems (SP1 / FP7) are using the same PortingSet and Tools Version:<br />
PortingSet=&quot;8.7a.03&quot; - PortNumber=&quot;PA.4264.64-bit&quot;<br />
LatestToolsVersion=&quot;7.6.a7tt&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Development trys to implement a kind of switch, which makes it possible, to get the old Behavior back.</div></div><hr />
