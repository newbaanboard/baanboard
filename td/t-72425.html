I was browsing the Xtreme and did not find anything useful.<br />

Has anyone else experienced this? What is the workaround?<br />

I thought asking here first before opening an Xtreme ticket.<br />

It works properly on LN 10.6. I think it should work on 10.5 too.<br />
Have you tried creating a new session and only use that command?<br />
Just to see if the problem lies within the session you are working on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried what you are suggesting and the problem is the same. <br />
If you have a little time, could you check my test session settings and the code here:<br />
https://www.dropbox.com/s/p55ddx5w1kbgyh2/execute_add_set_problem.pdf?dl=0<br />
<br />
As mentioned, I tried several other commands (def.find, first.view, end.program ...) and they worked.</div></div><hr />

I tried the same setting as you have. It works fine, but I am on LN 10.6 though.<br />
Maybe it's worth an incident.<br />
There might be some solution you are missing.<br />
Or just wait for other gurus.</div></div><hr />
