<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StillOnBaan</div><div class="date">1st March 2020, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a few jobs that run several times a day.  Every couple of months one of them may hang up and we do not know about it for a while until someone complains that something does not look right.<br />
<br />
The solution is always, stop the job, set it to Free, then restart it.  If the job is running at Midnight, then it is obvious that it is hung so I would like know if there is a way to script a job (or all) jobs to cancel if running, set to free, then continue at the next scheduled run?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">2nd March 2020, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure you can build your own:<br />
* create a SQL query SELECT ttaad500.*<br />
 FROM ttaad500<br />
 WHERE ttaad500._compnr=000 | or your application company where the jobs run<br />
 AND ttaad500.jsta = ttaad.jsta.running<br />
 ORDER BY ttaad500.cjob<br />
* in the SQL report build in a delay for the average+safety margin time for normal run time of longest running job and perform the same query again.<br />
in the selectdo start session ttaad5500m000 using AFS, looking up the job and mark it, use form commands to cancel the job, wait, release the same job and exit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StillOnBaan</div><div class="date">3rd March 2020, 04:06</div></div><div class="posttext">The SQL helps tell me what is hung (t_jsta =3) but is there a way I can cancel the job without building an AFS script because I am not familiar with how to do this.<br />
<br />
The job is started by a batch file &quot;StartUpdate.bat STATS&quot; where STATS is the name of the job.  The StartUpdate.bat is:<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
start f:\baan\bin\bw.exe f:\baan\lib\user\nightjob.bwc  -- -set BSH_JOB=&quot;%1&quot; -set BSH_JOBOK=&quot;%2&quot; -set BSH_FRSES=&quot;%3&quot; ttaad5203m000<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
I was thinking I could just substitute ttaad5203m000 with ttaad5204m000 to cancel the job, but that just brings up the Cancel Job screen without closing the job.</div></div><hr />
