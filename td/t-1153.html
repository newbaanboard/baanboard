<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmbarr</div><div class="date">24th February 2002, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some customized sales order reports that were printing the text associated with the customer master using tccom010.txta.  Since an upgrade to porting set 6.1c.06.01 and installation of patches related to solution 150185, and replacement of some standard program objects (like ostpstandard, ostp_stddll, ostp_textdll) the text that prints is not the text associated with the customer record.  We get text that looks like help text and sometimes it looks like code from scripts.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone offer advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th February 2002, 02:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a guess - since I am not real familiar with porting sets, patches and such.  Any way do the text numbers in tccom010.txta and the text in tttxt010 match?  By that I mean when you look up the text number in the text table does it have the correct text?  I am just wondering if for some reason some indexes are corrupt.  We had a case when you ran the Baan program and did a lookup using the index it returned a different record than what table maintenance returned.  We rebuilt the indexes and everything was fine.<br />
<br />
Just my humble guess.  Good luck!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmbarr</div><div class="date">25th February 2002, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried that a while ago.  The value in tccom010.txta retrieves the right text in tttxt010.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as you mentioned that the incorrect texts seem like help texts or suchlike, just try and look up the text number in company 000.<br />
If you find the text that is printed on your reports here, at least you are step further. Anyway you should find a patch on the Baan pages, if the company number gets messed up.<br />
<br />
Another shot in the dark, too, that is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">25th February 2002, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">This may not be your problem, but this is a problem I saw with a customer not too long ago.  This corporation had multiple companies with some logical/physical relationships.  In this particular case, tables tdpur040, 41, and 45 in company 600 were logical with physical counterparts in company 500.  They were printing the footer text from tdpur040 and the line text from tdpur041.  Everything was going along fine until they installed IVc4 SP8.  Then the texts started coming up wrong.  It turned out that even though you could see the correct text number coming up in the report debugger, it was taking the text from the physical company with the same text number (i.e., instead of grabbing text #10000 from company 600, it was taking it from 500).  The really interesting piece was that this only happened IF the report field was a table field.  So, if I put tdpur041.txta on the report, it had a problem, but if I assigned the same text number to txtn.ptr in the program script, it printed fine in the report.<br />
<br />
It was fun trying to diagnose that one!:)   Again, it may not be your issue, but I thought I'd throw it out there any way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once I assigned the field tccom010.txta to a new domain and printed that (cust.ptr) on the report it works!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the wonderful help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmbarr</div><div class="date">7th March 2002, 23:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Modified reports to print a pointer variable rather than directly from the table.  This cleared up some of the problems.  Another problem was discovered when more than one text message was being printed where the master tables were logical tables.<br />
<br />
There is a solution 120250 that corrects these problems.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">12th March 2002, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">This is indeed a known problem and related to ttstprepdll<br />
<br />
Newer updates have a dependency to the portingset (6.1c.06 at least). Be aware: installing a newer version and not updating the portingset will yield big problems.<br />
<br />
When you create your own reports (or objects in general), do not forget to also install the newer $BSE/include6.1 files from solution 114812. Note: on NT rename the *dmp file to *.tar and install using WINZIP.<br />
