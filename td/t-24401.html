<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th June 2005, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a free program that runs in Baan which tracks the users logins, what BW version they are using, IP info, OS Version, etc.  It writes the information to a flat file on the system, so anything can query it, VB or whatever.  <br />
<br />
It's basically 2 Baan sessions, one runs at startup (setup in bms) that writes the information, the other runs as called, to view the information (as seen in the flat files).  <br />
<br />
You can download and try it out at http:RMCis Client Information Tool (http://www.rmcis.com/tools.html)</div></div><hr />

This is not what I am looking for.  My interest is towards an auditing tool of what the setting were in the .bwc file at the time of log in.<br />
<br />
I have tried installing your tool in the past and found that the dumps seem to be corrupted.  Even though the dump.l lists the objects the import does not install any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th June 2005, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I see, you are right, we do not have the settings they run with.  I'll pass the idea onto Madhu, who developed the tool, we are always looking for feedback.<br />
<br />
As far as the delivery being corrupt, I did just download from the site and installed on a Unix and NT box.  Sometimes Baan versions have compatiblity issues with the delivery, and sometimes the files can get corrupted along the way.  The zip file also creates a separate directory, tu, where the install needs to call from if you unzip directly onto the server...<br />
<br />
Not sure why it would not install for you, but if you want the tool let us know and we can try to help, even get you fresh dumps if you want.</div></div><hr />

However, maybe the dumps for Client Info are not compatible for BaanIVc3?<br />

Actually, the NT system I just installed to was c3.  Are you on Unix or NT?   If you want, email me (lbencic@rmcis.com), I'll send you a fresh dump from a c3 box of your type and we can take  it from there.  I can't seem to attach files to the Private Messages ...</div></div><hr />
