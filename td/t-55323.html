    Can anyone please provide me some sample code for creating the tree using DsCtree. I tried to read the programmers guide as well find some links regarding it on the forum. But I am not able to create it.<br />

Any suggestions are welcomed.<br />

Actually I dont have any such situation where I require to create the tree like structure. But I just thinking of just playing around by creating objects and ...<br />
<br />
I was thinking of creating a 3GL script where I can display the complete directory structure of the server in the form of tree, irrespective of whether the server is working on Unix or Windows operating system.<br />

Any suggestions are welcome<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

Well, here is something very similar to your quest, but it is not in tree mode:<br />
http://mrand.name/baanftp/index.html<br />
Translate to English (http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmrand.name%2Fbaanftp%2Findex.html&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8) <br />
<br />
It is a Baan FTP program that should work on UNIX and Windows! As you cans ee you can browse the server directories.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
