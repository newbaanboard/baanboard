This will be based upon the user entering the first requirement week to be displayed. How can I get the cummulative requirements to show in this format:<br />
If the requirements were 50 pcs per week.<br />
<br />
WK1       WK2     WK3     WK4     WK5    WK6<br />

I tried to sum up the values, but no luck. This is what I have so far.<br />

<br />
what is the value found in week1?<br />
<br />
is week.f returning any values?<br />
<br />
I am assuming that you are wanting to do this in a report script as this is a standard session for which you have no source code.<br />
<br />
The script can be made efficient by using indices where available and minimizing the condition fields in the where statement.<br />
<br />
If you could explain your requirement in terms output currently<br />
in report,variables and indices available, it may be easier to get<br />
to the solution.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">22nd March 2003, 05:02</div></div><div class="posttext">What I need is in the sesison(I created)<br />
the user can select what week range they would like to view for past purchase schedules. They can select  for example week 10 (week.f)<br />
The report will gather data for all historical purchase schedules and will display all requirements for each schedule starting from week 10 forward.(up to 14 weeeks)<br />
The issue is that I need to get the sum of the requirements up to the week.f and then create the cummulative requirements.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is clear yet. <br />
<br />
another example<br />
<br />
on the session for the user enters week 10 for the field week.f and a date range to gather all histiorical schedules within the date range.<br />
<br />
Each schedule may have data prior to week 10, This needs to be included in the cummulative count.<br />
<br />
Ex <br />
week1    100 pcs<br />
week2    300 pcs<br />
week3     200 pcs<br />
week 4   150 pcs<br />
week5     150 pcs            qnty1 (on rpt)<br />
week6      100 pcs           qnty2 (on rpt)<br />
<br />
When the user selects in the session to print  starting on week 5, the values above need to be included  in the cummulative count. <br />
The begining cum here would be 750, then week5 would be 900 pcs and week 6 would be 1000 pcs.<br />
<br />
How can I sum  a field and then add the field to the sum<br />
select sum(tdpsc006.totq)<br />
where  week &gt; week.f<br />
.....<br />
begcum = tdpsc006.totq<br />
...............<br />
         if tdpsc006.week = week.f<br />
   qnty1 = tdpsc006.totq + begcum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">22nd March 2003, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding is your table lists weeknumber and total<br />
quantity as 2 fields.<br />
<br />
Most simple solution would be :<br />
====================<br />
<br />
    Select sum(tdpsc006.totq) :begcum<br />
    from  tdpsc006<br />
    where tdpsc006.week &lt; week.f<br />
    selectdo<br />
    endselect<br />
<br />
    select sum(tdpsc.totq) :curtotal<br />
    from   tdpsc006<br />
    where tdpsc006.week &gt;= week.f<br />
    selectdo<br />
   endselect<br />
<br />
   qnty1 = begcum+curtotal<br />
<br />
=================================<br />
<br />
As I said before, use Indices where available,take care of<br />
variable declarations and initializing them when required.<br />
<br />
The code can be made more concise but this is  the most simple form.<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />
