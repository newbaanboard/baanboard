<br />
Scite based on Scintilla (http://www.scintilla.org) now has support for Baan.<br />
<br />
As announced previously this editor has a boatload of features<br />
 Syntax highlighting<br />
 Folding<br />
 Calltips (no more trying to figure out the arguments for a function)<br />
 F1 key gives Baan Tools help.<br />
 Auto indentation<br />
 Auto complete<br />
 Block (un)commenting<br />
 Regular expression support<br />
 Line numbers<br />
 Windows editing keys<br />
 Small size executable<br />
 Works on Windows and Linux<br />
<br />
Not for people who like Vi :D.<br />
<br />
Download the current stable release executables from http://www.scintilla.org/SciTEDownload.html. Choose full download and not the &quot;single file executable&quot;.<br />
<br />
The files shipped from Scintilla.org site do not have the full keyword list nor the baan.api file. Unzip Scite into a directory preferably c:\wscite or d:\wscite. Then copy the files baan.properties (overwrite the file from scintilla.org site) and baan.api from Baanboard site - these are part of the zip file below. <br />
<br />
Copy and edit the SciteUser.properties file to an appropriate directory<br />
# for Windows NT this file should be in C:\winnt\profiles\xxxxxx\ <br />
# directory where xxxxxx is the windows user name<br />

Modifications / additions and new feature requests can be posted in this thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">22nd January 2002, 23:28</div></div><div class="posttext">This release has a Baan specific problem that has been fixed. Previous versions would show incorrect call-tips once in a while:<br />
<br />
for eg:<br />
seq.open( would show call-tip for seq.open.local()<br />
<br />
The patch to fix this has been submitted by Praveen Ambekar. <br />
Calltips in SciTE use the calltip.&lt;lexer&gt;.word.characters setting to correctly find calltips for functions that include characters like '$' which is not normally considered a word character.<br />
The baan.properties file in the download from www.scintilla.org matches more closely to one in this thread. The file on this site will continue to be the best version.<br />

<br />
how i can use SciTE with Baan Xwindows client in Linux ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 03:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no experience with using the BX interface of Baan. But I will take a shot at it.<br />
<br />
Install SciTE on the Baan server. Set your development parameters with the following values<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
Editor Read-Only Command: (name of scite executable)<br />
Starting editor-on: Server<br />
<br />
Editor Read/Write Command: (name of scite executable)<br />
Starting editor-on: Server<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
<br />
Start a telnet session to the Baan server and export its display to the IP address of your Linux box. It may look like:<br />
<br />
DISPLAY=xx.xx.xx.xx:0.0; export DISPLAY<br />
<br />
Now you should probably be able to edit your scripts in SciTE.<br />
<br />
I do not have a way of testing any of this. Someone please point errors in my methodology and/or come up with a better way of doing this.</div></div><hr />

Is this the correct place for the api file?<br />

<br />
Akshay your problem is similar to Haggis'. I do not know into which directory &quot;SciteUser.properties&quot; goes into on a windows-95 machine. Try clicking on &quot;Options...Open User Options File&quot; in SciTE and it should tell you where it is expecting the path to be. Then copy the  SciteUser.properties file from this site and edit it to meet your local settings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the stpapi commands. They are definitely a bonus to the baan.api file. But I am not in favour of changing the sciteglobal.properties file. The reason for this is the difficulty of porting your changes across the various versions. A better file for doing the changes is sciteuser.properties. Scite follows hierarchically for properities - just like Baan VRC :-) - global - local - user.<br />
<br />
Also could you verify that you are using Scite ver 1.43 or above. From looking at your properties file I have a nagging doubt that you may be using a beta of Rel 1.41 or even earlier. The baan syntax-highlighting code officially became available in ver 1.42. And a error that seemed to affect baan.api not to return the correct function in the call-tip was fixed in ver 1.43.</div></div><hr />

Those &quot;guiding lines&quot; are basically tabs. In the first case, you must have a bunch of unnecessary tabs. In the second case, there is not much we can do. The big alternative is to totally turn them off. Please look in the *.properties file to locate the appropriate option.</div></div><hr />

To your first post, I do not know if that is possible. Here are your options:<br />
Look in the scintilla/scite documentation.<br />
Join the scintilla/scite user groups and ask the question.<br />
If all that fails, code the feature and contribute it back for everyone to enjoy.<br />
<br />
As for it having stopped working, there must have been some modifications. See if you can undo it. If you do not remember what you did, reinstall.</div></div><hr />

Your post must have slipped past me :(. Sorry for the late response. I could not get it working either. It was not a priority for the release :). And these days I hardly code in Baan, making work on Scite less than a priority. Some one who has a little more time and an itch to scratch is welcome to make modifications to SciTE to make it work better with Baan.</div></div><hr />

I finally got it working.<br />
It is necessary that the file you'r editing has the extension i.e &quot;cln&quot; as indicated for Baan.<br />
<br />
If the file has no extension the &quot;F1&quot; command is not working.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your solutions<br />

In your sciteuser.properties file did you set this command.help.$(file.patterns.baan)=$(CurrentWord)!C:\BaanSc1\tt2.hlp. Make sure it matches this line.  <br />
<br />
This is what is in my sciteuser.properties file:<br />

command.help.$(file.patterns.baan)=$(CurrentWord)!c:\wscite\tt_mp2.hlp<br />
command.help.subsystem.$(file.patterns.baan)=5     <br />

I downloaded the file that simon posted and put it directly in my site directory(c:\wscite). Also make note of what Simon said about editing a .bc or .cln(two extensions used by Baan and defined in the baan.api file).  <br />

<br />
Bit of a pain when you open a script, start editing it then can't save it because PVRC is wrong and script was opened with read only attribute.<br />
<br />
Done some checking and it looks like the functionality was added in Scite 1.45 but it dosn't seem to work fully in version 1.52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure I understand what you are talking about? We are on 4c3 and Baan does not allow me to edit a script unless I am in the correct VRC/package combination.  It will allow me to view any file and then make changes that I can not save.  Is that what you are talking about?  I used to keep my viewing option to vi, but just recently changed it to the scite editor.  Under vi, I could view a file, make changes, then to a w! to save them.  I have not figured away around this with scite.  Which flag are you talking about?<br />
<br />
Mark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kevobr</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark you have the general idea, if you are viewing a script in Scite you can edit it but not save it.<br />
<br />
In the options for Scite there is a read only flag. Set this manually after opening a script and no editing is possible.<br />
<br />
You can also set this in SciTEGlobal.properties file:<br />
<br />
#read.only=1<br />
<br />
It's commented out by default as above but uncomment it and it will stop you from editing anything in Scite unless you manually untick the flag in the options menu.<br />
<br />
So a possible solution is 2 have to copies of Scite with different paths, one for editing, and one for viewing with the read.only set in the view SciTEGlobal.properties file. and left commented out in the editing one.<br />
In my case I just created a copy of the wscite directorty zscite and changed path accordingly in Baan for the view editor.<br />
<br />
Problem solved!<br />
<br />
Checked around on net and it seems to be a recognised bug in Scite.</div></div><hr />

Scite has an option to show a marker at a specified column. Find the edge options and set them appropriately.<br />
<br />
edge.column=80<br />
edge.mode=1<br />
<br />
This will not limit the user in any way to not code beyond 80 columns. But it does provide a visual limit of 80 columns. It is upto the developer to honor the stated goal of not coding beyond 80 columns.<br />
<br />
As for folding if statements, you will need to edit and recompile the Baan lexer. Praveen wrote the lexer based on the C/C++ lexer. You or someone who has the interest and skill need to program the changes.</div></div><hr />

Then when you view a file it will open with read-only set.  Then you can not type in the file.  At least that is how it is working for me.  Just another option besides having two versions of scite.<br />

I'm assuming that somewhere out there is a file with a line it should not have, but instead of sweating it I thought I'd pop the question to the scite-gurus.<br />
<br />
Also, I would like to have line numbering turned on every time I open a Baan document. I checked the API and it already had a statement in there that (supposedly) turns line numbers on.<br />
<br />
Also, How do I define a new style and then add keywords to it?<br />

<br />
Some versions of Baan would cause that statement if the last line in the program did not have a carriage return.<br />
<br />
Baan's fix was to add a carriage return to the program every time you saved it. You can see the result of this in many scripts shipped with Baan, where there are a bunch of empty lines at the bottom of the script.<br />
<br />
Perform a test and let us know the results.</div></div><hr />

You can do a save as on your local drive.  Then reopen the script in Baan.  Next just open up scite and open the save as file on the client.<br />

You could also open the script in Baan, copy all lines, open new file(cntrl-n), paste the lines.  Then flip back and forth.<br />

Neither option is too clean, but should get you what you want.</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much for the colorful editor SciTE <br />
I use it now for editing my script. I use BaaN ver.50C.<br />

<br />
You have to go to Tools - User Management - General User Data - User Data session. Find your account, and open the details.<br />
At the bottom of the 2nd tab (Defaults) you can see which 'Development Parameters' template is linked to your account. Remember it.<br />
Now close the User Data sessions and open: Tools - User Management - Developers Data - Development Parameters Template, and find the Template that was linked to your User Data.<br />
In this template you can change the editor commands.<br />
Note:<br />
 - you have to Convert to Runtime DD afterwards to make the new setting active.<br />
 - the template can be linked to others' User Data too. So their settings will change too.<br />

The story is as follows:<br />
<br />
Baan used to send a forward slash instead of a reverse slash in the pathname to the source file when invoking the editor. ViW, notepad and few other editors coped with this anamoly but not Ultraedit. Worked with the Baan Tools Development department in July 1997 to have them fix this problem.<br />
<br />
I also wrote macros for ViM to help with Baan development.<br />
<br />
I thought that an open source Windows/Linux editor needed to have support for Baan. And so support for Baan in SciTE was incorporated. And this thread is a place to discuss about SciTE.<br />

Please open a thread in some other forum - say Tools to evangelize whichever is your editor of choice. Help me keep the discussion on this thread about SciTE. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

What version of Baan are you using this on?  What are your developers parameters set to?  The only time I have seen this error is when I open a file with scite that is already opened and locked by another application.</div></div><hr />

I am using it on ERP LN6.1, the SciTE Version 1.56, I have been using Ultra Edit before this, and when i switched to Scite, I changed only the editor in Dev Param session keeping all the other things untouched, attached is the screen shot of it...please help me...one more observation is that the .bc file (the script that I am working with) kept localy in tmp folder is read only while all others which are already there are not in read only mode...I dont understand if it can help u to guide me but just thought to inform you...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th June 2007, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">To do read-only you can add these parameters  -read.only $*.  As for the other problem - first make sure all the property files are in the correct spot.  Then search the property files to make sure none of them are turning on read only.  Also check and make sure all the property files have the correct directories inside of them.<br />
<br />
So look for read.only=0 in your property files - in mine it is in sciteglobal.properties file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">28th February 2009, 00:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have downloaded latest version for scite i.e. 1.77 as of 27th Feb 2009, i did some changes to the files SciTEUser.properties, baan.api, baan.properties, SciTEGlobal.properties as per the various posts related to this thread.<br />
<br />
I have 2 questions on the same...<br />
<br />
1) Is it OK to use the latest version of scite, or do u see any issues with that ... one minor thing which i have noticed in latest scite if you go to Language Menu, you dont see BaaN as one of the language, which use to appear in atleast older version (1.42)... so i am not sure are there any other hidden stuff which i should be really worried for.<br />
<br />
2) The AutoComplete feature is not fully working, its working to the extent, that if i have a function lets say message() inside my p.script, and if i retype alphabet &quot;M&quot; it automatically autopopulates keyword &quot;Message&quot;, but if assuming this is the first time i am using a standard function in my p.script, then it doesnt bring the auto pop for that function ... any hints , tips, i have re-checked on the settings which are mentioned in older posts.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd March 2009, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Well not sure about question 1, but I am using 1.62 and it is still included.  For question 2 the autocomplete has always worked like that for me.  As far as I know you had to have the word in their once before autocomplete would work.  That seems to make sense to me because if typed &quot;s&quot; - look at how many Baan keywords start with s, or b, etc.  Maybe someone has a different experience.</div></div><hr />

I am assuming you have the editor set up in the developers parameters(we are on 4c4):<br />

I've installed SciTE version 3.0.1 and have configured the Global and User properties as listed above.  My autocomplete and my call tips work, but there is no color and folding does not work.<br />

I've modified these lines in the global properties:<br />

Normally we keep fold.on.open commented out.  But I tested it.  When I edit a script in 4c4 it opens and all of the functions below are folded.  I don't think anything else folds.<br />

What do you have for colors in your baan properties file:<br />

A C++ compiler is required, with C++11 required for building SciTE.<br />

There comes a zip download of Scite as well. Also, you will find a working version attached to this thread. Personally, I never did any installations. Just extracted the zip folder and thats it. If you download it from the official site, you will need to add properties files and a couple of others manually to get the BAAN/LN support.</div></div><hr />

Here are the steps to setup a new SciTE.<br />
<br />
 Download Scite from the link. http://www.scintilla.org/wscite.zip<br />
 Extract it to the desired location. (eg: D:\wscite)<br />
 open SciTE.exe from the extracted location.<br />
 Go to menu, &quot;Options&quot; --&gt; &quot;Open Global Options File&quot;.<br />
 Go to menu, &quot;Options&quot; --&gt; &quot;Open User Options File&quot;.<br />
 Copy the property &quot;imports.exclude&quot; from Global Options File(SciTEGlobal.properties) to User Options file (SciTEUser.properties).<br />
 Remove the word baan (and any other required language) from the &quot;imports.exclude&quot; property.<br />
 Close and restart SciTE window. Now, Baan will be visible in the Language menu. <br />
<br />
<br />
The above steps are required for enabling Baan.<br />
Additionally, below are few additional properties... which can be set in the User Options file (SciTEUser.properties), based on your personal preference and requirements. Basically, keywords2,3,6,7,8,9 needs to be filled based on the baan version you use. api.* &amp; command.* needs to be filled on where the help files and autocomplete files are located. <br />
<br />
Rest all settings, you can refer http://www.scintilla.org/SciTEDoc.html<br />
<br />
<br />
#uncomment below, set the full path of API files. If more than one, seperate it with ';'.<br />
#api.$(file.patterns.baan)=<br />
<br />

At the onset of Windows8.1, I had to convert the *.hlp file to a *.chm files for some customers. I dont have a windows 10 machine now, so cant be sure if it will behave the same way. <br />
<br />
The change from *.hlp to *.chm was done based on the below link.<br />
<br />
http://www.help-info.de/en/Help_Info_WinHelp/hw_converting.htm<br />
<br />
However, there was some manual work required especially for the *.cnt files, as *.hlp files which was available at that time did not have a ToC... but, the *.chm files by default has a ToC.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
PS: I am out of baanIV now and dont use any *.hlp file and all the new help files provided by Infor are *.chm files.</div></div><hr />
