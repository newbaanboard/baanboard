<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm importing a csv file via a Baan exchange.  However, a csv file will put quotes around any string that contains a comma.  It does not put quotes around the other strings in the file.<br />
<br />
All the records with quoted strings kick out.<br />
<br />
i.e.  ,&quot;Mansfield, Inc.&quot;,<br />
<br />
I receive this file from a supplier, so I have little means to change the input.  Is there a way I can manipulate this file while still in exchange, or do I have to strip out the commas and quotes before I process it (I didn't want to have to do this!!!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nanuco</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You could open the file with excel, remove the commas by substituting it by nothing or space in a single turn, export the file again, and simply import the file without having the problem you mencioned.<br />
<br />
ItÂ´s an easy way to go around your problem in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

As per Baan help it will not work.<br />

Do give us feedback.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">19th January 2004, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe you can create a condition that reads each record into a string and then strip out the fields.  Not sure if the internal exchange file reading functionality would first read the file and give the errors before the condition can read the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">27th January 2004, 11:33</div></div><div class="posttext">If you define the exchange scheme as using a comma as separator (and quote as enclosing character), the internal code of the exchange scheme that parses the line read from the file into fields will always fall over on an incorrect number of fields.<br />
<br />
So you will either have to change the source file (in Excel or otherwise) or change the exchange scheme. Perhaps you can define the input file in exchange as either fixed length or as 1 field long using some separator character that doesn't appear in the file at all. That way, the internal code will just read each line of the input file and parse it as being 1 field. You then have a job to do writing a condition to unravel it and stick it in variables that can be used to replace the original fields.<br />
<br />
I haven't found an easy way to change excel's behaviour to only use enclosing characters in a csv file when required (i.e. when a field contains a separator character). If anyone knows how that can be done easily then please let me know.</div></div><hr />
