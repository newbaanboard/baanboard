<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike.L</div><div class="date">22nd August 2006, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a multi-occurence subsession that lists the details of a main session.  I want to mark any of the details and press a user defined button to process those records that are marked.  The process will loop through the mark.table and process the marked records.  The only problem is, if I mark 3 contiguous records having values 10, 20, and 30, when using DO.OCC, the values are 20, 10, and then 20 again.  For some reason they don't process in the same order as displayed on the screen, which doesn't matter, but what I do need is to process the occurences that I have marked.  <br />
<br />
I found that when I select a group of records but click on the bottom record first and then the top record, that seems to be when the problem happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">22nd August 2006, 22:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used something like this:<br />

long i<br />

for i = 1 to fattr.occurnr           |* All Occurances on the form<br />
          if mark.table(i) then       |* If that occurance is marked<br />
               do.occ(i, myfunction)<br />

Maybe there is a better way, but this would resolve the problem of going in order.</div></div><hr />

My code snippet below is very similar to your example.  As you can probably tell, I don't have a lot of experience at Baan development.  I assume that the DO.OCC sends the data of an occurence to a function.  A problem that I noticed is if I click on record 4 and hold the shift and click on record 2, this will mark records 2 , 3, and 4.  When I try to process the marked records, the process is 3, 2, and 3.  Record 4 is skipped.  If I individually click on 2, 3, and 4, everything works fine.  Is there a way I can stop a user from selecting a group of records?<br />
<br />
choice.user.0:<br />
on.choice:<br />
	for i = 1 to filled.occ<br />
		if mark.table(i) then<br />
			do.occ.without.update(i,insert.my.records)<br />
		endif<br />
	endfor<br />
	display.all()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd August 2006, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Use fattr.occurnr - you do not want just the filled occurences(filled.occ).  You want to check each occurence to see if it is marked.  If yes then process it.  This should eliminate the order they marked the records in.<br />
<br />
Also if you edit your previous post with code you can see how I included code tags to make things easier to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike.L</div><div class="date">25th August 2006, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for you direction.  The data that seemed to not be in the correct order were not data coming from the main table.  They were values that were being populated in an after.field process.  I just used the main table values to query the database again to find the correct values and then continue the process with the correct values. <br />
 <br />
Thank you for the help.</div></div><hr />
