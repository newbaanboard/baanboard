<br />
Is there anyway to do it?</div></div><hr />

The session scripts send the report fields to the reports.  So what is available on the two reports could vary.  Are these two reports generated by the same session script?  If not, then maybe more details on what you are trying to do.  Maybe what the field is you are looking for.</div></div><hr />

Or I would take the code from the other session and include it in the new session or report.  I have usually does it this way - just add what I need to the new session/report.  Of course not always so easy when you do not have source code.</div></div><hr />

But I have several libraries where I run reports to disk.  Reading them is something different.  Not really sure what exactly I could post to help.  You can see a lot of my AFS code in the other forum.</div></div><hr />
