 <br />
the aggregate functions in baan reports are very limited and cannot be used for further calculations (okay, there are workarounds, but I would not suggest them).<br />
 <br />
Instead: calculate the sum on your own.<br />
 <br />
To do this: (create a report script); add a local variable to it; whenever you print it, add the printed value to your sum; after you are finished with the group, don't forget to reset your sum to 0.<br />

<br />
please suggest<br />
<br />
In expression write booked_hours - budget_hours and aggregate expression write total . That should yield difference . <br />
<br />
But mind well same will not go ahead with division/multiplication / percentages as gunther has already pointed out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">2nd April 2011, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">While there is definite method to  manipulation with aggregate quantities in the report script , there is still better way  which  can give the summaries fastest way and that too without affecting reports in upgrades / change of functionality in report.<br />
<br />
This way is very useful when  users need 5-10 page summary without 1000s of page detail lines .  Have a look at speed data tranformation though performance dll (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=28569) .<br />
<br />
With use of this dll the reports come at lightning speed and users really use the reports which come out of millions of detail lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kuldeepsharma</div><div class="date">2nd April 2011, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">In this case you hv to use the report script.<br />
<br />
Define a field bal hrs. and total booked hours<br />
Insert a detail line, do not show and field on this layout<br />
In before.layout of this add booked hours and  budget hours <br />
put lattr.print = false  so detail line line will not be printed<br />
<br />
Then on before.layout of after.field calculate balance hrs according ur formula<br />
And print this field on layout.<br />
<br />
BOL MAHA</div></div><hr />
