<br />
On our test server I accidently executed session ttiex3227m000 &quot;Patch Objects of Tools Development Package&quot; without filling any of the fields.<br />
I was shocked but the session did it's work and now I can edit/change tables/scripts/ etc. It looks like I have a working development license now.<br />
Before we couldn't do any of this.<br />
Is this correct (legal) ?<br />

<br />
Read your post wrong at first.<br />
<br />
You probably have a tools development license, very few people do not..<br />
look in your display requested system configuration to see if it is enabled.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">28th December 2005, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed it depends on your license. Please check in your requested license. In the Netherlands it's not so common to have a tools development license, you have to pay a lot extra for it.<br />
<br />
The question is, do you need it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">29th December 2005, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to be sure - are you pulling that license info from the server where<br />
the license daemon resides?<br />
<br />
(for example in $BSE/lib/licence6.1 - does it point to the same server<br />
that you looked at?) Just a thought. <br />
<br />
You'll probably want to tell SSA since they do customer audits.<br />

I ran ttiex3227m000 on the server which has licd6.1 running and the result is the same. A working development environment.<br />

<br />
yes, i agree with fred.<br />
Just tested on a IVc4 Environment, without  developing licence.<br />
After running session without  input in all fields you have a working development environment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">3rd January 2006, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, kind of like the FBI trying to prosecute hackers for taking advantage of Microsoft bugs.. never goes anywhere.<br />
<br />
however, you might want to ask yourself how much litigation your companies willing to go through to have access to something you didn't pay for. Whether you're right or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not encouraging piracy but since the code that enables the development license is from the manufacturer of the product, unlike Microsoft exploited bugs, couldn't it be considered an offering or even an improvement of the product?<br />
Anyone heard SSA denying this?</div></div><hr />

But I would think that 'in the spirit of the license agreement' it would be inappropriate to use the session this way. And thus rendering it not legal to use the unlicensed development environment this way.<br />

I agree with your statement. However since I know that SSA employees do use baanboard as well they know now. The question is are they going to correct it?<br />
