I have a requirement in developing a report on LN.<br />
The layout of the report is As follows.<br />
<br />
Header Layout<br />
Before Field Layout<br />
Detail Layout<br />
After Field layout<br />
and the layouts Before Field Detail After Field should get repeated on the same page.<br />
So the report after printing should look like this.<br />
<br />
Header Layout<br />
Before Field Layout<br />
Record 1<br />
Record 2<br />
Record 3<br />
...<br />
After Field layout<br />
Before Field Layout<br />
Record 1<br />
Record 2<br />
Record 3<br />
...<br />
After Field layout<br />
<br />
The repeated layout should have the same data, as if you are printing a duplicate copy.<br />
Report may also span to multiple pages depending upon the no of records.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<br />
Any suggestions?? how to print  layout twice?<br />
Any questions?? Do I have to provide more inputs?<br />
Is it possible??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sameer.don</div><div class="date">2nd December 2010, 12:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Is program script editable ??<br />
<br />
If yes, you can add one more field for report input (say XYZ) with Sorting sequence 1, i.e. highest sorting priority.<br />
<br />
Define after.field layout on this new field.<br />
<br />
On program script, define the same variable and use rprt_send() twice in succession. But for the first time with XYZ=1 and for the second time XYZ=2. This will serve the purpose.<br />
<br />
But if you do not have program script with you, then we need to think of some alternate way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice Suggestion,<br />
<br />
But. problem with approach is, Consider I can print only 20 detail lines per page. so on each page i can print 10 records +(10 duplicate record). Cause records should get duplicated on same page. So, in the scenario where I have 15 records. All fifteen records will get printed on 1st page, then 1st 5 duplicate records, and remaining 10 duplicate records on next page. My requirement is if there are 15 records n i can print 20 lines, then 1st 10 records will be printed on 1st page and also 10 duplicate records after that. and remaining 5 records will go to next page along with duplicate 5 records.<br />
<br />
I hope cleared my point.<br />
<br />
Also I am reluctant to make changes script.</div></div><hr />
