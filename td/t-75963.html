I read that it is possible to export from Report Designer tool using an export button.<br />
I cannot find the Export button.<br />
Below there are the instructions i googled.<br />
According to the Infor LN Report Designer Development Guide, you can backup the report design by following these steps:<br />
<br />
Open the Report Designer (ttstppersrep) session and select the report that you want to backup.<br />
Click the Export button on the toolbar. This will open a dialog box where you can choose the location and name of the backup file.<br />
The backup file will have the extension .rptdesign and will contain the report layout and style information.<br />
To restore the report design from a backup file, click the Import button on the toolbar and select the backup file. This will overwrite the existing report design with the backup file.</div></div><hr />

Hi, which LN version are you using? As far as I know you can backup your customized design as xml file in ttadv9507m000 - Report personalizations.<br />
