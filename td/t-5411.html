The end-of-file charachter of the original file isn't deleted when he append the new data; so when i open the file in Word; the viewer stops when he reachs this charachter so the appended data isn't viewable.<br />

:confused:</div></div><hr />

We have been reporting a defect for Baan and that problem is not going to be solved in the ttstpconv program. The reasoning is: you are writing to a ascit (add to file) type of device.<br />
<br />
What you will need is a kind of preprocessor to split the one RTF file in several different files based upon the EOF character. Imagine this character to be removed, even then the viewers would not be happy because the document header appears in the middle of a file...<br />
<br />
Hope you can find your way out.</div></div><hr />
