They got around using multibyte and had a program called Richwin that allowed us to cut and paste our label creations into Baan and they printed out corrrectly.<br />
<br />
now, Richwin is no longer for XP and up and I am unfamiliar with the IME ( tried playing around a bit.<br />
<br />
Any one else done this in Baan ?  IME or whatever software, into Baan to create report labels etc WIHTOUT going mutibyte ?<br />
<br />
The company didn't make many notes on how they originally did this and those resources are long gone  :( .....  but the labels are there in the system and print correctly, just need to add more labels now ....<br />
<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />
