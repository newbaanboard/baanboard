<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaycee99</div><div class="date">25th September 2009, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to sum all the tfcmg101.amnt field by using this method, it give me correct result.<br />
<br />
select tfcmg101.ptbp, sum(tfcmg101.amnt):atotal<br />
from tfcmg101<br />
where tfcmg101.ptbp =:tfcmg101.ptbp and tfcmg101.btno = :tfcmg101.btno<br />
and tfcmg101.cnum = :tfcmg101.cnum<br />
and tfcmg101.ccur = :tfcmg101.ccur<br />
group by tfcmg101.ptbp<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
But, now i have condition for tfcmg101.amnt which is as below.<br />
<br />
if (tfcmg101.tadv = tfcmg.tadv.slsinv) and (tfcmg101.amnt &gt; 0) then <br />
tfcmg101.amnt = tfcmg101.amnt * (-1) <br />
endif<br />
<br />
If it meet this condition then it should take the value for tfcmg101.amnt multiple with -1, before do the sum for tfcmg101.amnt.<br />
<br />
Why the result is still same even i already put a condition? Any idea for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">v_kewl</div><div class="date">25th September 2009, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Both things are independent, SUM functions is applicable to the original set of data fetched by the query. I guess your are putting this condition on SELECTDO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaycee99</div><div class="date">25th September 2009, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Where the condition put also give same result. For example:<br />
<br />
tfgld101.amnt = 100, 120, 130<br />
<br />
if sum then it will be 100+120+130 = 350<br />
<br />
Base on the condition that i set, that 120 suppose to become -120<br />
<br />
So it should be something like this, 100-120+130 = 110<br />
<br />
But it will not give me this result if i write the script like i posted above. Anything wrong with the script?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Difficult to tell you what is wrong as above code is correct. To conclude anything; we need to know whether you have written above code in proper place or not. Therefore, could you please post the exact code?<br />
<br />
And also check whether proper test data is available to check this scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">25th September 2009, 20:57</div></div><div class="posttext">To get the result you want you will have to do somewhat as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
atotal = 0<br />
select tfcmg101.*<br />
from tfcmg101<br />
where tfcmg101.ptbp =:tfcmg101.ptbp and tfcmg101.btno = :tfcmg101.btno<br />
and tfcmg101.cnum = :tfcmg101.cnum<br />
and tfcmg101.ccur = :tfcmg101.ccur<br />
order by tfcmg101.ptbp<br />
selectdo<br />
    if (tfcmg101.tadv = tfcmg.tadv.slsinv) and (tfcmg101.amnt &gt; 0) <br />
    then <br />
        atotal = atotal - tfcmg101.amnt<br />
    else<br />
        atotal = atotal + tfcmg101.amnt<br />
    endif<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The select has to complete creation of the record set before the SELECTDO will execute. When you use the aggregate function, the select has already finished summing up the amnt field into atotal. <br />
Also, not that it will matter when using aggregate functions, in your code you have not selected the field tfcmg101.tadv, so it has an EMPTY value and will always be false.</div></div><hr />
