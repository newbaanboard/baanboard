<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zfadel</div><div class="date">21st June 2016, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
We are using “direct” printers for printing BAAN reports where the printer is configured though an IP address and it is defined on Unix as a “remote” printer.<br />
We have Epson LQ590 printers, we are using the driver of epson_fx as there is no drivers for Epson lq. the problem we are facing is font issues with this driver where all fonts are being printed in 17cpi regardless of the configured font on the report. can you please help us on how to configure the Epson printer in order to print correctly the font size?<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st June 2016, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">While I am not familiar with Epson printers I was wondering if you have checked the print drivers associated with the print devices?  Usually located in $BSE/lib/printinf.  I know in our hp configuration we had to go into the driver file and set the different font escape commands.  I know when I looked at the Epson_fx on our system it really only identified some fonts.  You probably need to check the character sizes.  Now this is on baan 4 and maybe baan v has something different I am not aware of.</div></div><hr />

We did the same thing as mark said ... used a user defined font  and changed printer driver ( as mentioned by mike ) to set user font with escape sequence for 62 font.  This was in ERPLN .<br />
<br />
But the default small , medium and large should have already been defined.<br />
( check the driver if small , medium and large are defined to same escape sequence ( font size  escape seq.)<br />
<br />
I am novice in this but .. just shared what we did</div></div><hr />

We have Baan 5.0c. we have found the right escape command and defined it in the driver file. The printer is now printing correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a similar problem in ERP LN,and i found this problem similar to mine thats why i didnt open a new thread.<br />
 <br />
All my fields come as 17 CPI irrespective of what they have been set at the Report Field Level. I have checked the driver printinf and its not there in lib directory.<br />
<br />
Do i need to install something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd June 2016, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought it was part of a standard install at that location.  Not sure about LN but if all of your character sizes are the same there must be print drivers some where. If you look at your device you should see the driver it is using - at least in 4c4 I do.  Then try searching for the file in the $BSE directory.  Assuming you are on unix and can run a find command starting at the root directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">22nd June 2016, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Cant find anything on the driver field(i.e on the Device Data)<br />
<br />
I am on Windows and have tried searching for these fields, print,drivers etc.. Cant find any results that are relevant...</div></div><hr />

With the installation on windows I thought it used something in conjunction with bwprint - that I really have no knowledge on.  Wait for someone who knows something about windows printing.</div></div><hr />
