QKEY was developed by Kevin Brock of Redklay, who by the way is also a member here (aka KlayVessel). Your best bet would be to either contact Kevin or go to http://www.redklay.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KlayVessel</div><div class="date">31st December 2001, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">You can contact my company about this product.  If you are having difficulty reaching someone, send me an e-mail (kevin.brock@redklay.com) and I will put you into contact with the right people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My name is Heather Ward and I work with Kevin Brock, the developer of QKey at RedKlay. Kevin noticed that there was some discussion about our development product QKey, and sent me a note. <br />
<br />
I would be more than happy to help anyone who has an interest in the QKey product get more information about or arrange for a demo of this flexible and scalable tool. <br />
<br />
Please contact me directly at (514) 499.3681, ext, 228, or at heather.ward@redklay.com.<br />
<br />
I look forward to assisting you!<br />
<br />
Heather Ward</div></div><hr />

Just FYI: since Heather's account has now status &quot;Locked&quot; (see the icon under her username), her registered email address is no longer valid and by definition she will not receive a follow notification of your post. See also: http://www.baanboard.com/node/1751</div></div><hr />
