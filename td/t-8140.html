I am displaying a field tiitm001.copr ( data type - double ) on the report, problem is it is being displayed in the following format, let's say the value is 17, then it is being displayed as 17.0000<br />
<br />
please let me know as to how can i format this field, so that the display comes as :<br />
<br />
A)        17<br />
B)        17.00<br />
<br />
<br />
and one more doubt Is sprintf function works only for double data type and not for string function ?<br />
<br />
I hope I will not have tolink the domain with the field, should i specify the format in the print expression or in the script ???<br />
<br />
Please let me know the format for both (A) and (B) case ....<br />
<br />
If possible mail me the solution at <br />

A) ZZ<br />
B) ZZVD99<br />

The Baan Help for the Print Format field explains this quite well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I think i was not able to clearly speciy my requirment previously. Actually in report script i have done coding which tells me the unit measurement of the item , now if the item is of type pieces then i would like to display the tiitm001.copr field without decimal , but if the type is of gram then i would like to display the tiitm001.copr with decimal places ( 2 decimals )<br />
<br />
Please let me know how can i do it report script ? I tried using sprintf$() function but was not able to achieve since i do not want to convert this field into string, because i would  be using this field further for multiplication purpose.<br />
<br />
The solution u gave me displays only 2 figues before decimal where as i would like to display whatever it has.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you can do is use 2 detail layouts or more, eg. one for item in grams and another for item in pcs (use the layout condition field to determine which one is printed based on item unit). Then specify the display format of the field differently in those layouts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">18th December 2002, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Well then, evertsen already provided you a clue in the right direction. Just add more Z if you're not satisfied with his idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">18th December 2002, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... you could try ZZVDZZ in the print format field but if you always need decimals when type grams (even if decimal value is 0) then you could convert to a string (str$), use edit$ or sprintf$ and then convert back to a double (val).<br />
<br />
You could also examine use of ROUND and FORMAT.ROUND.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don't know of a function that will manipulate the format of a double directly but someone else may.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">neeraj_vasudeva</div><div class="date">18th December 2002, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">yaah i got the hint that the no. of Z will increase and so the no. of the digits to be displayed will increase. Problem is how do i do it in report script ??? I can assin this print format at design level , but how can i do it in coding, so that it is being reflected dynamically ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">18th December 2002, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">try this...<br />
<br />
in report script:<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
    string    str.value <br />
    double    new.format<br />
<br />
detail.1:  (or whatever the layout is)<br />
before.layout:<br />
if type = grams then<br />
     str.value = edit$(tiitm001.copr, &quot;ZZZVD99&quot;)<br />
else<br />
     str.value = edit$(tiitm001.copr, &quot;ZZZ&quot;)<br />
endif <br />
new.format = val(str.value)<br />
<br />
in the layout:<br />
replace tiitm001.copr with new.format <br />
<br />

On the report field screen ttadv3134s000 it asks for a domain or print format and this seems to over write what you have created in the script.<br />
Is there a way to get around this - as in, make the report script formatting be what appears on the report rather than the report field formatting?</div></div><hr />
