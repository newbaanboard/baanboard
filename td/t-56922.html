<br />
My problem: Some customers want for a lot o sessions implicit values for some fields. This is a way to avoid users to do mistakes.<br />
So I customized a lot of sessions and I seted implicit values for fields.<br />
<br />
But after weeks/moths... I installed some solutions that modified the customized sessions and from here some errors apear.... logic!<br />
<br />
There is any way to sugest implicit values without customize sessions or scripts??<br />
<br />
Thank you all!<br />

We use qkey, but even then when baan makes a major modification we have to go back and fix our code.  The only way to get around this is to move the baan source to your custom VRC, but even that is not a sure thing - they can and do change tables in the background. I am not sure what is the best method(well other than not modifying anything - which we all know is not always possible).  What we do is make sure the users(or us) test all our customizations as best as possible.  We usually have a customization of our code that goes into production with the SP or patch.</div></div><hr />
