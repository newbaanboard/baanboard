<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanbab</div><div class="date">24th June 2002, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone help me on this!!<br />
<br />
I am using the shell function in my program for e-mailing from Baan. <br />
<br />
   ret = shell(mail.msg, SHELL_BACKGROUND)<br />
<br />
This function is executed in a loop in the sense that it picks up the e-mail id from a table and e-mails a file. If the table has 200 records then this function is will be executed 200 times.<br />
<br />
Today I got a problem when I ran the session. The session created a small Baan Window with &quot;message&quot; title and it said...<br />
&quot;FATAL ERROR: PTY error: 'No more pty's available' (e=0) PRESS &lt;RETURN&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a number of Baan windows with this message and had to go to each window and press return to come out of it. <br />
<br />
But this did not affect my session it did work fine. But I am not sure if the shell function worked. I guess the command which I gave in Shell function &quot;sendmail&quot; failed. None of the e-mails were sent.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me to know about this FATAL ERROR<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Babu</div></div><hr />

Use &quot;run.prog&quot; instead. I would also look into the possibility of calling the run.prog once with a bunch of email addresses which are handled by a shell script instead of one instance of the shell script per email address.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Pat says you are breaking the pty's limits on your systems.<br />
<br />
I used similar kind of coding but I never got into trouble. <br />
<br />
You might try this option - <br />
<br />
use <br />
<br />
ret = shell(mail.msg, 0)  instead of<br />
<br />
ret = shell(mail.msg, SHELL_BACKGROUND) <br />
<br />
<br />
Syntax<br />
<br />
long shell( string command(.), long mode )<br />
<br />
command	The command to be executed.<br />
mode - This can be a combination of the following options:<br />
0 - No main window is created for the terminal emulator. This may result in starting a terminal emulator in the main window of the process that calls the shell function. The first status field displays &quot;ottstpvtemul&quot; while the shell process is running.<br />

<br />
Vamsi, is right about the deprecation with shell() but I still use it as I think it is better than the run.prog()<br />
<br />
<br />
long run.prog( const string progname, const string arguments, long mode )<br />
mode	This specifies the execution mode of the program or command. The possible values are:RP_WAIT - wait for the program to finish<br />
RP_NOWAIT   	run as a background program<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I think safe option is using the mode - RP_WAIT</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
email.addr = &quot; &quot; &amp; strip$(sendto) &amp; &quot; &lt; &quot;  <br />
|* safe option to use the email id directly<br />
endselect<br />
email.comm = &quot;echo test|mailx -s &quot; &amp; subject &amp; email.addr &amp; filename <br />
e = shell(email.comm, 0)<br />
<br />
<br />
I never had any issue with it.<br />
<br />
Vamsi, has a good idea that you can use multiple email addresses at the same time. I cant find the documentations/related emails with info, but I think there is a characters limit [~256] to the command+arguments which can be used with shell().</div></div><hr />
