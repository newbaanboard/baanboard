<br />
I am trying to get the Total Sell Quantity for each Item against each Business Partner in a particular date range. <br />
<br />
<br />
I have wrote the script, but its taking a huge time, and finally I just end in killing the process. I have tried to use indexes wherever possible but still no significant results. For just 10 days the report takes a lot of time, I am not daring to go for a month data.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have attached the script, if anyone could help me out, I will be glad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can use Call Graph Profiler mode , to get the details of queries execution time and can zero down to the query taking the longest time<br />
<br />
i also attached a doc that i downloaded on baanboard,i hope that would be helpful although it was for baan iv and v<br />
<br />
regards<br />

<br />
The call graph profiler will give you more detailed information to determine which specific sql code is taking more time or you can look up the DBSLOG or <br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can use this option to validate at high level -<br />
<br />
<br />
$ cat lmssq.sql<br />
select  fmlbd400.load:load,fmlbd350.orno:order,fmlbd350.fono:line<br />
from    fmlbd400,fmlbd300,fmlbd350<br />
where   fmlbd400._index2 = {&quot;WORKPLAN&quot;, &quot;640001204&quot;}<br />
and     fmlbd300.load refers to fmlbd400<br />
and     fmlbd350.shpm refers to fmlbd300<br />
hint use index 2 on fmlbd300<br />
and use index 1 on fmlbd350<br />
and  use index 2 on fmlbd400<br />
<br />
$ cat lmss751.ksh<br />
export  LMS_ID=lmss<br />
. /app/lms/common/baanenv lmss #set Baan environment<br />
export ORAPROF=0<br />
qptool6.2 -f lmssq.sql -c 751<br />
<br />
Check the records count in those 4 tables. The tdsls400, 401 are typically very big tables, make sure the db-stats are up to date for a query to run efficiently. <br />
Based on the example, I posted, add the tdsls400 with some fixed values and see how it is performing and then the other query for the table tdsls401. Also, change code to use the - &quot;hint use index&quot; clause.<br />
<br />
Also Refer to - Application Performance Guide - M2017 B US.pdf - Chapter 6- Profiling and Tracing.<br />
<br />
Nested queries<br />
Problem<br />
<br />
Nesting queries can reduce performance dramatically.<br />
Nested query:<br />
select  orders.ordernumber, orders.fld1, ...<br />
from    orders<br />
where   orders.ordernumber inrange :order.f and :order.t<br />
and orders.status = released<br />
selectdo<br />
    select orderlines.fld1, orderlines.fld2, ...<br />
    from orderlines<br />
    where orderlines.ordernumber = :orders.ordernumber<br />
    selectdo<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
Join nested queries into one -more complex- query.<br />
select  orderlines.fld1, orderlines.fld2, ...,<br />
        orders.ordernumber, orders.fld1, ...<br />
from    orderlines, orders <br />
where   orderlines.ordernumber inrange :order.f and :order.t<br />
and     orders.ordernumber = orderlines.ordernumber<br />
and     orders.status = released<br />
selectdo<br />
<br />
Note<br />
There are some attention points.<br />
The higher the number of records at a high level in relation to the number of records at lower level, the better is the joined way of implementation. <br />
The higher the number of selected fields (and its length is related) at a high level in relation to the number at lower level, the better the nested way of implementation. <br />
Using the above example:<br />
Number of orders is X, number of fields in orders is A. <br />
Number of order lines is Y, number of fields in order lines is B.<br />
If A is much higher than B, it is preferable to implement the nested way. <br />
If B is much higher than A, it is preferable to implement the joined way.<br />
If X is much higher than Y, it is preferable to implement the joined way. <br />
If Y is much higher than X, the joined as well the nested way can be implemented.<br />
As can be concluded, one cannot always say for sure which construction is the best.<br />
<br />
You can also add the time command to the shell script -<br />
time ORAPROF=0.0 qptool6.2 -f query_to_trace -c 123 2&gt;/dev/null</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much. Everything you said is valuable. I will try to modify my script using all your suggestions.</div></div><hr />
