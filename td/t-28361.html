Welcome<br />
Welcome to the SSA ERP Application Software Engineering guideliness which are created and maintained by the members of the work group 'Design Principles'.<br />
Within these guideliness we have tried to collect the principles of our profession. These principles represent the state-of-the art of what we believe is &#8216;right&#8217; when building software. Principles are the rules to live by; they represent the collected wisdom of many people who have learned through experience. For general principles these principles mainly come from school and literature, but more closely related to the Baan Tools they come from our colleagues that work and have worked with us.<br />
In order to be able to work as a software factory, Software Engineers must be informed about new standards (regardless of their location). These standards focus mainly on the realization phase within BDM (how should we program in a particular situation). We consider all software components within the Baan Tools repository, but due to the complexity we spent most of our time on coding. The main input comes from:<br />
Baan Tools: new functionality ask for rules and standards that tell how to use the new tools functionality <br />
Bottlenecks: problems cannot always be seen in beforehand during development, therefore quite some issues arise when our software is already general available (after sales). In that case standards are created afterwards which will result in (some) rework <br />
Opportunities: due to market development and emerging opportunities (ex. BaanSeries) we have to develop new standards with existing Tools that will be applied in a new project. <br />
Quality: sometimes too much freedom is present which becomes a danger to the uniform way of coding. <br />

Example of a personal review checklist<br />
 <br />
Nr Category Used for <br />
01 Design Code according to functional/technical design <br />
02 Documentation Correct documentation on variables, external functions, and so on. Spelling Standards for script layout <br />
03 Sessions/forms/ reports/charts Session communication, synchronization, zooming, disabling/enabling form commands (variables on) form/report/chart correct, job handling <br />
04 User-friendliness Feedback to user (progress indicator) and forgiveness- correct error handling, including clear messages, clear distinction between warnings, and errors <br />
05 Fields Disabling/enabling of fields (UI-script) Checks (for example, according to design) (DAL) <br />
06 Variables and declaration Correct declaration (fixed/static/based), using domains Use of expressive variable names, naming conventions Correct variable initialization Correct rounding // division by zero // index out of dims Maintainability: local/global/extern declaration Arrays allocated dynamically <br />
07 Functions Function call (correct (integration) function, type and sequence of arguments) No infinite recursion Return as early as possible (type of) return value Take &#8220;commit&#8221; and &#8220;abort&#8221; in function name Use of expressive names, naming conventions Reuse (libraries, includes) <br />
08 Transaction handling Correct transaction management (retry points // user interaction // locking) All fields initialized when adding records (db.set.to.default) Unwanted change of current record pointer <br />
09 Performance Optimized SQL, select no more fields or records than necessary Optimal use of query.extend Avoid unnecessary read and update actions on the database <br />
10 Other Expressions correct (for example, brackets in if-statements) Copy texts to new number when creating new record Superfluous statements &#8220;Wet feet&#8221; Other not mentioned before <br />
11 Package dependent For example, in Finance, the use of debit and credit</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">25th January 2008, 21:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to a add a check for the most popular programming flaw that I've seen over and over in badly designed Baan customizations: The excessive usage of global variables. Global variables are always a bad design decision. Unfortunately, they are unavoidable in Baan programming (tables are global and they can't be passed as function parameters). But never do this, it's so ugly it hurts:<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
     long retcode<br />
<br />
functions:<br />
<br />
function void somefoo () {<br />
     retcode = some.other.function ()<br />
     if retcode = 0 then<br />
         give.error()<br />
     else<br />
         ....<br />
     endif<br />
}<br />

I am not sure I want this to turn into a code review post - every program would probably have different styles.  I have a couple of other things that irk me in programs.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, there is no logic like java patterns, so I agree with Mark.</div></div><hr />
