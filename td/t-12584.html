<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">13th August 2003, 11:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
In standard BaaN package, a session &quot;Maintain TDS Deductions&quot; (tfacp9139s000) is invoked from &quot;Special&quot; of session &quot;Maintain Bank Transactions&quot; (tfcmg2100s000).<br />
<br />
Now, I have developed another session which also invokes the session &quot;&quot;Maintain TDS Deductions&quot; (tfacp9139s000) in the same way via &quot;Special&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now I notice that when this TDS session is started from the standard session tfcmg2100s000, it works well. (i.e. it starts in Insert mode), but when I start from my customized session the TDS session does not start in the same way. i.e. it does not start in insert mode.<br />
Moreover, I have not created a new program script for the customised session, but used the script of &quot;Maintain Bank Transactions&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does that mean that TDS session is somewhere hard-coded to  get invoked from the standard session tfcmg2100s000 only. Is my thinking right?<br />
<br />
Moreover, when a session gets invoked from &quot;Special&quot; of another session, what all sections/subsections are executed in the called session.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to solve this problem more so because I do not have the source code of the standard TDS session and Bank Transaction session.<br />
<br />
Plase help me over this.<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />
Manu</div></div><hr />

Try the following option -<br />
On the first form of the session ttadv2100m000, there is a field Start Option. Change the option here to add.set. This will open the session in the Insert mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">13th August 2003, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Morpheus,<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
If you mean that I change the start option of session &quot;Maintain TDS Deductions&quot; then I did it and it is not working.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, this session did not have a start option earlier. That means, it is programmatically controlled.<br />
Moreover, such types of sessions in which you enter some &quot;extension&quot; data, I have found out that, if info is already maintained then the session just displays the record, if not maintained then automatically goes to add record.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would be grateful if you could think of more options.<br />
<br />
What are the ways in which a called session can be hard-coded to behave in a specific way if it is called from anotehr specific session. <br />
One way to do is code in section <br />
zoom.from.&lt;session-no&gt;<br />
<br />
But, since this called session is invoked from &quot;Special&quot;, hence zoom from sections are not called.<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />

<br />
the behaviour of the called session is coded, like you already mentioned, in this session.<br />
Suppose the following:<br />
<br />
Session 1 has a call of Session 2 via Special Menu.<br />
<br />
Construct in Session 2:<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
            startup = true<br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
init.form:<br />
or<br />
before.form:<br />
    if startup = true then<br />
        if check.if.record.present() then<br />
             execute(find.data)<br />
        else<br />
             execute(start.set)<br />
        endif<br />
        startup = false<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
<br />
this is why it starts in display mode when a record is present and in insert mode when no record was found. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
<br />
Greetings<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />

<br />
Referring to this piece from your earlier post:<br />
One way to do is code in section <br />
zoom.from.&lt;session-no&gt;<br />
<br />
But, since this called session is invoked from &quot;Special&quot;, hence zoom from sections are not called.<br />
This is a wrong assumption.  Adding a special option to a form results in a &quot;user.x&quot; option.  To have such a &quot;Special&quot; option do anything, you will have to add a choice.user.x section to your code, and, in the on.choice of this, you will have to call the session that you want.  In BaanIV, this starting of a subsession is done by the function zoom.to$, therefore the zoom.from sections WILL be called.  Since you use the script of &quot;Maintain Bank Transactions&quot;, this behaviour stays the same.<br />
<br />
In the session &quot;Maintain TDS Deductions&quot;, the code probably checks the name of the parent/calling session, and acts on that.  Your new session will have a different session code than &quot;Maintain Bank Transactions&quot;, therefore the reaction of the called session is different as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true in Baan4, which it looks like Manu is running. But in Baan5,  you can zoom directly to a session from without having a choice.user.x section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">14th August 2003, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi  gfasbender<br />
<br />
Quite true.  But since Manu's profile states &quot;Baan IV c4&quot;, this seems to be the only explanation of what is going wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">18th August 2003, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear All,<br />
Thanks a lot for helping me get out of trouble.<br />
As mentioned by NvanBeest..<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
In the session &quot;Maintain TDS Deductions&quot;, the code probably checks the name of the parent/calling session, and acts on that. Your new session will have a different session code than &quot;Maintain Bank Transactions&quot;, therefore the reaction of the called session is different as well.<br />
 <br />
<br />
That is what I wanted to know how does the called session determine from where is it being called?<br />
<br />
Moreover, To determine whether the zoom.from sections are being executed in the called session or not, I did a simple test.<br />
<br />
Using bic_info, I generated a script of my own and used the external functions of the object &quot;TDS Deductions&quot;. Then, I started using this script of my own, instead of the original object on the session &quot;Maintain TDS Deductions&quot;.<br />
I tested this object, and as with the original object it was working fine with standard session &quot;Bank Transactions&quot; and now working with my developed session. Hence, I went ahead with assumption that I have not impaired the functionality of the original object.<br />
Now, I debugged the object and set a break-point of zoom.from.all section.<br />
When I ran the session, the break-point was not hit at all. It means that zoom.from section was NOT executed, in the generated script. <br />
Hence, I also concluded that the zoom.from section of the original script is NOT executed.<br />
<br />
Do you think there is a mistake in my understanding?<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />
Manu</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you please post the generated code? It would help a lot!</div></div><hr />

Please find attached the generated code.<br />
The object attached with tfacp9139s000 was otfacp9139. Now I created ptfacp9139c01 and attached with the session.<br />
