<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">a.menon</div><div class="date">6th October 2013, 08:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a form in which there are N number of fields and corresponding N check boxes. I need to hide a checkbox  corresponding to a form field if the value in the form field is &quot; &quot; . For eg <br />
<br />
if isspace (x004) then<br />
          inputfield.invisible(&quot;y004&quot;)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
where x is the prefix for the  form fields ranging from 0 to n. And y is the prefix for the checkboxes.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to loop through each form field (x) to do this check ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure if its possible, because for what you are looking for, you will need variables which will act as field names. But, program wont understand that its a form field or a variable. Again, I am not sure, there may be some undocumented function to convert a variable to a form field. <br />
<br />
Theoretically it looks possible by taking all the fields in an array and then manipulating it using a while/for loop and some pattern matching, but technically I guess its not possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">7th October 2013, 09:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I did use array-formfields in LN FP6/FP8 and looped through those array-fields by creating the strings containing the fieldnames on runtime:<br />
<br />
extern	domain	tcpono		pono(20)<br />
<br />
for i = 2 to 20<br />
if pono(i-1) = 0 then<br />
disable.fields(&quot;pono(&quot;&amp;str$(i)&amp;&quot;)&quot;)<br />
endif<br />
endfor<br />
<br />
But I don't know, whether this will work in ERP5 or not. An fieldcheck like isspace() won't work using this way - I think. That's why I used arrays.<br />
There's expr.compile() also, which could be used to calculate expressions on runtime, but I never used that before. (I just prefered using arrays for field-loops.)</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
 I tried the same with array form fields in BAAN 5 . It works like a charm! <br />
 Thanks a lot! ..</div></div><hr />
