   Can someone help me to redirect all bw error messages that are popping up on client side to a file either on server or client.  <br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

I have never tried these options but you can explore them from the BW commands in the *.BWC file -<br />
<br />
<br />
-logfile : log stdout/stderr output in <br />
-keeplog : don't remove the logfile after ending the bshell <br />
-appendlog : append to logfile (only useful with -logfile option) <br />
-nolog : stdout and stderr will go to the controlling terminal <br />
(if possible - on remote connection no output will appear)</div></div><hr />

The text will be available in the windows clipboard. You can paste the messages in most other applications with Ctrl+V.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">7th December 2002, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Option Dialog you can switch on all kind of BW loggings (&quot;Output to file&quot;). The file will come in the $BSE/tmp file on your local machine, because there also a Baan Software Environment is defined, there where the client software is installed. You can add extra loggings to the file by checking more log-options in the Option Dialog.<br />
<br />
The bshell messages are actually server messages (the bshell runs on the server) and they are logged into the $BSE/log files too or in the event viewer...</div></div><hr />

   Thanks for your inputs but I was not able to read these errors thru baan program.  May be I was not clear what I was looking for, let me explain the problem.  We have done some customizations for some standard sessions and whenever we apply a patch/solution, I wrote a session to start all customized sessions to check for any errors.  I am using activate() command to start the session and if any errors popup, I want to write those errors associated with activated session using process no returned by activate() command.  If you see  BW Error Messages, you can see the process number for each error.  I want to read this error log to get the errors linked to process id (which is equals to id returned by activate() command).<br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can also refer to this link - Issue with start.session() (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6673) <br />
<br />
So that will give you the process id of the started session.<br />
<br />
Then you can look up the corresponding error code/message by doing a pattern match (Process-xx) against the $BSE/log/log.bshell_name (which you have in your *.bwc file) in that environment.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you out.</div></div><hr />

    I dont see any log file with the pattern you mentioned in $BSE/log directory.  I dont know where I can see such a log.</div></div><hr />

Look in the event viewer, you can write the events to file and read that file.</div></div><hr />
