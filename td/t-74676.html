<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th October 2022, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">In 4c4 knowing your VRC's is important.  So I would not change my VRC to match one of the baan standard VRC's.  I can't change them anyway - no permissions.  But what I can do is copy a baan domain to my development VRC.  So for example I could copy a domain in package ti  from B40-c4-stnd to B40T-c4-dev(our dev VRC).  Now in 4c4 what I can do in maintain domains is hit the special button.  Under it I have 2 choices - make PVRC current or change current package VRC of user.  I always use change current package VRC of user - then I can double check and make sure I am in the right VRC.  Then I can change the domain in the dev VRC, convert to runtime, test it all in my dev VRC.  Once confirmed thru testing we can migrate it to production.<br />
<br />
Just remember you have to have developer permissions and access to the VRC's.  Of course I am assuming LN works the same as 4c4 for the basics.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
Domain property<br />
The Domain property is required to define the data type of the Calculated Field. <br />
You can select anexisting domain or create a new domain in the Extensions package.<br />
See the Infor LN Studio Application Development Guide.<br />
<br />

There are a couple extensions you can do on domains - you may want to check out the extensibility developers guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">14th October 2022, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no possibility to change the range with a domain extension. Seems to me a strange requirement to have other values than 0-100 for a percentage...<br />
But if you want to restrict the range, so allowing only 0-90, you can do that in the table extension for the table where the percentage is inserted. You can code this in the Is Valid hook of the field:<br />
<br />
if [your table field] &gt; 90 then<br />
    dal.set.error.message(&quot;@Percentage should be 90 or less&quot;)<br />
    return(DALHOOKERROR)<br />
endif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">6th December 2022, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I found there is some error in the importer of domains where specifically restrictions are influenced. I ran into both regex errors and &quot;XML-safe&quot; errors which I fixed manually by editing the domains in Studio and or the domain files in the model directory. No change but a correction to have them in line with the application.<br />
<br />
However you cannot import domains but when tables are imported, the used domains are imported as well.<br />
<br />
In studio select the domain, double click it and scroll down to the &quot;Restrictions:&quot; part, there you can click on the &quot;pattern&quot; where you can fix / align the restriction to make it work. <br />
<br />
In my case tdsmi.cfea now has pattern : [^=&amp;lt;&amp;gt;()\[\]{}&amp;quot;|]*<br />
This is the more or less fixed (syntactically correct) version the latest import came up with. I had to add extra escapes for the brackets and fix an &amp;amp; that came with the quot.<br />
From the importer it was : [^=&lt;&gt;()[]{}&quot;|]*<br />
In the domain the illegal characters are : =&lt;&gt;()[]{}&quot;|<br />
<br />
You can also edit the file in the model directory of your workspace<br />
*.bdt:<br />
  &lt;Facet&gt;<br />
    &lt;type&gt;pattern&lt;/type&gt;<br />
    &lt;value&gt;[^=&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;gt;()\[\]{}&amp;amp;quot;|]*&lt;/value&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Facet&gt;<br />
<br />
I just imported tcpvat and it has restrictions totalDigits 9 / fractionDigits 6 but no pattern.<br />
In the RDD version of the domain it reads: <br />
NAME:tcpvat<br />
TYPE : d<br />
DIGV : 3<br />
DIGA : 6<br />
DIVF : 1<br />
RNDO : 1<br />
OFOR : ZZ9VD999999<br />
RANG : $$ in [0,100]<br />
PLEN : 10<br />
<br />
so <br />
  &lt;Facet&gt;<br />
    &lt;type&gt;pattern&lt;/type&gt;<br />
    &lt;value&gt;[0-100]&lt;/value&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Facet&gt;<br />
is the least to expect, which is not in the tcpvat.bdt file.</div></div><hr />
