<br />
Goto BaaN IV Tools --&gt; User Management --&gt; Authorisations --&gt; Session Authorisations. You will find host of sessions for authorisation purpose.<br />
<br />
Use session ttaad2131m000 &quot; Session Authorisations by user/session&quot; , if the user has permission for all modules of a package then by entering your restricted session in this session will make it as &quot;exclusive&quot; (User is not authorised to run the session). Else if the authorisation indiactor is inclusive (User is allowed to run this session) just set the start time and end time to 00:00.<br />
<br />
I hope it solves your purpose.<br />

<br />
Set the start time as 00:00 and end time as 00:01. <br />
<br />
Setting both times as 00:00 doesnt work, cant think of why :confused:</div></div><hr />

Actually here in my company when i try to run that particular session from that specifc user then i get the attached message so i just want to figure out that how it has been done............I think at authorization level nothing has been done it must have done by some other way.<br />

But this is not smart way. Or may be you can search messages from ttadv450 field of t$mess and update contents of message.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
