 We are developing one Standard Report in Infor Reporting. We need to add few fields into design which are not part of input fields. What are the options available in Cognos Reporting Studio to Address this issue.<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated. <br />

Even better, if you are on LN 10.5, create a report extension to add fields to XML that is being sent from LN to Infor Reporting.</div></div><hr />

We are in LN 10.4 so modified report script as unable to use report extension so added fields as input fields which are missing in Standard report. I am able to add these fields in Header and it is working fine. I have added Unit field which was missing in Lines and added it to List along with quantity but once I have added this new field while printing report same line is getting printed twice. When I comment out code from details layout which I have added to get unit field, duplicate record got removed and able to see only one record or if I remove field from layout and keep code in report script still no issue.<br />
<br />
Any Idea why List record repeated once I have added code in before.layout of detail. <br />
<br />
@Ajesh: Infor Reporting has very strong feature as reporting tool compared to Baan Standard reporting as it is using IBM Cognos Reporting in background.<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">8th May 2017, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that you need to set a filter on the list. Multiple rows are written by the print session to the XML, you can check that by printing to the designer device and opening $BSE/tmp/ier_&lt;userid&gt;_&lt;report&gt;.xml. By default Infor Reporting suppresses identical rows in a list. Because you changed the data of one row by adding the unit to it, they are not identical anymore, so both are printed.</div></div><hr />

I am able to fix this issue. We need to use report input fields used in standard report layout print expression into IR design as data filter in SQL Queries.<br />
<br />
Xml file gives us information which rows need to be selected based on print expression variable condition.</div></div><hr />

Does it works on LN 10.4? <br />
<br />
I have report extension and Infor reporting, after reading the manual and add new fields on extension, they don't apear in IR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have report extension on LN 10.4 and I would like add new fields on Infor Reporting. After many tries they don't appear in input fields on infor reporting.<br />
<br />
Anyone could confirm if it is possible to do this on LN 10.4? I know Report designer is only available on  LN 10.5 and higher versions, but I think LN 10.4 with extensions (tools 10.6) is compatible.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />
