    In my system there is one customized report which displays Sales Invoice details. In that report I want to display customer order on every line of invoice line. I have added cisli245.corn in report input fields. But at the time of displaying, it shows next row record, e.g. for line number 40 there is different customer order number, but in report it displays that customer order number in line number 30. So give me any solution..<br />

Hello,<br />
corn and corp are at line level in cisli245, so it should appear at the right record.<br />
Do you use a variable, not resetted ?<br />
<br />
What Mark means, is the select in sessionscript done with &quot;select cisli245.* .......&quot; or with specific fields ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th May 2013, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">See bernd answer first.  Not sure I can help since I am not familiar with the session or the report.  I can only assist with general type questions and answers.  So if this field is passed to the report then you would need the session script to look at and maybe solve your problem.  I do not know what the session script does or sends to the report.  Next - if detail 4 is where you need the correct information, then the before layout is where you need to put a select to get the approriate data.  Again I am not familiar with this table, report or session.  Typically when I need to add something like this I add in a select in the report script since we do not own source code.  Then I just make sure the correct field is used on the layout - of course sometimes I use aliases and such for the select statements just to make sure it does not interfer with the session script or anywhere else in the report script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">15th May 2013, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting additional data on the invoice report is somewhat tricky. My advice is don't use table-fields without reading the table in the before.display-section of your layout.<br />
<br />
Infor changed the invoice-report from FP3 to FP5. They didn't just change the report name from cisli220011000 to cisli120011000, they changed the printing DLL too (from cislidll2200 to cislidll1200) and the layout-structure of the report itself.<br />
With cislidll1200 they introduced new report variables used in the report (you don't find table field in the input-fields of the invoice report).<br />
This will come handy when switching to FP8. With FP8 the old cisli-Tables (like cisli245) won't be used anymore...<br />
<br />
I recommend checking cislidll1200 first if you need to add additional information on the report. There may be some variables present, but not used in the input-fields.<br />
<br />
In our FP6 version of cislidll1200 there are two variables present:<br />
<br />
	r.customer.ord.nr = i.customer.order.number<br />
	r.cust.ord.nr.ln = i.customer.order.number.line		|#1129414.n<br />
<br />
So I think you should test r.cust.ord.nr.ln in your report. You may need to install solution 1129414 in addition to be able to use the variable in the report.<br />
<br />
I checked the FP8 version of cislidll1200 too. Infor changed the variable names, so (just in case) here they are for FP8:<br />
<br />
|	extern	domain	tcmcs.str30m	r.customer.ord.nr	|#1371107.o<br />
|	extern	domain	tcmcs.str30m	r.cust.ord.nr.ln	|#1371107.o<br />
	extern	domain	tccorn		r.h.cust.ord	|#1371107.sn<br />
	extern	domain	tccorn		r.d.cust.ord<br />
	extern	domain	tcmcs.st16m	r.d.cust.ord.line<br />
	extern	domain	tcmcs.st11m	r.d.cust.ord.seq	|#1371107.en</div></div><hr />
