These messages are flooded  in our logs and is an process overhead .</div></div><hr />

StephanOr maybe the data needs correction ... Most obvious is (you can debug report to pinpoint the exact location of the error) indeed fix the error by changing the format of the numeric field.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's certainly not an option in the sense  that there are 1000s of  places  it may be there and users  really dont use Ln reports per se in such cases  as their  data in such report is  converted to excel  and they use these XL reports for operational planning and execution. Such reports  many a times are very big in width  which simply can not  fit in a line . So the output variables on reports  are mere placeholder to get data for excel extractor . <br />
<br />
Recently after a path installation reports  started coming slow . We did revert the patch, yet the it's speed could not be improved. We have checked A/v and Ln application and folders are excluded from the A/v scans .  We see system resources . There are no bottlenecks on cpu/ram/network/hdd io . We checked db server too . That too has quite free resources on regular basis .  On careful  study  we find that Ln reports  spooler is very slow . Simple 400 page report takes about 20-25 mins . And that's where my question above.  Reports in study  does not have any complex report scripts also. <br />
<br />
Further I see the number of logs in the system is 5  only  whereas i believe i can increase it to 999 . On increasing that , i suppose as least bottleneck to find log file name may be reduced resulting in speed improvement. The problems of logs getting flooded with these entries is such acute that we can not examine  the genuine error logs also as it gets over-written with other log entries .  We are working on this  and will share how  we can improve it.<br />
<br />
PS - We have one para USE_LOGFILE . We are turning off  this and I think that should stop the logging of such errors .That should  eventually speed up our reports . I will update on this  further.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it can be an opportunity  for data correction . But in our case its not  the same as explained to stephan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turning off this has shown drastic improvement in throughput . Still will monitor overall response times . At the peak of system usage these log files are a crucial bottleneck .<br />
<br />
In the meantime if anyone has any ideas to  have more better control on log files  (like number of log files , the overall kind of data which is written in log file besides the number overflow ,dd errors ,fatal errors)  . I checked for float exception error . It did not log in the error log . <br />
<br />
Of course we can and will use the logfiles whenever required but at the individual level and NOT  at company level .<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help  in this matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th September 2023, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Man I agree - it sure would be nice if we could control what went in the log files so we could only investigate the important issues.  Even after 23 years we still get overflow errors from standard reports (and the users don't complain).  At least here our baan 4 is considered a legacy system.</div></div><hr />
