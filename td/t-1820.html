<br />
Is this possible?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">25th April 2002, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking the same thing...either table field data authorisations ttaad4135m000 or table field authorisations  ttaad4133m000. The only thing is, without testing this I'm not sure whether the authorisations are ignored by update sesions i.e where data is auto updated such as the price field you mentioned.<br />

<br />
This does sound like a problem that has been asked at a tech sig many years ago and I think it was found that it could not be done on update sessions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will do some testing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">25th April 2002, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">What about looking at it another way. Perhaps margin control against the sales price could be used to solve your problem. Margin control parameters are set at the user level so you could be very prescriptive as to who it would affect. Also the options are refuse, signal, log or block so you could effectively set the margins so that the price could not be altered.<br />
