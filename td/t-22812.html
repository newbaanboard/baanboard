<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th January 2005, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">A package combination is one or more packages with a particular VRC.  In other words a package combination is all of the packages that go into a particular version - like B40C_DEV(consisting of ti,tf,tp, etc.).  The difference between this and a PVRC is that PVRC is a specific package for a specific version - like tiB40C_DEV.<br />
<br />
Usually for standard Baan reports I just copy them to my development VRC.  At that point I can see if they have a report script.  I guess I have not run into a situation where I could not modify a report or report script that came with Baan.  In either case the report script should exist out in one of the application directories. Actually you should just be able to view it in Maintain Reports.<br />
