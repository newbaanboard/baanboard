<br />
There is an assignment to add Item Group [From-To] in the Session tdsls5401m000. For this I have copied the Form tdsls5401m0001 into my Development VRC and added citg.f and citg.t. After that I have added those two variables in declaration part in the program script [I guess this is a QKEY Script, but not sure as I am working with QKEY First Time] using &quot;extern domain&quot;. After save and compile, when I am executing the session it is giving the error &quot;Unknow Form Field citg.f&quot; &amp; &quot;Unknown Form Field citg.t&quot;. After that I checked the script once again and found those declaration of citg.f and citg.t is not there in the script. I tried those steps couple of times but no change has been taken place.<br />
<br />
May anyone please tell me what is the actual problem and how to handle this?<br />
<br />
On this context I have the following queries regarding QKEY Script<br />
1. How to identify if a Program Script is Standard UI Script or a QKEY Script?<br />
2. Is there any syntactical difference between QKEY Script with Standard <br />
    Script? I have viewed the Program Script and found some codes which I <br />
    am not familier with. [For example the following part of script<br />
<br />
    field.cuno.f:<br />
    when.field.changes:<br />
             	_pobj_exe1(&quot;when.field.changes.cuno.f&quot;)<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

You must get your declarations in the correct spot.  If you put then inside a pobj block they will be stripped out.  One thing you can do is to use the qkey editor - I think it is qkvi.  This will open the script, strip out all qkey commands.  Then you can put your code in.  You can see an example that I put up in the code and utilities forum.</div></div><hr />
