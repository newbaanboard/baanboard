<br />
I created a table with about 10 fields including one text field.  The index had to be alphanumeric and because I wasn't thinking too clearly on Friday, I used tcseak as the domain.<br />
<br />
Everything was fine except that when I edited text, the BW error message box would pop up with the error above - both when I needed to create a new text as well as when editing an existing text.<br />
<br />
It took a while and lots of trial and error in copying the table and slowly cutting out fields and CRDD'ing many times to get the table down to the single index field and the text fields and the error was still happening.  I then changed the domain of the index field to tcitem - and the error WENT AWAY!!!<br />
<br />
I took a look at the domains and the only difference is that tcitem is left aligned while tcseak is not aligned.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed any light on why this happens?  I took a look on the BAAN web site and there are many issues with similar texts and all of the solutions were just &quot;that was fixed with this patch&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

There are all sorts of special rules for multi byte:<br />
