<br />
<br />
I am executing a standard report, now i need to print it on some condition.<br />
If that condition evaluates to TRUE, report will be printed, if it evaluates to false, a message should be displayed and report will not be printed..<br />
<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that i have report script only.....i need to stop it from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestions are welcomed<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th June 2011, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really sure this is possible since the session does the report open and the report close.  The problem I see if you exit or end the report before the report close is that you leave something hanging on the device.  For example if in the before program you put:<br />
<br />
if somecondition then<br />
   message(&quot;Report stopped&quot;)<br />
   end()<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Now when you run the report to the display like D66 - if the condition is true the report will exit.  Then if you check your processes from the option dialog using start shell you will see something hanging on ttstpdisplay(or maybe ottstpdisplay).  If I recall correctly the bw client will not exit cleanly until you kill these.  You can test this.<br />
<br />
I think the best you can do is suppress all the printing using the print condition.  Just let a blank page or report pop up.  You can look at using one of the source extenders - free one in code and utilities by ~vamsi.  Without knowing the exact details I am not even sure that will help.</div></div><hr />
