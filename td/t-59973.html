<br />
I want to add session tfacp2522m000 - Business partner open entries as form command in session tfacp1110s000 (Purchase Invoices which is opened from Maintain Transactions tfgld1101m000), so that whenever the session tfacp2522m000 is opened from specific menu of tfacp1110s000, it displays open entries of BP already specified in tfacp1110s000.<br />
<br />
I could link the session tfacp2522m000 in specific menu but when it is opened, it does not display open entries of the BP specified in parent session. Has anybody done similar thing ? Pl guide.<br />

But, in case of Baan IV, you need to write code to import date from parent session, and show the corrosponding record in the zoomed session (tfacp2522m000 in your case).</div></div><hr />

I also tried synchronized option but no luck. Importing BP code in called session is also not possible in our case as we do not have source.<br />

Did you ever get this resolved?  I'm trying to do something similar in LN.  I want to display the current transaction (tfgld1101m000) from the attached batches from finalization run (tfgld1111s000).<br />
<br />
So far I have put a custom session that's called in specific.  In the code, am importing the values and then zooming to the transactions session.  It always goes to the last record.<br />

before.program:<br />
	import(&quot;tfgld100.btno&quot;,tfgld100.btno)<br />
	import(&quot;tfgld100.year&quot;,tfgld100.year)<br />
	zoom.to$(&quot;tfgld1101m000&quot;, z.session, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
end()</div></div><hr />
