Are you getting &quot;%&quot; as a field value?<br />
You should find first ..what value are you really getting from the table before print.<br />
message the value and check.<br />
if you get &quot;%&quot; as a value in message then check your script and domain.<br />
Domain which you are using for that field clould be the problem area.<br />
<br />
Hope it willhelp you.<br />

<br />
You might want to post your code so we can see how are you retrieving the field value and the domain you are using.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">22nd December 2008, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the domain of this input field?<br />
<br />
Just for us to know, are you trying this in LN/Baan V?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ipineda</div><div class="date">23rd December 2008, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working in LN, and the field is &quot;tdpur400.odat&quot; and the domain is tcdate. It is really strange cause in some cases the report is right but i have compared the orders and they have the same structure, in both cases the data is in the report script when i used the debugger but the character &quot;%&quot; is still there when the report is shown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raikar_raviraj</div><div class="date">23rd December 2008, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Check if &quot;%&quot; appears in such cases where tdpur400.odat is null, or if it appears randomly. Also suggest you to check which date format is used with domain<br />
tcdate, see whether the same format is being used in the report layout.</div></div><hr />
