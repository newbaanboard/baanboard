<br />
How can I define a form field to be a multi occurrence field in BaaN LN?( we could define the same in BaaN IV)<br />
Im developing a multi-occurrence session (with view field) having following fields on its form,<br />
<br />
Item(main table field)      Item Description(problematic form field)                Quantity(main table field, editable)<br />
<br />
The item description is populated in the after.field section of Item.<br />
Consider following scenario before quantity is entered,<br />
<br />
Item                 Description                   Quantity<br />
<br />
ABC                desc1                           0.0<br />
XYZ                desc2                           0.0<br />
<br />
Whenever I try to change the quantity, the description for first item (ABC) is wrongly changed to desc2 as shown below<br />
<br />
Item                 Description                   Quantity<br />
<br />
ABC                desc2                           10.0<br />
XYZ                desc2                           0.0<br />
<br />
Kindly note that the after.field section of item is not executed on change of quantity (as expected). The dynamic form apparently is treating the form field (description) as a single occurrence field. Is there any way to resolve this or achieve the same functionality?<br />
<br />
<br />
Cya !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">The quantity is a editable field. The moment the user tries to enter a value in this field , the descriptions goes haywire :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be wrong in your item desc finding part in after.field. Try following<br />
after.field:<br />
  <br />
    if update.status = add.set then <br />
      find.item.desc<br />
    endif <br />
<br />
This may help you !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">The after.field section of item field is not at all executed on any attempt to change the quantity field. Like i mentioned before , the dynamic form apparently treats the form field to be of single occurence(altough it shows as multioccurence). Hence the last value of description is shown in all occurences throughout the form.<br />
<br />
This problem was solved in BaaN IV by declaring the field as multi-occurence field.<br />
Can you please elaborate further on your proposed solution? Im not getting the link between update.status and logic for getting the description .<br />
<br />
Thnx for your interest.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I am aware of your problem and  I try to understand your program mechanism.I gave  update.statu solution . because  in every record update operation, It won't effect other field description.It will only effects updated record. Before I faced the problem like yours. I solved it by using update statu conditon. As a  Consequence, My aim is to assist and give some idea. <br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rjohmit</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a couple things I can suggest, although I use Baan 4c4...not LN.<br />
<br />
On the description field, use before.field or before.display and do a simple select on tiitm001 to get the description.<br />
<br />
Second, the do.all.occ(function_name) function will execute, for all occurences, the function given as the argument.  As a simple example, you could do:   do.all.occ(display.all).  This function may be of some use.</div></div><hr />

The tools will automatically read the correct value.<br />

<br />
Apparently the description was changing to the description of last record in before.input section of editable field and even the debugger was unable to catch the change.(i had put a trace on the description in debugger)<br />
<br />
I managed to get the correct descriptions by calling foll. function , <br />
void display.fld( long occurrence, field ) <br />
in the before.input section of the editable field.<br />
<br />
Thanx all for ur inputs :)<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />
