<br />
I've changed a menu (tssoc3003m000) to add a new print session. But after saving and compiling the new menu version will not shown in the browser for Ming.le GUI.<br />
<br />
To change the menu I have copied the menu by &quot;copy to currcent P-VRC&quot; form VRC &quot;b61C a8 pr10&quot; to &quot;b61C a8 wk20&quot;. Both a separate development levels. In Ming.le my user have grant to access the VRC &quot;b61wk20&quot;. So where seems to be the problem. Maybe cause the are additional VRCs with &quot;b61U a8 stnd&quot;<br />
<br />
Or is there an other reason? And I'm running into the wrong direction for that problem?<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

<br />
I've not to open the Ming.le-GUI. Instead I've to open the WebUI. In the WebUI there is the program tree in the left upper section. In this tree I've to navigate to the last upper menu (where the new menu is included). Then I've to collapse the menu list with the &quot;-&quot;Button. The button changed to &quot;+&quot;. After collapsing the list I've to right-click on the &quot;+&quot; Symbol. There is the Context-Menu with the &quot;Refresh&quot; option. After refreshing the menu list, the new menu was displayed also in the Ming.le GUI after restart.<br />

yes your right! I haven't executed the &quot;create runtime&quot; for the menu. But where can I find that? It's no context option and also not listed in the menu branch!?<br />

<br />
The Code of the Session is ttadv5214m000 and it is situated in ..Tools ----.Application Development ---&gt;Runtime Data Dictionary.<br />
<br />
Another thing which you can check is that whether you can run the print session in a stand alone mode and not from the Menu.. this way you can verify whether the problem is there really in the Menu or not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks again for your fast reply. <br />
Funny was too: in Worktop the &quot;application development&quot;-branch was shown but not in the Ming.le or WebUI-environment like it was for the &quot;new&quot; menu I've create. I've did the workaround with &quot;refresh&quot; in the WebUI for the &quot;tools&quot;-branch. Yet the &quot;application development&quot;-branch also exists for WebUI and Ming.le. <br />
But now I can't check your solution: ..Tools ----.Application Development ---&gt;Runtime Data Dictionary. Sorry :-(<br />
<br />
Somehow, I believe it depends on the migration from LN to a new server.<br />
<br />

<br />
Couple of things i would suggest<br />
<br />
1) Just try running ttadv5214m000 from the Run Program of Ming.le or Web UI. I dont know how these two(Ming.le or Web UI) works but i think there would be run Program Option in these interfaces. In LN Worktop, Baan V, Baan IVc4 there is a Run Program option, its present in the File Menu.<br />
<br />
2)Does the Package Combination of the attached User , who is logging in the Baan System, has the Package VRC b61wk20, in its ts Package or atleast the Package VRC in the Package VRC's derivation structure?Maybe the Package Combination of the attached User doesnt have the Package VRC in its derivation structure<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly you could check whether this is happening for more than one Menus or more than one Menus in more than one Package VRC's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've did step 1.) running ttadv5214m000 to be sure that all menus will be available. But till yet I haven't missed others.<br />
<br />
Cause anything is well now, I hope to get no further problems with missing menus :-)<br />
<br />
