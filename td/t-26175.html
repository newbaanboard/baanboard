<br />
i m again in trap of BaaN...plz help me ,<br />
<br />
i need to import data from an Excel sheet with 65000(near about 17 similar files ) rows (on a frequent basis...so i hav to giv an easy-to-use interace to my client)...and dont just to import but to perform lots checks, validations and business constraints on the data coming from excel... like if ther is an item in excell sheet so tht particualr item line will be allowed to enter into baan only when it is there in a particular sales order type else generate a message to include it first in SO Type the let him/her import it...<br />
<br />
another check is- Perform validations to ensure that the customer code, item code and price books exist within ERPLN.  Otherwise, provide appropriate error messages/report and prevent users from importing data until reference data has been set up correctly within ERPLN. ,other than this ther are various checks...<br />
so please show me the way how should I go about it (in detail...if u can ..plz take care of me as i m new to all this)..should i use Exchange Scheme utility or some third party tool is there ...or if any of you hav some script to perform this or similar task please give that to me...<br />
sorry if i hav written something wrong...<br />
<br />
thanks &amp; regards,<br />
Dilip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd January 2006, 03:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend using AFS.  Checkout that forum.  You would basically read in the file from Excel(using comma delimited) and then run the sessions in background mode for the user.  So instead of the user entering the data you read it in and process for the users.  Of course I am not sure how efficient anything will be with 65000 rows.  <br />
<br />
I think there is another way in LN, I think it is using the DAL libraries or something like that.  You can search this forum for DAL.<br />
<br />
With exchange you have to do all the checking and make sure all of the appropriate tables get loaded.  If you know all tables to be loaded then this would probably be quicker than the AFS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd January 2006, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a link to the sticky post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7251) in the AFS forum.   You can read how to use stpapi commands to run sessions for users taking input from something like an Excel file.<br />
<br />
Here is another http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=25634&amp;highlight=DAL about using DAL.  I do not have any experience using DAL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dilipk.pandey</div><div class="date">24th January 2006, 07:33</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks seniors!!!<br />
<br />
first of all thanks to mark who helped me a lot...again i m out of baan trap...and further, i dont know why somebody having good knowledge never wants to spread it out...ofcourse everybody knows the role &amp; importance of a forum and its members...and no one join it for some traingin sort of purpose...what i was looking for , i got that from this forum...even if someone takes it negatively to learn and share new things from forums...i wud say grow with your ideas...<br />
<br />
again thanks a lot to those who believe in &quot;Let the noble thoughts come from every side...&quot;...(i apologise if i hav hurt somewhere...)...<br />
<br />
with best regards,<br />
dilip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th January 2006, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem from me and I really do not think en was as upset as the message sounded.  He does have a point that some request more than is possible in the forums.  I usually point them to some threads or if I have an example available I will post it, then leave the thread.  So no problem here and you will find plenty of people willing to share answers - including en@frrom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">24th January 2006, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, first of all, I removed my post from yesterday, in order to avoid unnecessary frictions on our board. I agree with Mark, and I dare saying even a bit more than he dares. <br />
<br />
This board is for everybody, from bright to less bright, and from seniors to juniors. However, often we see people posting threads here, who lack any basic knowledge in the field they are posting a question about, yet they want a detailed explanation (course/training) in a few lines of forum-answer. This is not constructive; not for the people answering the threads, nor for the people receiving the answers. A person who lacks basics should either hire a consultant or get decent training. <br />
<br />
Second point is, that people should not be so aggressive and demanding while requesting assistance. It is no fun to assist someone when he &quot;threatens&quot; how urgent and bad the problem is with 10 exclamation marks, using capitals etc..<br />
<br />
Bottom line, I know that I speak also in the name of many of my friends here on the board when I say the above, and also when I say that I love this board, which is the most powerful online Baan-resource in the world. We just want it to stay as powerful, professional and friendly as it is. <br />
<br />
For all clearity: Of course I try to help &quot;juniors&quot; with their questions! No doubt about it, and I do it with great pleasure. I also was once a junior...<br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards, <br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />
