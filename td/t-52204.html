<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARUNSNAIR</div><div class="date">21st May 2008, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually i have a file which has been transferred into the baan server using SFTP and the file is in some different mode. As a result when i am trying to read this file using the seq.gets(), baan is not able to identify the line seprator and the eof() indicator gets reset.<br />
<br />
What should i do to open this file and use it, so that te program logic doesn't change. I am also not thinking of using any convert programs etc due to the security concern of the company</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">21st May 2008, 19:37</div></div><div class="posttext">If the file is generated from windows and the transfer was in binary mode, the translation of CRLF characters is different on Unix systems. <br />
You have to transfer it using ASCII mode. <br />
If isn't possible to transfer it again from the original system, you can:<br />
<br />
- transfer the file in any windows system using FTP binary mode<br />
- transfer it again to Unix using FTP ASCII mode<br />
<br />
This must correct the problem.<br />
<br />
PS.: In unix are some commands that do this without using ftp, unfortunatly I havent this time access to unix system, search in unix for dos2unix command or something similar...</div></div><hr />
