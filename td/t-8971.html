<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J.R. Einhorn</div><div class="date">21st February 2003, 00:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello -- We run Baan IVc2 on AIX servers.  We do not allow users to telnet to the Baan server, nor do we allow them to shell out of Baan, for security reasons.  But some of our users create report files that go to their default home directories and then use a generic ID with ftp to pull those files to other machines.  These reports can build up.  We are not permitted to delete old files because you never know when an old file will turn out to be critical to business.<br />
<br />
I wonder if anyone has created a customized session to allow users to delete their files.  I imagine that there should actually be two session -- one to list all home directory files, and one to delete files based on a user-supplied file specification that could contain the &quot;*&quot; wildcard but not the &quot;/&quot; character (could be used to try to delete application files).  Has anyone developed such a session or sessions?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

You can create a session [like the one I have used for a file browser] which shows the contents of the home directory then after a file is selected it can be programmed to be deleted-yes/no using the functions - file.rm() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_directory_file_operations_file_rm)  and seq.unlink() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_directory_file_operations_seq_unlink) .<br />
<br />
Please refer to the thread - File Browser (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1844&amp;highlight=file+browser)</div></div><hr />
