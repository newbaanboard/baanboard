I want to capture values entered on form for the CRDD session.<br />
<br />
What kinds of solutions are available?<br />
<br />

<br />
since it is a tools session I can't think of any practical way.<br />
What you could try though is to use the DEBUG switch when starting the bshell. Make sure that only one user can access the tools menus and that this user always has DEBUG activated. Easy to do with ba6.1, tricky with GUI.<br />
But this has some drawbacks, first of all that you will have to rename the files with the debug-information to keep them, but secondly (and this is the main problem) these files may get REAL big.<br />
May I ask why you want to capture the input?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th June 2005, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">There are things with wrappers and / or api's that you can do to track this.<br />
<br />
API:  You could make your own session that looks just like CRDD, same inputs (ok, similar, because you can't use tt domains).  You can put logging to a table or file of your choice, then use api's to call the stadnard CRDD session, assuming API's work.  I have not tried this.<br />
<br />
Wrappers (QKEY, RMCgen, rush):  You can wrap the CRDD session itself and put your logging before the continue process.  The wrappers will have the tools issues too, but we have gotten around this before with table entries...if that's the option you are choosing and have problems post up, I will try and answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was wonderful.... I was thinking only API calls as the solution and the reason i made the post is to know whether any other solution existed...<br />
<br />
Can you please give me more info regarding Wrappers, I will appreciate that.<br />
