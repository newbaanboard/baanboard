what is the right way to include dll's?<br />
<br />
With the command <br />
<br />
#include &quot;xyz&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
When do I use the preprocessor instruction?:<br />
<br />
<br />
#pragma used dll        &lt;dll objectname&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdittmar</div><div class="date">17th January 2020, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Include files (preprocessor)<br />
To include files, use one of the following statements:<br />
<br />
#include &quot;filename&quot;<br />
#include &lt;filename&gt;<br />
Files included between '&lt;' and '&gt;' are searched for in the directory '$BSE/include&lt;rel.number&gt;'. This directory is reserved for system headers and cannot be used for applications. Normally a file specified between quotes is searched for using the standard file redirection method. <br />
<br />
Note that the preprocessor works only during compilation of a 3GL source, as the standard generator std_gen6.2 does not have a preprocessor pass. So it is not possible to use 4GL events in an included file. <br />
<br />
Example<br />
Suppose the following entry occurs in $BSE/lib/fd.6.2&lt;package_comb&gt;: <br />
<br />
ippmmm:/usr/bse/standard6.2<br />
and there is an include statement as follows:<br />
<br />
#include &quot;ippmmmheader&quot;<br />
The file &quot;/usr/bse/standard6.21/ippmmm/immmheader0&quot; is included. If a '/' occurs in the filename, the file is searched using the specified path name. When a file is included twice, the second include is ignored. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Function overloading<br />
When DLLs are dynamically linked at runtime, instead of at compile time, function overloading is possible. This means that an external function contained in a loaded DLL can be replaced by overloading another DLL that contains a function with the same name and arguments. <br />
<br />
You use the load_dll() function to load DLLs dynamically. When you call this function, you can specify whether the DLL is to be overloaded or not. When searching for an external function called by a program, the bshell always searches in overloaded DLLs first. <br />
<br />
Specifying which DLLs belong to an object<br />
There are three methods for specifying which DLLs belong to an object. <br />
<br />
Specify the DLL dynamically, with overload, in the source code. For example: load_dll( &lt;dll_object&gt;, DLL_OVERLOAD ) <br />
Specify the DLL statically at compile time. There are three ways to do this: <br />
use the option &quot;Define Libraries&quot; in the session &quot;Maintain Program Scripts&quot; <br />
use the following syntax when starting the bic6.2 compiler bic6.2 script -o object -d dll_object <br />
use the following pragma code in the script #pragma used dll &lt;dll_object&gt; <br />
Specify the DLL dynamically, without overload, in the source code. For example: <br />
load_dll( &lt;dll_object&gt;, 0 ) or<br />
load_dll( &lt;dll_object&gt; )    | 0 is default<br />
<br />

<br />
#include is used at compile time. It tells the preprocessor to include the file, so that the compiler can process the file. After #include and compile, the &quot;Function&quot; (the #include file) is not needed to  run the object.<br />
<br />
#pragma tells the compliler to use a DLL at runtime. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
