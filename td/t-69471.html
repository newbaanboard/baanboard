My problem is with removing a table reference.  I can't seem to get the system to recognize that the reference to the parent table should no longer be checked.  It's a custom table listing contacts by BP/Location address.  There was a combined field of BP/Contact that had a mandatory reference to tccom145 (Contacts by BP).  The business decided that they wanted to allow entry to this custom table of contacts related not only to the BP in the record, but to the ship-to BPs associated with it.  So, remove the table reference and add code to check the contact.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the system still checks the reference of the combined field to tccom145.  To remove this I have tried:<br />
- changing the reference to not mandatory<br />
- removing the reference altogether<br />
- removing the combined field altogether<br />
I have converted and even created runtime DD and logged out repeatedly.  But I still get the &quot;606 reference does not exist&quot; on the combined field that no longer exists at all.  So what else can I do? where is it storing this reference?  I've checked the file for the table in $BSE/dict. The combined field is gone.  No reference to tccom145.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

So the custom table and tccom145.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mark is right. It requires re configuring both the tables.<br />

Yes, thanks.  Ran both convert to runtime DD and Create Runtime DD with open ranges.  Still doesn't work.  Even tried dropping the tccom145 table and recreating it.</div></div><hr />

Confirm they are getting deleted and recreated?  You might also need to check shared memory. I have seen these hang and not really convert.  Not sure what our sysadmin does to force it to happen.</div></div><hr />
