How do I to display an array of check-boxes as a form field in a multi-occ session. Please note that this array is not a table field but a local variable in a program script. Basically what I want to do is allow user to select a particular record(s) without having to use the Ctrl or shift button and highlighting multiple records.<br />
Any idea on how I can achieve this?<br />
<br />
Im using Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

That should give u the result u desire .</div></div><hr />

Actually thats what I had done but it doesnt work. Basically I created an array (check(999999)) of domain tcyesno and put it on the form. However, no matter which occurence I change on the form from No to Yes, when I check this array in the script, only the check(1) has a value of Yes and the rest all are No.<br />
<br />
So it seems like on the form, there is just 1 field check(1) and all the other elements of this array arent even on the form. How do I manage to put the entire array on the form without having to hardcode it on the form?<br />

Thanks,<br />

Instead of the check box you can use a combo box. The user can choose between &quot;Yes&quot; &amp; &quot;No&quot;. A good example for that is Maintain Countries (last column- attached). Check its form, I am sure you can copy it and play with it.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

Cant use your example in my code as the field EU Member(Yes/No) is a table field and not just a local variable defined at script level.<br />
<br />
In addition I am actually using a combo box instead of a check-box for now for testing purposes, though our preference is a check-box (one-click instead of 2 needed in a combo-box).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Manish.<br />
PS: any other suggestions are more than welcome. Im also attaching the script and form snapshots (incase Im doing so:confused: mething wrong).</div></div><hr />

Just looking at your script you use check(actual.occ) - and more than likely the only field on the form is check(1).  I think you will have to put the check boxes on the form as single occurance and use the element field.  So if you form as 10 occurances for the form then put 10 check boxes on the form with elements 1 to 10.  Of course this will not allow you to track across screens.  Are you trying to track across screens?  Even baan does not do that, except with select range.</div></div><hr />

Well I dont want to track across multiple forms if that is what you mean.<br />
<br />
However, I cannot put say 10 check/combo boxes on the form as I need as many c-boxes as there are records in the MRP Planned orders table. So I cannot hardcode the number the number of c-boxes.<br />

<br />
You answered my question about multiple screens with this statement.  You want 1 check box for every record in the MRP planned orders table.  At this point I would say your best bet is to either modify the table to include the check boxes or to create another table for the session to hold these check fields.  There are several ways to do this with other tables.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your suggestions. I just thought of an idea on how to make this work without adding new field to teh table. Im planning on using the existing status field in timrp021 as a combo box and displaying just the Planned and Confirmed statuses. <br />
Ideally would've preferred to display a checkbox but I guess I wont be able to use the status field as a checkbox somehow, right?<br />
<br />
Reason we really want to use a checkbox is simply because it takes just one click to select or unselect a record whereas a combo-box requires 2-3 clicks ... and users are pretty anal about the number of clicks considering they can have a coupla hundred orders that they need to work on regularly.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Boy ain't that the truth.  :)  Glad you found a solution.</div></div><hr />

Manish.<br />
<br />
My suggestion was different . Creating an array of such a big size looks totally unwarranted . If u restructure ur requirement and program u can easily work with an array of max total occurence numbers  in the form e.g. 20 . <br />
<br />
Further the variable to be put on the form (ie i.check) should not be an array. <br />
<br />
You can definitely let users  use the check boxes  on the form with 2  enum selection (not the order status ).<br />
<br />
Ideally when u wish users to do multiple selections across forms either there should be a field in the table or selected secords be inserted /deleted  in a separate table which keeps track of  array values  in after.update.db.commit section .<br />
<br />
Nevertheless if ur  solution is really working for u, u need not work in this direction .</div></div><hr />
