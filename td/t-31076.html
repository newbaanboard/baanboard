I customise the Purchase order document for a customer. The whole section with order lines should be surrounded by a big box. This is achievd by , on every layout, having a graphical pipe as leftmost and rightmost char in the layout. No problems so far.<br />
<br />
But the following happens. <br />
When the data to be printed in a layout  is a text (domain tctxtn), the graphical pipes in each end will be moved to the left or right, and it is no box anymore that surrounds the data.<br />
<br />
On my development system (Single byte) all works fine. When I installed the report with the customer (Unicode), this happens.<br />
<br />
Important may also be that the text field in the layout has a 'user font'. When I try the standard font it is OK.<br />
<br />
I may add that all other printing (except texts) works fine from this aspect.  There are both single byte and multi byte domains represented. And fields with 'user font'.<br />
<br />
The customer's environment is LN6 FP2 on MS-SQL on windows. And whatever has to be there to make it 'Unicode'.</div></div><hr />

If it's a proportional font than it's normal that you own designed box is not printed nicely since some characters need more space than others.<br />
You need to use a non-proportional font to make this work with standard baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">9th February 2007, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">My user font is proportional (arial). <br />
The mystery is that <br />
1) it works fine anyway in the single byte system <br />
2) in the unicode system the layouts with other user font fields , e.g. item, description, vendor's item ... works fine. Only the text messes it up when I use the user font. It is messed up equally much if the text is just one character as if the text are e.g. ten characters. (But gets OK when using the standard (non-proportional) font but the customer is not happy with this.)</div></div><hr />
