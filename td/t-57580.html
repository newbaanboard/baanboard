<br />
We would like to find documentation on the Baan IV API's.<br />
The aim is to control Baan from a language like Java,<br />
possibily some Web Services.<br />
<br />
Is there some documentation available in the internet because<br />
after some research I don't see any documentation on these API's ?<br />
<br />
Another solution which would suit us would have a &quot;Baan daemon&quot; which<br />
would wait for a file to be written in some directory. Then this file<br />
would be read by the Baan application and a &quot;transaction&quot; would be called<br />
and some data inserted into some table.<br />
<br />
The last solution we have would be to &quot;scrap&quot; and exchange data with the Baan windows application to simulate a user typing data and retrieving data from the screen. We would be kinda remote-controlling the windows app and it seems a very good solution. I saw this solution running while attending a Baan users gathering in Luxembourg. A guy from the Bull company made this demo and we were quite impressed with the results !<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help !!<br />

Then you can check this forum (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=15) on open world to see if there is anything there to help.  Other than that I not sure where other information is - you should always check with infor for current documentation.</div></div><hr />
