Find the record that is bad. Then go to the temp file that was created for the report and look for that record.  Check and make sure that there is not corrupt data.  My suspicion is that usually a field gets corrupted with a control character of some sort.</div></div><hr />

I have attached the debugger, at line 209 the if is executing and the error is shown up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your problem is resolved or still open? As Mark suggested, put the report in the debugger and check the temp file that is generated for the report, open the temp file in the Notepad and check if all lines have same number of record elements(fields), the first record element and lat record element are same per line. <br />
<br />
I suppoes that there should be some hidden &quot;line feed&quot; character with the data and you must find at least one line which has different number of record elements (record elements are separated with &quot;,&quot;). Note this line, and also ckeck the line above and below as one is the part of the line which has problem.  The last or first field in the line has some problem in the data, correct it in the related session. <br />
<br />
May be you can get the some other information in the line like transaction type, batch number, document number etc. Print the report by providing these specific information and make it conform that report has the same problem.  <br />
<br />
I hope you have enough clue to fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Best of luck<br />

<br />
We are facing same issue above.<br />
we looked for file to be printed but not able to found that file.<br />
Can some one please tell the path where we can search the file contains data for report printing which may be having corrupt records?<br />
<br />
or any other solution to tackle this error as we can't debug the report.</div></div><hr />

Put it in debug mode and walk thru the report.  You can get the tmp file name and go look at it to see what it looks like.</div></div><hr />
