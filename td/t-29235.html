I wonder that does anyone create GRAPH from textfile or baan session without<br />
chart manager on Baan IV ? . To create graph I extracts data into excel and manually create graph.<br />
<br />
Do you know different ways to use GRAPHs ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can write an Excel macro that will automatically generate a graph for pre defined columns. Then configure your excel sheet/template to run this macro whenever you open your excel file.<br />
<br />
The macro should read the data from a text file and it also should know the columns that you want to include in your graph (depending on a text file).<br />
<br />
I used to run this macro automatically from B2Win (http://nazdaq-it.com/utilities.php?prod=bwinse-pro) to get my graph.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th December 2006, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">We used macros to do graphs.  What we did in most cases was to create an excel version of a report(headers once, no totals,etc.).  Then we wrote macros to read the reports in and create graphs or charts.  I actually created a device call PCEXCEL which takes the report name( like rticrp940601200), looks up the macro, and launches the macro for the user.  So we have a common location on our Netware server for our Excel macros.  So in baan I store the report, the download name, and the macro to launch in a table.  When the user uses the device PCEXCEL I look up the report name and get the download name(includes directory path) and launch the macro.  I actually included site in the table so different sites can launch different macros, but site is no longer needed.  It used to be each site had its own macro and location to run excel from - but these were standardized within the last couple of years.</div></div><hr />
