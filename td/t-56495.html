<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rreichenbach</div><div class="date">7th August 2009, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, in many MMT sessions there is plenty of space after a label field before the real field occurs on the header form. This is a waste of space and when you have a lot of information on a form this ends up in a session where you always have to scroll to get all information. so the question is if there is a possibility to change the spaces after a label and if there are more labels below each other to set it i.e. to the size of the largest label plus x.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Occurence Independent Select this check box if the value of the current form field is not dependent on the actual occurence. Note that this only applies for viewfields that are not part of the maintable and are defined as a viewfield in the Dynamic Form Editor. <br />
Dependent on Parent Field If this check box is selected, the current form field is dependent on another field. That other field can be a parent field or, if the parent is not a field, the field above the current form field. If the other field is shown, the current form field is shown behind or below the field depending on the relation between the two fields.<br />
Note<br />
A dependent child field can be removed at run time without removing its parent field. For example, as a result of authorization limitations.<br />
 <br />
Child Field(s) Behind If this check box is selected, the child field appears immediately behind its parent field.<br />
Note<br />
If the child field is not positioned immediately behind the current field, the child field is aligned with other child fields in groups with the same alignment.</div></div><hr />
