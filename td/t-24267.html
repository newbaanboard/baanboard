I have a little problem. One of form is very bigh in width and not fit in the screen. I want to split it in the two form. I splitted it as I duplicated the first form and removed some of fields from the duplicated forms. After that compiled btoh forms and session. Now, when I try to acces the form2, getting error message as <br />
<br />
&quot;form cannot reach&quot; <br />
<br />
What I must further do to remove this error.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance <br />

This problem is resolved, but a small part is remains. One of the field of data type Enumerated is reamins diplay only in the second form. I want to make that field as Input. If I put the same field in the first form it can be as Input but in the second form it always remains as Display. What could be the resolution?<br />

Thanks in advance<br />

Please describe how you resolve the problem for other's benefit.<br />
<br />
Is that field part of the index and view field ? If so, they are allowed to be modify only on the first form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This problem is resolved by adding the standard commands in the form (List of form, first form, previous form, next form and last form).<br />
<br />
NpRao: This field is not the part of the Index. What do you mean by the part of &quot;view field&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

View Field If this check box is selected, the current form field is a view field shown above the grid when an overview session is started., If the Dependent on Parent field is selected, the View Field property is not relevant, because its value is the same as the value of its parent-field. So a dependent field appears in the view, when its parent also appears in the view, otherwise the dependent field appears in the grid (when the overview session is started).</div></div><hr />
