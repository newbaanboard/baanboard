<br />
I have the following problem but I also want to say that I am working on a package not standard to baan so table names are irrelevant.<br />
<br />
In one session upon a add.set choice a record is created in one table that is supposed to hold &quot;header&quot; records, let's name it 031.<br />
<br />
So When I choose to add a record in one session a new record is created in table 031 and if all goes ok by clickin on save there would be a record also in the table 150. But if I click on Cancel then this record from 031 that was created should be deleted. The problem is that it can not be deleted?!? Errors I get are 605 reference exists. The problem is I can not find that reference. I tried looking in all the tables I thought that could be referenced and nothing. I tried with the session Print where used tables to see all references any other table has on this 031 table and also references that 031 table can have on other tables. All tables I get I checked and nothing, no sign of referenced records?!?!<br />
<br />
I am out of ideas on how to solve this, any sugestion is very welcome.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drifter</div><div class="date">30th August 2003, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for help but in logs there is nothing, ok nothing in log from oracle, in Baans log there is only additional error mentioned 520 with the 602 which was shown in BW message window. This 520 is something about buffered updates, anyway that is what it says in help.<br />
<br />
But thanks I am shure I will use this advice in future :)<br />

Without seeing how the updates occur it is kind of hard to point you in a direction.  It sounds like a transaction may still be hung up or not processed.  The code may help someone see what the problem is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drifter</div><div class="date">2nd September 2003, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">It's solved. The problem was that one combined field had a reference on this table but not with all the right fields in the combined field.<br />
<br />
Tanks for help<br />

Here you can enter the key values of the main table (data) and it will tell you which tables refer to the key value.<br />
