You can use the tools function - to.field() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_form_and_form_field_operations_to_field) <br />
 previous value is carrying forword . I want to remove it . I need blank for the field. No value should be there. <br />
That is the BaaN Standard tools behaviour. If you like to change it you have to do some coding to set default values, like -<br />
<br />
field.field1:<br />
before.input:<br />
	if update.status = add.set then<br />
		field1 = 100<br />
	endif</div></div><hr />

N. Prashanth Rao<br />
<br />
Thanks for quick reply .<br />
First problem i have solved through form only . In form I have set default value = &quot; &quot; . So when it comes into next field then it comes as a blank record .<br />
<br />
Now question is how I pass TAB key value with out pressing TAB key. I have checked to.fiekd() , but it use after.field , after.display .<br />
It is not solve the problem. <br />
<br />
From Visual basic there is a systex like <br />
<br />
sendkeys(&quot;{TAB}&quot;},true<br />
<br />
But I hope there is option for going next field without pressing TAB key, When it reach the last char of that field.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

IF you had a field of 10 characters and the users can enter 0-10 characters how would you know the last character of that field unless you specify that the field always needs 10 characters or press TAB key to notify to move to the next field.<br />
<br />
You can look up the tools help manual for more info into -<br />

<br />
Last time i scan the barcode after passing the value of chr(9) in barcode .<br />
At that time we ware using the &quot; Bartender &quot; for lable printing now we are useing Visual Basic for barcode lable printing.<br />
<br />
what i want is, without pressing the &quot;TAB &quot; key I want to pass the value of TabKey. It means I will not press Tab key , but it should come to next field<br />
<br />
Any help through visual basic or through BaaN<br />
<br />
With Best Regards</div></div><hr />

Many readers have the ability to automatically append the tab or enter after the bar code scan - check the manual for your bar code reader.<br />
<br />
You can't put the chr(9) using your VB Program?  That's a good method for this.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for reply , we are using &quot; PSC Q56000 PLUs &quot; scanner.<br />
I have tried  Chr(9), vbTab , vbKeyTab  in  Visual program but it did not work.<br />
Now I am trying to do through BaaN maintain session which I have developed . Here I have tried data.input, inkey(),to.field , nothing is working.<br />
<br />
But You have given a good suggestion  to change the scanner setting.<br />
<br />

I know on our PSC scanners we had to make a few configuration changes to make sure it scanned control codes.  I know one we changed was to make sure it did barcode 3 of 9 extended.  I have also found that just because one out of the box works does not mean the next one will.  Just a thought.<br />

<br />
Thanks for replying, but it is not working in before.input bcz I have only two fields . one fiew field and one is multioccarance field. I want to pass the TAB key in multioccarance field .<br />
<br />
I am attaching my code and form . Please guide me.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">18th October 2004, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw ur code . U have put the tab() in the after input section. The program comes to after input  section only when successful error free value is entered in the field and tab is keyed in. In ur case need the system to generate tab. So u must write the tab() in the before input.section. This code can help when u have value calculated / computed in the before input section.<br />
<br />
However almost all bar code reader have options to generate tab keys (auto accept options ) . If u check the bar code reader manual , you may find such options.</div></div><hr />
