<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ksthakur</div><div class="date">9th October 2001, 06:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I want a  report to be customised in the following fashion.<br />
<br />
col1     col2     col3   col4    col5<br />
<br />
row1<br />
row2<br />
row3<br />
row4<br />
<br />
Although every report looks like this only but my report happens to be dynamic report in terms of its columns too. That means I have two tables from which the first table contains few rows that have to be shown as columns (col1, col2, col3, and col4). Now since the number of rows in this table is not fixed, it can be any numbers ranging from 0-9 (10 rows), what is the best way to do this. The one which i have resorted to was to declare 10 variables and store values in those and then get the report working, but is there any short and correct method too?<br />
<br />
Please advise. <br />
Warm regards,<br />
