<br />
According to manua &quot;This error indicates that the current transaction is aborted due to a lock error.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you have access to the program script , if yes then perhaps you can post th e same here for a better analysis.<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem may have been caused cause someone else is simultaneuosly modifying the records of the table.<br />
<br />
If you have got the program script... check whether there is retry.point specified.. and whethere commit.transaction is present..<br />
<br />
After encountering commit.transaction. the lock on the record is removed and you will be able to use the session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where can find the script? Is it from the session ttadv2530m000(Program Scripts/Libraries)? If yes then this is the script.<br />
<br />
*** Removed baan standard code *****<br />
<br />
FYI, the changes that I made is only in the ttadv4500m000(Domains) and I only changed the list of the user. I'm using DEM browser for normal user.<br />
If I ran the session from super user menu then it goes well but if i ran the session from user's DEM browser i always got the error.<br />
<br />
I was checking the tgbrg562101 but no record in that table.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th December 2006, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to me this looks like Baan standard source - if so I probably should not let it stay in the post.  You should also report the problem to the support center.<br />
<br />
On a side note the error looks like it comes out of the library tgintdllttstp.  If you have source you should be able to compile the library in debug mode and see where the actual error is occuring.  Did the error occur before you made the domain change or did it only start occuring after the domain change?  It could be that something in the library does not know about the domain change and is causing the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">agoes.s</div><div class="date">15th December 2006, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's the Baan standard source then please remove it. I'm not sure about this, that's why I asked how to look for the script.<br />
<br />
I got the error when i did the changes in the Domain, but the things that i changed is only the list of employee names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th December 2006, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">NO problem - code removed.  What domain did you change?  I would like to look at it on my system(if we use it).  Also if you all own source I would put (after reporting to support center)that library in debug mode to see where the actual error occurs.  That might provide a clue as to what in the domain is causing the problem.</div></div><hr />
