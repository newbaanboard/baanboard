tmp008529590( 366): Error: Enumerate/Bitset expression expected.<br />
  1 ERROR     REPORTED.<br />
<br />
2 questions...<br />
1. what does this error mean?!<br />
2. is there a way to retain these report tmpfiles that are immediately deleted?  Maybe that would give a clue of what's happening?<br />
<br />
Tried it on 2 different servers with old and new porting and toolsets and get the same error.  Tried to remove ALL the report script and this error is still top of the list so I assume its something to do with layouts but I have barely changed anything in there since the last OK compile (but have changed a lot since the last backup) :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">22nd March 2011, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Display the line 366 that has the error so can see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">22nd March 2011, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">the report script only goes to line 124 and as it says above even if I delete all the report script I still get the same error (as well as some more obviously due to missing script).  The report is in line 366 of the tempfile which is immediately deleted during compilation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">22nd March 2011, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at the Program Script not the Report Script for line 366.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">22nd March 2011, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">line 366 of the source is the first line below:<br />
<br />
	if isspace(itm.dsca) then<br />
		select	tiitm001.dsca<br />
		from	tiitm001<br />
		where	tiitm001._index1 = {:tdsls940.sitm}<br />

		selectempty<br />
			item.desc = &quot;&quot;<br />
			itm.dsca = &quot;&quot;<br />
		endselect<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
this line hasnt been changed since the report last compiled without error though :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd March 2011, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">This looks to be in the report - not the session.  Have you backed out your changes and recompliled?  What about restoring the original session - have you tried that?  If you can get back to the original report - then you can make your changes again.  One at a time of course to see which one gives this error.</div></div><hr />
