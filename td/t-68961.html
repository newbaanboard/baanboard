<br />
I required the output of Excel Device in Local System and in proper format without doing conversion after opening the file in Excel.<br />
<br />
For example, after i give the device i can give the o/p but its at Server side, Can i give it at Client side?<br />
<br />
And<br />
<br />
Can i want all the formatting in the file so that when user opens the file it opens in a proper format.<br />
<br />
Many of us would have thought in these lines. So it must be done before?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not possible without writing your own device, as far as I know. The other solution is exporting the report data to sequential file and then opening it in Excel, with whatever column separator you want. But it requires writing / modifying report script of all concerned reports.<br />

It opens an Excel workbook with the raw data of the report formatted in columns. See example in attachment.</div></div><hr />

What we do is write macros on our 4c4 system. The user runs the session, picks our PCEXCEL device, which takes the report and runs the macro for that report to format it how the users wish to see it. Usually the macros are not just simple formatting, the users can typically do that themselves.</div></div><hr />

I defined the parameters like this. Are the parameters Ok?<br />
<br />
I am getting an Error when i select the defined device.</div></div><hr />

Attachment is missing. I guess, the solution recommended by Jaap will only work in LNUI.</div></div><hr />

How do you call the macro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th June 2016, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically we have a device which has 3gl script attached as the program.  What this does is takes the report in the $BSE/tmp directory and converts it to an ascii file.  You can see how to do this in the Code and Utilities forum.  So for the fileout the user puts in what we call site.  This allows us to have multiple macors for the same report to run for a different set of users.  You could have USA - macro1, CAN - macro2 - all for the same report name. At this point pretty much every uses the same macro so we have a site called &quot;ALL&quot;<br />
<br />
Then we have two tables one holds the site and where excel is located (not really needed since all of ours sites are now the same for excel).  Then we have another table than holds the report name, where the converted file gets downloaded to, and what the macro name is and where it is stored.  So basically the below code builds a command like excel.exe \\soemfileserver\maindirectory\subdirectoy\macroname.  It then does an app start on the command.<br />
<br />
function start_excel_with_macro()<br />
{<br />
	string appl(132), parm(215),start(1024)<br />
	long app_id, rc<br />
| Setup application to start and macro name<br />
<br />
	select	tuddc906.*<br />
	from	tuddc906<br />
	where	tuddc906.site = :spool.fileout<br />
	as set with 1 rows<br />
	selectdo<br />
	endselect<br />
	appl = tuddc906.loca<br />
	|appl = &quot;C:\program files\microsoft office\office\excel.exe&quot;<br />
	parm = strip$(tuddc905.macl) &amp; tuddc905.macr<br />
	start= appl&amp;&quot; &quot;&amp;parm<br />
| Start the apllication	<br />
	app_id = app_start(start,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<br />
<br />
	rc = app_status(app_id)<br />
	if(rc = 0) then<br />
		message(&quot;Application start failed.&quot;)<br />
	endif<br />
}</div></div><hr />

I guess B2WIN is also good option as far as different formats output and formatting is concerned.<br />
<br />
Also if someone wants to do it themselves, as suggested by Mark in above threads;one can make use of Macros.There are examples related to Macros in the forum</div></div><hr />
