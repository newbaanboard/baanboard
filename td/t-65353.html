<br />
I am in process of developing a WEB application which utilizes the OLE Automation to execute logic inside LN. As part of the logic I make use of changing the predefined Variable &quot;logname$&quot;, which enables the logic to be executed as-if the given user had done the input as a normal logged-in user in LN.<br />
<br />
This change of logname$ for example ensures that the specific users Purchase Invoice Authorization Limits are ensured during an invoice approval process. At the same time the new Finance batches etc. are created under the specific user. <br />
<br />
My challenge is that Audit still logs the activity under the logged in user (the user from the &quot;bwc&quot; file), whereas inside the application it is logged under the user which is &quot;switched to&quot;. I would like Audit to switch the user as well. Does any of you know how to accomplish this? ...are there for example any predefined audit variables, which can be used?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
