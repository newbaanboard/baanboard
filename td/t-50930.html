<br />
Please can you highlight &quot;* only 4 pos will be printed on each page of report (if there are more than 4 pos have to print out)&quot;? <br />
If you mean after 4 pos it has to stop then I don't see any problems go in your report script and count the pos and after 4 pur lattr.print on false that's all.<br />
