I am looking for some working examples of the mwindow functionality, especially the get.window.attrs &amp; get.mwindow.size functions. I am getting some interesting errors and I am unable to move forward.<br />
If anyone would be kind enough to offer some help, it would be greatly appreciated,<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Brian</div></div><hr />

Ps. However any added main window functionality would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Was having trouble myself, with the get.mwindow.size in Baan IV. The help says;<br />
Example:<br />
long wwidth, wheight<br />
get.mwindow.size(DSMAXWIDTH+DSMAXHEIGHT, wwidth, wheight)<br />
<br />
However, compiling the script gives an error of; &quot;argument 1 should be called by reference&quot;. This was due to all three arguments, being reference variables. Which didn't make sense, as it wouldn't let you specify if you wanted the minimum, maximum or actual widths and heights<br />
<br />
So I still can't figure out how to pass to the function, that I want the DSWIDTH and DSHEIGHT (to get actual width and height)...<br />
<br />
In the end, I gave up using that function and used get.mwindow.attrs. EG:<br />
long at.values(MWINMAXSIZE)<br />
get.mwindow.attrs(at.values)<br />
<br />
Now, the actual width and actual height are stored in elements 11 and 12 respectively, ie:<br />
wwidth = at.values(11)<br />
wheight = at.values(12)<br />
<br />
Not sure if this was your problem. But would like to hear what issue you were having and how you resolved it?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
Ruskin..</div></div><hr />

I was able to solve my problem by using the get.mwindow.attrs(attr) as well. I was able to get the width and height requirements that I needed to move forward on my last problem.<br />
<br />
However I now need the X and Y co-ordinates of the session on the screen. The only function that I have seen that has the X and Y co-ordinates is the get.window.attrs(wind_id, attr). However whenever I call the function current.window() to get the process number, it returns a 0. And when I use the process number from the current.mwindow() function, to comes back with DsNRow and DsNColumn BW Errors.<br />
<br />
If anyone know or has used a function where the X &amp; Y co-ordinates are given, please feel free to post them here.<br />
Many Thanks<br />
Brian</div></div><hr />
