Our current Print PO report has too much of white space. We have a detail section where we are printing the PO lines. After this detail section I have the after order number sections.<br />
<br />
Even though we have just 1 PO line in the PO Im printing, there is plenty of Empty blank lines between the PO Line and the first line of the after field. In the report layout there is no such empty space. <br />
<br />
Any idea what needs to be done to get rid of this empty space when we print the report?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
You may need to make use of report functions skip(n), skip.to(n), need(n) in report script to control the empty spaces between the detail and the after field layouts.</div></div><hr />

As the totals need to be printed at the bottom of the page in the report script the function skip.to(spool.page.length - [X]) is used. This means that this sections starts at the point of the page length minus [X] lines.  In case your page length is 66 and the [X] is 10  your layout will start at line 57. The lines between the detail and the after.field section are blank and you won't find them in the report layout as a result of the skip.to function.<br />

Good Luck<br />

However I still have a few problems -<br />
- Firstly if in the detail section, the PO has say 10 order lines, then the after field section gets printed at the bottom of the 2nd page, whereas all the lines are printed on the 1st page. So in essence, my 2nd page is all empty with just the after field section at tge its bottom. So basically in the formula (Page Length - X) my X is a variable. Bottom line is that I just need the blank lines eliminated.<br />
- Secondly I have an after report section as well which gets printed on the top of the last page. No matter how much space is left on the bottom of the previous page, the after report will always get printed on a separate page. I have &quot;Print on new page&quot; checkbox as No for this layout.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
Thanks,<br />

Plus with that skip to you may need to just try removing it to see what things look like.  My print PO is so customized it would not be any help.</div></div><hr />
