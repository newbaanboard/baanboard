<br />
I need to write a script which will open baan sessions to a certain record..<br />
<br />
I tried the following,<br />
<br />
put.var( pid, field.name, field.value )<br />
zoom.to$(session.name, Z.SESSION, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
<br />
And it worked for display sessions but I need it to work also for maintain sessions.. What should I do ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Hiba</div></div><hr />

Set it to 7 (find.data). In display sessions this action is default. Mostly thats all you need to do.<br />

Its only the start parameter. And without the change (or editing the session-script) there is no way to tell the session to do that.<br />

<br />
I get it now - you are writing a program to call possibly any maintain sessions that are available.  The problem is just like csecgn mentioned.  So in your program you set the table fields and then when the zoom executes the display sessions execute a find.  In order for this to work you have to change the &quot;maintain sessions&quot; with main tables that will be called.  I see no way around setting the start option on the sessions.  That may not also work for all maintain sessions.<br />
<br />
You could always try setting the start option in ttadv200.sopt before you do the zoom.to.  This may or may not work.  I do not like this because it would impact all users.</div></div><hr />
