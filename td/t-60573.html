<br />
We are having a peculiar problem. Many of times it is observed that Users are not getting the desired Report, but the Report given by some other user. Take Example<br />
<br />
User A had given Print command from Session X.<br />
<br />
User B had given a print command from Session Y.<br />
<br />
The report output being received is as below :<br />
<br />
User A Gets output of Session Y<br />
<br />
User B Gets output of Session X.<br />
<br />
Many of times it also happens that a user gets reportout which is merged and haing informations from both Session X &amp; Y.<br />
<br />
Did anyone of you had ever went through such scenario. If yes, please share the resolution.<br />
<br />

<br />
Can you provide some more details about the session?<br />
I would like to know your observation on debugging of the session as to how the session behaves. Does it print the correct report or it still prints the wrong report?<br />
If its the wrong report, then how the program script and report triggers are activated?<br />
Kindly let us know some more information on this aspect.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Amit Mokashi</div></div><hr />

<br />
My setup :<br />

Tools 7.6 a5<br />
Windows Server 2003</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">26th May 2011, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you attach some examples? And also some screenshots from ttaad3520m000 where we can see the data of the printed reports. What happens if you repeat the request in this session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th May 2011, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about LN - but are the temp files created correctly and sent to the correct printer?  On baan IV I have ttaad3120m000(Maintain Device Queue) where I can go look at the temp files created by user id and sent to a printer.  I assume this is windows printing since I have never seen anything like this with UNIX printing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drcelus</div><div class="date">27th May 2011, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Will take a look at this sessions when I find an error, I don't have an example at the moment, as I said it is appears randomly and users do not always reports this kind of errors.<br />
<br />
We mainly use ttstpconv:POSTSCRIPT and ottstpconv:ASCII for our devices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pbenven</div><div class="date">27th May 2011, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe append something unique to the output? Like ${LOGNAME}</div></div><hr />
