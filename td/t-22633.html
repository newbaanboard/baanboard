<br />
We are using BaaNc4.<br />
<br />
Need some help on table authorisation.<br />
<br />
1. We have set table authorisation for table ticst001 for users that they cannot read/delete/insert/modify this table for certain order no and position no. it is working perfectly with all the session. <br />
<br />
We have developed one print session using table ticst001 and we want users can print all the records using the customised session, but they are not able to do so , since users are not authorised to read the table.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to make read permission localy in the session scripts, so that users can print all the records and after closing the session authorisation will be active again.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it safer to have them read the information from paper than from a monitor?</div></div><hr />

The Baan session, be it print, maintain, or display is above this level and so has no influence of the data returned by data database driver.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The suggestion i give is not the right way of getting things done..<br />
but for academic purpose, the database authorisations are written in files found in $BSE/lib/user..the file will be named as p&lt;user&gt; or something like that (not sure)..i guess moving the file to another name will remove the auth...<br />
<br />
but as i said, this is not the true soln to the problem...<br />
<br />
database auth shud be avoided as much as possible, as the overhead is very high<br />
