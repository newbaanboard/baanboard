<br />
Trying to add text to a delivery address table tccom013;  Customer Service wants to add notes to the address such as &quot;Deliver to Side Door&quot; kind of thing.<br />
<br />
Added the field ok.<br />
<br />
Tried making text available to sessioin tccom1102m000;<br />
<br />
When I test, it lets me add text on the customer address, but doesn't let me write the record as it has also somehow blanked out the customers Country Code (which is required).<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions as to how to fix this??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th June 2008, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">So you have added a text field to the table correct?  Then turned on text for the session making sure the correct text field is attached(using the texts button on form one of maintain session).  You have done both of these correct?  You might need to post relevant portions of your code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">6th June 2008, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark: There's no code to post.  I added the field with the domain to the table tccom013, converted/reconfigured, etc.<br />
<br />
I can add text at the table level, no problems.<br />
<br />
Then in Maintain Forms, I went into &quot;4 Stand.Opt&quot;, and enabled &quot;39 Text&quot; from No to Yes.<br />
<br />
Then in the session, tccom1102m000, I can hit &quot;H&quot;, it'll bring up the text editor, let me add whatever, and exit out of the text manager no problems.<br />
<br />
When returning to tccom1102m000 from the text manager, the country code field is suddenly emptied.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">6th June 2008, 23:46</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a bug in the session that we had to correct by adding following code to the field.tccom013.ccty:<br />
<br />
<br />
before.field:<br />
        save.ccty = tccom013.ccty<br />
<br />
<br />
This is BAAN IVc3 A&amp;D2.2b version of the session. This was very long ago, but I believe the problem you describe happened for us too after adding the text field. Maybe the addition of text interferes with how before.input works because that was where the original logic was assigning to save.ccty !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">7th June 2008, 06:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess this problem can't be solved unless you have source code, which we don't have.  D'oh!<br />
<br />
Anyone have any other ideas?  I'm thinking about creating a personalized session that replaces this one, however, we use vertex, so the geocoder api routines would need to be built in, a lot more work then I had anticipated.<br />
<br />
thanks again</div></div><hr />
