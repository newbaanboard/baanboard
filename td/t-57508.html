<br />
     I'm new the development. I was having a problem when i alter a table definition.<br />
<br />
I had created a new table definition for a customization that needed to be performed and i created a table in the test company. After a while working on it i had to add more fields in the table definition. After adding these fields i converted the table definition to runtime DD. But as a result my data got corrupted or something. I couldn't see the records in it. <br />
 I had only converted the table defn to DD after adding the fields. <br />
<br />
So can anyone tell me what is the correct procedure to change the table definition correctly so that i do not lose the entered data as well as manage to change the table definition.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

   Try doing convert to run-time DD if then also it won't work the go to GTM and check in ttadv502 in 000 company for your table and pkg combination. If record is there then delete that and re-login. I thing then issue will be resolved.<br />
<br />
If then also you are facing problem plz let me know.</div></div><hr />
