<br />
I am not good at writing reports for BaaN IV and do not seem to manage to get my mind around it. My company has requested me to design a label for some of our products and so I have used the &quot;SQL Queries&quot; to perform this task. The problem is that when printing on these pre-cut / pre-defined / pre-templated labels, the first three labels print fine but the remaining labels start overlapping. I am using the labels from this company Redfern, their website is as follows, http://www.redfern.co.za/redfern/red%20website/original%2016%20up%20no%20border.html - we are using the 16up no border labels. The other problem which I am experiencing is being able to print the labels for the second column. I know one can go and re-feed the paper into the tray but I was hoping that BaaN would be able to print these directly.<br />
<br />
I am praying for a miracle to happen here, would appreciate any and all input in resolving this more than likely simple process.<br />
<br />
Thanking you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just wanted to say thank you very much. My problem was with the page width, I had it set to little and so the 2 columns were not printing. Thank you for identifying the extra setting of the Multi Columns as well, had this set but if the page width is too short, then the labels will only print down one column.<br />
<br />
Thank you once again.</div></div><hr />
