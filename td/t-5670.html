We do not want to use exchange for this purpose. <br />
I've read in this forum a lot about BOI's, AFS and OpenWorld.<br />
BOI's seems to be not supported anymore, OpenWorld expensive...<br />
Has anyone done this and want to share his way-of-working and experiences?<br />
<br />
Your help is welcome!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trchandra</div><div class="date">29th June 2002, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Peter,<br />
    You have different options to do the import...<br />
<br />
1.  Exchange : This is the best way of importing items and other related tables.  Once you have created exchange programs and ascii file formats, it is one click to import all tables at once.  <br />
<br />
     Since you dont want to use import let us talk about other possibilities.<br />
<br />
2.  4GL/3GL Program:  You can write a program thru which you can read delimited file to import records one by one.  You should make sure that the file is in right place and you use variables with right data type for parsing. <br />
    <br />
      You can have a form where you can take the filename and other parameters necessary for processing.  You will directly create records using db.insert() functions.<br />
<br />
3.  AFS Programs:  You can create a AFS program for the item session, and you can use stpapi.* functions to pass the values from the ascii file.  The advantage with this is you can fire the functions attached to the field events on the form which are programmed in UI scripts.  Sometimes this is preferable if you are not sure of field events.<br />
<br />
    I dont see much use of BOIs in this mass import as they are not meant for mass data transfers.  They are good at dealing transactional data with limited data flow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prademaker</div><div class="date">2nd July 2002, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd agree that for a one time bulk upload exchange is the way to go. We want to extend our product range with more then 70.000 product within the next years.<br />
Update will be done on a regular base, but we want to build in some additional test and conditions. <br />
Writing a tailormade session will give us the flexibility we are looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prademaker</div><div class="date">2nd July 2002, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">You've talked me into trying the AFS programs. So I spent a few hours on testing this functionallity. <br />
Have to admit that i'm impressed! :cool: After a quick test I was able to use the technique to add missing functionallity to a few homemade sessions.<br />
I'm sure that using this technique on &quot;maintain items&quot; will be a bit more complicated but you've conviced me. I'll give it a try.<br />
Thank you very much for your advice.</div></div><hr />
