<br />
We are unable to generate hard allocation using session tdinv2201m000 &amp; getting the attached error.<br />
The problem is only when there is a discount percentage assigned to the sales order line. <br />
If there is no discount percentage or discount amount (not percentage) is assigned, we are not getting any error &amp; able to generate hard allocation.<br />
<br />
I have also tried to debug the script but didn't get any solution. <br />
can anyone please help me?</div></div><hr />

This looks like something we would report to infor for a fix.  I would say something is not updating the tables correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ashishjain</div><div class="date">17th May 2010, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no customization in this session. It's a standard one. We have three BaaN environments...<br />
1) Production<br />
2) Development<br />
3) Test<br />
<br />
In all above three env. scripts are same but the problem is only in Test env. <br />
Production &amp; Dev. env. is working fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th May 2010, 23:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you checked all the libraries also?  Is it possible there is a setup difference between the 3 environments? Something to make the test environment act different? Have you double checked to make sure nothing is in the executable path at the UNIX level.  I know I found one on our system once that should have been running out of a Baan VRC, but was running out of our dev VRC.  Someone had just copied an object down at the unix level - nothing in tools showed this.<br />
<br />
I know trying to debug baan sessions can be difficult especially when it starts running DLL's. It becomes very difficult tracking where or what did the update. Something you can try - is moving the object of the session from one environment it the test environment.  Then try running that object - keep in mind it could be one of the libraries.</div></div><hr />
