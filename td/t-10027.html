<br />
We are using BaanIVc4 on Digital UNIX.<br />
<br />
Depending on particuler Condition, I want to disable a field on the form.<br />
<br />
I want the same effect of 'disable.fields(...)&quot; command of BaaN V.<br />
<br />
The only way I can disable the field in BaaN IV by making &quot;attr.input = false&quot; in the script depending on coditions. But this keeps the field color white. How can I also change the color to Gray? (like Baan V)<br />
I tried to use  &quot;attr.color = 8&quot;  which doesn't work.  Is there any other way?  Is ther any way I can use the function &quot;rgb&quot; here.<br />
<br />
Any help is very much apreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
The above answer is not exactly I am looking fro.  invisible.field() makes the field Invisible.  Well, I don't want this effect. I want BaaN V effect, viz, field is disabled and grayed out. <br />
As I told earlier, I am using attr.input = false to make field disabled. But also I wanted to gray out (by say, coloring) that field.<br />
<br />
Hope I get the answer.<br />

Baan V tools are much more flexibile in these areas.  The question has come up a number of times - it would be nice to find an answer.  <br />
<br />
Maybe if you can find an example of a standard session in Baan IV that does this, we can figure out how.   It may be some undocumented options that have been ported to Baan IV.</div></div><hr />
