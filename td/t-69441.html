All the ERP LN reports throws the below exception while using Infor Reporting Device. Any thoughts ? Have anyone come across similar issues ?<br />

Is it possible the label mentioned was deleted by accident in production.  Wait for someone with LN experience to see what they think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The error occurs only with Infor Reporting device, the labels are not deleted those are still existing. This error is thrown for every report and not just a specific report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is your default language non-English? Do the labels exist in your current language? Also, can you please validate if you have the latest version of DLL Infor.ReportingServices.LNDataExtension.dll? You can check KB 1644013 which points to the required solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">14th November 2016, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems that a part of the LN Connector for Infor Reporting is missing. Did you upgrade or re-install Infor Reporting? I assume you need to re-install the LN Connector as well.</div></div><hr />
