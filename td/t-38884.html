<br />
We are using the BW-Print to print to a Zebra Z6MPlus printer directly from Baan.  I have used the 'bc$' command to get the barcode labels to print.  I'm fine it seems if I just print one label at a time.  However, if I want to send a range of labels to the printer it loses it's formating for the Baan report (the 4X6 label).  I have my baan report layout as all detail lines (no header or footer, etc...).  <br />
<br />
When it prints the first label it's fine, the ones that follow are only printing one detail layout line per label.  So, I'll have one completed label and then up to 6 more labels print, but only print one detail line per label.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone that has been successful using the bc$ command and printing to a Zebra printer straight out of Baan?  Maybe, I'm missing a valuable reset code or something.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
why bwprint, the printer can be controlled directly by ZPL II.<br />

Can you give me more details on how I should switch?  Do you have your Baan Device set up special?  <br />

I'm not the most technical person when it comes to printers, drivers, etc...<br />

Thank you,<br />

What it does is generate the ZPL II code to send to the printer.  It keeps you from having to learn the ZPL language.</div></div><hr />

In this threat i've explained, how to use ZPL II.<br />
Please compete your profile. A lot of help is OS and/or DB dependent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 09:29</div></div><div class="posttext">We print to a Intermec printer (similar to a Zebra) directly from BaaN for about 8 years already, also directly from BaaN, using a UNIX queue, printer is connected directly to the network, printer commands are written ('printed') in the BaaN report. Occasionally some commands are skipped, e.g. it would happen that in a serie of 10 labels suddenly on the 5th label a text field is missing, or on 8th label a barcode is printed 4 times as large as it should be.<br />
Perhaps the network protocol of the printer is not doing a good job in error correction.</div></div><hr />
