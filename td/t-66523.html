<br />
Patch creation is basically a session which you can use to Move your customization's from one VRC to other or One Environment to other.<br />
<br />
<br />
Case where you want to Move customization's to different environment using patches:-<br />
<br />
<br />
You can create your patch using session ttiex4500m000, add the components which needs to be transferred and do a create patch. It will create 2 files on the mentioned path. One will be having the encoded components and other will have the list of components included in the patch. Copy and place the folder in the target environment and use session ttiex1284m000 to import the patch. Take care of the VRC's if you are transferring to some other VRC that the source.<br />
<br />
There is one more way to do this. You can create a Customization Project and create customization parts. Now, you can add your components to these parts and use Export/Import data dictionary to transfer the components from one Environment to other.<br />
<br />
For patch creation you have to add the components one by one manually, but with Customization Project, you can just go to specific and add it in your project. So it has two pro' re-usability and is simpler.</div></div><hr />

If it does I highly suggest using that rather than the export/import because at least with PMC you can back out a solution if there is an issue, export/import it's rather difficult to &quot;back out&quot; issue components...</div></div><hr />
