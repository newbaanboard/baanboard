<br />
I have some dynamic data in an excel file which gets refreshed every 5 minutes.<br />
I want this particular information to be available to all the baan users. itz practically not possible to copy the source file to each of the client machine.<br />
Is there any mechanism by which this data will get populated to the baan table and there by through forms or reports we can allow the users to view it.<br />
<br />

why dont u write a macro in excel file which updates the data from excel file<br />
to SQL table (which r same as baan table)<br />
Then create a session for viewing that table dat and refresh it time to time.</div></div><hr />

Are you using a level II driver with SQL if you are not then you will have problems just loading the data directly to sql as baan will not display the data unless the index fields baan uses with a Level I driver are correct. there are are ways to create the index but it can cause problems if you get it wrong. But if this is data from outside of the baan system  that is not used by any standard baan sessions then it is probably not a problem and there are post on the board that discuss this. If your using the level II driver then this will not be an issue. <br />
Rather than use a macro to update sql take a look at the DTS module in sql it allows you to create jobs that will poll the  exel file (any data source infact)  and then upload the data to sql at set intervals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your posting. Well frankly speaking am not aware of this level II or Level I driver.. and i dont think ill have to bother about it too cause the data which i want to import to sql table is independent of baan Standard session. I have created a table, i have a excel file, where dynamic data gets refreshed every 5 minutes or so..  Just want to populate this data in to sql tables so that all the baan users can have the data at their disposal..<br />
<br />
If you think there is any alternative solution then taking this data in to sql tables then please let me know..<br />
<br />
I dont have much Idea about the DTS module.. would be nice if you could brief me on that.. or rather let me know if there is any threads or links pertaining the same..<br />
