<br />
I believe this is predefined variable to meet your needs.<br />
<br />
long	mark.table()<br />
This array indicates which records are marked. The size of this array is set to fattr.occurnr. For example,<br />
if records 3 and 8 are marked,<br />
then:mark.table(3) = 1<br />
mark.table(8) = 1<br />
and other elements in the array are 0 (false).<br />
<br />
Here is an interesting flag variables for condition checking<br />
<br />
long	marked	Indicates if there are marked records.</div></div><hr />

Here is one thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=32739&amp;highlight=mark.table) that might help.  Others are available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your suggestion was excellent. This is working very well for me.  <br />
There is something that could contribute for this thread. This has to see with that I didn't need to update with do.occ. I needed to update from my source code  and I had to use do.occ.without.update in the following way:<br />
function read.main.table()<br />
{<br />
	reg.act = 0<br />
	for start = 1 to filled.occ <br />
		if (mark.table(start)) then<br />
			do.occ.without.update(start,copiar.lineas) 			            reg.act = reg.act + 1<br />
		endif<br />
	endfor <br />
	message(str$(reg.act) &amp; &quot; filas copiadas&quot;) |novaget01.n<br />
} <br />
<br />
function copiar.lineas()<br />
{<br />
	tdcpedll.creli.copy.sales.order(que.cuno, tdsls045.orno, tdsls045.pono, que.orno, que.prdt, que.ddta, que.cvat)<br />
}</div></div><hr />
