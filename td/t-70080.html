<br />
 I have done setup for Document Output Management for Invoice and Receiver Type is User. While Printing Invoices with DOM Device it creating documents but while running session Document Rendering and Distribution (ttrpi3210m000) session getting error as document failed. We are getting following Error in log.rpi file:<br />
Function send.mail.message in library ottrpidllcmf not executed successfully;<br />
Function distribution.send in library ottrpidllmail not executed successfully;<br />
Function distribution.send.document failed for bshell PID '648' <br />
 Failed to send message; cmf.send()<br />
<br />
I have checked SMTP setup and its looks good.<br />
<br />
Is there any missing link in this process and how to check cmf.send() function fail issues.<br />
<br />
Any Help appreciated. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Check the SMTP Parameter setting is correct in sess. ttcmf0120m000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If yes, then maybe the Firewall is blocking the port, You need to check that..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Ajesh on this topic. I have got the same error when I try to use DOM and got to know that the issue is due to the Network/Firewall Restrictions. You can try contacting your Network Admin to get the Solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">8th July 2017, 06:57</div></div><div class="posttext">There are actually several levels of this problem<br />
<br />
1) The set up has to be good. The SMTP Server name and the port used for smtp has to be proper. This has to be verified by the system administrator.Generally the port name 25 or 587 is used for SMTP<br />
<br />
2) Then you have to get it checked whether those ports are not blocked in your Application Server<br />
<br />
3) Then you have to get it checked whether any Anti Viruses are not blocking the service requests<br />
<br />
4) Then SSL Curl has to be enabled as Yes sometimes,<br />
<br />
5) Even then there has to be dedicated SMTP Server installed in the server because with the default SMTP Server is not consistent as its protocol blocks many of your message sending abilities.<br />
<br />
All the Best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have any manual for DOM. Like have you prepared any document to setup DOM.<br />
<br />
If you have such, can you just send me to  sdash093@gmail.com<br />
