There are some sessions in BaaN for which code is provided. If some PMC solution is installed for these sessions, and provided the solution has script as a component, then the old script is replaced by the new one. And if the solution is uninstalled, the old script is AGAIN available!!<br />
Now, the query is where is the old script stored!!?:confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">12th February 2003, 13:26</div></div><div class="posttext">in a dmp file with the uninstalled solution number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">13th February 2003, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply.<br />
But, I am not sure whether I could explain my query or not!!<br />
Anyway, the &quot;uninstall&quot; directory for PMC solutions includes all those dmp files (with solution # name), which are required to uninstall any solution, or we say, the solutions which are in the installed stage.<br />
Now, what I am talking about is that, there is a software component (10 Kb) which is being replaced (20 Kb) through a PMC solution. Now, if later on, I uninstall this PMC solution (20 Kb), I get back the original component (10 Kb). Now, where is this 10 Kb component stored!!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isimeon</div><div class="date">13th February 2003, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure, but I think PMC working as follows:<br />
<br />
Install<br />
1. PMC save original components included in solution in dmp file in uninstall directory.<br />
2. Install solution with new components<br />
<br />
Uninstall<br />
1. PMC install original components from uninstall dump and delete or update coresponding PMC records.<br />
<br />
The original scripts are included in uninstall dump.<br />
<br />
If I am wrong, correct me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">13th February 2003, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Check to Install solution 101101 with component update on otttstobj (20 kb):<br />
In the $BSE/pmc/install_dumps/B40_c there is an exact copy of the 101101stnd file of the ftp-server (named 101101).<br />
<br />
Now install 101101 to replace 10 kb otttstobj with the update on this object (20 kb). Check &quot;save components&quot;.<br />
when installing: in the uninstall directory a dump is being made with all components contained in 101101, the file is named 101101.<br />
<br />
So in that stage: the 10 kb object is parked there.<br />
When uninstalling solution 101101 that dump is imported again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">13th February 2003, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">It does make some sense.<br />
I install solution # &quot;A&quot;. The components which will be overwritten, are stored in the dmp file &quot;A&quot;, under &quot;uninstall&quot; directory. Later on, if wish to uninstall solution # &quot;A&quot;, the system uninstalls the solution, and then imports all those components from file &quot;A&quot; into the system.<br />
Hope I am on the right track, and does it hold good even for Service Packs!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">13th February 2003, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Service packs are collection of individual solutions... so it works the same... But due to the extra information that is contained in the SP dump, the procedure is different. I think the basic principle is however the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Question:<br />
<br />
How can someone execute an 'uninstall' if the dumps in the uninstall directory have been deleted and are not available anymore ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember trying that once. But, the system did not allow me to uninstall the solution. The error message said - Dump not found - or something like that!!<br />
I do not know whether there is any workaround or not!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">If you uncheck the field &quot;Save Components&quot; then you are being warned.<br />
<br />
The dump in the uninstall dir has another format (at least another header) than the dumps in the install dir, so you cannot sneak the previous solution number from the install to the uninstall directory.</div></div><hr />
