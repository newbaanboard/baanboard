<br />
Infor ERP LN Supports the Label Printing as part of its standard functionality, which you can use during the Inbound/Shipment Procedures.<br />
<br />
The fields that you can print on a Label are pre-defined. If you need any additional fields, you might have to go with Customization.<br />
<br />
Just to give you an idea, I've quickly created a Label which is automatically printed after confirming the Receipt. Kindly find the attached sample label (including Bar code).<br />
<br />
If you could let me know the details that you would like to print on the Label, I can check the possibilities (available in Standard) and let you know.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you!</div></div><hr />

Please find the attachments with possible fields that you can print on a LABEL.<br />

The first attachment (Number-1) contains the list of fields that you can print during the Inbound Process &amp; the second attachment (Number-2) is for the Outbound Process.<br />
<br />
Hope you find it useful.<br />

Let me hear from you in case more details are required!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you try printing the Label with &quot;Ship To Location&quot; Field? I believe that would print the Location we specify in the Destination Location Field during the Receipt Process.<br />
<br />
Do let me know your feedback.</div></div><hr />
