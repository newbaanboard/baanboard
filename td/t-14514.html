<br />
I would like to use an table from another database in my BaaN reports. This is a new subject for me so i haven't got a clue where to start or how to build this.<br />
<br />
Anybody has any experience with this ?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appriciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">If the other database resides outside Baan environment (ie not linked to any Baan table) , it may not be possible.<br />
<br />
But within Baan environment different databases do not matter. All u need a properly validated db driver for that database.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">croezen</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks Hitesh Shah, for your fast reply!<br />
<br />
I have another SQL2000 database on another server.<br />
There isn't a link at this moment between those databases, but i can use a number that is present in both databases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have experience on SQL 2000 . If the other tables on other server too are on Baan and has a company number other than the one on current server , u can create a database definition to read SQL2000 tables from another system and attach it to tables of other database (assign tables to database). Convert 2 runtime DD .  This updates files tabledef6.1 <br />
<br />
Doing this u can read the the tables of another company in another server SQL2000 and fetch it in a report.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 07:40</div></div><div class="posttext">This possibility is outside Baan Report and probably may not serve your purpose.<br />
<br />
You can have separate ODBC  connections to your SQL2000 on separate machines and combine this using MS SQL.  As I have not done anything on this , I don't have technical details . I only know it as a possibility . <br />
<br />
The only problem with this approach is Baan data dictionary tables and domains (restrictions,validation , alignment , case conversion, enum description) etc is not available.</div></div><hr />
