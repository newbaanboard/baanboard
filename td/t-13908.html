<br />
If you just want to maintain a table field which you can not access with a regular baan session you can generate a new session (Session in the Toolsmenu &quot;Generate Session&quot;) with the main table of your choice.<br />
<br />
If you have a more complex problem, post your script an we could help to solve your problem. <br />

To create virtual inventory store,<br />
I have created table called tlpur040 - same as tdpur040<br />
Another table tlpur041 - same as tlpur041<br />
Another table tlpur045 - same as tlpur045<br />
<br />
I have copied all records from tdpur040,041,045 to tlpur040,41&amp; 45.<br />
Suppose I PO ( 50001) is having 300 lines. I have generate one maintain session using tlpur045 using form type 3.<br />
I have to update PO line by line. If I create one to one update in maintain session using Form Type 1 (Single Occr + main). There was not problem to update, but when I am using Form Type 2 (Multiple Occ + view + main) the the problem is there for saving. And it is giving error.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">12th December 2003, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">You just want a type 3 that you can update each record without error?  The Generate Session should give this to you - there is no code required.    You can easily remove the 'insert' option if you want through Maintain Form / Standar Options button.<br />
<br />
If you want something else...are you trying to update all records with 1 change..?  <br />
<br />
Maybe post up your code and we will try to help.<br />
<br />
It would be helpful to also see the form - maybe a screen shot..?  and marked so we know which fields are marked 'multi occurance' and which are marked 'single occurance'.<br />
<br />
That should help us help :)</div></div><hr />
