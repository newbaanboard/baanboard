<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">7th June 2003, 03:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for the support during my days of co-moderating &quot;Tools Development&quot;. I have been out of the Baan business for about 6 months now. My decision of not wanting to move from San Diego when my project ended here in Oct last and me getting married in February have taken my time away from the board. It was great to work with Patrick, Mark and Gordon on the direction of this forum.<br />
<br />
Effective today I no longer am a moderator on this forum. It was great fun and joy to help and be helped by others on the board. A list of threads that I worked on during this time can be found here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/search.php?s=&amp;action=finduser&amp;userid=21).<br />
<br />
Ofcourse my pride and joy is the &quot;Code and Utilities Forum&quot;. This tiny forum has five threads that make the top twenty viewed (25%) (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/vbstats.php?action=topthreads) threads on the entire board. It is my personal belief that this forum could do with more growth. This could come in the form of both individual projects and group collaborative projects. So far we have only seen the former kind.<br />
<br />
Praveen and I pitching in to create the Baan code highlighting in Scintilla (www.scintilla.org) which is downloadable here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=603<br />
). Because of this effort, support for Baan programming is making into a lot of code editors based on Scintilla :). I was pleasantly surprised to find support for Baan in ActiveState's Komodo (http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/?_x=1). There are many more components that use this component. Details can be found here (http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaRelated.html).<br />
<br />
One of the small projects that I worked on that gave me the most satisfaction was providing code highlighting support on Baanboard. You can see Patrick's announcement here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5452).<br />
<br />
I am not sure how many people use Rush (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=559) but it sure does get a lot of hits :).<br />
<br />
BaanXL (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=5880) on the other hand helps a few companies out there that want to do their own thing.<br />
<br />
I will continue to hang around the Code and Utilties Forum in the hope of seeing more contributions and perhaps at some point contributing more projects to this forum.<br />
<br />
Thank you once again!<br />
P.S.: I have attached the reason that I do not spend a lot of time on Baanboard anymore :D.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your efforts and contributions. <br />
<br />
Tools Development and Code and Utilities forums are certainly the areas that have made me log on every day since I discovered BarnBaord.com a year ago.<br />
<br />
From the photograph I can understand why you can't spend a lot of time on this board.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
