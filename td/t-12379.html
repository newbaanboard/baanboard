I need to know what records have changed in a table. I found some documentation saying that i have to use the netlist functionality that is in tmboinetlist. Has anyone documentation on what functions are inside this DLL and how to use it. Can anyone share a piece of code?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th July 2003, 03:36</div></div><div class="posttext">One way to find out what is in a library or a DLL is to use bic_info6.1 or bic_info6.2.  I am not sure which one works for Baan 5.  An example is bic_info6.1 ottdllbw.  Just thought I would mention this since I am Baan IV user and not Baan 5.<br />

Also the code and utilities forum is for complete code or utilities you would like to share with this community, so I moved this post into this forum.  Hopefully you will get a few responses.<br />

Good Luck!<br />
