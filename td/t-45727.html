<br />
I want to print 5 different reports in 1 spool, all using the same printer.<br />
The 1st is portrait, font is middle,<br />
the 2nd is landscape, font is small,<br />
the 3rd is landscape, font is middle,<br />
the 4th is landscape, font is small,<br />
the 5th is landscape, font is large.<br />
<br />
I tried it with spool.open(...), setting the spool.fontnumber, orientation with pc$(5) and pc$(6) works, but:<br />
all reports are using the same fontsize (the font of the 1 report), the changing of the fontnumber don't work :-(<br />
<br />
Anybody here with a solution?<br />
<br />
We are using BaaN IVc4 SP13<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Holger</div></div><hr />

Are the reports from different programs?  More information might help get other solutions or suggestions.</div></div><hr />

the reports are all from different programs, controlled in 1 new session by afs.<br />
They want them all together in 1 pack, not disturbed by any other printout.<br />

Greetings,<br />

What I did was run each individual report to disc, then read them back into one report.  I read each report one at a time. The report was generic so each line was one report field - this generic report had no headers, just one detail.  The only thing I did not do was try to change the font size or orientation.  But I do not see why you could not set a control string for both orientation and font.</div></div><hr />
