<br />
I am a newbie to QKey. I want to generate a Qkey script from standard baan session which does not have source code (say tcmcs0423m000).<br />
<br />
I searched but could not found anything. Can anybody guide me what are the steps to generate a Qkey wrapper script for tcmcs0423m000?<br />

Already answered here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=68131). Do you have the product? It's no more supported.<br />
<br />
Alternative way is to go with ~Vamsi's Solution (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=559)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are working with a US client who is using QKey with Baan IV. Many a time we happen to modify software components (adding form fields, session scripts etc). <br />
<br />
My sole purpose was to know the procedure to generate a wrapper script which makes necessary calls to parent object and adds something to it.<br />

Then when you compile the qkey script it will embed all of the functionality calls it needs.  Keep in mind if you use the qkeyvi editor it will strip out everything qkey related and leave only your code changes.  If you don't use qkeyvi editor then when you add your code into the session make sure it is in the right place.  If you do not put it in the correct place then the qkey compiler will strip it back out.<br />
<br />
Below is all you need to start with:<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
 |#parent<br />
<br />
Compile it and then look at the new script. You will then see all of the events that are available from the parent object.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand this but when clicking on script editor, it says that source code is not present. It is usual because source of that session script is not available.<br />
<br />
I do not know how to create a black script for the session script.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd October 2015, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">You can just copy any source script into the session - even an existing source script.  In 4c4 I just go into maintain scripts and hit copy.  Then I give it the name I want. Then edit it and delete all lines in it.  Then you can add the declaration and |#parent.  So for example I might copy tisfc0101 to tisfc0404.  Then I would edit tisfc0404 and delete all lines.  Then put in my qkey information.<br />
<br />
Also in 4c4, since we do not own source - if I go to maintain scripts and copy the baan vrc script of the session to my development VRC I also get an empty script.  There are a bunch of ways to get an empty script out there.</div></div><hr />
