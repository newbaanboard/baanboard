<br />
You can add a header layout and select page no in special field on report menu bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomson S</div><div class="date">4th April 2012, 06:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, Thank you. But, the page number should be in footer of the every page of the report. like 1, 2, 3 etc.,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shahudit</div><div class="date">4th April 2012, 08:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Thompson<br />
<br />
Its simple...select a footer layout and do the same...page no will be printed at the bottom of each page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomson S</div><div class="date">4th April 2012, 13:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Shahudit. I tried that. Its printing correctly for the first page as 1, but for all the remaining pages its printing '0'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th April 2012, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">And you used the page no from the special fields as mentioned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomson S</div><div class="date">5th April 2012, 06:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes !! I used the special field Page No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th April 2012, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you post a screen shot of the layouts?  Not sure what would reset the page number to 0.  Is there a report script in it?  Did you try putting it in debug mode and see if anything is impacting lattr.pageno?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomson S</div><div class="date">6th April 2012, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes It does have the report script. am using lattr.pageno too in that script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th April 2012, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Put it in debug mode and step thru it.  Make sure your use of lattr.pageno is not causing the issue.  You may even want to comment out your use of the variable and let the report handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomson S</div><div class="date">10th April 2012, 07:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not working, since the report scripts contains lots of Predefined Variables.<br />
Is there any other way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th April 2012, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what you mean it is not working.  Not sure what you are doing with lattr.pageno in the report script - but try commenting all of that out.  If you do that and it comes out correct on the report then you know it is the report script.  Then it will be a matter of debugging what is going on in the report script.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
before we're fishing in foul water, as Mark suggest, show your report-layout and script.<br />
<br />
So someone will be able to find your problem.<br />
<br />
I suggest, put the page-number from special field in the header of your report (as BIV standard) an see, if the pages are counted correctly.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomson S</div><div class="date">11th April 2012, 06:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys, Thank you for supporting. I have done that in another way.<br />
<br />
My requirement was to print an &quot;Title&quot; in every second page of the Item Report.. That report may contain many Item's details. In each item detail I need to print &quot;Title&quot; from its second page. So I made use of the lattr.pageno.<br />
<br />
And the next requirement is to print Page Number in every page's Bottom right corner. Since the report is quit complicated I used more lattr.pageno. It affected the special field as you guys were saying.<br />
<br />
Then I finally created a variable and assign it as &quot;0&quot; in header layout in the script and in the footer i incremented it by 1. Then I can print page number in all the pages.<br />
<br />
Thank you for supporting guys. Sorry that I couldnt post the screenshot :(</div></div><hr />
