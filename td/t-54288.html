<br />
We print our invoices for SLS and SMA in separate jobs. More than 500 per day.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, 1 per month, we have a problem:<br />
A range of invoices all positions line are multiple printed. Some Invoices before are not printed, the rest is ok. In BaaN tables are the invoices ok and the reprint is perfect. <br />
We have this problem sometimes for sls and sometimes for sma.<br />
<br />
We already open a case, but the infor support couldnâ€™t help us, they propose update the porting set.<br />
<br />
Does somebody have the same or similarly problems?<br />
<br />
Where could this error come from?<br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />
