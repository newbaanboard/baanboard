Hello,<br />
1.) Define a 120 character textwindow.<br />
2.) Assign this window to the textgroup. The user will be able to write text with 120 char's in the line.<br />
3.) Use 120 char's in report-textfield defiition.<br />
<br />
All new text will be 120 char's !<br />
<br />

<br />
I have the same problem. what happend if I don´t want to change the <br />
windows size (number of columns) fo the windows and group text where the user input the text.  ejem: he have a windows with 72 columns <br />
<br />
I wanbt to print this field text in a space for (50 columns). The text for every line is truncated. <br />
<br />
Yes I know that I may create a new windows and group text with 50 columns of width, but how can I assign this windows, temporally to the field, while is printing after. <br />
<br />
Is there some predefined variable that I can set to change or assign a new group text or windows type.<br />
<br />
I don´t want to manipulate manually the field text with some functions to read the text and sent it to a string variables. I supposed that there are a standard and easy manner to do that.<br />
