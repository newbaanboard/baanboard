<br />
What happens when you run it? Does run normally? If yes then check if there is any hang processes in Baan using &quot;Start Shell&quot; in the option dialog. If there is a hang report there kill it, compile again then try it<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

If I try to run the session it is working fine without hanging the processes. Session will not run in debug mode.<br />
<br />
Hi  En<br />
<br />
I am getting compilation errors as attached in XLS. Also please check the attached script and guide me.<br />

<br />
I don't see any errors! Those are warnings.<br />
<br />
It is not the session who hangs, sometimes it is the report. Check all running processes..<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

Actually script is standard I had made modifications and copied in to custz. VRC. Script is in correct VRC.<br />

Is the script you attached the CUSTOMIZED script? Is this the same report code as the original version? Also, is the customized script in the correct development layer (highest layer)?</div></div><hr />

If you are not sure, try to add a message or so in for instance the header.1: before.layout: to test if the script is being compiled at all...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had this problem once. I was not able to debug the report even after it had compiled. The reason was that since there were too many layouts on the customised report, the runtime memory was less for executing the debugger.<br />
<br />
Since most of the layouts were similar, I could overcome this by deleting a few layouts and debugging them.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!<br />
<br />

Could you give a bit more detail please (messages you got, errors etc)??<br />
<br />
Anyway, what I understand from you if I understand well, is that your report did work, just the debugger wouldn't be activated. Ganesh however, says that his report does not even get compiled...</div></div><hr />

You might even go so far as to delete the object - before recompiling.  I have seen cases where file permissions are not correct and the file does not get replaced, but the compile looks like it worked.<br />
<br />
Also run explode6.1 (or your version) to make sure that the path that is returned is actually the path you are compiling to.  I have seen extraneous files cause problems in this regard - in the path when they should not be in the path(and not in the database).<br />
<br />
Last but not least - make sure the report is not in shared memory.  If it is then you will need to start and stop shared memory.  Really do not know anything about this since we do not appear to use it.<br />
<br />
And yes I have seen the problem rohan described - but years ago.  You could compile the report and run it, but if you put it in debug mode it would abort in the debug process.  Can not remember what reports this happened in.</div></div><hr />

I have gone through the object and observed that object is not updating after compilation. I had removed the old object, recompiled the script and then tried to run the report. I got error message as mismatch of report object.<br />
<br />
Also I am not aware of explode6.1 command, can u please explain me in brief. I am working on BaaN4c4. If u could refer the attached document you will realize that no.of functions are not used in the script.<br />

Check this link out for syntax (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=15896&amp;highlight=explode6.1) of the explode command. Not sure about versions, but I think yours would be 6.1.  All it really does is display the path to the object for you current bshell.  <br />
<br />
I do not think I have ever seen a mismatch for report object.  I would if that could be the RTDD.  You might need to create RTDD.  Maybe a screen shot of the actual error would help someone tell what the problem is.</div></div><hr />
