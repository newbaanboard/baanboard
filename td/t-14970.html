<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">One way to do this is how I handled the print production order planning by priority report.  I have a batch job that runs at night and sends the report to disk.  The user then runs a session I created to read the report.  The session lets them search for their work center only - then prints those pages.  This session does not do anything fancy and just reads the file and send it to the report.  The report only has one input field(string of 215) and one detail section.  That is one way.<br />
<br />
Or you could give users access to the maintain device print queue session and let them reprint a report.  Of course they would have to find it each time.<br />
