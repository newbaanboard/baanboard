<br />
I have added a new table field tdsls045.flag (Yes/No) in table tdsls045. It's default value at table level is tcyesno.no<br />
We are doing partial delivery of an order &amp; making this flag (tdsls045.flag) to &quot;Yes&quot; after release outbound.<br />
We are doing partial delivery so we have back orders. While confirming back orders, session is inserting a new sequence in table tdsls045 for that particular order &amp; position (Standard Functionality).<br />
<br />
My problem is if a new sequence is added in table tdsls045, field tdsls045.flag should be &quot;No&quot; because it's default at table level; but system is making it  &quot;Yes&quot;. I don't want to customize standard session &quot;Confirm Backorder Quantity&quot;.<br />
I just want to understand that what may be the reason of making field tdsls045.flag to &quot;Yes&quot; even though its default value at table level is &quot;No&quot;.<br />
<br />
Quick reply would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I know the one time I did something like this I did a find of the last record, updated the sequence and another field, then did an insert.  That was a lot easier than setting all the fields.  We don't own source code so I can't look to see how they are doing it.</div></div><hr />

This is just a work around.</div></div><hr />
