I have a little problem. I want to add some text at the footer of report. That text should be printed in different language based on language of report. <br />
I have updated the layout, added label field in &quot;footer&quot; section and defined the text in label field. I have updated &amp; compiled reports in different languages. Is this a right approach? because text is not printed correctly based on language of report.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advnace<br />

You can use that to debug your problem.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure, if language$ keep the language of the current user or the language in which the report is to be printed. In my situation, the language of User is always English (2) but reports are also printed in different languages like French and German, based on the Business partner for whom the report is printed. Report is printed correctly in the language as it is supposed to be printed but the text that I have added in the footer section is not printed in the correct language. <br />
<br />
One other small problem, the layouts of some reports are available to edit in English only, how should I update the layouts of reports in other languages?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
This variable should be entered in the concerning reportfield (in maintain layouts) in the field Language/Curr. expr. (ttadv334.dcex)<br />
<br />
That way text for exemple can be printed in the language of the customer (and of the report) instead of the home language of the Baan user.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this helps ?<br />

Thanks a lot for your responses. <br />
One more thing, is there any way that we can access the report language variable (lattr.language$) in a device script (script attached with a device) to know in which language this report is going to print?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
