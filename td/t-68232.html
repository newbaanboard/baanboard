<br />
If it already has form 1 and form 2, the new form should be Form 3? What's the issue? Did you removed the last two forms? Can you post a screenshot of your form from DFE(Dynamic Form Editor) if possible?</div></div><hr />

You can do this in Forms by Session (the Forms button in ttadv2100m000). Copy No 1 to 4, delete 1, copy no 2 to 5, delete 2. Now you got 3, 4 and 5 and those will be displayed in the right order.</div></div><hr />

The session is a new session . which is created by copyng the old session.<br />
<br />
<br />
When i tried to add the form on newly created session.<br />
<br />
its taking the form serail number as 3.<br />
<br />
The new session dosnt have any existing forms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th October 2015, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I must be missing something - In 4c4 when I add a new form to a session, using ttadv2111s000(maintain forms by sessions) I give it the number to use.  So I could delete the first form and add a new form 1.  What exactly are you calling the form serial number?</div></div><hr />
