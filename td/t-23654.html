<br />
I don't think its an error, if you receive any error then it shows below help text and abover input field button as COMPILATION ERROR<br />
<br />
Its a message generated by report generator</div></div><hr />

<br />
The compiler result is for sure alright, and doesn't show an error, nor a warning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">7th April 2005, 12:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me you are trying to compile a report that is in the update vrc (tdB40U_c4_in5p), looking at the screenshot of the attachement.<br />
<br />
Suggestion to undo changes to the report, change your pvrc to the own vrc and copy the report to the own vrc. Change the report and compile.<br />

<br />
yes i am compiling this report in update VRC but the report attached with the session<br />
<br />
tdind0460m000 is visible in this VRC only and with my Live VRC it is not visible<br />
<br />
but the session is there(live VRC) so i am trying to compile it there only.<br />
<br />
IS it allowed? if not then how i can find which perticular report i have to change<br />
<br />
please guide me .<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">7th April 2005, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">It's your system, so no one can tell you not to do this. But it isn't a smart thing to do, because if you get an update on this component, your changes will be lost.<br />
<br />
As said, first you have to undo the changes that you have made to the report. After that, change your package vrc to your &quot;own&quot; vrc, something like tdB40O_c4_in5p (at least with an O in it). Use Special, Change current package vrc.<br />
<br />
After that, copy the report to your &quot;own&quot; vrc (use CTRL X) and make the changes and compile the report. Doing the copy to the own vrc will take care that this component is directly visible in the live vrc, which will be derived from the update vrc (tdB40U_c4_in5p).<br />

<br />
I  am new to Baan so i have asked, is it allowed?  but u can tell me not to do that as <br />
 you are senior member of BAAN.<br />
<br />
I will try by copying to my own vrc, and if any probs i will get back to this forum<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
