<br />
I want to change the value in a var &quot;X&quot; on the before.report section depending on another var &quot;Y&quot; value(true/false) in the detail section.<br />
<br />
the var &quot;X&quot; has to be on the before.report, can't not be moved to any other section of the report layout.<br />
<br />
is there a way to do this?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm - When running the session script why can't you set x when y is set?  All of this before the report send command.  Is Y being set in the report script or is it true/false for each of the detail records?</div></div><hr />

It is because if at least one of the records in the detail the var &quot;Y&quot; has value true then var &quot;X&quot; has to be true, otherwise &quot;X&quot; remains false. I do not want to prerun the same select statement to find out first if &quot;X&quot; has to be true before I send all the detail records.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - two ways to do this that I see off the top of my head.  The first way is with the session script and should work since this is the before.report section.  What you do is pass X as false until Y has 1 true value.  At that point you pass a dummy record with X true.  By a dummy record I mean one where whatever sorting you are doing this record comes out first.<br />
<br />
Another method is to use the after.receive.data section - search for that and my user id. In this method basically what you would do is read through the tmp file that baan sends to the report.  You would look for any Y is true.  At that point you can reset the record pointer to the start of the file(maybe seq.rewind) and let the report continue to run.  The example you will find is where I actually add a field to the tmp file and change the sort.  You can probably adopt this to something you can use. Personally I like the above better than this one.</div></div><hr />

thanks for your help. I just pre-run the select statement to find out if the &quot;Y&quot; is true and set &quot;X&quot; to true, before the first record is send it to the report.<br />
<br />
thanks anyway,</div></div><hr />
