<br />
We are having a session to generate excel data file based on the the given input &amp; that file can either be mailed automatically by the session to an email id or saved to a local path. The session is working fine when it is getting run from menu. <br />
We are facing the problem in email functionality when the session is getting run in JOB mode. Following are the results (problems) in email functionality in JOB mode...<br />
<br />
1. Some time we get the mail without attachment.<br />
2. Some time we get the mail with attachment but no data in file.<br />
3. Some time we don't receive any mail.<br />
<br />
We are facing the problem only when the session is run in JOB mode.<br />
We tried to debug the session &amp; found it's returning the proper value &amp; sending the mail properly but we are not getting the mail that we actually need (Mail with attachment &amp; having data in attachment).<br />
We are usin elm command to send a mail.<br />
The problem persists only in JOB mode.<br />
<br />
Can anyone pleasev help me in this regard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">11th May 2010, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">So, could you check/try the following:<br />
<br />
1. what are the permissions on the output file that is created by the BAAN session - are these at least read for everyone, so that whatever that wants to read the file can do so<br />
<br />
2. use sendmail instead of elm to see if that works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th May 2010, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Expanding on what shah_bs wrote.<br />
<br />
(1) Make sure normal user and job user all have same access and permissions<br />
(2) Make sure in job mode that there is not a timing issue with the attachment.  The attachment made not be closed before the email is sent.  Sometimes things have to be slowed down to work.<br />
(3) While I am not familiar with ELM can you log received and set messages?  Just to make sure all the emails are making to elm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th May 2010, 21:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the job history and job messages . Sometimes jobs are so set that next step is not executed when current step is error prone.<br />
<br />
Further c if it's possible to use mailx instead of elm . <br />
<br />
Is user running job and user testing in non-job mode are different.<br />
<br />
Further when a session is run in job mode , run.job or cont.process is directly executed after before.program section . So some variable may  not be correctly set in job mode leading to error in email.<br />
<br />
Finally in jobs other sessions can not be called . If any session is called , u may need to convert to dll and then call the dll function and not session when in job mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanx for quick replies. Special thanx to mark. Your point 2 is right Mark. There was a timing issue. I suspended the process flow for few seconds before closing the file pointer &amp; now its working fine:)</div></div><hr />

Hi Sapna,<br />
 If you still need to know the answer to your query, below is the code for your reference:<br />
    |******* for Email Body<br />
          attachment.ID = cmf.createAttachment(message.ID)<br />
	ret = cmf.setAttachmentBody(attachment.ID,ttyeno.yes)<br />
	ret = cmf.setAttachmentMIME(attachment.ID,&quot;text/plain&quot;)<br />
	ret = cmf.setAttachmentFileName(attachment.ID,file.name1)<br />
<br />
	if bp = 0 then<br />
   |*******for Excel Attachment<br />
		attachment.ID = cmf.createAttachment(message.ID)<br />
		ret = cmf.setAttachmentBody(attachment.ID,ttyeno.no)<br />
		ret = cmf.setAttachmentMIME(attachment.ID,&quot;application/excel&quot;)<br />
		ret =   cmf.setAttachmentFileName(attachment.ID,file.name,ownr.f&amp;&quot;.xls&quot;)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
