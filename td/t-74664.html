I'm have created a calculated field (extension) that looks up the shipping contraint of a business partner. I'm showing this field in the sales order header, but it only shows the ID of the shipping contraint and not the description. Is there anybody who can tell me how to get the field showing the description?<br />
<br />
I have used this statement in the calculated field:<br />
select  scon<br />
from    tccom110 as a<br />
where   a._index1 = {tdsls400.ofbp}<br />
<br />
I'm adding a snapshot of how the field is currently displayed. I guess that I need to add an extra table to find the correct description, but I am not sure where the descriptions are stored.<br />

PS: I am rather new to LN and this is my first post. Hope that it is clear enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd October 2022, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">In 4c4 I just ran the session which had the field I was looking for.  I could then hit the help button and click in the filed I wanted help on - of course this assumes the you know a session with the description included.  And if a display field I would just go pull up the form and see what field it displayed.   Of course this assumes you know a session which displays the field.  Another thing I could do to try to locate tables is run table maintenance and see if there was a referencing field, then check that table out for what I was looking for.  And last but not least was go print were used on domain or tables.  So in your case I would run field scon - or you could run the domain for scon to see what other tables it could be related to. Of course I usually limited it across one module or something like that.  <br />

That tccom110 does not exist in our 4c4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The comment of JaapJD did it for me. In the calculated field, I refered to domain tdscon and that worked perfect.</div></div><hr />
