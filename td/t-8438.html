<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">15th January 2003, 13:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Today I tried to delete a table.<br />
<br />
Therefore I deleted the table definition (ttadv4520m000) and then the table with ttaad4231m000. Then I run a Create RDD over all domains an tables.<br />
<br />
If I check $BSE/dict/.... I find there still a file for this table. If I try to access this table via ttaad4100, the system asks me, if I would like to allocate the file... I didn't continue here, but normaly the system would create the table!!<br />
<br />
Stange do some of you have similar experiences?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">15th January 2003, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">not sure how to &quot;clear&quot; the shared memory - but use the &quot;srdd_init6.1 -p&quot; command to see what tables are actually loaded.  Maybe the table you deleted is in the shared mem as the previous post by lbencic.</div></div><hr />

The table's DD file will always be present as you might use the same table in another company. Deleting a physical table means you are removing it from the database. The table's DD is removed when you delete the table from the session-ttadv4520m000. Hence, when you go into the GTM to the same table and company it asks you if the table storage has to be allocated or not. If the table was deleted or if the table is new and no runtime has been done, and you go into the GTM and try to get into it then an error message is given - Data Definition t&lt;table-name&gt; not found.</div></div><hr />

that is what I said, I deleted the table with ttadv4520m000. If I use GMT the system still offers me, to allocate the space. It doesn't tell me, that there is no table definition -what it should do- ????<br />
<br />
May it can follow the advice of nick and check the shared memory.<br />

is there a possibility to redirekt the output of srdd_init6.2 (ERP)?<br />
<br />
I tried &quot;srdd_init6.2 -p &gt; foo&quot; but it doesn't work. The program prints a lot of information, but to fast to follow.<br />
<br />
Btw. I'm on a Unix system.<br />
