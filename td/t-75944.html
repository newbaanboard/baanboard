<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">31st August 2023, 11:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, now we are talking...<br />
tlesb300 is populated already, as i see. That is good, I assume you mean that there is (also) a record for your BOD, caused by:And i have an active data flow. Problem happens even before the BOD is triggered.<br />
Now it is to see what your problem exactly is.<br />
1) No source code: as indicated before, that is not an error but a feature. The debugger states you cannot find the source so stepping into the BOD.Publish define/function is not possible. So we put that aside.<br />
2) Actually because the standard BOD for tcmcs048 does not include all fields, and that the BOD has no User Area,Now let's move into this statement. Which component do you take for &quot;The standard BOD for tcmcs048&quot;? I only found a BDE CostComponent(_v2) [tcmcs070/tcmcs071] on my system... No mentioning of tcmcs048 in the &quot;Infor LN - June 2023, Inbound BOD Mapping and Descriptions&quot;...<br />
 Did you try to &quot;Extend&quot; the BDE CostComponent_v2? Or the .found.by.you. standard BOD for this table?I mirrored this table to a tx table and build a BOD just to sync out when there is change/Add/delete. To me this indicates that you want to go the extra mile to get this done. So why not take another direction? Like I worked out here before: (and you have seen that before) (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showpost.php?p=221659&amp;postcount=14) In that way you can create your own BOD on the standard table interfacing all needed fields. And yes, I am aware that such interface needs modelling to get the complete set of data as used in LN (due to normalization) to make it a nice complete set in LNAnd as far as I know, this is the script sitting in table extensions that invokes the BOD publishing, also listed as Public Interface documentation<br />
<br />
        r = BOD.Publish(<br />
        		&quot;Txmon048BOD&quot;,	|i.noun,<br />
        		&quot;txmon048&quot;,			|i.bod.table,<br />
        		mode=DAL_NEW?&quot;Add&quot;:&quot;Change&quot;,    |i.action.code,<br />
        		0,			|i.bod.entity.type,<br />
        		&quot;&quot;,			|i.bod.entity.code,<br />
        		txmon048.cpcp,          <br />
        		&quot;StageOrPublish&quot;,<br />
        		l.exception.message,<br />
        		l.exception.id,<br />
        		txmon048.cpcp<br />
        		)Looks quite similar to what I posted here. (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showpost.php?p=220156&amp;postcount=1194])<br />
And BOD.Publish is implemented in otcextbodapi so it has to be declared. Error pops when cursor hits line with DAL_NEWMaybe you should try the construction I used in the forementioned post (see the After.Save code part) (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showpost.php?p=220156&amp;postcount=11)<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated. Is it possible to extend a standard BOD to include 'User Area'? That would be a good idea if possible. ThanksSure too, you can add calculated fields for both input and output, but you must take care of the mapping to LN fields by update queries or DLL function calls yourself (this should not surprise you)</div></div><hr />

Yesterday night, i found that tcbod0299m000 has to be used for BOD Publish in my case and it seems it is no longer a practice to invoke BOD from DAL extension of table. Not yet done as am working with xsd/xml still. Then i can try publishing using tcbod0299m000.<br />
<br />
Cost component is part of 'CodeDefinition'. You'll notice that it only has cpcp and dsca and not the rest. Also, no UserArea. <br />
<br />
I will definitely look into referred threads...it's better and cleaner to extend an existing BOD. feel good.. thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">31st August 2023, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">In the standard BOD add the component CodeDefinitionBOD, add the hook &quot;Add Calculated Fields&quot; and &quot;Process Inbound User Area&quot;<br />
<br />
You can use AddXML or AddValue to add Calculated Fields and call DLLs (declared in the Declaration section) or functions (in the Functions section) to process the incoming data.</div></div><hr />

Where did you get that information? And why?<br />
<br />
Because we use bod.publish (as LN Public Interface) a lot (and do not have tcbod0299m000), or we do use functions like tcint.dlltcbod.publish.item.master.common.replace().<br />
<br />
Note that we have some custom BODs but most important interfacing we do with BOD extension of standard BODs for which (as the name suggests) &quot;Publish Custom BOD Data&quot; [tcbod0299m000] would not apply...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is intended to be able to fire (data load) your home made BODs all in one action, but not on change of data for each current changed record, as can be done in a DAL extension with BOD.Publish().</div></div><hr />

I am unable to separate the component within CodeDefinition BOD that publishes cost component. Tried randomly but getIdentifiers is never getting hit in debugger. So, unable to find. If you can, please let me know. The same would be needed even if I were to extend a BOD with a new component. Maybe I should ask Infor? The BOD being published lacks UserArea.

I have done that in LN Studio.Does it involve generating libraries or everything done in Extensions.Creating new ones, from the Integration Perspective are generated in LN Studio. In the Extension Modeler they are also generated on top of the (standard) DLLs (which are left untouched, like in the normal events, extra hooks are added and called in the extension)<br />

With Is hook necessaryyou mean a trigger to send out the BOD on change of record? Not sure about that. I think you may need a table extension in tx to address your BOD in tf.</div></div><hr />
