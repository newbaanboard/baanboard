We have problem with oracle triger and baan convert to runtime. We added triger to oracle DB side for checking external data transfer. When we convert to runtime , triger on oracle db side is absent. Do you have any exprience withi this subject ?<br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - I am very familiar with this.  One DBA keeps code ready to recreate the trigger because I tend to forget to let him know when I run CRDD on certain tables. :)  This all has to do with the way baan does the CRDD - somewhere along the way it drops the table(drops the triggers), recreates the table and reloads the records.  I do not have a good solution.  Maybe someone else does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple: Never ever use them. <br />
<br />
First, because the database &quot;belongs&quot; to Baan, but more important, because application logic should be maintained in the application, not in the database. Triggers are a bad thing from an architectural point of view, and it's always a bad idea to use them for creating interfaces to other systems (that's what they are usually used for...)</div></div><hr />

Thanks<br />
Sorry, but I really do not know what script or commands they use.  I just know that they keep it ready - just for me. :)</div></div><hr />

Just run the trigger script (PL/SQL) starts with &quot;CREATE OR REPLACE&quot;.<br />

<br />
we had the following situation:<br />
<br />
We supported a external product configurator with e.g. the tiitm001, price tables, project  etc.<br />
<br />
The trigger was updating the external item master if an item was modified within baan. Doing a reconfig of the table (sometimes the effect came with reconfig of other tables) the triggers got lost, therefore data was missing on the external product configurator.<br />
<br />
So we had one db script containing al the oracle PL/SQL Code with all triggers. <br />
<br />
We had to run this e.g. from TOED or Oracle Enterprise Manager.<br />
It runs some seconds, afterwards all triggers became valid again.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can use a oracle enterprise management repository (installed with oracle db, no extra cost). There you can detect if an trigger gets invalid (ALARMS and Events) and you can run the trigger script with a so called FIXIT_JOB on oracle level. <br />
<br />
Because of the &quot;CREATE OR REPLACE&quot; Syntax no problem with existing triggers. (none existing will be created, existing triggers will be replaced).<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

I don't want to run external oracle job for this!. Whenever there is a re-config operations, after that my triger will be reloaded. I think that it should be possible on DB level. Does anyone have any exprience about this. Additionally, thanks for past posts.<br />
<br />

Thanks in advice !</div></div><hr />
