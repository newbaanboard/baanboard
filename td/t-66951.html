Just increase the window size of after.tfacr200.itbp.3 and add those field in there. Also check whether there is anything coded in after.tdsmi201.acty.1 section of Report Script.<br />
<br />
If yes, then move that piece of code as well to after.tfacr200.itbp.3 section.</div></div><hr />

Hi, I try it before but the data (in tdsmi201.acty.1) only display one data (the last one) at tfacr200.itbp.3. So, still have any way can solve it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess you have 3 fields in there. So, just move those three fields in after.tfacr200.itbp.3 layout. What do you mean by displays only one data?<br />
<br />
Else, what you can do, add new field in Report input fields and name it something like znew_field and provide similar domain as tdsmi201.acty. Now, assign the value of tdsmi201.acty to this new field. Now duplicate the layout tdsmi201.acty.1 and name it as znew_field.1. It will then print it after after.tfacr200.itbp.3 as &quot;z&quot; comes after &quot;t&quot;. You can suppress the layout tdsmi201.acty by assigning Output Expression as 0.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Nope, only 1 field in the tdsmi201.acty, so my data will auto running. If got 5 data then display 5 lines, if 8 data then display 8 lines. Please refer my attached file for more details. Thanks.<br />
<br />
I means in my database got 3 data but only last data can display on the report. I try to put the message on my report script, the 3 data can read but only last data display my report only.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestion. I try do it but still same result. Please advise. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
