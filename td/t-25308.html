<br />
As part of Sarbanes Oxley compliance auit, we have to generate bunch of reports as follows, need some help with the same.<br />
<br />
1. Price Change Report<br />
2. Price override report<br />
3.Customer Change report<br />
4.Credit Limit Change Report<br />
5.Supplier Change Report<br />
6.Voided Transaction Report etc<br />
<br />
As far as I know the auditors are looking for the audit of the person responsible for changing the data. I also know that this can be done with turing on the audit on these specific table in Baan, due to the performace issues we have turned off the AUDIT on all the tables except the mandatory baan tables(parameter tables).<br />
<br />
do I have to write custom session for the maintanance of the data, use the Function servers and log the changes in a custom tables, can it be done? what is the feasible solution. <br />
<br />
Any one come across this situation. Appreciate any help<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure what other Baan standard auditing tools are available by user, if that slows you down too.  If that is not possible, we have a tool called RMCgen, similar in nature to QKEY and the 'rush' solution on these boards.  The tool allows you to add code to standard sessions without modifying or owning the source code.  With such a tool you can add your own audits to these sessions fairly easily.   The wrapper tools are useful in many areas.<br />
<br />
Just 1 thought.</div></div><hr />

If you have Oracle as your database, you can use Oracle INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE table triggers to populate another table with change info like userid, date, time, or any other available item you need. Using triggers does not noticably degrade system performance. If you know PL/SQL then the rest is pretty easy.<br />

None of the above are required for SOX compliance. <br />
<br />
i.e. If somebody wants to baanboozle the company by changing a sales price, it is not a concern of SOX as long as the transaction is correctly registered in the ledger.<br />
<br />
<br />
I swear, SOX is the best thing to happen to IT since y2k.</div></div><hr />
