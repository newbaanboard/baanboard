<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">21st November 2003, 00:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I can shell to &quot;licmon -w&quot; to get the list of users logged on, with username.pid, but am wondering, how do I determine the process ID of the user currently logged in...<br />
<br />
The issue, is that I can not interrogate the return of the licmon command, as the user may be logged on multiple times. Hence, I'll get;<br />
joe_bloggs.357<br />
joe_bloggs.498<br />
<br />
If I log on as joe_bloggs, then how do I know if my main process ID is 357 or 498...<br />
<br />
Using functions, such as get.mwindow.attrs and returning mwin.pgrp to try and work back, to get the main process ID, doesn't work... If I go to the option dialog and click on 'start shell', then do a 'ps', it does not show the main process ID anywhere...<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get the main process ID, from the currently logged on user?</div></div><hr />

I know in UNIX I could get my current main process number for licmon by just starting a sh and doing ps -f.  On my system in is the first listing.  I do not have a clue on how to get something like this on NT.  Also maybe if you let us know what you are trying to do someone will have other ideas on how to accomplish the task.<br />

Good Luck!<br />
