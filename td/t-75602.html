<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">31st January 2023, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually these are a number of presets you used to use in the past for different possible form settings. Nowadays DF.0 is for Dynamic Forms default settings.<br />
<br />
Once set you can alter each setting.<br />
<br />
Nothing fancy, just quick way to set values for specific use cases: you can mark one line and click the Open Read-only button to see which settings are made. Helps for standardized behavior (similar to the standard) when using the match for the use case (see description of the option sets)</div></div><hr />

1) Without too much understanding: level monkey see monkey do: always select DF.0<br />
<br />
2) With some understanding: level wanna know: Select DF.0 and click the Open Read-only button to see which settings are made. These are selected (and suitable) for the majority of the Dynamic Forms used nowadays.<br />
<br />
3) With more understanding: There were different types of sessions / forms each with a different presentation and thus different optimal settings. Like Multi Occurrences (M) or Single Occurrence or Print/Process. These differences are no longer used, the forms are &quot;dynamic&quot; and appear different with the same settings. History is fun but unused history is burden.</div></div><hr />
