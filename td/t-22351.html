<br />
I have a report and if all fields have zero value then that particular row is to be darkened. How is this possible? Please help if there is a solution.<br />
<br />
This is for printing purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th November 2004, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never tried this, but maybe in the before layout of the report script you could check all the values and use the CF$(1) command to turn bold on. Then in the after layout set cf$(0) to set back to normal.  Not really sure if this would work.<br />
<br />
What I typically do is add a new field at the end of the line.  Then in the report script in the before layout section I check the fields.  If all fields are 0 then I set this new field to &quot;*&quot; or something. Then in the after.layout session set it back to a space.  Or if you have few enough fields you can put in the print expression something like x = 0 ? &quot;*&quot; : &quot;&quot;.  Just some options.<br />

You would have to have a print condition to determine which layout gets printed.</div></div><hr />
