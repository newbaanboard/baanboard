I find it hard to believe that there is absolutely no additional offered functionality since 1998. <br />
<br />
I learned development with Knowledge Quest, and the Quick Tools stuff and have been doing development, off and on since 1998. I know that Baan 5 or Baan ERP_LN have additional functions, such as the ability to open a file on the client's PC and read/write to it. Has that been added to Baan IV?<br />
<br />
I was also wondering if anyone had an application that allowed me to run an sql on a remote baan system in real time. I want to synchronize certain tables, so that they are the same across two systems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan' own net using tabledef6.1 may be handy for tables with same database in similar servers for updating the tables realtime across servers .</div></div><hr />

Yes, your example has been added. #pragma used dll ottdllbw. Client2server and server2client (and much more). You can try successfully many of the new functions. But very often you will need an actual porting set and actual tools patches.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: I'm not shure that I understand your question. I'm using this function very often. And some other file-functions (the baan Version of chmod and so on) also. If this has been your question, yes I can confirm it. <br />
Many of the function you find in the manual files from baan 5 you can use at IV also. With (nearly) every new portingset and tools patches some functionality becomes back-ported to baan IV. But I also didn't find them in the manuals from IV. Just by try and error (or success  :) ).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">My baan manuals date from 2000 or before. In those manuals there was a list of functions for 3gl and 4gl.<br />
<br />
Now, I have worked with Baan V, and in Baan V, there were functions that were not listed as part of my documentation list for Baan IV.<br />
<br />
For example, allowing a &quot;local open&quot;, a &quot;local write&quot; etc to the client`s disk(s) as opposed to the server disks.<br />
<br />
It was claimed that the new baan V functions were also available in IV, if the porting set was current.  Can someone please forward the list of new functions. I would like to know, for example, if radio buttons are being supported, or what new 3gl functions are available that would be most useful to me.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
as far as I could see, all the Baan V functions as per ERP-Programmers Manual in WIKI are also available under the latest porting sets of Baan IV (even xml* functions!) with following exceptions:<br />
<br />
- DAL functions.  Not surprising as the DAL functionality IS the main new thing in Baan V.<br />
<br />
- Socket functions. Not a big loss as practically useless due to a) lack of thread programing in Baan and b) the fact that sock.recv() function can block the whole bshell when trying to read more data as actually available! (..and there is no way to know how much data has actually arrived!!)</div></div><hr />
