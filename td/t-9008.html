You could try and make new session code that is connected to the same program script, same main table, same forms, but only connected to the one particular report you would like to give access to. Then for the person in question, give the permission to access this new session code instead of the original one<br />

But the downside to it is that you will have to keep modifying the program scritp if you want to keep on adding users.<br />

And in the report you just allow access to those users present in this table.<br />
<br />
But the best way would be to copy the existing report to a new report session and then give access to selected users to this new report.<br />
