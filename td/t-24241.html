Tables tdinv150 and timrp010 give each give a picture of what our planned inventory movements are.  However, each is incomplete, so both need to be looked at to determine the entire picture.<br />
<br />
For example, tdinv150 has SFC issues and receipts, PUR receipts, and SLS issues.  Timrp010 has MPS issues and receipts, MRP receipts, PUR receipts, and SFC issues (we're using MRP for purchased items and MPS for manufactured items).<br />
<br />
Has anyone combined these two tables to give users a single comprehensive display session for planning purposes?  If not, what advice would you give on creating such a session.</div></div><hr />

That will serve the purpose of print as well as display.</div></div><hr />
