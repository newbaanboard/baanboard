Refer to -<br />
<br />
Create Runtime Data Dictionary (Forms and Menus) (ttadv5214m000)<br />
Use this session to convert the forms and menus, or changes in existing forms and menus, to the run-time data dictionary.<br />
You can use the Multilevel check box for software distribution purposes to ensure that only the latest version of the forms and menus are available. This is instead of all versions in all package VRCs that are available. Define up to which package version the forms and menus must be converted to the run-time data dictionary.<br />
Run this session, for example after changing/translating labels. Note that this session must also be run after changes in software made by the following utilities:<br />
Copy Software Components to New Package VRC (ttadv6265m000).<br />
Delete Software Components by Package VRC (ttadv6250m000).<br />
Import Language-Dependent Software Components (ttadv6231m000).</div></div><hr />
