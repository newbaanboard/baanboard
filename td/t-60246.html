<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheMind</div><div class="date">18th March 2011, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">After installing SP27 for Baan IVc4, 5 different custom reports show up blank in the Preview window, give &quot;Invalid argument encountered&quot; when you right-click on the blank window, and hangs the Baan session.<br />
<br />
I went to Maintain Reports, and when going to Edit Layout for the Layouts, it seems the Layout Fields have disappeared and that may be why the report shows blank?<br />
<br />
Anyone experience this before and have an easy way to correct the reports?  Or, is it really a situation where customization needs to be re-done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th March 2011, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Never seen this with a service pack, but we have had reports get corrupted before.  We can usually just re-import them from another company. Do you have a copy in either a test company, service pack company or production company?  Somewhere you can re-import them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheMind</div><div class="date">18th March 2011, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We have the reports in several different VRC package combinations, but I don't know if they are in different companies?  <br />
<br />
And what is the process to import them from a company or package combination?  I see in Maintain Reports there is a Special -&gt; Copy to Current P-VRC but that just tells me &quot;Report already exists in current VRC&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th March 2011, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">At our site our development company points to a VRC derived from the production VRC.  So we can delete the report from DEV and then just copy from the production VRC again.  Now if both reports in the prod and dev VRCs get corrupted in our development company  - then we can go to our production company.  Setup a customization, export the customization and then import said customization into the development companies.  Our development companies and production companies are different and are on different machines.  Have you checked the other versions to see if all of them are corrupt?<br />
<br />
How do you do development? Do you development in the same VRC your users are in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheMind</div><div class="date">18th March 2011, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a dev package combination, but we don't do any development.  We don't have a developers license.  The customizations were set up when Baan was implemented long before I worked here.  As far as I know, customizations were built on their systems and imported into ours.<br />
<br />
I just tried each of the different VRCs and the reports didn't work in any of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th March 2011, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Then I can think of only two solutions - try to create a new company and restore everything from tape.  That includes company 000.  See if you can get the report trying that.<br />
<br />
The second solution is to rebuild the customizations.  Neither option is very good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheMind</div><div class="date">21st March 2011, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">To note, previously Infor support ran a dbslog while we tried running a problem report, and the SQL statements and process in general didn't throw an error anywhere, it just simply brought up a blank report.  It seems like it should be an easy fix to get data to show up, but I can't figure out where to look and I'm not a Baan developer so I don't know how the reports were built or interact with Baan.<br />
<br />
Well, I figured it was going to come down to the second option.  Thanks for taking the time to offer suggestions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheMind</div><div class="date">21st March 2011, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing, after installing SP27 and encountering these report problems, a person here who works on Baan created a dummy report with a header and a footer as well as text and detail.  The text field names show up but the detail is blank.<br />
<br />
Even on a new report like this, somethings aren't generated on the report.  Is it due to layout changes?  Improper coding for detail?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st March 2011, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We just upgraded to SP28 and did not have any issues like this.  It sounds like a tools problem.  I would check with infor.  Have you tried creating a new easy sql report?  That would create a report with a header and detail section.  To me this sounds like something inside the tools environment or maybe around reports only.  Maybe if infor can fix the problem with a new report the old report will work.</div></div><hr />
