To solve this problem I usually use nested selects - first thing that popped into my mind:<br />
<br />
select product, machine, subs, type, size&amp;length<br />
from  table<br />
where ....<br />
group by product, machine, subs, type, size&amp;length<br />
selectdo<br />

	rprt.fgsqty = 0<br />
	rprt.fgoods = 0<br />
	select sum(a.fgsqty):rprt.fgsqty, sum(a.finishedgoods):rprt.fgoods<br />
        from   table a<br />
        where  a.product = :table.product<br />
	and	a.machine = :table.machine<br />
	and	a.subs = :table.subs<br />
	and	a.type = :table.type<br />
	and	a.size&amp;length = :table.size&amp;length<br />
	selectdo<br />
        endselect<br />
	| Above queries give total of qty and weight columns.  You<br />

Good catch - I did not see he was missing the :'s.  This is part of his other post on trying to group records in a report.  I will combine the threads.</div></div><hr />

i was hoping that it will merge the data that having similarity then i can group it into field&lt;location&gt; named &quot;M+S&quot;....but my sql knowledge sure is limited...and i randomly takes some code from the forum and tested it...leading to random duplicated data in table tdkpm620......</div></div><hr />
