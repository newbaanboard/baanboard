  <br />
I am using Infor LN 6.1  <br />
  <br />
I have to make a customization on tfacr2421m000 session, but I see that this program uses Macros. I never have worked with this.   <br />
  <br />
Anybody can explain me which is the advantage to use this Macros definitions?  <br />
  <br />
That is to say, if I want to modified this macros I would have to do it how I have done it before on the normal scripts?  <br />
  <br />
Thank you..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">17th December 2008, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The main advantage of using macros is to decrement the size of the source, avoiding repeating instructions. <br />
One golden programming rule, independent from the language used, is 'less instructions written, lesser the probability of errors done'. <br />
The only disadvantage using macros is the difficulty of debug them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for your answer, but the main disadvantage that you told me, this is my main problem, Is there some way to do debugger on this macros?.   <br />
How can I do?  <br />
  <br />
Thank you another time for your answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">17th December 2008, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">No way.<br />
In the debugger window the line appears as is written (with the macro call), so the only way to debug it is to ask the values of each single step in the macro. <br />
If the macro isn't called in a condition, you can modify the macro using variables to track the values you are interested in.</div></div><hr />
