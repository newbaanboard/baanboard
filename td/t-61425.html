<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertP</div><div class="date">4th November 2011, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I have a basic problem which is quite simple but I just canâ€™t get it to work.<br />
<br />
In a form type 2.  Several records have been saved. The last field on the form is a table field of type tcyesno (checkbox). <br />
<br />
Step 1 - If the user clicks it yes, then I want the program to automatically save the changes.  In the &quot;when.field.changes&quot; section I execute(update.db). In debug, I find that execute(update.db) resets the field value to No!  This is the current table field value.  Seems like execute(update.db) is actually doing a execute(recover.set)<br />
<br />
Step 2 - then execute another function (gen.scm) to generate additional records (on the same table).  This function works perfectly if the user manually &quot;saves&quot; the record on step 1 and then executes the function gen.scm from &quot;specific&quot; menu<br />
<br />
So, in a form type 2, is user tabs past last field on form, how to auto save the record before proceeding?<br />
<br />
Quite a simple but frustrating problem!<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
Robert</div></div><hr />

For a list of all standard commands and the program types in which you can use them, see Standard commands.<br />

4GL library function. <br />
You can use this function in 4GL scripts only. You can use it in the following event subsections: <br />
<br />
before.choice, on.choice, after.choice<br />
init.form, before.form, after.form, on.entry <br />
<br />
You cannot use the function in the after.choice section of choice.update.db.<br />
<br />
Doing some checking it seems every place I use it is a choice type section. I can't recall, but I think in one multioccurence session when they insert a new row in the choice section of add.set I execute(update.db) after each row. Check to see if they tab past the last field to start a new record that add.set is not executed - I think you can do it there in the before.choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I solved the problem by calling a function in do.occ()<br />
<br />
In the function I first called update.occ() and then execute(update.db) as well as managing the marked record, it all works perfectly, andno messages about &quot;records mod by other user, new values are displayed&quot;..<br />
