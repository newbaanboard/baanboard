<br />
I am testing SSA ERP Ln currently.<br />
<br />
There is no more Generate Session function in the menu.<br />
So to create a new session, I have to create one new session,<br />
then create the form and then the reports.<br />
<br />
I found the functionality, Report generator. But I don't see any Form Generator. So I have to insert all the fields into the form one by one.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway I can just generate the form??? Let's say I am creating a Maintain session for a table with 30 fields. In Baan 4, we can generate session and all the individual pages with all 30 fields can be generated in the forms. <br />
Can't we do the same in LN?? It would be a step backward if we cannot generate it. I thought the dynamic forms is suppose to be better and easier to create than the old form format in Baan 4.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

There is an option to 'insert all table fields'.  I believe that's as close as we are going to get for now.   It should also then insert the related / referenced description fields if appropriate, not sure about the zooms on those though, that does not seem to be working on the generate from what I have tried.</div></div><hr />
