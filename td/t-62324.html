<br />
I write a script which will execute as a job on daily basis. Script is for sending payment advise report as an attachment to the supplier.A batch file is generated and executed on cmd. I am using SMTP (BLAt Utility) to send mail. Now i need an exception report to track which mail has been sent from the server and which has n't.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to track the mails?????<br />

<br />
Normally when you send email you might create subject that is unique (like payment batch etc, and you can read the log file back with that subject. <br />

<br />
First thing is quite easy, simply cc the email to a special account of your own.<br />
Then you can check this email-account (for instance with a php-script) whether the copy has arrived.<br />
But to exclude an error in the recipients e-mail adress, you would have to locate the email that has been produced by the system informing you that the outgoing email couldn't be delivered.<br />
If for example the recipient's domain does exist but there is no smtp daemon running, then the informational email that the mail couldn't be processed may arrive several days later!<br />
<br />
What about the logfile of your mailserver? Can't you find info there whether sending was succesful?<br />
