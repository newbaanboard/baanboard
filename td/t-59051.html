<br />
I'm trying to put button in the session just like we have button in items Dashboard.<br />
<br />
I have created form commands for it and have created field for this on session. when i look at properties of Form Field in Form Editor, the 'Linked Form command' field is filled with form command. that is correct.<br />
In the form command i have selected this option &quot;Show as Button in Dialog or browse Session&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
But when i run this session, I can only see checkboxes on the session but no button. Do you guys have any idea why I'm not getting button on session. <br />

Aamir, check if your Session's DFE property is set to Rich View.<br />
<br />
Refer to the screenshot, you have to create the new form command and set the command type to field and associate to a field to get the button.<br />
Refer to field level help:<br />
Possible Values<br />
Form<br />
For all of the session's form tabs, the form command appears on the form's Specific menu, and/or as a button on the form.<br />
Group<br />
The form command only appears on the session's Specific menu when a user selects the tab that includes the group you define in the Group/Field Number field.<br />
Field<br />
The form command appears as a button on the form, behind the field whose Sequence Number you enter in the Group/Field Number field.<br />
Print<br />
The form command appears as an option in the session's print menu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your suggestion solved my problem.<br />
<br />
The reason was that Session's DFE property  Rich View was not checked. I just checked Rich View property then it (button) get appear.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
