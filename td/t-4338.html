how can i create a new field in a table ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th May 2002, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use session ttadv4120m000 session to add a new field to a table.  Then just create runtime data dictionary for the the table.  Remember to log out and back into Baan to get the new data dictionary.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
After new login/Bshell restart, check the table definitions, it <br />
should contain new fields.<br />
<br />
For creating new fields, table has to be recreated by dropping<br />
it first and then creating it again. Just recreation will not creat<br />
new fields. But it is a problem for table with some records in it.<br />
You to make a copy of the records, drop the table, recreate the<br />
tables and copy back the records to the tables.<br />
<br />
Now this what happens in migration of one major version to<br />
another major version -- BIVc4 to B Vc. In B Vc, both new fields<br />
and new tables are added. The data is copied from existing tables, the data is modified to new table definitions and added to<br />
the new tables.</div></div><hr />

How are you verifying that the table definitions have changed or not??<br />
If you are verifying thru GTM (General Table Maintenance), then it could be that you have changed table definition in a VRC which is not part of the package combination you are connected to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">21st May 2002, 17:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you run Create Runtime Data Dictionary (ttadv5210m000) with &quot;Tables&quot; and &quot;Reconfigure Tables&quot; checked for the table and package combination in question?  Following that, you need to exit and re-enter Baan.  If that still doesn't work, try running the &quot;Create Runtime&quot; again with &quot;Print Errors&quot; checked to see if you get any output.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didier</div><div class="date">21st May 2002, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes , i've made all you said , but nothing change !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st May 2002, 20:51</div></div><div class="posttext">It really is the easy. Modify the table, Create RDD, logout and back in.  So if you have done these steps and the new field is not there, then redo them.  So - first go change the table.  Double check the VRC of the table - make sure the company you are in uses that VRC.  Make some kind of change to the table - sometimes create RDD does not actually do anything unless something actually changed.  I usually delete a label, exit the table, then re-edit the table and re-add the label.  Next run Create RDD for the VRC of the table.  You should see a screen where the records are unloaded and reloaded. Once that happens log off and back on.<br />
<br />
If the company you are using is not attached to the VRC you are changing, then it must be in the companies derivation structure.  You must also make sure that there is not any definitions between your current company's VRC and the one you made the change.  If there are VRC's between your company and the VRC of the table changes, then you should try creating RDD for that table in all of the VRC's.  I have had corrupt RDD's come in from Baan.<br />
<br />
That is all I can think of - Good Luck!!!<br />

If so please read the threads that are active about shared memory. I believe you have to restart the shared memory for your datadictionary changes to become effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didier</div><div class="date">22nd May 2002, 11:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi , <br />
when i modifie a label , the change is done , but if i delete or add a field nothing change . Is there anithing to do for the change take effect ? <br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">22nd May 2002, 13:40</div></div><div class="posttext">on what kind of object did you make the change? On a form or in a table?<br />
<br />
For a form you should dump it (within developers data you can configure that it should happend automaticly after saving/exiting the form). <br />
Within a table you have to dump and reconfigure the table. If you have a Baan environment on NT than you will have to remove the table definition out of shared memory (via bentman) or restart your complete Baan environment. <br />
<br />
If the change still is not visible check if the dd file of the table contains your update. If it hasn't your reconfigure tables went probably wrong. (is there a .new file?) If it is, then you probably are running baan on NT and have to update the shared memory.<br />
