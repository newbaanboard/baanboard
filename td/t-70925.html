<br />
I just want to know that Infor LN studio is the only way to create sessions and other components or traditional Baan/LN tools can be used ?<br />
<br />
Please guide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st March 2018, 14:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Because LN UI is the only supported UI for Infor LN 10.5, you can only create those components that can be created with tools sessions that run in LN UI. Editing scripts, report layouts and forms is not possible with LN UI. <br />
Using BW to do development may work, but is not officially supported by Infor. <br />
I would recommend to start using LN Studio. Yes, it is a learning curve, but it has a lot of nice features in it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do we have to get a license to use LN Studio ? <br />
Report Studio is part of the same tool or it is another additional tool that we have yo get to develop reports ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">15th October 2018, 14:43</div></div><div class="posttext">For LN Studio itself there is no license needed. However, if you want to develop domains, tables or script components, the Development license (10146) is needed.<br />
Infor LN 10.6 has Report Designer, no license is needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garias</div><div class="date">26th October 2018, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello JaapJD:<br />
<br />
Thanks four your information. I have been working many years with BW,<br />
bit I wan to work with the new IDE.<br />
<br />
These days, I have installed the last version of Infor LN Studio  (InforLNStudio_10.6.0.0372-x86_64)  It looks good and interesting <br />
<br />
Some questions:<br />
1.- Why you say that using BW is not going to be supported anymore, since  INfor LN Studio requests that we have installed BW and DFE ?<br />
2.- If I create the static and dynamic connections in infor LN Studio without using BW, for example using baanlogin directly . I need to have installed BW or not ?<br />
<br />
3.- There is an option to force the developers to go through Infor LN Studio, instead of access directly to BW/BECS ? <br />
This question is because I saw that when a component is check out by one developer using LN Studio, the control to prevent other developers to change the component,  is working if both are using Infor LN Studio, but if the second developer is using BW, he can access and modify the component without any alert, even he can change the component in the Activity VRC and that is not good.   I am  not using SCM in my installation.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">26th October 2018, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">1. For LN Studio it is a technical component to be used for older LN backends. For 10.6 you can use http basic authentication and then BW and DFE are not needed anymore.<br />
2. See #1.<br />
3. SCM prevents it, but without SCM there is no block. But I doubt another developer can change a component in an Activity VRC, because you cannot set the current package VRC to an Activity VRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garias</div><div class="date">26th October 2018, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello JaapJD:<br />
ok thanks for your answers.<br />
1. and 2.  totally clear ok.<br />
3. You are right, the Activity VRC can not be set as current package VRC. Should be good if the control could be applied also for the original VRC without activating SCM, it seems that I should not difficult since all information is saved in the LN Server project.<br />
<br />
I saw that there is a enviroment variable to activate the use of  Infor LN Studio:<br />
FGL_STUDIO_ENABLED .  Could be interesting an enviroment variable to restrict the changes from BW. ?<br />
<br />
It seems that in the same LN Studio Workspace  I could create more than one development enviroment. But the project server is only one server, we can not define more than one project server? . if I want to work in different LN Servers from differents companies (customers), I can not work in the same workspace and define the two enviroment development (customer1, customer2) because the project server is only one.  Should I create two differente workspaces . Am I right ? <br />
<br />
I am going to use the Infor LN Studio and I will send you more questions/doubts. <br />
  <br />

a) LN Studio installed in a Windows Server in  Customer's facilities<br />

Hello Gerardo,<br />

Can it be configured with trial period installation? Any document you followed for configuring LN Studio? Please guide.<br />

Hello VishalMistry <br />
<br />
As was explained by JaapJD: in this thread.<br />
<br />
You need license for development to use fully LN Studio.<br />
You can use LN Studio if you do not have development license, but it will be work for basic customization tasks.<br />
To download the infor LN Studio KB.  1561993   but in addition to have login password in inforxtreme you need a user and password for the Infor Download Center.<br />
In inforxtreme also you can find the documents:<br />
Infor LN Studio Administration Guide 10.6.x.pdf<br />
and <br />
Infor LN Studio Application Development Guide 10.6.x.pdf<br />
<br />

It was fixed.<br />
RCA:<br />
Port 7900  in the Windows Server where LN Studio was installed should be open for input connections from the LN Server. <br />
