<br />
Why I can't edit a report script? The Developer's parameters are properly set, but when I push the button Edit Script nothing's happening, although the report script script file is created on server. My BaaN instalation is Unix server+Win client.<br />
I can edit this file on server, but it's annoying.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Bogdan</div></div><hr />

Have you typed the right editor's file extention ? I once had the<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem you are facing is that Baan Client is not able to open the editor. The reason is easy: It cannot find the path to it. <br />
<br />
Workaround:<br />
1. you can copy the file (probably wordpad.exe) to your baan inslalation path, for example C:\Program Files\Baan\Bin. It is only 200 KB...<br />
2. Or, you can write the whole path to the editor (executable) in Developers parameters. Sometimes it is a problem if the path contains spaces.... This is most often used if you have a &quot;smart editor&quot;. <br />
<br />
 Be sure that you have chosen to open the editor locally.<br />

I checked again; everything seems to be ok. (I am able to edit/view a program script !); but indeed, the system act like it's not finding the editor.<br />
I'll check on a NT system; I have a WIN2K and it's a little bit diffrent (because of cahed dll).<br />
<br />
Stefan, come sta lei? Grazie per l'aiuto.<br />
Ce lei in Italia o e ritornato a Bucharest?<br />
Migliori salutti da VILMAR.<br />
