<br />
I have a big problem. I am working with LN FP7.<br />
<br />
When I send a dump with source code and I install in other instance,  at final of each line the source code script is added  &quot;^M&quot; when I see it for VI, and when I see it with wscite  &quot;^M &quot;this understand it as final line and jump line. Anybody can explain me what happens with this?</div></div><hr />

Btw. You can remove that in VI with :%s/&lt;Control-V&gt;&lt;Control-M&gt;$//<br />
That meas substitute (s) within the complete file (%) the pattern Control-M at end of line by nothing.<br />

Is OK, I have transferred the dumps in binary mode, I understand that it is correct, I know that when the dumps are transferred in ASCCI mode are modified, but you explain me that is wrong way. In others installations I always had transferred in binary mode and I don't had problems. <br />
<br />
Your comments please.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Hi g端nther  <br />
<br />
Thank you by VI command, I didn't do so , but I did the same,  I get the program script and transferred it to my pc and then I erased jumps line, after I paste, by wscite, the script but now show me compiler errors.<br />
<br />
Before compiling, I made sure that no special characters added notepad<br />
<br />
Please can you explain me what might have happened?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
