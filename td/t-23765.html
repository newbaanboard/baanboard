<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">16th April 2005, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally, I use double.cmp() when comparing two floating point variables.<br />
<br />
Here is a question though.  <br />
<br />
Define  A as a float or double. <br />
<br />
The test    if A &gt; 12  then<br />
                  xxxx<br />
               else<br />
                  yyy<br />
                endif<br />
Does not generate an error message about comparing mixed mode. What if A is 11.999999999999999, will the else be taken with yyy action?<br />
<br />
If however I have<br />
                if A &gt; 12.0 then<br />
                    xxxx<br />
                else<br />
                    yyyy<br />
                endif<br />
<br />
The compiler generates a warning message. I do know that the yyyy branch will be taken unless I setup   the compare as <br />
            if 1=double.cmp(A,12.0,;.001)  then        | my tol value is 0.001<br />
<br />
What would the domain definition for A do if the domain was declared as 1 decimal place for rounding purposes?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 20:16</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) Comparing A to 12 is not comparing two doubles so I would not expect the warning message and I would expect the else clause to process when A equals 11.99999.<br />
<br />
(2) Depending on how you declared the domain.  I would expect the rounding to take place first.  So for example if you took two doubles multiplied them and the result was 11.999999, when you set A to the variable it would become 12.0.  I would still do the double.cmp, but you could probably tighten the difference.<br />
<br />
In Baan the last I remember reading was that the left side of an equation is what the right side was converted to.  In the case of integers or long then the right side would be truncated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">20th April 2005, 04:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I am at a loss to know what Baan does for mixed compares. Mark replied to me that there is a difference between<br />
<br />
if A = 12 then                and          if 12 = A then<br />
<br />
Where A could be 11.9999999999999 or 12.0000000001<br />
<br />
Does Baan promote the 12 to 12.000000000000  or does it <br />
round A to an integer, based on domains, and then do the compare.<br />

Please throw the book at me.  I am writing an application with interest calcs and hours accounting. I would like to know what to expect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th April 2005, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry - I was not very clear.  I meant assignment equations or math calculations.  So for example if you have A as double, B as integer, C as integer - then A = B * C results in a double.  Also if A is double and B is an integer then things like A&gt;B or A&lt;B will not result in warning messages.  You only get warnings when you compare two doubles.  So &quot;12&quot; is an integer and not a double so no warning for your example, and 12.0 is a double so then you get a warning.  <br />
<br />
In your other example if you use normal round and set a domain to have 1 decimal place the minute you assign the variable the rounding takes place.  So the minute you assign this new variable a value like 11.99999999 it rounds it to 12.0.</div></div><hr />

I raised this question on the board for the sake of being pedantic. I still am not sure why Baan chose to not warn about mixed mode comparisons. To me, it is urgent that such warnings be made. If the developer does not want to see them then he has several means at his disposition to silence the warnings. <br />
I set an office standard where a source must compile free of all warnings. That was done to ensure that during maintenance, a warning added would not be missed.<br />
In areas where I am confident of the code, I permit the programmer to put<br />
#pragma nowarnings<br />
before the comparisons in question that generate warnings<br />
and<br />
#pragma nowarnings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I appreciate your answer and while you did respond appropriately, I believe that neither of us put in the assembly option to check what the compiler did to generate a mixed mode compare. <br />
<br />
I really need to know what the compiler does for mixed mode comparisons.<br />
Is it converting the long to a double or float, as I would think it should, or is it by default, looking at the domain definition of the long or float and converting long to match within tolerance. Knowing this would give me confidence in the code.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I should ask this question directly to Baan. then, from the source, we would have the absolute correct answer.<br />
