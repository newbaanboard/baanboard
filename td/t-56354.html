Is there any option in LN were we can maintain the Devices for different report by User. I know that we have the option of maintaining the Font types for particular report and VRC (not user) in Report Defaults session ttaad3105m00 or is there any method by which the Saved Defaults for the Printing Device can be avoided for a particular report and  particular user. As currently the saved deafults on the Device session (ttstpsplopen) is picked for all reports for a particular user which he is about to print.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">20th July 2009, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">In case of Baan IV C4 , you could try &quot;save defaults&quot; option in &quot;select device&quot; session after entering the device type in it.<br />
<br />
it works with the combination of User and report.<br />
<br />
Note : If the same user opens some other report - the Device type is not appearing as default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th July 2009, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">On our 4c4 systems anything saved in ttstpsplopen is defaulted for all reports.  This causes problems since this default device can become corrupted.  I do not recommend this.  In 4c4 you save default printers in a session.  But to the original post nothing that I know of by report in 4c4, but ln could be different.  What I did in 4c4 was create my own table (for limited sessions) that would allow us to save different printers for different users for the reports.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no idea - why it holds good in our environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th July 2009, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a good question.  When I look at ttadv990(user defaults) I see nothing that indicates the report.  I am wondering if your ttadv990 has report name included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">21st July 2009, 03:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Well , ttadv990 shows the session code , record along with baan user .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbdave</div><div class="date">21st July 2009, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi sushil,<br />
<br />
What mark says is right once you say saved defaults it save the default for device 'ttstpsplopen' and that is common for all report for that user,hence there is no way in Baan that it will save the setting for that particular report the particular saved defaults will be applicable for all report.<br />
<br />
I had worked in baan 4,5 and ln i had never seen what you are sayign but what i think that the session Report Defaults ttaad3105m000 must be coming in the picture in your case were the font tyeps anr linked to the device for particualar report hance what you must be seeing is that font types may be changing.<br />
<br />
Again my question is can we avoid the ttadv990 defaults.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">21st July 2009, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok , I shall make Fresh installation from master cd (test server)  and run some tests and let you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbdave</div><div class="date">22nd July 2009, 07:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks sushil and also to Mark for showing your interest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">5th August 2009, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally , i have made my observations  in test server.<br />
<br />
1.As said above - default device saved shall impact all the reports .<br />
<br />
2. their are some exceptions like &quot;ticpr2210m00&quot; where it is not a report session but it comes with report - if you make a save defaults for a particular device type , it remains only for this user &amp; session .<br />
<br />
not for all report sessions.</div></div><hr />
