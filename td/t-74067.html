<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garias</div><div class="date">15th October 2021, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We have LN 10.7 Cloud (multi-tenant) <br />
and we use LN Studio to develop components in tx package<br />
Our installation has the automatic monthly update from Infor.<br />
Therefore, every month, after the infor update,  we have  a new Package Combination and VRC is created, for example: <br />
ce01047 LN CE 2021.10   which was on Oct. 19.<br />
Package Combination: ce01047LN CE 2021.10<br />
and companies and developments are moved automatically there.<br />
Also  the LNStudio development projects (tlprj110) , activities (tlprj120) , etc. are moved automatically to the new environment.<br />
<br />
Opening LNStudio, we receive messages  that application has ben changed, and the default Software project has been changed (from EXTce01046  to EXTce01047)  and we need to refresh the projects, and recover the open activities.<br />
<br />
Also the two dynamic connection points  (Development Address, Runtime Address) for the Project Software EXTce01047 have to be created manually again and  the previous dynamic  connections points EXTce01046  have to be removed.<br />
<br />
Is that ok ?  or there is a form/different process  to create the two dynamic connection points with a generic name (example:  EXT_dev, EXT_rt),  so  that they could be used although the default software project change each month? <br />
 <br />
Someone working with LNStudio connected to a LN Cloud environment that can share with me his/her experiencies (pros/cons)<br />
<br />
