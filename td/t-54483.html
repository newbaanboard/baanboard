<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanjim</div><div class="date">10th December 2008, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I'd like to have some information (documentation?) about the &quot;Authorization Group&quot; property in the &quot;maintain form&quot; session.<br />
<br />
I have to disable specific menu in some sessions depending on the rights of the users (connected via DEM).... theses specific options can activate others sub-sessions or external functions. So I wonder if I can modify the value of the &quot;autorization group&quot; to solve my problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Authorization Group Select the Authorization level users must have to carry out the form command. All commands with an authorization group that is higher than the user’s authorization for the session are removed from the /kd/dtd/specific menu.<br />
Example:<br />
A user is authorized to view and to print records in a session. His authorization group for that session is 'Print/Display'. All form commands with authorization groups 'Full Authorization' (Delete/Insert/Modify/Print/Display), 'Insert/Modify/Print/Display' and 'Modify/Print/Display' will be removed from the /kd/dtd/specific menu.<br />
You must choose the authorization group of a form command according to the following guidelines:<br />
Command Type If this form command… Authorization Group in Form Commands (ttadv3118s000) session <br />
Form, Field or Group gives access to functionality, where a delete action should be possible. Full Authorization <br />
Form, Field or Group gives access to functionality, where an insert action should be possible, but no delete action is needed. Insert/Modify/Print/Display <br />
Form, Field or Group gives access to functionality, where a modify action should be possible, but no insert or delete action is needed. Modify/Print/Display <br />
Form, Field or Group gives access to functionality, where data is displayed, but no print, modify, insert, or delete actions are needed. Display <br />
Print gives access to report functionality, which also provides an option for the end-user to delete data (or executes a delete action in the script). Full Authorization <br />
Print gives access to report functionality, which also provides an option for the end-user to insert data, but not to delete (or executes an insert action in the script). Insert/Modify/Print/Display <br />
Print gives access to report functionality, which also provides an option for the end-user to modify data, but not to insert or delete (or executes a modify action in the script). Modify/Print/Display <br />
Print gives access to report functionality, which prints data, but does not provide an option to modify, insert or delete data. Print/Display <br />
<br />
Note<br />
You can define authorizations in the Authorization Management System module, and link these to a user on the Authorizations tab of the User Data (ttams1100s000) details session. <br />
