<br />

<br />
OR<br />
Which table is being used by session tfacp3425m000<br />
<br />
 anybody can help ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">24th January 2003, 08:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Option 1 -<br />
In &quot;Maintain Session&quot;, on Form 1, there is a field for main table.<br />
<br />
Option 2 -<br />
From the session name. The 1st, 3rd and the 4th &quot;digit&quot; of the session code refers to the main table used. But, this is not always true, as in your case too.<br />
<br />
Option 3 -<br />
Use session &quot;ttadv2450m000&quot;. After using this session, probably the main table used in the specified session is &quot;tfacp004&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">24th January 2003, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">And if you are looking to use in your program code, then you can use the predefined variable -<br />
<br />
string  main.table$(9) 4R  Name of current main table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">24th January 2003, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this is another option. But, in case of Leena's query, probably she does not have the code for the specified session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tahnx for the help<br />
<br />
but:<br />
option 1:<br />
 it is not showing any main table for this standard session,means the main table coloumn is blank in this case.<br />
<br />
and for option 3:<br />
it is showing 'No data with in selection&quot; while running the  &quot;ttadv2450m000&quot; session.<br />
and tfacp004 table is using only for analysis coding,i want the main transaction table.<br />
<br />
Please help</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I have checked the same at my end also. The field is left blank.<br />
<br />
it is showing 'No data with in selection&quot; while running the &quot;ttadv2450m000&quot; session. <br />
<br />
It is giving me the output. Check VRC, script code, etc. when you execute the session.<br />
<br />
i want the main transaction table. <br />
<br />
I am sure the output of the above session will certainly help you, but if you need some more information then you post your query under &quot;Finance, Invoicing and Integration&quot; forum. I am not the right person to answer this query.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Print sessions technically don't have main table. To find out where the reports get most of their data, you'll have to either<br />
 read the program script of the session<br />
 be very well versed in the module, in your case tf, to be able to recognise immediately which table it is using<br />
<br />
I don't have the program script of tfacp2450m000 and BaanERP finance is not my specialisation. But I'm sure someone in this board can help you with this<br />

Use session &quot;ttadv2450m000&quot;. After using this session, probably the main table used in the specified session is &quot;tfacp004&quot;.<br />

<br />
yes it is the transaction table,but it is not satisfying my requirements,<br />
<br />
<br />
My exact query is this (It is not related with tfacp3425m000,this is my actual problem)<br />
In my session the program script selects the following data<br />
<br />
A=100,B=200,C=50,E=100,G=300<br />
<br />
While report script is selecting the following data by setting relation into standard and report table<br />
A=50,D=20,E=10,F=50<br />
<br />
Now my report is showing A=150,B=200,C=50,E=110,G=300<br />
<br />
Though what I exactly   want is A=150,B=200,C=50, D=20,E=110, F= 50,G=300<br />
<br />
So how can I get this ?<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />

Could you also explain from the functional side, beside technical side, what kind of report you are trying to make, please? This may help us help you better. Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leenaa</div><div class="date">24th January 2003, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">What I want to do is, I want to merge the payments which is posted or still pending to post,<br />
<br />
Session tfacp3425m000 is printing the supplier aging summary (posted payments).<br />
<br />
Now  what I m doing is ,I m writing a report script using table tdpur045(putting condition tdpur045.matc = tdpur.matc.no(for unposted payments)),<br />
<br />
by doing this it is showing only that supplier which have any posted payment or<br />
 it is not showing that supplier which have only unposted payment.<br />
(Means it is showing the same suppliers for customized or standard  report, but it is adding up the data  i.e posted or unposted payments in customized report by writing the report script)<br />

hope u got any idea,</div></div><hr />
