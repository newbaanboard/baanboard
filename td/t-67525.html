<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pbenven</div><div class="date">25th March 2015, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a heavily modified Routing Sheet report with 3 after.field layouts. I want the detail and the 3 layouts to stay on the same page. The quick and dirty way that I know of is to total up the lines of the 3 layouts and put that value in the Nd field of the detail. My problem is that after.field.2 has a variable number of lines (it contains routing text). Am I hooped?</div></div><hr />

I tried doing it - but those variable number of lines would always hose it up.  And changing it so it was 1 line per page would kill a tree.  Eventually they learned to live with the fact that the text length and information could always hose something up like this.</div></div><hr />
