The 2 fields of the second one are part of the index of the first.<br />

I want to do this select but with a refers to clause:<br />
      select T1.*<br />
      form T1<br />
      selectdo<br />
           select T2.*<br />

           selectdo<br />
           endselect<br />
      endselect<br />
<br />
I want to do something like this:<br />
        select T1.*, T2.*<br />
        from T1, T2<br />
        where T1.f1, T1.f2 refers to T2<br />

<br />
It's possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">25th May 2004, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually this can be done using combined fields, check on the Sales Order Deliveries  table - tdsls045.  The combined field:  cmba is a reference to the Sales Order Lines table - tdsls041, view this in the Table Field definition.  If you have read the 45 table for some reason, and want to get the related 41 record, you could write it like:<br />
<br />
<br />
select   tdsls045.*, tdsls041.*<br />
from     tdsls045, tdsls041<br />
where  tdsls045...... some condition relative to tdsls045<br />
and   tdsls045.cmba refers to tdsls041<br />
<br />
<br />
If the combined reference field is not defined on the table, I am not sure if you can make the combined field reference on the fly.   You can try something like this instead:<br />
<br />
and {tdsls045.orno, tdsls045.pono} refers to tdsls041<br />
<br />
But really I am not sure if that would work, as it is not a reference defined on the table.  I think that's what the combined fields are meant to overcome.</div></div><hr />

It is no necessary to have a reference defined on the table, only if you have the 2 combined fiels in the index of the 2 tables.</div></div><hr />
