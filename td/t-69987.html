So I am stumbling my way trying to understand a modify a report that has already been created. I am modifying it in Hidox and now some layouts aren't displaying.<br />
<br />
It is the production order checklist, and the header for my material list(detail.3) is not showing. Currently my material list layout has an output expression of &quot;flag.opr.matrl=1 and p.outb=tcyesno.no and k.of.data(1;11)&lt;&gt;&quot;order.distr&quot;<br />
From googling and poking around through this forum can I assume these values are assigned in the program script? I think it would be best for me not to modify the program script since that is a little out of my scope. I have full access to the report script<br />
<br />
Now how do I get a header on the top of this detail? The layout that was working before converting to hidox is a before.field.flag.opr.matrl layout with the same output expression, but my header is nowhere on the report.<br />
If I open the report script there are these lines in before.field.flag.opr.matrl<br />
  if lattr.print and fd_lattr.print() and html.fp.host then                |@uto_HTML<br />
        if lattr.break then                                                      |@uto_HTML<br />
                put_elements_ov1_before.flag.opr.matrl.1(tdhtmdll0001_language.get()) |@uto_HTML<br />
        |ndif                                                                    |@uto_HTML<br />
        endif                                                                    |@uto_HTML<br />
<br />
I can force the header to display by simply commenting out the IF statements but then the header appears twice on the same page for some reason.<br />
<br />
I think it may be better to start from scratch on a new header so I can work from there if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help</div></div><hr />

At least that is what I would look at doing first in 4c4 - might not get you what you expect but it might get you the layout.</div></div><hr />
