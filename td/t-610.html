<br />
We have a requirment from the business for a new functionality within BaaN.<br />
<br />
This will require a new table, new set of forms and reports.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any advice, theories behind that I should be aware of or anything that I absolutley should do?<br />
<br />
I obviously will be testing this on our test server first but has anyone done any BaaN development to this scale?<br />
<br />
It is not a major operation.<br />
<br />
6 fields in a new table which will have to be created.<br />
Then also the relevant forms and reports to maintain the data and report on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">11th December 2001, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be best to stick to baan standards when naming the sessions and tables.  <br />
<br />
Keep to Baan standards for formatting new forms and reports.  The users of the system should not notice a difference in your new sessions.<br />
<br />
You could create a new module for your customizations or use an existing module.  If you are using an existing module then use a prefix to identify customizations eg. tiitmc402m000.<br />
<br />
Make use of Baan's Customization Adminstration module to help you keep track of new and changed components.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of for now.<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">11th December 2001, 23:59</div></div><div class="posttext">If you follow the naming conventions for Baan, all you will need to do is create the table properly, and run Generate Sessions for the Display, Maintain and Print sessions.  All of them should come out requiring minimal changes if you only have 6 fields on the table.<br />
<br />
The naming I am referring to is as follows:<br />
Table Name:   tixxx900<br />
Maintenance Session:  tixxx9100m000<br />
Display Session:  tixxx9500m000<br />
Print Session tixxx9400m000<br />
<br />
Just put the 1, 4 or 5 in the right place and the Session Generator will know what to do from there.  You can accept the defaults, or change the options.  On thing you'll for sure want to change is the default option for the report from type 1 to type 2 or 3.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As said by maria, use Customization Admnistration (projects/ part,...) to keep track of all the components you create or change. It is very important and with that you can create patch and easy install mods on others baan servers or on same server but other VRC (if you use baan V).<br />
<br />
Use release notes to manage differents versions of your developments.<br />
<br />
In addition to lisa bencic reply, you can use tixxx9200m000 for process sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">outra9e</div><div class="date">12th December 2001, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">we have two packages derived from stnd these being liv0 and tst0 obviously i would create the new functionality in tst0.<br />
<br />
I have only been working with BaaN for a few months so I am a bit wet behind the ears if you like!<br />
<br />
So, I create a new table in the relevant module.<br />
<br />
I beleive that when I do this part of the process should ask me if I want BaaN to generate the relevant parts for the sessions for the table?  If this is so then I should then just be able to customise as I need to for efficient functionality.<br />
<br />
Is this the case?  If not how should I go about this?<br />
<br />
Sorry if I seem a little dense, but you have to get your experience somehow!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your input on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">12th December 2001, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a session ttadv2290m000 under Maintain Sessions in Baan tools which will generate a session for you, you will need to provide the type of session eg. Maintain or Display, as well as the name of the table.  This will create the Session, Forms, Script and report (in the case of a print session) for you and then you will be able to modify these compnents to suit your requirements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">outra9e</div><div class="date">12th December 2001, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for all your help, I have been reading into this as well as all of your helpful comments and I feel ready to run with this.<br />
<br />
No doubt if I get stuck I shall be posting away again.<br />
<br />
Once again many thanks</div></div><hr />
