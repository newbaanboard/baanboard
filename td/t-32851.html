<br />
Dont know if this issue is really for Admin forum or for Dev. forum.<br />
<br />
We have created couple of reports and on bw print we have done some FONT SPACING and within the report we have assigned User Font 11 to certain fields. Now issue is that when i execute the report it comes perfect , where as my colleagues executes from his machine/laptop, it doesnt come perfect i.e. the right side is getting cut which means i am able to see amount as 55,000.89 where as the other fellow is able to see only 55,00<br />
<br />
I have already imported the Font registry into his laptop as well, still it dint solved the problem, it is occuring for only certain machines. <br />
<br />
Can somebody give me a hint as to what could be the real problem, inspite of this same font registry exisiting at both machines. <br />
<br />
Does BaaN Client version also plays a role in this or any other stuff which i have missed ?<br />
<br />
This is something urgent for me to figure out and i tried allmost all possible things which i could think of.  :-(<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
I would say yes the client and version of bw print should match.  At least I would make sure they match.  Also are you both printing to the exact same printer?  If not can you have him print to your printer?  Have you checked the print configuration of the laptop versus your configuration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your prompt reply.<br />
<br />
We both are having diff. -2 default printer, my colleauge is actually gegoriphically located a bit far and i sit at diff. office. so thats the reason y we have diff. default windows printers.<br />
<br />
but we r not firing any printout/output on the actual Printer, we are just doing a Print Preview in our Device WIN_Print.<br />
<br />
Using the Print Preview only we are able to see this problem. <br />
but tell me if both the persons have diff. phsycail printer, does doing a Preview also affects the way report look ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Note : win_Print is a device which exists in Device Data and it has Device Type field as value as WINDOWS PRINTER.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

Some problems with the physical printer being configured differently cause baan reports to look a little different.<br />
<br />
I would make sure the client and bwprint were the same.  It sounds like you both use the same print device in baan.  Have you checked the file that makes it down to the PC?  I think it is a .bpf file in the baan/tmp directory on the client.  You should be able to an editor to just check to make sure that the complete number is there.  If that looks okay it could be the font or bwprint - at that point I really will not be able to help since we do not use windows printing.</div></div><hr />

Hi learner,<br />
as far as i know the above statement is true. We had the same situation in our setup.<br />
I think that bwprint makes use of the physical margins of the printer.<br />
So check if your colleague's printer has a greater phiysical margin so that your report doesn't fit on the paper size.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps,<br />

<br />
Thanks for the same, yesterday I had a word with my colleauge and yes it seems that since he is having diff. default printer thats why it was behaving in this fashion.<br />
<br />
But i wonder if i have 100 users in co., who are using 10 diff. printers which means i have to make sure that all user stick to same printer setting while doing a print preview or print.<br />
<br />
Anyways , i tried locating margin setting in my printer setup, but could not do so, i am using XEROX phaser 6120. <br />
<br />
Are u talking of Paper type defined in Printer setting. Refer to below screenshot.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
My answer to that is - possibly.  Even though we print via a UNIX print server I have run into one case where the default settings on a physical printer were different - causing the report to work incorrectly.  They reset the printer to factory defaults and everything was fine.  I know my finance users do not print to one printer because it is setup for something else and Baan reports do not come out on the printer.  So you may only have to deal with those where the user has made changes or defaults do not work - I can not say for sure since we do not use windows printing, but it seems to make sense.</div></div><hr />

Hi Learner,<br />
that's not exactly what i mean. In our situation we had the following problem:<br />
Suppose printer type A. Physical margin of printer is f.i. 8 mm.<br />
So the print area is width of paper - 2 * 8 mm.<br />
If you define your Baan Report to fill the complete print area on that printer and you use a printer B with a physical margin of 10 mm then the report doesn't fit on the paper on that printer B.<br />
I hope it's clear.<br />
What i did was that i changed the report a little bit to match the print area on type B printer.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps,<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />
