Hello,<br />
<br />
string openmode The mode in which the file must be opened. This can be one of the following options:<br />
<br />
&quot;r&quot; Open for reading. The current file position is placed at the start of the file. <br />
&quot;w&quot; Open for writing. The file is created if it does not already exist. The current file position is placed at the start of the file. <br />
&quot;a&quot; Open for writing. The file is created if it does not already exist. The current file position is placed at the end of the file.<br />
<br />
The file position is placed at end of the file before every write statement, even if the previous file action was a seq.seek().<br />
 <br />
&quot;x&quot; Open for writing. This is the same as &quot;w&quot;, except that the function fails if the file already exists. <br />
&quot;r+&quot; Same as &quot;r&quot;, but the file can also be written to. <br />
&quot;w+&quot; Same as &quot;w&quot;, but the file can also be read. <br />
&quot;a+&quot; Same as &quot;a&quot;, but the file can also be read. <br />
&quot;x+&quot; Same as &quot;x&quot;, but the file can also be read. <br />
Use the following modes to indicate whether the file is a binary or a text file. You can combine one of these modes with any one of the previous modes (for example, &quot;rt+&quot;). <br />
&quot;b&quot; Use for binary files. This is the default mode and need not be specified. <br />
&quot;t&quot; The line separator(s) for text-files are different on Windows NT and UNIX systems. CRLF on the former; LF only on the latter. In addition, a Windows NT text file can include an EOF-character (^Z) that indicates the end of the file. This character should not be returned to a program reading the file.<br />
<br />
So, you must specify the &quot;t&quot; option when reading from or writing to a text file on Windows NT systems (for example, &quot;at+&quot;.) This ensures that line separators and EOF characters are handled correctly. Never use the &quot;t&quot; option when opening a binary file; on Windows NT systems this will corrupt the file data. The &quot;t&quot; option has no effect on UNIX systems.<br />
 <br />
Normaly -2 says:<br />
<br />
ENOENT<br />
No such file or directory<br />
<br />
This occurs when a specified file name should exist but does not, or when one of the directories in a path name does not exist.<br />
<br />
2 ENOENT - No such file or directory<br />
Description: <br />
This error occurs when a specified file name should exist but does not, or when one of the directories in a path name does not exist. <br />
Solution: <br />
Possible solutions: <br />
If a file or directory is missing, you must create the file or directory or restore them using a backup.<br />
If a table is missing, check the company number. Your current company number can be different from the company number the Virtal Machine is using.<br />
The file or directory exists, but still the error occurs. Check the redirection of the files.<br />
<br />
Try to use FULL path :<br />
<br />
temp.file = &quot;app/data/installation/cust_avail_credit.txt&quot;<br />
temp.file = &quot;/app/data/installation/cust_avail_credit.txt&quot;<br />
