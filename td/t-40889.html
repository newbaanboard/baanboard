If you need to do special calculations and/or filtering of records, then you can still program it yourself. I have done it before, so if you need references, I may be able to help you..<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
this field in tdilc1512m000 (itm.stoc) is read with itdsls0005 and has the value from tiitm001.stoc.<br />
<br />
isls0005 Check item reference<br />
itm.stoc = tiitm001.stoc<br />
<br />
It's not calculated on runtime in B4c4.<br />
<br />
So you have to built your own logic and coding !<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baancust</div><div class="date">25th August 2007, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">display.total.fields() cannot be used in Baan IV I guess because it gives compilation errors.I was talking about how the scroll bar comes only for the part where there is multioccurance data and the total appears in a footer like area.<br />
When I tried putting the calculated total field below the multioccurance fields in a separate graphical box the scroll bar was getting shared with the part where I have written the total field and the value was not getting displayed.However when I put the same total variable where the index fields where there .i.e at the top it displayed accurate values<br />
Currently I have copied the form of tdilc1512m00 and replaced its body with my form fields so my total appears properly.So I concluded that it has got sumthing to do with the form feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">27th August 2007, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">My apologies, display.total.fields() indeed does not work for Baan IV, if required I can provide you a way to program it, but I have to warn you that you will be &quot;messing&quot; a bit with Baan standard functionality...<br />

Kind regards,<br />
