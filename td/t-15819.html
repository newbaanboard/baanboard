We did just create an app that does write to a custom baan table.  Then we process these records into the hours accouting table.<br />
<br />
Also check you private messages.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
<br />
Can you please explain what is the custom method you followed to update custom tables??<br />
<br />
Is there any connectivity in Baan 5.0 c which I can use to push data into some other database.<br />
<br />
I really need this solution :))<br />
<br />
Hey thanks for the private message.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st July 2004, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know anything about Baan 5, but in Baan 4c3/4c4 we use a couple of packages called Autotime &amp; Autoquality.  These packages uses DDC type function servers to push data back and forth between the applications.  Every few minutes a job runs that moves the data to the other app and another job runs to move data back from the application.  You may be able to use this type of record transfer. All of the coordination is handled by interface programs on both sides using interface tables.<br />
<br />
As for the custom app and the custom table, what we did was to create a new table in baan(tpfsp215).  There is another piece of software (web application) that writes directly to this table.  Our Oracle admin setup a different user-id and password for just this table for this app.   So this web app runs(not sure what it really is or what it is written in) and it writes to the tpfsp215 table.  Then I developed a few sessions let the users see the records(and modify if necessary).  Then the user runs the process session and I find the selected records in tpfsp215 and write directly to the tpppc235 hours accounting history table.  I track which records are processed in the tpfsp215 table with a flag.  Supposedly the web app or middleware we call it reads from another oracle table somewhere to get the records to put into the tpfsp215 table, but I am not sure what all it does.  I do know we have successfully pulled records into the tpfsp215 table and then processed through to the tpppc235 table.  All of this goes into production on Tuesday of next week.<br />

Thanks again for your valuable time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. You can create  a database link in the BAAN instance in order to recognize the table in the other instance.<br />
2. Create a PL*SQL script that can read a BAAN table and update the table in the other Oracle instance.<br />
3. Create a shell script to connect the BAAN instance and runs the PL*SQL created before.<br />
<br />
You can do this creating a BAAN session that writes de PL*SQL script (step 2) and runs step 3 using a shell commad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you please elaborate more on the solution you gave.<br />
<br />
I will appreciate your help.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

This is the appproach I have done in past. I will create a small VB or java program that can read the i/p file and create record in the table. I would then call the external program via Baan by using run.prog or shell. This seems to work fro me.<br />
