<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camste</div><div class="date">4th May 2011, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear gurus,<br />
I am creating a session, and now I would like to change the standard commands available for it. So I right click, choose &quot;standard commands&quot;, and then get the window with all the check boxes. The problem is just that I'm not allowed to do any changes here. No matter which changes I do I get a popup telling me to &quot;Enter a value for the Step Size field&quot;. I can even un-check a box, press submit and get the error, and then re-check it, and still get the same error. I'm allowed to choose a different command set through the &quot;St. Command Set&quot; button, and then press OK, but if I try to open the commands list again it's back to the commands it originally had. This affects only this session. All the existing ones I can change the commands for without problems. If I create new sessions using the same table now however, I can change the options for print sessions, but for the others I haven't been able to do it. What do I have to do? Where is this step size defined? Is it defined per table?<br />
The table doesn't have any DAL associated with it.<br />
<br />
I hope you can help me.<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
please make screenshots from your session settings and I'll try to reconstruct it on our Linux-System.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

Thank you. Yes, checking the horizontal field helped. I had misunderstood the meaning of it, and thought it meant that it would display all the fields in one line like in a list (even though I wanted a regular dialog) rather than just giving a &quot;pivot&quot; like effect in overview sessions (as I see from the help linked to it now).<br />
But what is the reason for it to be impossible to change the options with this check box unchecked? And in case we in the future would need something displayed vertically, where can we set this step size?</div></div><hr />

Editing ttadv300 in GTM and putting value '1' in step size  ttadv300.stsz (it was previously zero) seems to have solved it without causing any other issue that I can see.  <br />
<br />
As a test, I also set the value back to zero after changing the standard options, this also worked. <br />
