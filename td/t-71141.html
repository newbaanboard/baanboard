<br />
This is for ERPLn FP0<br />
<br />
I am trying to create user exit dll for table tcibd001. I have attached screen shot of what I am doing to create UE DLL.<br />
<br />
What happens is that general DLL is created in place of UE DLL.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help to find out missing step?<br />

I think User Exit DLLs have not been introduced with the first releases of LN but with a solution for FP4.:<br />
<br />
Extra hooks added (User Exits DLL) <br />
TOOLS VERSION(S): 7.6_a4 <br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: &quot;4GL Engine&quot; (ttstpstandard) <br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
It is not possible to extend the standard functionality of saving and deleting records without modifying the standard components. Customers want to have the possibility to add extra functionality before and after saving and/or deleting records without modifying standard UI scripts and/or DAL scripts. <br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
In order to be able to extend the standard functionality of saving and/or deleting records, the concept of User Exits has been introduced. A so-called User Exits DLL (UEDLL) can be created in a non-standard VRC which provides 8 new hooks that are executed just before and after the defined standard sections/hooks of the UI script and/or DAL script. By implementing extra business logic the defined business logic of the standard software can be extended. <br />
This solution contains a Functional Addition. Please read solution 22827268 for the background of Functional Changes. <br />
PATH NAME IN DIAL-UP DIRECTORY/WEB SITE: <br />
Below are the supported VRC's based on the Baan standard derivation structures. <br />
If your Current Tools VRC is: <br />
7.6_a4:(FP4) <br />

<br />
By FP4, I think you mean FP4 for tools. In my previous company, our Ln configuration was ERPLn FP2 application + FP5 tools future pack. We were able to create user exit dll.<br />
<br />
So, Geeks out there, it it right that user exit dll functionality is not available in ERPLn FP0?<br />
<br />
Thanks for clarifying,<br />
Vishal</div></div><hr />
