I need to know how to add a new input field in report, whereas the package of the report and the field is different. The report package is wh (warehousing) and the field package is tc (common).<br />
<br />
Might be there is some missing that i forgot to do.<br />

Are you changing the source script for the report program to pull the new field? If yes, then just add to input fields on the report, put it in a layout and compile it.<br />
<br />
If you are going to populate the new field in the report script. Do not add it as an input field.  Just declare it at the top of the report script.  In the appropriate section (before.field, after.field, etc.) write the query to pull the field.  Then add it to the correct layout and compile.<br />
<br />
So what exactly is the problem you are having?</div></div><hr />

Field package isn't important for adding new item to report(except that some cases like VRC). Package structure and working flow is a bit complex. In my opinion you need some information about this structure. I suggest that you should firstly learn this structure very well. You can read other threads about packages and their workings. Use search tool on board. <br />

That's all</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all you have suggested to me. I never thought that i've to maintain at the script too, coz for all this time i just add it at the editor sheet. I follow your instruction &quot;If you are going to populate the new field in the report script. Do not add it as an input field. Just declare it at the top of the report script. In the appropriate section (before.field, after.field, etc.) write the query to pull the field. Then add it to the correct layout and compile.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
And now the report is run perfectly. See you...!!<br />

Best regards,<br />
