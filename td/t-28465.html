<br />
I am facing this unique problem. When i am using print session to print the report it works fine. But when i want to run the same print session again without closing the first report, it doesnt allow me to do so. This was working fine previously. we cant open two reports from the same print session at the same time. What could be the problem??<br />
<br />
Hope i am clear in putting up the problem.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help Please.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

It was working previously?  Have you installed any patches or updates?  How does it exactly stop you from running the report twice - what are the messages or errors?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raikar_raviraj</div><div class="date">21st October 2006, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Well  I think i was not able to put forth my question effectively enough for you people to understand it.<br />
Let me make one more attempt..<br />
<br />
I dont think this is da problem of report script or program script, because this was working fine couple of months back, and i dont think we have touched the program scripts of most of the sessions.<br />
<br />
Well regarding updation of patches, well we had upgraded the service pack of our sql server, that was all about it.<br />
<br />
The problem am facing goes on like this.. When we open the print session and feed in the requisite data on the form and then take the report preview usin our defaults windows printer setting it works perfectly fine. Now i keep the report open, and want to go back to the print session and want to view the same report for different data specification, then it doesnt allow me to do so.. The print session goes in to busy mode.. Unless and untill i close the opened report, it wont allow me to enter data on the print session...<br />
<br />
First it used to allow me to view the report as many times as possible with the same print session..<br />
<br />
Hope this is more clearer.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your valuable solutions for this query..<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Maybe some unknown magic power changed the code over the last few months causing this new behaviour...<br />
<br />
It's maybe only, but it's worth a try...<br />

<br />
If I understood your problem clearly , do you mean that in all your print sessions even standard/cutomised when you print your report with one specification and then minimise it and using the same sesion type in different specification the report does not execute , am i right ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raikar_raviraj</div><div class="date">24th October 2006, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">hi ..<br />
<br />
U are partially correct.... The first part of your understanding is perfectly fine..<br />
When i minimise the report... it doesnt allow me to enter the specification the second time.. forget abt executing it..<br />
<br />
Do u have ne solution for this?<br />
<br />
Have u encountered such problem? i fell this is bit different and tricky problem..<br />
None of the solutions mentioned above works..<br />
<br />
Can u help me in this respect?</div></div><hr />
