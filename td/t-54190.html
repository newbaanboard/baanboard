       I want to achieve the connection to Baan 4c4 through Baan LN. I am able to do it. But it also opens Menu Browser(ttdskmbrowser) of Baan 4c4, which I dont want.<br />
<br />
Can any one please help me to do so. I want to make the connection to Baan4c4 without any UI and to call the 3GL scripts in it. After calling one script I should not loose the connection. I should be again able to call the other 3GL script and close the connection when not required.<br />
<br />
I also tried to use &quot;-server&quot; in the command field of bwc file but was not able to do so.<br />
<br />
My idea of doing such is at very core level so may sound odd, but please give suggestions. Any suggestions are accepted.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

<br />
Why don't you want to loose the connection after the 3GL finishes?<br />
<br />
Check this link:<br />

<br />
The way described there every 3GL execution will create its own connection, and you can wait for one process to end then execute the other one.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot for your reply.<br />
<br />
I want to maintain the connection because I need to keep on calling number of 3GL script in Baan4c4. So if I try to create the connection each time I call the 3GL script then it will affect the execution speed. So I would like maintain the connection.<br />
<br />
Please suggest if there is any efficient way to achieve this.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Rahul</div></div><hr />
