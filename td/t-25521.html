<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">1st November 2005, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I am getting the following error<br />
    :Host variable expected after ':'<br />
    :Syntax error:  '}' not expected<br />
    :Found 2 errors during scanning/parsing .. Stopped.<br />
    :Error 302 (SQL syntax not correct on SELECT<br />
    :Cannot continue<br />
My program code is attached and the form is a type 3 form.  The error occurs when I navigate to the next set of records.<br />
<br />
What I find very strange, is that the same code is attached to a different session.  Also a type 3 form but different because the data which is displayed is different.  When I navigate to the next set of records, I do NOT get this error.<br />
<br />
So I think the problem lies in the form but I have compared the two forms and I see nothing to explain this behavior.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any assistance.</div></div><hr />

Try to disable the query extension in the script and see if the problem still exists. <br />

I just did a comparison between the fields in the index and the fields which are displayed on the two forms.  On the form that creates the error, I noticed that one of the indexed fields is not displayed on the form.  <br />
<br />
When I added the field to the form, the form no longer outputs an error message.<br />
<br />
Guess I found my own solution.  Thanks for the attention.</div></div><hr />
