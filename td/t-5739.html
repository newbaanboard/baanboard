<br />
I have a table with, let's say, two fields, for instance employee number and salary. I can make a type 2 session to maintain salaries and I can put a variable named, for instance total.salary somewhere on the screen to display a sum of all salaries entered in my table - that is not a problem.<br />
<br />
But my user sometimes uses Query option to display a smaller set of employees (but more then one screen, in common) . Of course my user expects that total salary value will be also calculated only for employees matching specified query.<br />
<br />
So,my question is: how can it be done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">8th July 2002, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">calculate the value in the maintable.io section of your session so that only the retrieved records are in the sum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">8th July 2002, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, but if there are more rows than one full screen, main.table.io section is not invoked for rows not present on screen. So result is wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can possibly do this using the function -<br />
<br />
do.all.occ()<br />
Syntax<br />
void do.all.occ( function_name [, ... ] )<br />
Description<br />
This executes the specified function for all occurrences on the current form. When included in the before.choice<br />
 subsection of a choice.update.db section, the function is executed only for updated occurrences. <br />
Arguments<br />
function_name	The name of the function that must be executed. The function must be of type void.<br />
...	Use these optional arguments to pass one or more arguments to the specified function. Use commas (,) to separate the arguments.<br />
Context<br />
4Gl library function.<br />
You can use this function only in 4GL scripts, of types 1, 2, and 3. You can use it in the following event subsections:<br />
before.choice, on.choice, after.choice<br />
before.input, on.input, after.input, check.input <br />
when.field.changes <br />
before.zoom, after.zoom<br />
See also<br />
do.occ(), do.occ.without.update(), on.old.occ() <br />
Example<br />
declaration:<br />
	long old_inventory<br />
choice.cont.process:<br />
on.choice:<br />
	do.all.occ( update_occurrences, 9999 )<br />
main.table.io:<br />
before.rewrite:<br />
	on.old.occ( get_old_inventory )<br />
	pctst999.change = pctst999.item - old_inventory<br />
functions:<br />
function void update_occurrences( long new_val )<br />
{<br />
	pctst999.special = new_val<br />
}<br />
function void get_old_inventory()<br />
{<br />
	old_inventory = pctst999.item<br />
}<br />

You have to write a function to find the totals and code it in the following choice sections so that the function is called when a user uses a filter, page up/down, previous/next record etc.<br />
<br />
Standard commands<br />
The following table lists the available standard commands and the types of program in which the various choice subsections can be programmed for each command.<br />
No	Choice_option	Description	Before	On	After<br />
01	start.set	Add/start a new group in main table	1234	---4	1234<br />
02	first.view	View first group of main table	1234	---4	1234<br />

06	def.find	Find a specific record on key	1234	---4	1234<br />
07	find.data	Start the set from the current data in the program script. Use: after import of data in a zoom process. (refresh)	1234	---4	1234<br />
08	first.set	View first set of main table	1234	---4	1234<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th July 2002, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I did something like this with one of my sessions. What I did was create a main session where the user input the filter fields, then clicked continue. When they clicked continue it launched a sub-session and used the query.extension to set the filters.  When they wanted to change the filters then they just hit the exit key.  The users liked this better because it seemed to be quicker than running a query.<br />
<br />
I have sinced changed the session to build the sql query. I import filters, build the query and parse it.  The only thing you have to remember is that now you control the next record, first record and so on.  So when they click on next record I have to rebuild the query.  It works really good for my situation.<br />
<br />
Not sure if they apply here, but thought I would mention it.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately function do.all.occ works only on records present on form. So, if there are more records matching specified query then one full screen, total value will be wrong (I tested it). .:confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot, Mark.<br />
<br />
Your idea is good, but I wonder if any general solution is possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you considered writing your own filter screen. Since you only have a couple of fields and probably only want to filter based on employee number range and possibly salary range, then you could write your own filter screen. Based on what the user enters, you can restrict your query to calculate the totals. For an idea on how to do this run the session tssma3501m000 (Display Service Orders) and click on the 'Selection' button.<br />
<br />
This is much the same idea as Mark's option, except that you would call the screen from your main session, in case you don't want to put a filter on your records. Plus, it means, just clicking on a button to change your filter if you so desire.</div></div><hr />
