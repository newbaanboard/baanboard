<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">16th May 2007, 21:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I have started to write Baan Help on some of the main custom sessions that we have developed but facing problem creating them. <br />
<br />
As an example, I took one very simple session and tried to create help for its one field.<br />
<br />
Using session ttadv1160m000 - Maintain Help Text Codes, I created a new help text code and put in Text the help information for that field. <br />
<br />
Then in the form editor, I linked it with the field using Help Text Code field.<br />
<br />
Using session ttadv5230m000 - Create Runtime Help created the runtime help for Forms and Form Fields<br />
<br />
Log out and log back in, ran the session and tried to get help on the field I just created help for, but my newly created help was not displayed. Rather the standard Press the Content button or [Z] for ... window was displayed<br />
<br />
What am I missing? <br />
<br />
We are on BaanIVc4.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I tried and worked for me:<br />
<br />
A) I went to maintain forms, clicked on the &quot;maintain forms fields&quot;, went to form 5 &amp; entered an already used help text code.<br />
B) Dump the form<br />
C) Create runtime using ttadv5230m000 for forms &amp; fields.<br />
<br />
I worked without logging out &amp; in.<br />
<br />
Make sure that:<br />
<br />
1) Your text code is working correctly. Maybe try to put (replace) it on another session that already has a Baan help<br />
2) The text is filled correctly in the maintain form field (form 5), as I did in (A).<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">17th May 2007, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Strangely, it is still not working.<br />
<br />
For testing purpose, I copied an existing help text code to our dev VRC and added a line and followed the same steps as George and it still displayed the old help (without the new line).<br />
<br />
Any other tips/ideas?</div></div><hr />
