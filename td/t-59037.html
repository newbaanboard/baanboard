<br />
I'm fairly new to ERP LN - but I had been working in Baan IVc4 for a number of years - so alot of that knowledge is applicable in ERP LN.<br />
<br />
1st off - in my experience in Baan IVc4 I never really used the &quot;Customization Administration&quot; sessions (Project/Project Part/Customization Part).  I find this is a requirement in ERP LN - to a certain point at least.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I've created a simple report session - nothing fancy - real simple - however - when I attempt to use ttiex4110m000:Components by Patch Code and add the components - I run into problems with the Session and Form components.<br />
<br />
I can insert the Script/Source &amp; Script/Object &amp; Report(source &amp; object) - but when attempting to add the Form and/or Session components - I get a &quot;Component not found&quot; message.  When I zoom to the Sessions(ttadv2500m000) or Forms(ttadv3500m000) sessions from ttiex4110m000 I don't find the components I'm seeking.<br />
<br />
I know they exist in the Package VRC I'm currently set to - because I can find the other components - but not the Session or Forms.....<br />
<br />
I'm perplexed at this - it's not how Baan IVc4 behaved.....<br />
Am I missing something? <br />
<br />
If anyone can give me a good explanation of the &quot;Customization Administration&quot; sessions and just what purpose they're serving for me - I'd appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

In LN, it is advised to use the PMC Distributor &amp; Recipient functionality to build a logical PMC solutions with dependencies, undo-install process etc.<br />
You can always use the Import/Export Data Dictionary (ttiex1280m000, ttiex1285m000), which don't give the enhanced pmc style options. Refer to the latest PMC pdf from the documentation portal.<br />

I know they exist in the Package VRC I'm currently set to - because I can find the other components - but not the Session or Forms.....<br />
Also check in the Patch codes session (ttiex4500m000) for the export VRC. The export/staging VRC might not always be the same as development VRC.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the tip about the &quot;integrated sessions&quot; when using the ttiex4110m000 session - I don't know why I didn't think of that.   When I use that as the component type - the patch file that's created contains both the Session and the Form.<br />
<br />
That just what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
I'm unable to find anything about &quot;Integrated Sessions&quot; in the &quot;Infor ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide&quot; so I'm not exactly sure what an &quot;Integrated Session&quot; is as opposed to any other session... but this does help me generate the needed patch files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">23rd August 2010, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">From the webhelp: Integrated Session<br />
The session and the session's form are integrated into one object. The form is a subcomponent of the session.<br />
When you perform an operation (for example: copy, delete, checkin, or checkout) on an integrated session, you also perform the operation on the integrated session's form.<br />
A non-integrated session's form is a separate object.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I do is, instead going in maintain s/w components sessions. I choose to maintain components from that component's session itself. All these sessions has option in specific menu as &quot;customization parts&quot;, select this one, enter project, project part, cust part and save. (Create Project, Proj Part, and Cust Part prior to this.). So that as soon as you create a new component say label, mesg, session, library, go to specific menu, select customization part, and maintain things.<br />
<br />

<br />
We haven't used much of the Customization Administration, its seems more used in the Baan5 versions, in the LN Tools PMC is the go forward way.<br />
<br />
Refer to my earlier note:<br />
In LN, it is advised to use the PMC Distributor &amp; Recipient functionality to build a logical PMC solutions with dependencies, undo-install process etc.<br />
You can always use the Import/Export Data Dictionary (ttiex1280m000, ttiex1285m000), which don't give the enhanced pmc style options. Refer to the latest PMC pdf from the documentation portal.<br />
You can also create a component list and use the Export DD tool too.<br />
Using Software Components by Customization Part (ttadv1176m000), you cannot setup the logical dependency of the software components or have a backup option like PMC. So it depends on your sox audit, change/audit management processes etc established at your company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">11th September 2010, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use both... we do, I think that is what Milind was referring to.<br />
During development we use customization admin to keep track of all the components.<br />
Then use PMC to generate the Patch based on Customization Admin (Connect Components to PMC Solution - check Customization Admin).<br />
<br />
If you wait to make the patch before gathering and connecting your components, you forget stuff all the time.  Need to make the Customization Admin as you go....</div></div><hr />
