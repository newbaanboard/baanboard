<br />
I have an issue with a multi-occurrence session.<br />
The session's main table is : tisfc001.<br />
And I want to add a filter on the session.<br />
The filter includes a query extension on a table which contains the fabrication order.<br />
So this is the link between the two tables.<br />
But in the database definition there is no indexes between the tables.<br />
And I can't modify the database structure.<br />
Therefore, in the query by form there is no field from the other table.<br />
<br />
I added two text boxes which contain the filter limits.<br />
And I tried to modify the session's script.<br />
I wrote this part :<br />
<br />
<br />
|%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />
function display.sort()<br />
|%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br />
{<br />
	domain tcbool exist<br />
	exist = true<br />
	<br />
	if  NOT ISSPACE(seri.from) AND NOT ISSPACE(seri.to) then<br />
		exist = seri.exist()<br />
		<br />
		if exist then<br />
			query.extension = &quot;tisfc001.pdno IN (SELECT lhlmb132.pdno FROM lhlmb132 WHERE lhlmb132.seri INRANGE :seri.from AND :seri.to)&quot;<br />
		endif<br />
	else<br />
		query.extension = &quot;tisfc001.pdno NOT IN (SELECT lhlmb132.pdno FROM lhlmb132)&quot;<br />
	endif<br />
	<br />
	if exist then<br />
		rebuild.query()<br />
		execute(find.data)<br />
	endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
I call the function when I click on a button.<br />
<br />
The code doesn't work properly.<br />
Sometimes the UI is totaly blocked and there are no more occurrences.<br />
So you need to close the session and reopen it.<br />
This issue was reduced by using seri.exist() to ensure that there is always data to display but it doesn't seem perfect at all...<br />
<br />
Moreover when you add a query by form filter it's well executed.<br />
If you remove it the query by form filter will disapear.<br />
But if you click on the button the old query by form filter will be executed.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me on this issue ?<br />
<br />
My goal is to filter session's records with the query by form filter and the UI filter that I have added.<br />
<br />

<br />
query.extend.where = &quot;tisfc001.pdno IN (SELECT lhlmb132.pdno FROM lhlmb132 WHERE lhlmb132.seri INRANGE &quot; &amp; quoted.string(seri.from) &amp; &quot; AND &quot; &amp; quoted.string(seri.to)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for your response.<br />
<br />
I tried to use your code part.<br />
But it gives me an error : unsolved reference.<br />
So I have added the dll : ottdllstring.<br />
But it doesn't change anything.<br />
<br />
Do you have any other idea ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
