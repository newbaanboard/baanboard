<br />
I am editing the Finalized Trans (by Ledger Account) with Supplier report. TFGLD140611001.<br />
<br />
Simple script addition to already customized code ...<br />
<br />
The first select statemetn WORKS FINE ....<br />
<br />
select tccom020.*<br />
	from tccom020<br />
	where tccom020.suno=:tfgld106.suno<br />
	selectdo<br />
		supname=tccom020.nama<br />
	selectempty<br />
		supname=&quot;&quot;<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
The SECOND statement below follows the above statement and will not execute at all !  When I step through the code, it gets to the &quot;Select tfgld&quot; line, then jumps completely past the end select stmt like as if nothing was even there.<br />
<br />
<br />
	select tfgld410.*<br />
	from 	tfgld410<br />
	where 	tfgld410.leac=:tfgld106.leac<br />
	and	tfgld410.ttyp=:tfgld106.otyp<br />
	and	tfgld410.docn=:tfgld106.odoc<br />
	and	tfgld410.amnt=:tfgld106.amnt<br />
	and	tfgld410.suno=:tfgld106.suno<br />
	selectdo<br />
		ponum=tfgld410.orno<br />
	selectempty<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
We originally had a declaration in for the table that matched the working syntax for tccom020 above, but no dice ...<br />
<br />
I can't figure out why it does this !  it is a simple query but it appears to not execute the select stmt. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Code as it sits in the report :<br />
<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout: <br />
<br />
| ** EHC Code Begins **<br />
	select tccom020.*<br />
	from tccom020<br />
	where tccom020.suno=:tfgld106.suno<br />
	selectdo<br />
		supname=tccom020.nama<br />
	selectempty<br />
		supname=&quot;&quot;<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
	select tfgld410.*<br />

	and	tfgld410.amnt=:tfgld106.amnt<br />
	and	tfgld410.suno=:tfgld106.suno<br />
	selectdo<br />
		ponum=tfgld410.orno<br />
	selectempty<br />
	endselect<br />

ANY SUGGESTIONS ????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">11th July 2008, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">If it jumps passed the 'endselect' it mean no record was found; since you didn't program any code in the 'selectempty' section, the program jumps on. <br />
<br />
As for WHY the required record was not found: maybe the tfgld106-fields are not all filled, for instance by not all being selected in its query? I suggest you run the report in debug mode, and check the values of tfgld106 before the query on tfgld410, and see if they contain what you'd expect. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">11th July 2008, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, yes, the code did drop through because I did not put in a condition at selectempty, thanks for that tip.... <br />
<br />
It does stop there now that I told it to just make the value 0 if empty ...<br />
<br />
The values for TFGLD106 are showing up in debug so it knows what it needs to match in gld410<br />
<br />
The values for the TFGLD410 are all blank though in debug ....<br />
<br />
If I run that exact query in SQL Developer I do get a result ...<br />
<br />
Is it possible the script is not recognizing the gld410 table or something ?<br />
<br />
Under Declarations, I had added 	<br />
<br />
table   ttfgld410.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">11th July 2008, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I removed some of my conditions and it will work on some. I think I just need to spend a little more time on the criteria to make sure they are picked up properly. Thanks for your insight ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">13th July 2008, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I would probably pull out the &quot;and tfgld410.amnt=:tfgld106.amnt&quot; and check the lines using 'double.cmp' with the desired precision &quot;.0001&quot; within selectdo --if (double.cmp(tfgld410.amnt, tfgld106.amnt, .0001) = 0) then.  You could be running into a rounding-type issue when comparing doubles in the select statement.  I normally don't use doubles in 'where' clauses since the internal representation may vary slightly.  If they didn't, there wouldn't be a need for 'double.cmp'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">14th July 2008, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the suggestions. The problem ended up being that the leac values were not equal in the 2 tables, I didn't even notice it. I removed the condition for leac from the query and it picked up the correct record...  Finance will test fully this morning ....<br />
<br />
I'll know to put in a value for selectempty too, and will look at the double.cmp entry.<br />
