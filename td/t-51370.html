<br />
Any Suggestions about how to print 3D Barcodes in BaaN IV.<br />
I found a lot of threads for barcode, but still m not that clear about how will I be able to  print 3D Barcode in BaaN IV.<br />
<br />
Is there any document for Barcode Printing in BaaN IV?<br />
<br />
...</div></div><hr />

We have the RMCis product to print barcodes, but I am not sure if it does 3D - we do not use that, but eventually we might be doing RFID.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you post the document for barcode you are talkin abt, atleast i can get some idea from there.<br />
<br />
Can any 3rd Party Tool be used for 3D Barcode?</div></div><hr />

This thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=97161) discusses some of the label options.  I would contact RMCis(merged with crossroads) about their RMClabel product - it might do what you are looking for and I thought it was reasonably cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you have kyocera printer for the report, you could use the prescribe language.<br />
<br />
It is just one line of code in the BaaN Report Layout.<br />
<br />
!R! BARC XY, TEXT 'FFFFFFFFFFF'; EXIT;<br />
<br />
where XY is the type of barcode, FFFFFFFFFF is the BaaN Report field e.g. tiitm001.item etc.<br />
<br />
As mentioned works only with kyocera printers.<br />

<br />
Another option that should work with bwprint is WELP/ELP.  Its a software solution which is also available in hardware and works with every PCL printer.<br />
<br />
http://www.sthethos.com (http://www.stethos.com)<br />
<br />
One disadvantage because of software: The print files become bigger. Not so much with 1-d Barcodes, but with 2-D Barcodes (and formulars) the growth can become heavy. In a LAN it is not a problem, but if you print about a WAN (we do) you should be aware of this.<br />
<br />
We just started to implement it with Solaris.<br />

2d barcodes are more complicated to generate than 1d as most of them are more 'configurable' in that you can select the level of duplicated information to aid scanning of damaged labels as well as xy size and density.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Actually you are right, the bar code will contain a lot of data...<br />
This barcode will be printed at the bottom of the sales invoice report, so cant use any label printers for the same...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">14th May 2008, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">you could get the Baan report to print a label at the same time and attach it to the printed report?!<br />
<br />
there are a number of barcode generators out there, eg:<br />
http://www.posworld.com/onbargen.html<br />
<br />
finally, you could look at output management software (typically used to make horrible Baan reports look nice) such as:<br />
http://www.efstech.co.uk/output-management.html<br />
... some of these products claim to be able to add barcodes to reports, not sure if that extends to 2d formats</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanted to share the solution I got.<br />
<br />
I found one console application for PDF417 Barcode print.<br />
I'm saving the content of the barcode to a text file (test.dat) and alongwith some other parameters this console application PDF-DOT converts the string present in the test.dat file to 2D BArcode (PDF417)..<br />
<br />
The command goes like : PDF-DOT test.dat 4 2 2 4<br />
and the desired 2D Barcode is printed directly to priinter attached to the LPT1 Port.<br />
<br />
I'm executing this application using app_start(). But what problem I'm facing now is the barcode is getting printed on the second page rather than  at the bottom of the first page.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest something for this problem now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dieter MM</div><div class="date">4th June 2009, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
we also have to print PDF417 Barcode on different baan documents.<br />
The first step was very easy, because our PCL5 laser printer include a stethos barcode module with nearly all 1D and 2D barcodes.<br />
So i only defined in the device file:<br />
$BSE/lib/printinf/h/hpdf417<br />
two additional line for free psfonts:<br />
pfont7=\E(s4p8s24850T,<br />
pfont8=\E(s0p-36v10s24680T,<br />
in the report layout i only have to select this font and the barcodes are printed well.<br />
pfont7 is for PDF417, pfont 8 for Code39. You can change type , size, high by the parameters.<br />
<br />
I still have one problem with the field seperator in PDF417. I have to insert 4 fields in the PDF417. I think, i have to insert a &quot;CR&quot; and &quot;LF&quot; between the different fields, but i cannot do that in the report script.<br />
If i do like <br />
barcpdf417 = field1 &amp; chr$(13) &amp; chr$(10) &amp; field2 &amp; ...<br />
then only field1 is printed on the barcode.<br />
<br />
Any idea for that?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
Use a Kyocera Printer. There you can print 2D-Barcodes direct from your report. You don´t need any additional software.<br />
<br />
The command is something like: <br />
!R! XBAR;&lt;your Data&gt; ;ENDB;<br />

<br />
i have still the following problem:<br />
if you print PDF417 with them, how do you separate the fields.<br />
E.g.: <br />
field1 = customer part number,<br />
field2 = quantity<br />
field3 = supplier number<br />
In PDF417 you have to separate the fields, so if you read the barcode with a scanner, system can attach the fields correctly.<br />
Therefor you have to build a string with all fields for the barcode, with the special field identifiers and the separators.<br />
&lt;ID-cpn&gt;&amp; &quot;customer part number&quot; &amp; &lt;separator&gt; &amp; &lt;ID-qty&gt;&amp; &quot;quantity&quot; ...<br />

<br />
as i see now, the difference between my tries and your solution is the definition of the barcode type (barcode file).<br />
I defined a new psfont and you a new barcode. And it looks like that by my way, all &quot;special charactars&quot; are lost during printing. I get a 2D barcode, but without any CR, LF ...<br />
<br />
Do you think it is possible to get your type25 file?<br />
