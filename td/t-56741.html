<br />
  I've created one history table of a customized table. But I couldn't find any function which can return me the BAAN login name who is doing the transaction.<br />
Usually, logname has a great significance in a history table. Please advice me.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
in BaaN 4 :<br />
<br />
Use field tccom001.namc for logname (e.g. &quot;gabriel&quot;)<br />
Compare logname$ with this field an you'll get tccom001.emo and all others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th September 2010, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - there is depending on how you set your system up.  For example how did you do employee name (employee table) and name on user table(user setup)?  If you did those the same you might be able to match them.  Or if you wanted you could put user name in something like email on the employee table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">20th September 2010, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark &amp; Bernd. Can you give me an example of how i would compare the fields?  I assume this needs to be in the script in order to compare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th September 2010, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Our system is not setup correctly.  So for my employee ID I have H, Mark(tccom001.nama) and then for user id I have Mark H(ttaad200.name).  So I would have to write a function to switch the ttaad200.name to H, Mark.  If they were both setup correctly you could just use tccom001.nama = ttaad200.name - might have to strip spaces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK so looking at the tccom001 table (maintain employees) I don't see any sort of user name field to compare logname$ so I can then also display an employee id. I do see employee number and name (full name). Where could I find information that has the logname$ though?  Or is there a way that I could take the ttccom001 info and somwhow use logname$ to convert something? Maybe Im just missing something here. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">21st September 2010, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no direct link between logname and employee id (or name).<br />
<br />
But if your logname e.g. is 8 carachters (1st of firstname, 7 of lastname) you could get a match like <br />
<br />
logname: mbagetta<br />
tolower$(tccom010.nama) = &quot;mike bagetta&quot; and then make a string search to find &quot;bagetta&quot; in the Name field. <br />
Then you have the employee id.<br />
<br />
But this is fuzzy logic, not 100 % but sometimes good enough.<br />
<br />
Better if your masterdata in tccom001 is:<br />
<br />
Name: Bagetta<br />
Name2: Mike<br />
<br />
to separate first and last name so you could compare mbagetta with mbagetta. But what if you hafe many smith or miller in your company, asmith, asmith2 or adsmith. It depends on your naming convention.<br />
<br />
Other possibilities:<br />
* you make a additional table to mapp employee with logname<br />
* read a textfile from the server where the mapping is done<br />
* you have an unused field in the employee table to store the logname<br />
* Writing employee id in the ttaad200.name field e.g. Mike Bagetta (1) (and filter the brackets, other id could be (4251)).<br />
* Using SMI modul (tdsmi) to mapp contact persons to a business relation, here you could store the information (logname, employee id, name).<br />

I dont think that would work as the name field is the entire last name as in the example. 'bagetta', the user id or logname$ may be mbagett for example while the employee number that im trying to show in the example is the number 1. Im suprised that theres not an easy fix for this in BaaN IV.</div></div><hr />

Hell,<br />
<br />
Kozure has shown possible ways to solve your requirement.<br />
<br />
You have three informations sources, you are able to use :<br />
<br />
logname$<br />
ttaad200<br />
tccom001<br />
<br />
Based on the setup on your system, you'll have to find your own way.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">21st September 2010, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Bernd, <br />
<br />
I would agree that I would need to find my own method of getting this. Looking at the data setup, it is not possible to achieve what I've been tasked to do.  In order to make this work, I will have to write in an employee ID number in the ttaad200 table or make another table to map the employee with the logname$.  Thanks for everyones input on the matter here. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">29th September 2010, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there another predefined variable like logname$ that I could use that shows then entire employee name???</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">1st October 2010, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming that you have updated the name in the Maintain User session, you could use the function tt.user() to get the user name. If this name is exactly identical to the Employee Master name, it may be possible to 'link' but this is a very person dependent link - one spelling mistake and the link will not work.<br />
<br />
Also, as you must know, tccom001.nama is 35 characters whereas ttaad200.name is 30 characters.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, as a 'procedure', you could RESERVE tccom001.name, which is 30 characters, and make sure that it is always identical to ttaad200.name, and use these two fields to create a link.<br />
<br />
Still, not very sturdy approach.<br />
<br />
The better approach is the one you suggested of having a new table to create a cross-reference between tccom001.emno and ttaad200.user and write your own library functions to get from the one to the other, using logname$.</div></div><hr />
