  <br />
I have a big big question.  <br />
  <br />
I am working with Infor LN 6.1  <br />
  <br />
When I want to upload one dump of tables that in the source has a logical tables scheme, I need to know if exists any logical sequence when I download the tables in the source and When I upload the tables in the target.  <br />
  <br />
When must I do the setup on ttaad4120m000 on the target, First I upload the dump on the target and after ttaad4120m000  or before....<br />
  <br />
  <br />
Thank you .........</div></div><hr />

That is; for example I have tree companies 127 physical and (117 - 617) logical.  <br />
  <br />
Then, before that I upload the tables of tree companies firstly I have to setup on ttaad4120m000. It is correct?  <br />
  <br />
I also need to know if I have to upload the companies in some specific sequence......  <br />
  <br />
When Do I download the tables of the source, exists any special consideration to make the dump?... My question is because the companies 117 and 617 are logical companies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.....</div></div><hr />

Though setup of ttaad4120m000 can be done / modified any time , it's recommended to do it before all data upload activities.<br />
<br />
If u ignore the ref integrity while upload (which people do normally) , the upload can be in any order.<br />
<br />
In export shared tables are exported in every comp if not locked . However while importing the import occurs only for the physical tables and for shared tables it skips by giving error 514 in log. If it possible to skip through shell script (checking $BSE/lib/compnr6.1) shared tables of logical companies , it will save user some time eliminating repeated export of shared tables.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when you dump the tables with ttaad4226m000 on the source system then check the box: &quot;Exclude logical tables from dump&quot;. If this box is checked, then you can export all companies in one run. The logical tables will be dumped only once.<br />
<br />
You can do the import on the target system also in one run for all companies. As recommeded earlier modify ttaad4120m000 before you import the data.<br />
<br />

gget79 wrote that he is working with Infor LN 6.1. At least in ERP LN - FP3 this option is available. I donÂ´t know if this is also available in earlier FPs.<br />

  <br />
Thank you for your help. Yes, I have FP3 installed, but now my question is  <br />
In my scheme 117 and 617 (logical companies),  and 127 (physical company)   <br />
Which company should I export from on source with the check selected?  <br />
  <br />
The company should be the 127 because this is the physical company...  <br />
  <br />
The check tell us &quot;Exclude&quot;   <br />
Why do I when select this check I can do in one run, if this tell exclude and not include?<br />
<br />
Than you</div></div><hr />

<br />
when you export all companies for the range from 117 to 617 in one run with the checkbox &quot;Exclude logical tables from Dump&quot; marked, then:<br />
<br />
- All tables from company 127 will be dumped. (they are all physical tables)<br />
- Only the physical tables from company 117 and 617 will be dumped.<br />
<br />
The logical tables in company 117 and 617 (which are linked to the physical tables in company 127) will be only once in this whole dump (as tables for company 127).<br />
<br />
If you have other companies in between, then you can do the whole thing also in three runs for evry single company with the checkbox marked. The result will be the same  :-)<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
