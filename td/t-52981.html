<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">10th July 2008, 22:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to complete a display-only version of the sales order sessions (tdsls4101m000). We need to keep people from maintaining sales orders, but let them see all the information on the order (which does not show up readily on existing Baan display sessions). People in shipping, for example, will use this to view delivery addresses and shipping terms.<br />
<br />
We don't have source code, so I'm trying to figure out how to use switch.to.process() with the subsessions. I've seen some discussion of this in other threads, but I'm not able to figure out how they all fit together.<br />
<br />
There are three sessions involved:<br />
tdsls4101m000 (Order Header)<br />
tdsls4102s000 (Order Lines - the bottom of the order line screen where data is entered).<br />
tdsls4503s000 (Order Lines - the top part of the screen where lines are displayed).<br />
<br />
What I'm not sure about is which session calls what. <br />
<br />
I think I use activate() and switch.to.process() in the header session to call the subession. But do I call the bottom session or the top? Does one of these then call the other using activate() and switch.to.process()?<br />
<br />
In some initial tests I end up with all three sessions open, but overlapping and blocking one another. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th July 2008, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just turn off insert, delete and modify in the original sessions?  Or clone the sessions - keep the scripts, then turn off insert, delete and modify on the forms?<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">11th July 2008, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought of that, but the session numbers are in the code. I would not be able to zoom to a clone of tdsls4102s000 from the header because it would have a different code.<br />
<br />
I thought of changing access to the tables too, but shipping users probably need write access to the sales order tables.<br />
<br />
I can do it by creating clones of tdsls4101m000 and tdsls4102s000 and dropping the split screen from lines session, but I wanted to know how to create the split screen.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Anyway, after a few hours of trial and error, I got something that is close to working. I'm now having a few problems with the way the session refreshes the display. <br />
<br />
If I manually refresh, from the client, it works, but I can't get the program script to work.<br />
<br />
When I start this session, it displays everything correctly. <br />
<br />
When I try to change views/groups (go from one sales order to another), the parent session (bottom part of the screen) moves to the next sales order, but does not show any lines. The child (top part of the screen) does not change at all. If I hit Refresh (Ctrl-R in BW), the screen updates and looks fine.<br />
<br />
If I move from one order line to another, the parent (bottom) works normally, but the child (top) does not change. For example, if there is more lines than the child can display on the screen, it does not scroll down. In the Baan session, the position number in the top part of the screen is highlighted. I'm not sure how they do that.<br />
<br />
Here is part of my script:<br />
<br />
These session look like the sales order lines screen:<br />
Parent: tdcus0501s000 = tdsls4102s000 (bottom part of screen)<br />
Child: tdcus0502s000 = tdsls4503s000 (top part of screen)<br />

As you can see, I've tried various display commands, and tried them and the refresh commands in various places. Nothing seems to work. <br />
<br />
