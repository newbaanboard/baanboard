If it matters, this is with an Oracle database.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
i agree with zardoz,<br />
<br />
what should be the benefit. How to handle such a string.<br />

<br />
there are good reasons for long table fields. in one case I had to use a table with 4 String Fields each with a 999-Domain to hold an XML-message with maximum length of 4K! There 999 was actually too short and I had to chop up the XML in program so that it clould fit in the table :mad:</div></div><hr />

I would think the parsing effort would be almost the same. Plus, TEXT does not have limits.</div></div><hr />

yes, we are talking 'unlimited' XML data.  Text is fine within Baan but too tricky for external apps to look at by ODBC.  FYI - this is a legacy compatibility issue rather than part of a clever new design!</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Standard&quot; Text handling in Baan involves writing files, and you might get issues with line breaks when you try to store XML. So both from a performance point of view and for data integrity reasons Baan Texts would not be the first choice for implementing XML storage.</div></div><hr />
