I have been told we might have to create some PDF417 labels from Baan, but have not heard about scanning them in.  I suspect we might also need that feature.  <br />

Good question ~Vamsi.<br />

<br />
what kind of scanner are you thinking of; PC based or portable?<br />
How are you planning to generate the barcodes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Andy, We have PDF417 print capability via the use of Intermec Label printers.<br />
<br />
As for the scanning we have handheld computers and scan wedges for PCs which both use the same scanning engine.<br />

http://www.hhp.com/hhp/products/product.tpl?prodsku=0937023966884<br />
<br />
So the question is, how does one parse the long string into the various fields. Has someone already done this? Especially has someone done this with 2D symbols with the standard specified by AIAG?<br />
<br />
Mark, I have not seen 2D symbol print capability using Baan. RMCis seems to have an add-on for Baan. Lisa any info on the product and which printers it supports?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, thanks Vamsi, we were going to post on this.  We support the printing with our RMClabel barcode software that runs in Baan.  You can print 2D to regular bar code printers using the PDF417 symbology.  In our product, you define your source fields in Baan and the 2D elements and separators, and we spit it out to Intermec, Zebra, other printers in PDF417 standard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">~Vamsi,<br />
<br />
We use Bar-One, Jetforms and Zebra printers to currently print our barcode tags from Baan.  I guess I assumed (probably bad assumption) that since I could design tags using the PDF417 format, I could then create a Baan report that would send the info to Jetforms to print the PDF417 tag.  I was thinking that all I needed to do was figure out how to format the report fields.  I did not do any more research since I am not include in the project that is looking at tagging  our inventory for tracking based on some new government regulation.  Our actual barcode tags do not come from Baan(depending on how you look at this), but we do use baan to print a few reports with barcodes using a user defined font.  So I was basically looking for how I might need to design the reports.<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">24th August 2004, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an idea but is it possible to get a newer version of AXBarcode OCX control that still works with BW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">25th August 2004, 03:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Phil,<br />
<br />
I looked into that option. AXBarcode does make 2D symbology Activex controls. But the control is separate from the one that is integrated into BWPrint. This is something that Baan will have to provide.<br />
<br />
This would be a low cost high value addition to the product IMO.</div></div><hr />
