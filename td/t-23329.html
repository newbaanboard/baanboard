<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">2nd March 2005, 23:17</div></div><div class="posttext">We are planning a migration from our current porting set of 6.1c.05.02 to 6.1c.06.04 and I understand that there are changes to the SQL syntax in custom development that must be considered in this migration.  <br />
<br />
I can't say for sure that I am in compliance with the new syntax because I have not been able to find documentation on this change.  Also, we do not have a test system.  <br />
<br />
Before attempting this migration, I want to understand the syntax change.  Using the sales tables as an example here is some common code in my system: <br />
             select tdsls040.*, tdsls041.*, tdsls045.*<br />
             from   tdsls040, tdsls041, tdsls045<br />
             where tdsls040._index1 inrange {:orno.f} and {:orno.t}<br />
             and    tdsls041.orno refers to tdsls040<br />
             and    tdsls045.cmba refers to tdsls041<br />
             <br />
On this forumn, I've seen an example where<br />
      &quot;where  {tdsls045.orno, tdsls045.pono} refers to tdsls041._index1&quot;<br />
<br />
Do I need to change my statement  <br />
from    tdsls045.cmba refers to tdsls041<br />
to       {tdsls045.orno, tdsls045.pono} refers to tsls041._index1   :confused: <br />
<br />
And do I need to change statement <br />
from    tdsls041.orno refers to tdsls040<br />
to       tdsls041.orno refers to tdsls040._index1<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your responses - Joy</div></div><hr />

There are only problems if you wan't i.e. to refer with 2 fields to a table with 3 fields in the primary key. This will not longer work. You need all 3 fields.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
...<br />
and {tdsls041.cwar, tdsls041.item} refers to tdinv001  --&gt; will not work<br />
...<br />
<br />
you have to change it to:<br />
<br />
...<br />
and {tdsls041.cwar, tdsls041.item, &quot;&quot;} refers to tdinv001 --&gt; will work<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
...<br />
and {tdsls041.cwar, tdsls041.item, tdsls041.cntr} refers to tdinv001 <br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
the {} are very helpfull if don't have a combined field with all fields of the primary key. Or if you need references with different tables (didn't try it, but it should work). Or like in my example, you only wan't to see one record that doesn't match exactly. <br />
If you have a combined  field with all fields (or the reference has only one field), you don't need to change anything. <br />
