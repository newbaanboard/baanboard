<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive just made my first step into the world of Baan customisation and Im having problems compiling a program script due to missing source for the itccom0100 function. Let me explain what Im trying to do.<br />
<br />
Ive created a new table, which is updated via a new session. The data from this table needs to be shown on form 5 of tdsls4531m000  Display Deliveries. I have copied the tdsls4531 session from B40_c4 to our custom vrc, Ive copied the 4531 script from the B40U_c4_stnd to our custom vrc and Ive copied the tdsls4531m0005 from B40_c4 to our custom vrc. As I know nothing about Baan scripting a colleague in the States has helped out with the coding. When trying to compile the script I get a fatal error:-<br />
<br />
ptdsls45310 Fatal error Cant open input file itccom0100<br />
<br />
Hes told me that I need to get the source from somewhere. Where can I get this?<br />
<br />
The original 4531 script must have been installed as part of a Baan solution as it was in the stnd vrc. So why would the solution not have delivered the source that the script needs?? Probably a silly question but Im very new to this side of Baan.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">You should have the function source itccom0100 somewhere on your system. I-files are like include files (ref C language) and are compiled together with your actual program script. Check following directory:<br />
<br />
$BSE/application/tcB40_c4/itccom. Look for the file icom00100. That's what you need.<br />
<br />
I am no developer but I am  guessing you also need to 'copy' this function source to your custom VRC and the recompile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">You do not need to copy any includes into your own VRC, since Baan will pick them (when available - we'll get to this) from a previous VRC.<br />
<br />
We had [have, this is an ongoing process] a lot of problems with missing source codes and includes (functions, as Baan calls them). This was generated by a faulty PMC that skipped several source/include installations since its fresh installation and was fixed only after SP7 (on SP8).<br />
<br />
There is no immediate fix (my case is on PEG and still ongoing), so what I do is open a Baan case and request them to send the missing include. Also, you must install several solutions to update your PMC to avoid other problems asap:<br />

<br />
Regarding my case (has a defect open), the last exchange of comment is:<br />
<br />
- Comment from Baan<br />
This is related to Defect 111680 , which is still open for the same subject. There are two options to solve this:<br />
<br />
1. The customer creates a new Update VRC and installs all solutions again in that new Update VRC. The sources will be installed then, and can be copied to the live Update VRC afterwards, with the session to copy components to another VRC.<br />
<br />
2. Baan creates a dump with all sources till SP8 of B40c4. This dump can be imported with the Import Patch (ttiex1284m000) session by the customer in a new VRC and then the sources can be copied to the live Update VRC.<br />
<br />
This second option can only be used if the customer wants to have the sources of all SP's till SP8. I donot have sources till a previous version of a SP.<br />
Please inform me if further action is needed.<br />
<br />
- My comment:<br />
Regarding the case, we are encountering missing scripts, etc, but mostly the customer opens a case (or request us to open one) and ask for the missing one, that Baan sends. The creation of an update layer does not sound very feasable, since it will take ages to reinstall everything on it. I would go for option 2, but I have a small question:<br />
<br />
Since customers do not install SP8 when it is released (the usual is 3 month after, minimum...), is that dump a PMCone that checks for existing newer versions of the scripts or a normal dump? Because if it is a normal dump, this will overwrite the new ones (after SP8) and we don't want that to happen. How is that going to work?<br />
<br />

I keep you posted as soon as I have some news.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Patrick - Thanks for the advice. I did find the file icom00100 but I think I need icom01000 file, which I don't have. Correct me if I'm wrong but the zero on the end signifies something else.<br />
<br />
Victor - Thank you for your reply. As you suggest I will ask Baan to send me this missing i file. I will also look into the solutions that you listed down.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the quick response.<br />

Baan sent me the missing i file and I can now compile my new script.<br />
