<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">24th June 2005, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I have managed to add a form button to the standard buttons near the help button in every session using the same way I can add a menu to every form. Check the attachment.<br />
<br />
My question is: &quot;Can I write a global  script that will tell this button what to do in all the standard sessions?&quot;.  :confused: <br />
I know I activate it in any new session that I make that there is user.9 in it. Or by entering any session and add this to its settings. But I need it to work in all the sessions with out configuring all session!<br />
<br />
I can let this button always to open the help field or any other standard option. I need to know how can activate any other task I want.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to write a global script? Or any other way to let this button to work from all the standard session? :confused: <br />
<br />
Please help<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

U can  create a session mention as zoom session at the choice field of the form (assuming there is not zoom session already defined) , dump the form and u can run ur code written in a common session from special menu of such sessions.</div></div><hr />
