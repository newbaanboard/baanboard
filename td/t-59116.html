Hello gianci,<br />
you don't have to generate ZPL files from reportscript.<br />
Put the ZPL commands with the variables in the report layout and send it RAW to the ZEBRA printer with ZPL.<br />
<br />
I'm doing this in BaaN IV and LN to ZEBRA printers and woth DML commands<br />
with DATAMAX printers.<br />
The file you have to generate for ZEBRA printers with ONLY EPL language.<br />
<br />
I've explained in this thread.<br />

That is what we use.  This way I don't need to know the ZPL coding. Just another option.</div></div><hr />

thanks a lot for your reply. I had already given a look at your thread, but my concern was not on where to put ZPL commands, but rather on how to write ZPL commands without, if possible, having to learn ZPL language. Mark_h was suggesting to use a third party software or, with ERP LN, to try the new dal2. Thus I suppose that these dal2 may contain some new feature that could support the ZPL commands preparation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the confusion.  The dal2 is part of my signature and is really centered around API or AFS functionality and not barcodes. I will fix my signature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gianci</div><div class="date">31st August 2010, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize mark_h,<br />
I re-read your reply and the DAL2 reference was a general comment and not linked to the ZPL commands preparation.<br />
Thus I only have to prepare ZPL by myself or, as per yor suggestion, to consider the usage of RMCis product.<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
there's a programming guide ZPL II (400 pages) available from ZEBRA.<br />

Designing format layout with BarTender is really easy.  I have been using this product to generate the barcode for both BaaN and LN.  Basically once you have the format then in either BaaN or LN you'll need to create &quot;|&quot; delimited file with first couple lines of BarTender commander script.  Set up BarTender Commander to pick up that file.  Here's an example of data file.<br />

      It is possible to do with LN in the following way.<br />
<br />
      Normally Zebra printers will be purchased with Barcode design s/w like Bar- One.<br />
      where you can design your Label with 1D /2D/ with Logos etc.<br />
      Once you have designed  the label save it as Text format.<br />
       Copy the Text file content and paste it to any  Text Fields associated with a       LN- Table        Now u can use your normal Report Session to use this text and print it to Zebra printer.<br />
      Before printing replace the Text - Varibales with Actual values.(check txt commands for editing text).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gianci</div><div class="date">14th September 2010, 10:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello and thanks to everyone gave his help and suggestions,<br />
I am very close to the final solution and I think I am going to use two different ways of print depending on the label.<br />
For barcode label printed on label printers (zebra-like) I prepared the label using Bartender, as per tnitwahn's suggestion, and with file-triggered printing (Bartender Commander module), and it works fine.<br />
Now I have to print barcode on some reports (i.e Delivery Note). Since I have to print on PDF modules and because of that I can use neither BWprint nor barcode printing via printer driver,  I am thinking to use bynoy000's hint and prepare the label on file, then put it on the report. I will notice the result<br />
Of course, other possible suggestions are welcome.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Please, can you tell me the result of your work?. Now I have the same problem that you had before, I need print barcode labels at zebra and Sato Printers from Ln.<br />
<br />
I want know your advice about this.<br />
<br />
I'm waiting your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

are you on windows or unix.<br />
We do print bar codes for certain customers on the label. Its pretty straight forward.<br />
<br />
This is how we construct a bar code field(shid.barcode) in the report <br />
<br />
before.whinh953.box.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	shid = strip$(shid)<br />
	shid.with.ID = &quot;4S&quot; &amp; strip$(shid)<br />
	shid.barcode =  chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp; &quot;)&quot;&amp;chr$(34) &amp; chr$(32+ len(shid.with.ID)) &amp; shid.with.ID</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gianci</div><div class="date">25th October 2010, 20:13</div></div><div class="posttext">@CTE:<br />
As I posted recently, we decided to use Bartender to print labels with zebra-like printers. It is quite easy to develop a layout and setup a trigger with the Bartender Commander module.<br />
Printing barcodes on documents printed via BWprint or direct printer is quite easy too, following Infor indication and/or SujitKumar's suggestion. <br />
We are now still working on how to print barcodes on documents which are printed on PDF files using Nazdaq product B2win.  We requested help to Nazdaq and they said they are working on it, but it will be nor a straightforward solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gian_z</div><div class="date">17th October 2011, 23:28</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to create PDF documents with all the same fonts and BARCODE used in a BWprint report, I am using the new solution that Nazdaq has just released.<br />
In this way, I issue  my document with Barcode, using only my knowledge on Baan's document.<br />
It is enough to setup  Mail Merge of Nazdaq and then chose the new device “MM71”  instead of “Printer device” for create a PDF document with the same Fonts an Barcode.<br />
I realize that what  I want to print on Baan's report  is now really what I get  in PDF document.<br />
Furthermore it is possible  to save automatically the PDF document in my favorite folder with the name of the object (it may be the item, the customer, etc), so that I can print this PDF document with barcode where I wish.<br />
<br />
I am using Barcodes directly on Baan Tools and with the support of B2Win and Baan Mail-Merge from NAZDAQ, I am able to print them and made PDF files, this is the best easier quickly solution that I have never find.</div></div><hr />
