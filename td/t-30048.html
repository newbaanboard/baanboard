Is there any way to scroll horizontally with keyboard buttons ???<br />
Also is there any way to start a form with full maximum size ???<br />
Also text.to.buf is not working  i.e. it is not giving any error but it is not selecting the text so I have to write logic to select text from tttxt tables .<br />
Can anyone tell me what can be the problem ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">17th January 2007, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, a bunch of total different questions...<br />
<br />
1) I don't know; never tried yet, maybe someone else played around with this..<br />
2) Yes, this is possible. Look at this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=13000&amp;highlight=maximize) to see how to apply it. I use it myself in various sessions. I created a dll as follows:<br />
<br />
	extern	long				win.wid<br />
	extern	long				win.hei<br />
	extern	long				srv_data(SRVMAXSIZE)<br />
	extern	long				event(EVTMAXSIZE)<br />
	extern	long	form<br />
<br />
function extern tcrom.dll0001.full.screen()<br />
{<br />
	DllUsage<br />
        Expl:	 	<br />
        Pre :		<br />
        Post:		<br />
        Input:		<br />
			<br />
        Output:	<br />
			EndDllUsage<br />
<br />
	get.display.data(srv_data)<br />
	win.wid = srv.display.width(srv_data) - 40 |in case of office bars etc<br />
	win.hei = srv.display.height(srv_data) - 125 |consider the application bar at the bottom..<br />
	evt.type( event ) = EVTRESIZEWINDOW<br />
	evt.resize.width( event ) = win.wid<br />
	evt.resize.height( event ) = win.hei<br />
	evt.resize.columns( event ) = 0<br />
	evt.resize.rows( event )=  0<br />
	send.event( pid, event )<br />
	change.object(current.mwindow(),DsNx, 0, DsNy, 0)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
In sessions which I want to start at full screen mode, I just call the function as follows:<br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
init.form:<br />
	tcrom.dll0001.full.screen()<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Can you be a bit more specific? What are you trying? What does your code look like (posting your code here would help), etc<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
What I did is as follows.<br />
<br />
(1)To make the form full screen I tried inbuilt function resize.window() .But I got an error process 888(some number) not found .I tried the function everywhere init.form,before.program etc. I get this error most of the times when I use functions relating to form .I will be glad if you can tell the reason for this error .<br />
<br />
(2) I need horizontal scroll using keyboard keys .I did not try anything for it .We can use pageup and pagedown keys for vertical scroll but we don't have any key for horizontal scroll .We have to use mouse for horizontal scroll on the form .My client wants to use &lt;- and -&gt; keys for horizontal scroll .<br />
<br />
(3)My client has different tt objects on development and live servers .So when I used text.to.buf on development area it worked but when I m running it on live server it is not giving me any text in the text array eventhough the text is there .So I had to write a logic to select text from tttxt001 using text number .<br />
<br />
I will be glad if you can share some of your excellent scripts like the one you gave above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As suggested above you can know the size of your screen then you can use the function in this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showpost.php?p=98147&amp;postcount=2) to resize your form, instead of resize.window() function.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

I will be thankful to you if you can help me to solve the other two points .</div></div><hr />

Are you trying it on the same language?<br />
Can you post your code?<br />
