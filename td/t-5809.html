<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kul_sach</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a customised session which creates export dumps from customisation marks. This session is using ttiexdeliverp to create the export dumps. This session is working fine in c2 &amp; c3, but in c4, it doesnot export reports.  Also I have observed that in c4, you do not require to set the parameter CUNO_SRC to export sources.  Is there any other parameter or mapping required for exporting reports?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">15th July 2002, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We have also created a custom session that creates a file that is then processed by ttiexdeliverp.  We haven't had any problems getting reports to be sent on 4c4.  <br />
<br />
We have, however, discovered that if we try to export from multiple packages, we don't get all of the objects exported.  We essentially have to break up our export into one export per package.  Is there something we are missing, or is this just the way it works?</div></div><hr />
