How can i start a session in another company other than the current company.<br />
<br />
for Example : your current company is the logistics company. If you start cisli3600m000 - invoicing 360 session, you will notice that your company is changed to linked financial company and when you end the session it again sets the company to your original company.<br />
<br />
Also, what is the link between the logistics company and the financial company?</div></div><hr />

LN probably has a better session.</div></div><hr />
