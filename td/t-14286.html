<br />
We have a problem with our users globally releasing the outbound, despite changing field defaults. The problem is that they keep hitting return and the cursor is positioned on the continue button. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if and how we can reposition the cursor to the cancel button.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

We took the forms and removed the defaults for several fields.  Is there any specific fields you want them to input.  For example if you always want them to enter a specific order number, then just set the input expression on the orno.t field to 0 and remove the default.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes we have changed all the defaults we can, The trouble is that they change them all now as a force of habit and end up missing the correct field to enter. It really is unbelievable how many times this has happened despite us changing the defaults. <br />
<br />
No ideas about the cursor position?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">When you said &quot;Have you tried changing the default button?&quot; what exactly did you mean? That sounds like exactly what we want to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">When maintaining the form(ttadv3100m000) if you click on the &quot;buttons&quot; button there is a field part way down that sets the default button.  On my system on that session the default was set to continue, you could change it to cancel.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I also forgot to mention that you could delete all user defaults for this session.  Then dis-able the &quot;save defaults&quot; options.  This may also help.  The only real cure is to check the ranges in the code and not let them run it wide open.<br />

We have a problem with changing the script because we don't have the include file required to compile.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
