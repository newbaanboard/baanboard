<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shajipthomas</div><div class="date">19th October 2002, 01:44</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the logic behind the fact that we can not access / use labels from other packages(eg. labels created in TD package from say TF package) like the labels created TC package can be accessed from all packages during customizations ????? <br />
<br />
This limitation leads to duplication of Lables. <br />
<br />
Any comments on this? :confused: :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">19th October 2002, 02:22</div></div><div class="posttext">From the BaaN-5 series, BaaN has introduced the concept of &quot;Decoupling of Packages&quot;, in which you can only use the same or &quot;tc&quot; packages, domains, messages, questions, labels etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shajipthomas</div><div class="date">19th October 2002, 04:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, but was it done for any specific reason ?  Do you agree that this feature has bought in some extra work for the Technical People and of course some unwanted load(data) to the Database.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">20th October 2002, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan has done it right.<br />
<br />
In order to live with the ttiex128*m000 series of sessions for exporting sessions in a package, one is not given the ability to cross package boundaries. We export tc, or td, and we expect the labels in our package to all be there.<br />
<br />
Even the practice of integrating tc lables should be reviewed. Baan has an ample set of tc lables, but you may have added to the standard baan collection.  Thus, exporting your  xx package (where xx is not tc) and then importing that package at a distant location will yield undefined labels, if in the xx package you had labels from your customized tc package.<br />
<br />
Thus, the way to support your local customizations is to copy the foreign label (other package) to your customization, with a package name change along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warans</div><div class="date">21st October 2002, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">But by creating a patch code and by Patch Creation (using ttiex4110m000)....we can still export lables of different packages...together to a distant location...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't you agree that if we were to use labels across packages, then even when I export my customized session to a different location, they will have no problems as all the labels will be available for them as well. <br />
<br />
If its a new label that any way we will create in the required package (I mean if I am doing a customization for td I will create the new label in td instead of tc).<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">22nd October 2002, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">If you export your session to a system that does not have the package you are exporting, then what?  the labels will not be recognized and will appear as blanks. I have had that happen to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shajipthomas</div><div class="date">22nd October 2002, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Got You !!! But fortunately, I never had that experience. But I think I agree when you say if locations does not have all he packages installed we will face this problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you....<br />
