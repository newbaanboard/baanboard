You could probably set up a device like word or excel and get it to work.  Try it and let us know.<br />

<br />
thanks for pushing me. I tried already, but it doesn't work. Got some error message. No I tried one more (copying a word printer and played around) and it works. Don't know what all entries mean, but I attach a screenshot of how ot works for me.<br />

(my ultaedit is located on C:\ultraedt)<br />

In the path-field (german: Pfad) I have a filename &quot;test.rft&quot;. Seems like Baan opens that on C:\temp. C:\ is closed to be full on my system. So I tried something like: &quot;d:\test.rtf&quot;. But somehow I'm not able to change the drive??<br />

It seems like baan always downloads the report into the baan\tmp directory and then launches the app.  So I always end up doing a &quot;save as&quot; to get the data where I really want it.<br />
