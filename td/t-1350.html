<br />
We have a table that keep a record of an item, what level it is at in a hierarchy and its parent.  A session displays this information and from the table you can use the standard buttons to delete and add a new item into th hierarchy.<br />
<br />
In Development system this works great.  You can delete an item from a certain level and create it again at a new level.  In the Live system you can delete the item bu when you create the item at a different level it comes up back at the level it was originally at?<br />
<br />
The program scripts are identical.  Is this a table problem?  Is the standard &quot;New&quot; button not adding the item in its correct place?  Is the functionality behind the standard New button in the two systems different?<br />
<br />
I am thinking of writing a function to add and delete an item now but just seem confused that it works fine in dev but not in Live.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is an elementary error I am making, I am confused.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You could make a tracefile to see what statements are being send to the database.<br />
<br />
Remember that deleting the record in a database only marks the record as being deleted. The actual delete will only take place when you reorganize the table (kind of pack the database).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check also that the forms and tables are identical between dev and live. It could be that if the position in the heirarchy is part of the key in dev, but not in live then there could be a difference in the &quot;automatical&quot; functionality.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how it turns out.<br />
