Questions such as this should go in the tool development forum.  I moved it over here.  Now to (maybe) answer your question.  I think the display only fields will only display when you do a display(&quot;field.name&quot;) and input only fields will only work with input(&quot;field.name&quot;).  Not positive because I pretty much just use input and display - if I used one of the other types then it was probably by mistake. :)<br />

<br />
An &quot;input&quot; field can be reached by the tab sequence <br />
but an &quot;input only&quot; field can be reached only if u put the cursor on the field.<br />

I think they were more useful back when we were all ASCII.... because the only way you could get to the Input Only field was through code - thus you could really control when a field was available.  With the GUI now, there is not as much difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is some information, which I guess is mostly valid for BaaN-5.2 series.<br />
<br />
Field Type:<br />
Indicates the form field type. <br />
The following options are available: <br />
Display: Normal display field, input not allowed. <br />
Input: Normal input field <br />
Display on Demand: Display is only possible on this form field if the Baan 4GL function display &lt;field name&gt; is used in the program script. <br />
<br />
Input on a form field is also dependent on the input expression. A form field can be a temporary display field if the attr.input is filled with the value false in the before input section of the field in your program script.<br />
 <br />
Which means that is you choose Display on Demand the value in the field is only displayed after the function display(&quot;&lt;fieldname&gt;&quot;) is called.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suppose we have package te with module tst and table tetst100.<br />
Create a details session tetsttesting with tetst100 as maintable and with <br />
script tetsttesting. In the DFE add all table fields. For field tetst100.dod of <br />
the select field type &quot;Display on Demand&quot;.<br />
In the UI script add the following:<br />
function extern dod()<br />
{<br />
 display(&quot;tetst100.dod&quot;)<br />
}<br />
Add a formcommand that runs function &quot;dod&quot;.<br />
If you run the session you will see that the field tetst100.dod doesn't display and value, until you execute the formcommand. If you navigate to another record, the field tetst100.dod will still display the old value until you execute the formcommand again. So the the field tetst100.dod is not refreshed by 4GL Engine, the programmer has to do this him self in the UI script.<br />
 <br />
Note that this feature is only rarely used.<br />
<br />
Also refer to the thread - Baan 5: alignment in forms (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10275&amp;highlight=demand)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, just don't use the 'only' options unless you have a reason.   Because they are not hit, the corresponding sections in the code do not fire when you may be expecting them to.  I have had this issue and since it's a form option, it's not very obvious when you are trying to debug.</div></div><hr />
