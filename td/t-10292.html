<br />
I could go to their machine and give them defaults &quot;yes&quot; for the field &quot;Print Already Printed Documents&quot; in tdsls4404m000 but there are a number of problems with this; including the fact they can over-ride it!<br />
<br />
We have already customised the tdsls4404 (m000) script so I am not too worried about adding to it. <br />
<br />
Any code or other suggestions would be very welcome!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
One way to do it would be to copy the session to a new code, e.g. copy tdsls4404m000 to tdsls4404m0ed and then copy form 1 to a new code.<br />
<br />
Then edit form 1 (using ttadv3100m000) so that the &quot;printed&quot; field is defaulted to &quot;tcyesno.yes&quot; by changing the &quot;Default&quot; field, and then put &quot;0&quot; in the &quot;inp./ref  Expres.&quot; field to prevent the user from changing.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<br />
I had to add my new session to the order steps (I called it step 20) and I had to enter a value in the re-execute field - made it the same as tdsls4404m000.<br />
<br />
Eventually I also decided to just have the 1 form attached to my new session (this was form 2 from the standard Baan session).<br />
<br />
Also I added a bit of program script as I was getting a few problems (with both scenarios of 1 form or 2 forms) with the form getting &quot;stuck&quot; running through the field.all, before.input section.  So I stopped it running when my new session was the object calling it.<br />
<br />
field.all:<br />
before.input:<br />
if prog.name$ &lt;&gt; &quot;tdsls4404m0ap&quot; then</div></div><hr />
