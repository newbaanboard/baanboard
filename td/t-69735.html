<br />
I am trying to print Sales Order Acknowledgement from Document management. All those fields,variables which are coming from Program scripts are printing correctly. If I am creating any variable on report script or trying to use a table field of report script in document management mapping its value is not getting printed. However it is printing when report from the SOA sessionis printed. Any suggestions on how to map report script variables in DOM.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />

In the report script you are using those fields to read additional data. You can read the additional data also in the mapping expressions of the Report Rule.</div></div><hr />

Yes i am reading some additional data in report script. I tried to map this additional data in report rule again. Its not working. Here is the Scenario, Trying to print SOA and sending the document to the customer. In Email i am trying to print Sales Rep name. This is not coming from program script. I created a query in report script and stored name in a variable. Mapped this variable in report rule to print the name in Email body. That's not happening. Instead the sales Rep code can be printed as it is coming from program script.<br />

Thank You !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">9th February 2017, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">What I meant is that you code the query in the mapping expression for the variable in the Report Rule. I did this to get a variable filled with the user's email address:<br />
<br />
string	email.address(100) mb<br />
<br />
email.address = &quot;&quot;<br />
select ttcmf200.mail:email.address<br />
from ttcmf200<br />
where ttcmf200.catg = &quot;BAAN USER&quot;<br />
and ttcmf200.akey = :1<br />
and ttcmf200._compnr = 0<br />
as set with 1 rows<br />
wherebind (1, toupper$(logname$))<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
return(email.address)<br />
<br />
Select the Report Rule variable and start the text manager to create text and type your code.</div></div><hr />
