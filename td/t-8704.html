<br />
I am trying to copy report layouts from one report to another. However, I can't. <br />
<br />
It seems to be very temperamental in that it will allow to copy from one report, but not from another.<br />
<br />
Also, it will copy  a header but if I then try to copy an after or before field layout I can't......<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what is wong??? Its driving me mad.....<br />
<br />
I know that service packs have recently been installed, would this have anything to do with it?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for any  help</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JRussell</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 14:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Leena<br />
<br />
I was trying to copy a report layout from report A to report B. They are in the same VRC.<br />
<br />
I have managed to do it, but it very unstable. <br />
<br />
I have another question regarding layouts.<br />
<br />
What determines the way layouts are arranged???<br />
<br />
I have a before.field layout  = table.pono<br />
I have below that a before.field and after.field = table.workcentre.<br />
<br />
I want the b.f table.pono to be displayed between the b.f and a.f of the workcentre field.<br />
<br />
I have this format in another report and it does as I want. But when I copied this layout the results are not the same. Both reports woek off the same table, with reports just printing different fields.<br />
<br />
I don't understand how it will work in one report and not another....<br />
<br />
<br />
eg.<br />
<br />
Report A<br />
<br />
before.field.pono<br />
before.field.workcentre<br />
after.field.workcentre<br />
<br />
<br />
want it to be like Report B:<br />
<br />
before.field.workcentre<br />
before.field.pono<br />
after.field.workcentre<br />
<br />
Do you understand what I'm trying to do?<br />
<br />
All sort fields and select statements are the same......<br />
:(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes the way the layouts are arranged in Maintain Layouts is not the way they will actually print when you run the report.  This is because the index on the ttadv331 table is by the field name, not by the sort value defined in the &quot;Input Fields&quot; session.  This can be especially confusing (and irritating) when using the &quot;Maintain All Layouts&quot; option because the layouts won't appear in the order you desire (but will, of course, print correctly later).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
I ended up just copying the whole session and starting from scratch to modify it to suit my needs.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand why I could not copy the report layouts after the service packs have been installed. It seems very unstable....<br />
<br />
It would allow me to copy the layouts and I could save+compile. But when I went back into the report the layouts were not there......<br />
<br />
it has baffled me!<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help<br />
<br />
Jo</div></div><hr />
