<br />
Hi, <br />
we are trying to use and improve usage of report viewer, the latest reporting tool released by infor, but we found some problems.<br />
First, the settings of enviromental variables it's a strange task, and we are not still able to recover a standard procedure of setting them up in order to install the same settings in every systems we need. I mean we found a lot of problems especially in the automatic process of loading java class and running of jvmi.<br />
Second, finally we found a solution after thousands attempts, then we tried to convert some reports, conversion works fine, but the problem now it's exporting and importing of the generated .rptdesign file.<br />
I mean, first time we convert from a 4gl report and export it to locale, modify  it and import it on the server again, then print the report converted from webtop session and goes ok. <br />
Now suppose we would like to modify it again in reporting studio, so repeat the procedure (export-import) print it again. Here is the bug, we are not able to see the last modification we made in the second process of export - customization - import of the report.<br />
Maybe webtop store somewhere the old one? Maybe we have made mistake?<br />
Please help me if you can, i'm getting crazy trying to understand why.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I know that the only modifications allowed in the report converted from baan are layout modifications.</div></div><hr />

<br />
gheryosti, can You explain how You solve that? I'm traing to do the same thing, but it's not working :( after running sesion for enable reports on the windows event viewer I can see log like: Unable to start JavaVM - JVMI not available<br />
Do You have the same problem?<br />
<br />
Concerning Your bug, chceck the latest solutions for 7.6_b4_tt and also if session for import replace oryginal files in ${BSE}\application\*\*.rptdesign with Your modified report.<br />
Second, chceck for newest version od reportviewer, reading the changes history there is a couple bug concerning showing and refreshing BIRT reports. <br />
Finally try to delete content of folder (or selected files) in Tomcat server: \webapps\reportviewer\reportdesigns\HOST_NAME\erp6ln\application it's cache for reports reading from LN, check if there is Your modified report. This should help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tese112</div><div class="date">12th May 2008, 10:55</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I solve all problems. Problem concerning JVMI was in not proper PATH and CLASSPATH variables. Now I have the same problem as yours with not refreshing customized report but when I delete reportviewer cache it hepls :).<br />
I already register an inquiry for that in Infor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gheryosti</div><div class="date">12th May 2008, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Great, now we have the same situation. We are in contact with Infor too, i propose now to keep the link between our progresses in order to reach faster results.<br />
For the moment we are in stand by, but meanwhile we noticed another question: when you print a report in Report Viewer, despite of his original size and orientation, it's printed with a landscape orientation and a window(screen)-sized dimension, do you know what's the problem?<br />
Thanks a lot for the support, best regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">13th May 2008, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mean print in BWprint? If this is the case, keep in mind that bwprint always uses your default (windows client) printer settings...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gheryosti</div><div class="date">13th May 2008, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">No, i mean print in the RPT device, expressly built for printing rptdesign file.<br />
It looks like a landscape page printed in the BWprint, but it's a completely different matter, i think.<br />
In any case any suggestions are welcome.<br />
thanks, bye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tese112</div><div class="date">15th May 2008, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, after couple emails I get the answer from Infor concerning not updated reports:<br />
What I know this feature will be available in the next version. Rigth now you have to deleted the old reports, sorry.<br />
Check the new WebTop (NS0122) there is couple new fixes concerning homepages and reports:<br />
 - Resize is sent far too often if session is running in a homepage<br />
 - A close of a homepage also gets the unopened reports<br />
 - Memory leaks in home pages<br />
Now, I don't know error with landscape orientation, but I try convert some more reports and check it, I will inform You about progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gheryosti</div><div class="date">15th May 2008, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again Tese,<br />
At least i've learned i've to wait for a fix in the report update, now still remain resizing problem...hope will be fixed. <br />
Anyway keep update, as usual.<br />
Best Regards.<br />
bye.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tese112</div><div class="date">28th July 2008, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor reporting studio is nothing more then regular eclipse with plugins for BIRT (available on the eclipse page) and one more plugin with ERP LN (the las one You should download from Infor) but You can work without this plugin as well.<br />
If You have access for infor.subscribenet.com there is new versions of studio and there is 3 version of them in one ISO image:<br />
1. Infor ERP LN Application Studio<br />
2. Infor ERP LN Business Studio<br />
3. Infor ERP LN Reporting Studio<br />
The one with interesting for You is 3 it's newest version, I just started to test that environment.</div></div><hr />
