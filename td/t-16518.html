<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BurghMan</div><div class="date">10th September 2004, 22:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing a session for our quality department to keep track of the reasons people change delivery dates on sales orders.  We are not using Baans prompt for change code parameter because we do not want to be prompted for all changes.  I made the Plan. Del. Date field on the sales order lines session (tdsls4102s000) a display and made a zoom out to a session I created to capture reason codes.  All of this is working fine.  <br />
<br />
When there are deliveries on an order, Baan code will not allow the Plan. Del Date to be changed.  A message Note: deliveries already entered, choice not allowed is displayed.  The way I have this set up, I am bypassing this functionality. Ideally, I would like to code that functionality into my session to mimic Baan.<br />
<br />
My question is, does anyone know how Baan determines this.  Do they check order line status in the deliveries table?  Does the backorder quantity have to be taken into consideration?	 <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, Rob</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does check the last delivery in the deliveries table for delivery status (pmsk). If there is backorder then also it prevents editing. If there is already existing delivery (tdsls041.dqua&lt;&gt; 0 ) then it does not allow u to modify the line.</div></div><hr />

Once you enter deliveries against a sls order, the actual delivery date is set, thus making it possible to compare the actual against the planned delivery dates..</div></div><hr />
