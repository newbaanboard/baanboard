<br />
Please have a look at below piece of code. Sometimes it works perfectly fine but sometimes it hangs either at brp.open, brp.close or at brp.ready(written in function read.main.table()) . No clue why this is happening. Please help me to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Please see attached file for detail screenshots where debugger hangs.<br />

	select	tcsil999.* <br />
	from	        tcsil999<br />
	where 	tcsil999._index1 inrange {:cuno.f} and {:cuno.t}<br />
	and 	        tcsil999.email &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;<br />
	and	        tcsil999.aemail &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;<br />
	selectdo<br />
		if isspace(tcsil999.email) or isspace(tcsil999.aemail) then<br />
			break<br />
		endif<br />

		spool.fileout = creat.tmp.file$(bse.tmp.dir$())<br />
		invoice.file.name = spool.fileout<br />
		inv.rep = brp.open(&quot;rtdsil041011003&quot;, &quot;ASCIN&quot;, 0)<br />
		read.main.table(tcsil999.cuno)<br />
		brp.close(inv.rep)</div></div><hr />

In the past I have had various programs freeze up when they ran faster than some of the shell commands it ran.  What I ended up doing was putting in suspend(1000) or something like it, to give commands time to clear up.  You can try this after the brp.close - but I have done it after shell commands and even after ending subsessions to give the system time to clean things up.  Like I said I cannot say with any certainty this is the same problem.  Especially since it seems to be random where it occurs.  <br />
<br />
Other than that - can't think of anything other than making sure the device and tmp files that are created are not still being accessed when trying to close them.</div></div><hr />
