    I am trying to use StreamServe with Baan IV c3.<br />
<br />
    Does anybody have any documentation on it?<br />
    I am looking for a doc, which will run me thru the various steps <br />
    involved in creating a &quot;StreamServe&quot; report.<br />
<br />
    Thanks.<br />
Regards,<br />

Just call me and I will walk you through the steps. And then maybe you can create a document which could be posted here.</div></div><hr />

I thought Streamserve only worked with 4c4 or higher.  O well...I am attaching a simple walk through on getting Baan reports through to Streamserve output if you still need it.   This is specific for our office setup and current software.<br />
<br />
Our company does Streamserve with Baan and Oracle implementations and customized reports and outputs.  Email me if you need any more info.<br />

That was a very good explanation of the process. Thanks for the document.<br />
<br />
As for Madhu's problem, we got together on the phone and here is what we came up with.<br />
<br />
He sent me a .grb file which I converted in my Baan Layout converter to create the .dic and .plt files. In a new project I used &quot;autogenerate message&quot; with these files to create the input and output messages. This worked for me.<br />
<br />
As for Madhu, when he uses the .dic and .plt (or equivalent - he has Streamserve 3 compared to my Ver 2.3) he ends up *not* generating the input and output messages. We tried with files generated with my converter and his converter. I have asked him to log a call with Streamserve.<br />
<br />
Again thanks for the document.</div></div><hr />
