<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th March 2005, 00:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a test report that I am sending to a test printer.  The report prints one string field - this is all testing.  In the report script I set the string field like this:<br />
<br />
	testinfo = &quot;[)&gt;&quot; &amp; chr$(30) &amp; &quot;06&quot; &amp; chr$(29) &amp;&quot;17V064S4&quot; &amp; <br />
chr$(29) &amp; &quot;1PSA2829712&quot; &amp; chr$(29) &amp; &quot;S0000001&quot; &amp; chr$(30) &amp; chr$(4)<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet when I view the output file it will only have this in it:<br />
[)&gt;0617V064S41PSA2829712S0000001<br />
<br />
When I debug the report everything looks okay.  The string field contains the control characters.  My question is what is stripping out the control characters?  The print device I am using is set-up with the PS device driver.  I would prefer to use my current printers and the drivers associated with them.<br />
<br />
I have a couple of different work arounds, but would prefer to use the printers and the drivers already in use in production. I am going to play with a print driver tomorrow - I think I can set one up to do what I need.  I can also write directly to a file, but that requires more coding than I want to do. So I have plenty of options, but was wondering if I was missing something in using the report.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

This may also work - this is for creating 2d matrix tags.  I won't be able to scan my test tags until tomorrow - so far to the naked eye the tag where I used ^^ looks the same as the one where I used vi to add the control codes in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I strongly believe that your problem comes from filter6.1 which is invoked automatically to &quot;transform&quot; files from $BSE/tmp/... into the &quot;real&quot; data sent to the printer.<br />
<br />
Some time ago I also played with the problem &quot;How can I add complete Postscript Documents into the data stream?&quot; Re-printing had to be possible as well.<br />
<br />
Solution: Baan's barcode functionality!<br />
<br />
Within the report, add something like<br />
<br />
  string buf(100)<br />
  buf = bc$(20, 10, &quot;some data&quot;) | int type, int len, string barcode(.)<br />
  spool.buf(buf, len(buf))<br />
<br />
<br />
In the directory $BSE/lib/barcode/hp_lj4 (e.g.; have a look at $BSE/lib/printinf files and their entry barcode_dir=...), you need to create a shell script called &quot;type20&quot; (because of the first argument 20 in the example above). When you print to a printer of the appropriate type, this script gets called automatically; $1 is the string e.g. &quot;some data&quot;, $2 is the length (I think it is 10 in the example above).<br />
<br />
What I'm  not shure is how you could/should pass your data a) clear text including all printable characters? b) coded say \xxx for non-printables.<br />
<br />
Btw. In the latest ERP Programming manual I found a version of the Baan ASCII table that mentions that characters 139 to 152 (decimal) are cf$(0) to cf$(15).<br />

<br />
I am using cf$ and pf $ functions to change the making characters bold and changing fonts  in a Baan text (using lattr.textexpand) . I use cf$(0) and pf$(spool.fontnumber)  to return to normal mode.<br />
<br />
But it does not work . Entire text is printed bold and in the same changed font .  Underlining the characters work perfectly . <br />
<br />
Any clue .</div></div><hr />

I just took a report of my own and added some test code for your purposes. I could not find any problems, everything works fine!<br />
<br />
Here is my report code:<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
  extern string cf0(10) | maybe less characters<br />
  ...<br />
  extern string cf15(10)<br />
<br />
  extern string pf0(10) | upto 24 I guess<br />
  ...<br />
  extern string pf3(10)<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
  lattr.textexpand = true<br />
<br />
  cf0 = cf$(0)<br />
  ...<br />
  cf15 = cf$(15)<br />
<br />
  pf0 = pf$(0)<br />
  ...<br />
  pf3 = pf$(3)<br />
<br />
<br />
and here is my text:<br />
<br />
  $cf1 bold $cf0 back to normal<br />
  $cf4 reverse $cf0  back to normal<br />
  $cf4 bold reverse $cf0  back to normal<br />
  $cf8 underlined $cf0  back to normal<br />
  $cf12 underlined reverse $cf0  back to normal<br />
<br />
  $pf0 large $pf1 small $pf2 middle<br />
<br />
<br />
which looks about:<br />
<br />
   bold  back to normal<br />
   #reverse#   back to normal<br />
   #bold reverse#   back to normal<br />
    underlined     back to normal<br />
   #underlined reverse#   back to normal<br />
<br />
    large  small  middle<br />
<br />
Can you check this?<br />

<br />
Thanks for the help. It worked perfect. We had declared variable for cf$(0) and  pf$(spool.fontnumber ) with a length of 2  instead of 10 used by u (domain tcmcs.str2) . We changed the domain to tccs.str10 .<br />
And the entire code worked excellently .Once again thanks for the hint .</div></div><hr />
