We are developing a online credit card interface through our Baan system. I was curious how other people are doing this. <br />
<br />
In my case I have a java program that can be executed through run.prog function. This program reads the file that is generated by our Baan system. This file contains all the parameter require to complete the tranaction. Baan program waits for 30 sec(That is a variable) and reads the reponse from another file that is genrated from the java program. After this we delete all the files. Each file is unqiue. And we don't store the credit card number in our system. We want to do both the return and norma charge transaction. In future we would add the check over phone also. I guess this way is a nice little tool for anyone to communicate to weba and integrated with Baan. We don't or cannot afford Baan open world.<br />
