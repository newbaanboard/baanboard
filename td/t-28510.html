<br />
I'm developing a baan 3-GL script entering data into tfgld102, session tfgld1115s000. <br />
<br />
When I tab though the lines in the form, session tfgld1115s000, I receive a Baan Standard error &quot;message ttstps0108&quot;. Beløb ikke tilladt (Amount not allowed). I doesn't happen in all lines. The amount that I insert in table tfgld102 has domain tfgld.amnt. I insert the same amount in tfgld102.amnt and tfgld102.amht. When I look in GTM (ttaad4100) the amounts look identical.<br />
<br />
<br />
What does message ttstps0108, Beløb ikke tilladt (in Danish) (Amount not allowed) indicate?<br />
<br />
How can I solve my problem?<br />
<br />
I found a few threads concerning the error message ttstps0108, but none I found useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">27th October 2006, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really underdstand your situation. A 3GL is used to run scripts without forms... You talk about EGL on one hand and session/form tfgld1115s000 on the other hand..<br />
<br />
Anyway, the main difference between tfgld102.amnt and tfgld102.amth is that tfgld102.amnt is a single field, and amth is an array (3 home currencies possible in Baan).<br />
<br />
So if I will write for instance tfgld102.amth = 123, or tfgld102.amth = tfgld102.amnt I will have errors...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andersine</div><div class="date">27th October 2006, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the solution The problem was caused by more decimals than allowed by the rounding factor for the transaction currency. I could fix it by using the round() function before inserting in table tfgld102.<br />
<br />
I had only thought of looking at the domain, which was correct.<br />
<br />
round()<br />
Syntax<br />
 <br />
double round( double value, long diga, long mode )<br />
Description<br />
 <br />
This rounds a given value to a specified number of decimal places.<br />
Arguments<br />
value <br />
The value to be rounded.<br />
 <br />
diga <br />
The number of decimal places to which value is to be rounded.<br />
 <br />
mode <br />
0 truncate (for example, both 1.5 and 1.49 are rounded down to 1)<br />
1 normal round (for example, 1.5 is rounded up to 2; 1.49 is rounded down to 1)<br />
2 round up (for example, both 1.5 and 1.49 are rounded up to 2)<br />
 <br />
example:<br />
 <br />
round(1.345,2,1) gives 1.350000<br />
<br />
I inserted doubles with sometimes 4 decimals in tfgld102, which was ok when thinking of the domain, but not ok when looking at the rounding factor for the transaction currency. Then only 2 decimals was ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">30th November 2006, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having this problem with a brand new session I've created.  It is very simple, just reading one table tdpur041 and spitting four fields out to a report.  There are only two form fields, the From/To suno.  I can run the session if I leave the the suno range blank - ZZZZZZ.  As soon as I zoom out on those fields and put a suno range in there and click Continue or Save defaults or Save &amp; Exit I get the error &quot;Price Not Allowed&quot;  ttstps0108.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what to do.  I've read there are domain issues that could cause this but I haven't really done anything.<br />
<br />
thanks - tnzabo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th November 2006, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say first - make sure this is a print session and not a maintain session of any sort.  Next I would say validate the domain on the session and in the report script(maybe even a CRDD on the session/form).  If possible find another print session with suno so you can see what baan did on the form.  I have never seen something like this in a print session.</div></div><hr />
