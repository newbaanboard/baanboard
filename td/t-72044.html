I am try to save a tmp file with more than 10000 characters but It just saving 4080 characters, I am using the standard function text.write.<br />
<br />
text.write(&quot;tdvvr036.tret.o&quot;, language$, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, <br />
			   tgroup.o, editopt.o, <br />
			   l.file.temp.o)<br />
<br />
The text group is set to maximum number of columns and lines.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd July 2019, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Well one of the things I did at one point was use text to buff instead of text.write.  So I would put the text into a buffer and process it.  Basically like this - since this was part of our conversion to oracle, I am not sure if the first time I ran into a issue was with the text truncating or note.  Been a couple of years since I wrote the extract code.<br />
<br />
<br />
	ret = text.to.buf(&quot;tiitm001.txta&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,900,buf)<br />
	if ret &gt; 0 then<br />
		t.numrecs = ret<br />
	else<br />
		return<br />
	endif<br />
	for i = 1 to t.numrecs<br />
		ret = seq.puts(buf(1,i), output.itm)<br />
	endfor<br />
	rc = seq.flush(output.itm)<br />
	rc = seq.close(output.itm)</div></div><hr />
