In this instance MDM is running on Oracle (as per BaanV), so one would assume that it could be possible.  <br />
<br />
For example, we would like to compare MDM item, revision and BOM to that in Baan.<br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

In baan you have only visibility of tables that are in the DD, indifferently from the kind of database.<br />
But, if both are in Oracle, you can use instruments of DB to do this (good luck :) ).</div></div><hr />

Heres a crazy question (not that we'd implement it :]  ) - Could it actually be possible to setup table def's in Baan that  read / link to MDM oracle tables?   I imagine the developed sessions being display only.  Sounds quite fantastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st June 2012, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried it once.  We setup some tables, converted to runtime, then the dba's went in and linked them to the other database instance and tables.  We could actually read the data - but we ran into too many issues.  Convert to runtime stopped working, or if it did work you would not see your changes.  After a week or two of this we pulled it out - then again this was maybe 5-8 years ago, maybe it is better now.</div></div><hr />
