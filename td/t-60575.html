<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">23rd May 2011, 23:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a new customized session which calls a custom library.  It works for me, but when a user test the session out they get the following error when they try to open the session:<br />
<br />
Fatal Error : Error 1229 (bdb_errno 1229) on SELECT<br />
Can not continue in tiosd9199m000 in DLL: otiobgd10000003 (&lt;0&gt;[sql.fetch])<br />
<br />
I searched the forums for the error number without much luck.  The user has access to both the tiobg module and the tiosd9199m000 session.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Are there any special tables that the user might not have permissions to?  Just taking a couple of stabs in the dark - I seem to recall this error, but not what the solution was.  And is this really just opening the session or trying to run the session?</div></div><hr />

oerr ora 229<br />

00229, 00000, &quot;operation disallowed: already hold snapshot controlfile enqueue&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
I am not really sure what the solution would be. Most probably not the session, because it does work for you at least. So, possibly some tools table that is referred when the session starts up. Look at log.oracle8 or log.ora.sql</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">25th May 2011, 21:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Need to update my profile (we're using MS SQL Server now as of Oct of last year).  With the Migration to SQL Server we went from having one database user accessing to Baan to a one-to-one Baan/Database user and when we created the test environment we needed to set up a different permission group for users.  These new users were not set up with that permission group so they got the error (I am certainly not a DBA).  <br />

Thanks for your responses.</div></div><hr />
