<br />
Trying to change an existing Session to read a particular file when the session is run for that company in question:<br />
<br />
Now the session has hadrcoded file name (InfoA) I want to include another file (InfoB) so that when the Session is run for company B it will upload the file for the same.<br />
<br />
In the code presently it is:<br />
<br />
file = filename &amp; &quot;data/import_dat/InfoA.txt&quot; <br />
<br />
I also want to include another file InfoB.txt which may or maynot be there. I will take care of the file existing condition outside of the Session. I just want the Session to be able to read both files.<br />
How do I change it? Is it better to create another new Session for this Company 'B' or can I do it in the existing Session itself?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
file = filename &amp; sprintf$(&quot;data/import_dat/Info%03d.txt&quot; , get.compnr() )<br />
<br />
That way, the session will read and process the data file for the company you're in.<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunalv</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Your suggestion seems the right thing to do but since there is already hardcoding of the .txt in the Session I wanted to know if I could do the same for another company? Someone has already hardcoded the file name so I just wanted to keep the same pattern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option maybe ... file = filename &amp; &quot;data/import_dat/InfoA.txt&quot;how is filename filled, maybe you can use the same name from another path... The other option is to add a shell script somewhere to do a rename or move action on session start ...<br />
<br />
But without source code changes it will be hard to do. That is why I would opt for the customizing partner.</div></div><hr />
