<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">7th June 2002, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys,<br />
	I have created a chart using Chart Manager but I am not sure how to populate the data into this chart now. What I would like to do is to display BOM on this chart. We are having problems viewing multi-level BOMs in a display screen since users have to manually find and navigate through the sub-levels of BOM. So, I thought I could create a chart which will display this BOM with expand and collapse capability. For example, it would display the first level BOM and if there is a custom items with in that, users will able to click on that line and it will expand and display the sub-levels and so on.<br />
		<br />
	I know of one session which does this (not BOM). That is tppss2100m000 (Planning board data) but unfortunately we dont have the source code for this.<br />
 <br />
Do you guys thinks its possible?  Is there any other way of doing this that you guys have tried?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help/feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    If I understand your problem correctly,  you are refering to Menu Browser kind of tree view.   To generate a tree view, you need to use set of (Generic Browser Framework) gbf.* commands to generate view for BOM.  This will allow you to expand and collapse nodes.</div></div><hr />

A tree view would be sufficient. The one I was talking about (example session tppss2100m000 (Planning board data)) has more graphical features. In this session you could set background and foreground color, text color etc. apart from expanding and collapsing nodes. But, I think a tree view would be more than sufficient. <br />
The set of (Generic Browser Framework) gbf.* commands you have mentioned, are they supported in Baan IV. If yes where can I find any documentation/information on them?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    If your baan supports Menu Browser (GUI), you should be able to use these gbf.* commands.  For list of commands and their usage you need to refer to your Baan version Tools Technical help documentation. If you dont have tools help, you can get it from Baan Support.</div></div><hr />

        Yes, our version does support Menu Browser since we are suing BW client. I found some information on gbf.* commands and started a small application but looks like I am stuck. <br />
<br />
        See the code below:<br />
<br />
<br />
long	retval<br />
<br />
|#include &quot;itggbfdefs&quot;<br />
|#include &quot;itgcomlogging&quot;<br />
<br />
choice.cont.process:<br />
on.choice:<br />
	test.01()<br />
<br />
functions:<br />
<br />
function test.01()<br />
{<br />
|retval = gbf.init(gbf.current.library(), &quot;Test Menu&quot;,<br />
|		  bit.or(GBF.MENU.ALL, GBF.MENU.FILE.OPEN),<br />
|		  bit.or(GBF.BUTTON.ALL, GBF.BUTTON.FILE.QUIT),<br />
|		  def.options)<br />
<br />
retval = gbf.init(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;Test Menu&quot;,<br />
		  1, 1, 1)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
I can not include itggbfdefs and itgcomlogging since we don't have the source code for these functions and thus when I compile it, I get errors on gbf.current.library(), bit.or(GBF.MENU.ALL, GBF.MENU.FILE.OPEN),<br />
bit.or(GBF.BUTTON.ALL, GBF.BUTTON.FILE.QUIT). I believe in one these functions (itggbfdefs or itgcomlogging) these variables are defined. <br />
<br />
Do you know any other way of doing this? Do you have any example code? <br />
<br />
Appreciate you help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
