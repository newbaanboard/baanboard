<br />
i have a exchange scheme to output PO Lines.<br />
<br />
The problem i am facing is that , i got to export the first 30 characters of the  Text field  tdpur041.txta using the same exchange scheme.<br />
<br />
<br />
simply putting a condition to select the field ..only returns the Text Number and not the actual text.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get this done.<br />
<br />
can anyone guide me on this ?<br />

<br />
You can find a Baan standard Quick Guide on the support site for working with Text and Exchange called:<br />
<br />
Exchange - Multi-line Text<br />
<br />
Edited:  That guide is for Import of text, you want export, sorry.<br />
<br />
I beleive when you specify the text field, you may be having 'long' as the field type.  It should be multi-line text and I think it will spit out the actual text, not the number.  Does that work?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i tried using the MultiLine Text agianst the field in the exchange Scheme. <br />
<br />
it does output the Text instead of the Number , but it gives the output in the following format .<br />
<br />
<br />
100001~50~PLA117~200-02-5186~48.5~4~ea~0~0~0~~0~4~~~~~~~<br />
{\{dsca    2<br />
Parts Orders deliver to c/s Attn: Victor Escbar<br />
}\}<br />
<br />
since the {\{dsca 2  is not  to be outputted , and also only the first 30 char of the string has to be outputted , i am not sure how to do it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">12th July 2003, 00:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, that's the format it gives.<br />
<br />
I don't have exact example, but probably you can make a string field length 30, and fill it using Condition Logic based on the tttxt010 table and the text number you have in hand.  Find your language, line 1, and get the first 30 characters.  Hopefully the text you are trying for has the first 30 characters all on one line 1, otherwise you will have to read multiple lines, etc. <br />
<br />
Another solution is on the receiving side.  If you are running this through another Baan system, this is the right way to do it as it is expecting the text in that very format.  If you are bringing it into another program, you can parse it through there and get what you need using ascii parsing.   <br />
<br />
If you are directly sending to excel or some other program without programing available, you probably have to go to the text table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the condition of the exchange script use the &quot;TEXT.TO.BUF&quot; function to convert the text to a character string and extract the first 30 bytes as required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The text.to.buf () function worked  !<br />
<br />
<br />
I just attached a condition to the field in the exchange scheme<br />
Here is the code i used to get what i wanted  :<br />
<br />
#include &lt;bic_text&gt;<br />
<br />
string     dsca.array(30,1)<br />
<br />
long ret<br />
<br />
dsca.array(1,1) = &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
ret =text.to.buf(&quot;tdpur041.txta&quot;, &quot;2&quot; , 1 , dsca.array)<br />
<br />
dsca.array(1,1)     = shiftl$(shiftr$(dsca.array(1,1)))<br />
<br />
<br />
return(dsca.array(1 ,1;30))<br />
<br />
<br />
