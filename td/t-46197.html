<br />
I use std command button with print.data to create print session for most of my customize reports, however if i want to add some new report to an existing LN print session, i notice that the developer attach a form command exec.cont.process to print button.<br />
<br />
Mind to tell me what does this exec.cont.process really does? it seems that the report has been hard code into the program script so we can't add any report to standard print session.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to reuse standard print session. Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

I believe you could program exec.* for any of the former choice commands to execute that section.<br />
<br />
If the reports are not hard coded in the script, you should be able to add your own as usual.  But, maybe they are, they certainly do that - what session are you referring to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
if the customer doesn't have developer license, created any new rpt and add to print session it won't work also. that's the catch.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure about it in Ln  Why don't you try to use Rush program for non-source codes.<br />
You can do something wih it. More information about Rush program  use search tool .<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th December 2007, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Rush, like QKEY and RMCgen are wrapper programs/tools.  This is the perfect use of them in LN, they still work.  So much of LN is done through form commands, the wrapper programs allow you to add your own form commands.<br />
<br />
You still need a developers license, but you do not need source code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexlow</div><div class="date">28th December 2007, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">LN have the wrapper concept build in, can add form with customize program script on the stnd print session without needing the source code. <br />
<br />
previous without developer lic i still can copy and modify report for existing session. guess now i just have to do it on demo system and import dd in for those who don't have dev lic.<br />
<br />
interestingly infor now selling the dev license at very high price and is valid for 2 yrs only.<br />
sigh...</div></div><hr />
