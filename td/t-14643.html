<br />
the problems with new porting sets 6.1.c.05.02 or higher have already been discussed here and by baan support.<br />
<br />
But I have a piece of code that is a bit more tricky:<br />
<br />
<br />
   ...<br />
   and {:tiedm110.comp,:sitm} refers to tiedm100 unref clearunref<br />
   ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions to rewrite the code?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st March 2004, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a reason you can not separate this into a new query inside the selectdo statement?<br />
<br />
Mark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g端nther</div><div class="date">2nd March 2004, 08:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. The code is a select with 12 tables, a big selectdo part, written 3 years ago by a person that is no longer in our company ... So I would like to change as least as possible.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd March 2004, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe if you post all of the select someone with better skills than me will see something that can be done.  On a side note can you post a link to the discussion on the porting set so I know which thread you are referring to and maybe even a case number at Baan that I can look at.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I found this in our help manual -<br />
<br />
REFERS TO syntax<br />
A REFERS TO statement has the following form:<br />
<br />
&lt;from&gt; REFERS TO &lt;to&gt; [PATH &lt;path&gt; [,&lt;path&gt;...]] [UNREF&lt;mode&gt;]<br />
The following table explains the various parts of the statement:<br />
<br />
&lt;from&gt;<br />
 The referring table field or table.<br />
 <br />
&lt;to&gt;<br />
 The table referred to.<br />
 <br />
&lt;path&gt;<br />
 The path via which reference is reached (always table fields). If PATH is specified, specifying a table field for &lt;from&gt; is mandatory. For example:<br />
<br />
WHERE table1.field REFERS TO table4.field<br />
PATH table2.field, table3.field <br />
<br />
&lt;mode&gt;<br />
<br />
 A mode indicating system action if reference does not exist; possible values are:<br />
<br />
SKIP If a reference cannot be found, the record is skipped. <br />
CLEAR If a reference is empty or absent, the referring record is filled with spaces or 0 (numeric). <br />
SETUNREF The value of an undefined reference is filled with an 'undefined reference' sign, defined in the data dictionary, or with 0 (numeric). <br />
CLEARUNREF The referred record is filled with spaces or 0 (zero) when reference fields are empty. When the reference is undefined the referred record is filled with an 'undefined reference' sign. <br />
<br />
Depending on the reference definition in the data dictionary, the default reference mode is:<br />
<br />
reference mode in DD  UNREF mode <br />
mandatory SETUNREF <br />
mandatory unless empty  CLEARUNREF <br />
not mandatory CLEAR  <br />
<br />
Example<br />
SELECT  ttadv100.*<br />
FROM    ttadv100, ttadv101<br />
WHERE   ttadv101.cmod BETWEEN &quot;aaa&quot; and &quot;azz&quot;<br />
AND     ttadv101 REFERS TO ttadv100 UNREF &lt;UNREF_mode&gt;<br />
AND     ttadv100.cpac BETWEEN &quot;  &quot; and &quot;zz&quot;<br />
<br />
The evaluation order of this query may be as follows:<br />
<br />
Find all rows / records in ttadv101 that match the BETWEEN &quot;aaa&quot; and &quot;azz&quot; condition. <br />
Find all references from each row from step 1 in table ttadv100. <br />
Find all rows selected in step 2 which match the BETWEEN &quot; &quot; and &quot;zz&quot; condition <br />
When some reference does not exist in ttadv100 (step 2 fails), because of the condition on the referenced table, the whole row is rejected.<br />
<br />
You would have to change some of the SQL codes to be compatible with the New Query Processor (NQP). The code you pasted seems like a inrange or between on an index, I am not sure if index is allowed and the documentation says table/table-field.<br />
<br />
1.4	Degree mismatch in refers to expression<br />
Explanation:<br />
Functionality will change when the number of fields at the left hand of the REFERS TO is different from the right side.<br />
In the old QP, this always results in an inner join.<br />
It will become an outer join.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
	cisli205.itbp refers to tccom112<br />
<br />
Because the main index of tccom112 has two key parts, this query can now result in multiple records of  tccom112.<br />
In old QP (level 1 driver) always only ONE record was given.</div></div><hr />
