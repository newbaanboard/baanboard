Try putting audit on the tables. Also, you can maintain history of the user.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no way to monitor specific fields in Baan. As morpheus says, you can use the audit features to see who's 'messing' with your tables, or activate user history (both come with significant overhead), but in my experience the only way to prevent users from getting into areas they are not supposed to is by means of security.<br />
<br />
Establish ownership of your items table and restrict access to the proper owners only. That way, if anything happens to the data, there is no other responsible party than the people who are supposed to maintain that data in the first place.</div></div><hr />

I agree that Audit and History come with an overhead. But, there are times when more that one parties are responsible for the data maintained in the system (including master tables). So, in such scenarios audit can be put on for important data. Also, the files generated in the process can be purged after regular intervals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smiffy</div><div class="date">19th July 2002, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">There is of course a way to achieve what you require, if you have development access to the code of the session.  You can take a value of a field after a read (after.read) and before write (before.write).  If there is a difference, the logged on users id could be stored on a table for a particular item (which links via the key field of the record).  <br />
<br />
This new table could store the id &amp; date and time of the last person to change the field concerned.  This may be a bit too much work if you want a quick and easy solution, but the possibility is there.  You could make it more complex by storing the last 5 changes or something.  I did something similar with a text field, keeping history of Purchase Order amendments, but that really was complex.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />
