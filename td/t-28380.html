<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">11th October 2006, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all, I made a bad customisation a month ago, it is installed at the customer, using PMC. I should have modified the DAL whinh431 instead of whinh430. <br />
What I want now is to, effectively, have no customisation at all on the <br />
whinh430.<br />
- of course the standard baan functionality should rule<br />
- minimum problems with the whinh430 when installing future standard solutions<br />
- minimum problems to understand what happened for someone else that studies the history<br />
<br />
The situation is that if I uninstall the 'bad' pmc-solution, a lot of other, later,  solutions will have to be uninstalled, containing all kinds of components also new domains and changed tables here and there in the wh-package. Since the customer is in the testing phase, the first option is not to rebuild his whole wh-application. <br />
<br />
What is a good practice on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th October 2006, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I do not know what is good practice, but you could just make a new PMC containing the correct components(whinh431 and the correct whinh430).  I know with baan after installing a PMC solution with 1 or 2 bad components, they just povided the new components to overwrite the bad components.  No un-installing required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 00:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Well ... I want to take away the whinh430 from the customisation level because the standard version (on a lower VRC) should be the effective one. And the next standard update from baan on whinh430 should go in and be effective without any special action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 06:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not think about that - I have no idea how you would do that with PMC at the custom level.  Baan has told us to delete some objects in our patch layer, but other than that I have no solution.</div></div><hr />
