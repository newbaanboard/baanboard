i've implemented a user-friendly gui for the touch-screen terminals in the production (big grid, big button, ..). The code is 3-GL and it works with the depricated API create.object(). Now i want to use an alternative API, the online-help gives a hint for the &quot;programmable Dialoges&quot;. But here is no chance to give the sizes of the buttons and forms or am i wrong? Maybe there is another option?</div></div><hr />

<br />
we have developed an InforLN program (FP8) which uses deprecated functions like create.object(). It is used for a touchscreen application and therefore it uses smart and big grids and buttons for easy pressing with fingers. With a look at the online help i can see the &quot;programmable dialogs&quot; is meant to be an alternate for the deprecated functions. But there is no possibility for sizing forms and buttons. Or do i overlook something? Maybe there is another option or api to use?</div></div><hr />

Programmable dialogs as you rightly said, does not have that capability. I once did play with the standard UI using java script wrapper which used to fiddle with the UI generated by LN which is quite cumbersome and tedious because you have to go through the source, find the elements to handle and play with them using DOM. But well, worked for me. I will be pleased to know if there is any alternatives.</div></div><hr />
