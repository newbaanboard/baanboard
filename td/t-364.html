I will try to help you, I am on Baan5 and MSSQL 7 and had the same problem few month ago. As far as I remeber you have to: 1. delete this table using directly Enterprise Manager form MSSQL Server<br />
2. run Reorganize Tables ttaad4225m000 for the company and package you have problem with<br />
3 I am not sure if I run this session but it won't be a problem if you do it -  Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary ttadv5215m000 to reconfigure tables<br />
4 From session Table Definitions ttadv4520 choose Specific\Create Tables  to create your table which you deleted using Enterprise Manager<br />
<br />
and this should help, if you still have a problem let me know<br />

There are problems with the 'Import Data Dictionary' when importing table changes.  The little internal Baan flag that says there has been a change to this table does not get set.    You may have to run Create RDD on any reference tables that were changed as well.   (Another silly trick is to edit the table that was imported, just changing the name slightly then changing it back is what I do.  That sets the flag, so you can run Convert to RDD instead of Create RDD ..)<br />
<br />
Also, there are problems getting the Convert / Create RDD changes to take on NT systems if you don't shut down - or at minimum reboot shared memory.  I have found this to solve most RDD problems after import.<br />
<br />
If all of that still fails - you will have to follow more drastic steps, as Jenny may have had to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin</div><div class="date">9th April 2003, 10:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm,<br />
<br />
as i remember, the problem is on SQL-Server side.<br />
SQL Server creates for each Baan table a stored procedure.<br />
(named like : Pttccom100589_1)<br />
So if you make a change on a table, the old stored procedure would not be deleted and the result ist, that the sql server dont know the new table fields.<br />
The Soultion is to delete the stored procedure for this table in the sql server. The correct procedure would be generated automatic when the table is read from Baan next time.<br />
