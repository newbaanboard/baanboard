We just upgraded from 4c3 to 4c4.  Since going to 4c4 we get a lot of format messages in the log.bshell file and it will fill up two or three times a day.  Most of these messages comes from generating outbound.  What I found was that if I added the unit in ttaad1106m000(Maintain Generic Units) and in ttaad1107m000(Maintain Formats by Generic Unit) I could prevent the messages.  My question is that when looking at ttaad1106m000 I see mostly currency units and I wonder if others have had to do this?  So has anyone out there had a problem like this or had to do this?  Second how do I determine what the correct format is - should it match what is in tcmcs0101m000(Maintain Units)?  Worried about causing rounding problems.<br />

Currency Formats <br />
 <br />
In the application you can make use of flexible formats. Flexible formats allow the user to determine the exactness with which quantities, prices and amounts are presented. <br />
<br />
<br />
Quantities, prices and amounts can be presented to four decimal places. This degree of exactness can be adjusted through flexible formats. These are applied in two areas within the application:<br />
<br />
-	Currency formats (prices and amounts)<br />
-	Quantity formats (quantities)<br />
<br />
Below, we describe the use of currency formats in detail. For a description of the use of quantity formats, you are referred to Quantity Formats. <br />
<br />
<br />
Currency formats: <br />
The degree of exactness with which currencies are presented differs from one currency to the other. In practice, currencies of which the basic unit represents a relatively low value are generally presented as whole figures (e.g. Belgian frank or Italian lira). Currencies of which the basic unit represents a relatively high value are generally presented with one or more decimals (Dutch guilder, German mark).<br />
<br />
Several currencies can be used at the same time in one logistic/financial system. It is therefore desirable that each currency is rounded and presented in a manner that is characteristic for that currency. <br />
<br />
<br />
You must first define the currency before setting up its format. This should be done in two places. First each currency must be made known to the system as generic unit in the session &quot;Maintain Generic Units (ttaad1106m000)&quot;. (Most currencies have already been predefined in this session.)<br />
<br />
Subsequently, you must define the currency within the application in the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot;. The code of the currency defined in the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot; should be equal to the code of the generic unit defined in session &quot;Maintain Generic Units (ttaad1106m000)&quot;. The currency defined in the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot; is then used in the application, on sales and purchase orders, etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
Within the application, prices and amounts are arranged in a number of categories. Each category is identified by a format code. Format codes are available as predefined codes within the system. The table below lists all predefined format codes: <br />
<br />
<br />
       Format Code  Application<br />
       <br />
       001          Rates (Manufacturing)<br />
       002          Rates (Transportation)<br />
       003          Prices<br />
       004          Cost Prices<br />
       005          Amounts<br />
       006          Cumulatives<br />
       007          Fuel Prices (Transportation)<br />
       008          Advances and Expenses<br />
       009          Amounts by Unit (Transportation)<br />
       010          Small Amounts<br />
       021          Small Amounts<br />
       095          Amounts (Finance)<br />
       096          Cumulatives (Finance)<br />
       400          Rates (Manufacturing and Project)<br />
<br />
<br />
To each format code, you can link an unlimited number of generic units (= currencies), with the desired form of presentation. This is done in the session &quot;Maintain Formats by Generic Unit (ttaad1107m000)&quot;. There are a great many different possibilities - it is possible, for instance, to present prices with a greater degree of exactness than amounts in the same currency.<br />
<br />
Example: <br />
You wish prices in a specific currency to be registered with two decimal places, and amounts to be presented as whole numbers. Execute the following steps: <br />
<br />
<br />
a) Define the currency as generic unit in the session<br />
<br />
&quot;Maintain Generic Units (ttaad1106m000)&quot;. b) Define the currency as application currency in the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot;. c) In the session &quot;Maintain Formats by Generic Unit (ttaad1107m000)&quot;, select the format code for prices (003) and link a generic unit to it with a format allowing two decimal places to be specified. Execute the same steps for amounts; link formats without decimals to the format codes for amounts (a.o. 005 and 095).<br />
<br />
Consequences: <br />
Within the application this will have the following consequences. It will be possible to enter amounts in whole numbers only. Decimals will not be accepted. In calculations, amounts will be rounded to whole numbers. Prices can be entered with up to two decimals. Prices will be calculated to two decimal places. <br />
<br />
<br />
Note: <br />
The currency format system is subject to various limitations. As these are NOT tested by the application, users should be careful to comply with them:<br />
<br />
-	The currency in the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot; must have the same code as the generic unit in the session &quot;Maintain Generic Units (ttaad1106m000)&quot;.<br />
	-	When creating a new currency, you should check if the currency is present as a generic unit. You should furthermore check if a generic unit with the right format is available for all relevant format codes.<br />
	-	In the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot; you can link a rounding factor to each currency (in the field &quot;Rounding Factor&quot;). This will allow you, for instance, to round amounts to multiples of 0.05. This rounding factor is not related to the format (and the degree of rounding resulting from it) recorded in the session &quot;Maintain Formats by Generic Unit (ttaad1107m000)&quot;. Hence, it hardly makes sense to define a rounding factor of 0.01 in the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot; if currency formats without decimals have been linked to the currency concerned in the session &quot;Maintain Formats by Generic Unit (ttaad1107m000)&quot;. This rounding factor is only used to round amounts (not prices).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th March 2004, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess what confuses me most is that it appears these sessions are used for &quot;currency formats&quot;.  This quote:<br />

<br />
Makes me wonder where the rounding really takes place. I thought the rounding for units of measure like &quot;EA&quot;-each and &quot;FT&quot;-foot was derived fromt he tcmcs0101m000(Maintain Units) session.  And now Baan is telling us we need to add these unit of measure formats into these other tables.  I will probably do that eventually just to get ride of all the messages.<br />
