<br />
For some sessions, when I am opening the Form Editor,  it is opening in Read Only mode. Sometimes it is opening in Editing mode, but often in Read Only mode.<br />
I checked the VRC, it is the correct one.<br />
What am I doing wrong ?<br />
Attached a print screen.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if there is any other issue I know apart from incorrect VRC. Other thing what you can check is, if there is an object present in your $BSE/application for the form in the desired VRC directory.</div></div><hr />

Check if SCM is activated,</div></div><hr />

Hi Soumya,<br />
<br />
SCM is not active for that VRC but in it I have other forms which I can edit.<br />

Thank you for your help</div></div><hr />

But on our UNIX platform what happened was some forms and scripts were created with my name only with rw permissions for the owner.  So if someone else opened the files they could not edit or update them. Essentially read only for them.  Is it possible that maybe at the windows level you do not have read/write access to that particular form in that particular directory?  Like I said just a wag.</div></div><hr />
