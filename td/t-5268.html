<br />
We would like to know the customised scripts and components alone from our <br />
derived VRC(customisation)layer. I mean there could chances of standard scripts <br />
copied to these layer without any change on it.<br />
<br />
Is there any option in tools which could list out the customised scripts or <br />
components from standard.<br />
<br />
This is for the preparation of migration to c4 and baan5.<br />
<br />
please advice.<br />
<br />
thanks, Eric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">21st May 2002, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you taken a look at any of the tools under Tools/Application Customization (or Development)/Utilities?  There is a comparison session and one that allows you to purge components that are unchanged relative to the VRC from which they were derived.  I think this could be a good starting place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you found the session running properly in c3?<br />
<br />
If yes I would like to run that the earliest.<br />
<br />
So the remaining objects I could take as customised then.<br />
<br />
Again there could chances of baan patches included in that.<br />
<br />
We have patch and accepted customisation in one layer.<br />
<br />
thanks,Eric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st May 2002, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">If you could I would certainly recommend separating the patch and customisation layer at the earliest possible time.  If a Baan patch over-layed some of our customisations we would be in trouble.  Just a suggestion.<br />
<br />
The way we use this session is typically to compare our customization layer to our patch layer. We usually only do this for things like sync-patch testing.  We do not do the purge piece, because we want to review all places where objects collide between the layers.  We have found that Baan support sometimes puts things in our customisation layer that we do not want to keep. It takes a couple of us 2/3 days to review everything, but we think it is worth it.<br />
<br />
I am not really sure how helpful this would be to you since you combined the two layers. A purge would certainly worry me.  Do you have a test box you can do this on first?  If so give it a try there and check the results.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
