<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">11th February 2008, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Our company purchased some new printers (an Oce 3165 and Imagistics 3511s). I set them up with drivers for similar printers, but am having some problems. When they print multipage reports from Baan, the printer miss the page breaks, printing the last lines of one page at the top of the next.<br />
<br />
So I think I need to go into $BSE/lib/printinf and create some new printer definitions for the printers. But I need some help understanding what I need to do.<br />
<br />
Here is the printer definition I was planning to start with (based on the hp_lj4 printinf file), with some explanations I got from reading HP's PCL command reference:<br />
<br />
initpr=<br />
  1 \EE                                  Reset?<br />
  2 \E&amp;l0S                             Simplex Print<br />
  3 \E&amp;l2a66F                        # of Lines<br />
  4 \E(12U                             PC850<br />
  5 \E(s10H                           Primary Pitch (10)<br />
  6 \E&amp;l5H                             Lower Bin<br />
  7 \E(s0p10h0s0b4099T        pfont1 (Courier)<br />
  8 \E&amp;k11.6H,                       HMI  = 120 / 10.34483<br />
I think I need to change line 3, the page length, but I'm not sure what &quot;2a66&quot; means. The PCL references I saw just say you can put a number in there.<br />
<br />
Also, PCL command reference that came with the Oce printer says to use this command for page length:<br />
<br />
Esc &amp; l # P (where # could be 66 for letter size)<br />
<br />
I guess in the Baan printinf format this would be:<br />
<br />
\E&amp;l66P<br />
<br />
  <br />
Should I use this instead of the HP command?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I also think you will have to roll thru and complete a new driver file.  You may even want to ask baan support if they already have one for this printer.  Never hurts to ask.</div></div><hr />

Hello Rob,<br />

PCL sequence for HP Printers are as :<br />
<br />
RESET                                 \EE<br />
Paperformat                         \E&amp;l#A where Letter is ...2A<br />
Orientation                          \E&amp;l#O where 0 = Portr. / 1 = Landsc.<br />
<br />
The sequence for Letter and 66 lines maybe :<br />

Hello Felipe,<br />
if your Canon printers are working in PCL-Mode, use PCL sequence for tray options.<br />
I'm not in front of my Infor Systems, but i'm using a Canon IR.... Color Multifunction Device with 4 trays in BaaN IV at one of our sites.<br />
<br />
The following PCL sequence is for Tray 2:<br />
<br />
                                                     |-Tray 2<br />
initpr=\EE\E&amp;l26a66F\E(12U\E(s10H\E&amp;l1H\E(s0p10h0s0b4099T\E&amp;k11.6H,<br />
resetpr=\E(s10H\E&amp;l5H\E(s0p10h0s0b4099T\E&amp;k11.6H,<br />
<br />
PCL sequence lxH is for tray.<br />
<br />
\EE = Escape<br />
l26a66 = A4 Paper with 66 lines ........<br />
<br />
Paper Source ?&amp;l#H 0 = prints or ejects current page<br />
1 = Tray 2<br />
2 = manual feed, paper<br />
3 = manual feed, envelope<br />
4 = Tray 1<br />
5 = Tray 3<br />
6 = Envelope Feeder<br />
7 = auto select<br />
8 = Tray 4<br />
20-69 = external trays.<br />
Paper size ?&amp;l#A 1 = Executive<br />
2 = Letter<br />
3 = Legal<br />
25 = A5<br />
26 = A4<br />
45 = B5-JIS<br />
80 = Monarch<br />
81 = Commercial 10<br />
90 = DL<br />
91 = International C5<br />
100 = B5<br />
101 = Custom<br />
Paper Type ?&amp;n# 5WdBond = Bond<br />
6WdPlain = Plain<br />
6WdColor = Color<br />
7WdLabels = Labels<br />
9WdRecycled = Recycled<br />
11WdLetterhead = Letterhead<br />
10WdCardstock = Cardstock<br />
11WdPrepunched = Prepunched<br />
11WdPreprinted = Preprinted<br />
13WdTransparency = Transparency<br />
#WdCustompapertype = Custom1<br />
Orientation ?&amp;l#O 0 = Portrait<br />
1 = Landscape<br />
2 = Reverse Portrait<br />
3 = Reverse Landscape<br />
<br />
Set the xH to proper tray<br />
<br />
Sequence for tray2 in landscape mode:<br />
<br />
                 |-Landscape (l1o)                     |-Tray 2 (l1H)<br />
