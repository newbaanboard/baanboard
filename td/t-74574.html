<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garlapati</div><div class="date">10th August 2022, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">i have report personalization done on a report<br />
i am able to print the report as required to screen<br />
but problem is its not taking any other device other than &quot;D&quot;<br />
but i need my report print to a notepad or asciif.<br />
when i try to give the notepad it says &quot;selected report personalization uses exact positioning&quot; and not allowing other than D.<br />
we dont have report designer looks like. <br />
any suggestion on how to fix the &quot;selected report personalization uses exact positioning&quot; and let it print to any device?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your inputs</div></div><hr />

when i initially designed report personalization some how the &quot;convert to exact position&quot; option got checked and report got designed based on position level.<br />
i removed that report personalization completely and again started new one and made sure this time that option is not checked in report designer. and now the report is printing to any device.</div></div><hr />
