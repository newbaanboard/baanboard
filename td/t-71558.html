<br />
I would like to use standard session &quot;Print bill of material multilevel&quot; to print by bom. However, I would like report print only for 2 item groups only.<br />
as i can't amend the session, i would like to put instruction at report.<br />
Does anyone can advice me on this?<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

What I would do in 4c4 is either create my own session and use AFS code to print them in the background.  Or I would create a new session copy the form to the new session and restrict options on it - but use the actual script from standard code.  And a third option I have is to use Qkey(source extender) and just put code it to restrict the report option to what I want.  Now wait for someone who knows LN - it probably has a better option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also,Not sure, if you have extensibility in your system as it is 10.1 but you could give it a try , putting it in before print.data or continue.process, resetting Item Group as the one which you want.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for the feedback.<br />
<br />
Actually i tried to copy the session but can't copy the script from the session.<br />
Seems i need to create new session for this.<br />
<br />
However, I do not know how i want to assign the session to read from the table as it is show only a single bom.<br />
That's why i'm thinking to use the current session and just add code at report that only print out if .mitm is either these 2 item groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th December 2018, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">If I did not own source code I can add a field on the form - but it would have to be one that is defined in the session script.  Then add the field to the report - then only print those records that match.  The problem is  that the session script has to send the data to the report with each record.  A wrapper script is best, but I did this one with one baan session.  In my case I was able to add a field to the form and then in the report just skip everything that did not match what as on the input field.  Not very efficient because basically you were running the report wide open - then not filtering until you got the report.</div></div><hr />

is your requirement based on session tibom1411m000.<br />
<br />
If you don't own sourcecode, you have to develop your own session within the logic of tibom1411.<br />
<br />
I will give you some hints when i have access to my Infor - Systems next week.<br />
<br />
Session dhbom1411m000 is extended with selection of tcibd001.citg and tcibd001.dscb for mitm.<br />
Form attached.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdittmar</div><div class="date">30th December 2018, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Therefor you have to select all tibom010.mitm in the range from<br />
&quot;&quot; to &quot;ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ......&quot;<br />
<br />
Should comsume a lot of time.<br />
