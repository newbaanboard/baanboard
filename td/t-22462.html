What I need to do is either override this question and insert a question of my own or determine how the user aswered the standard question.  Are either of these options possible.  I have been unable to find anything on this.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

I do what is below is several programs just to validate that the data is correct - if not I make them try again.  Is this possible in your case?<br />

When I put the session I am working on in debug mode I did a L to see what is out there in the choice.abort.program section.  All I did was change a value and then hit exit.  The choice.abort.option started and I did the L and saw this variable.  I can not find any documentation on it yet.  Forgot to mention I selected NO and the value was 2.<br />
