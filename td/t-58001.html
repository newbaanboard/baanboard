<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">11th March 2010, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone knows of an existing utility/session/method for copying texts from one company to another? As you know the problem with texts are that the text is present as a text number in the table, which refers to a text in the tttxt tables. Copying a text number is therefor wrong and dangerous, since the text number may exist in the destination table with a different text!<br />
<br />
I want to have a dynamic kind of session or utility to copy texts of given tables (for instance tables listed in a file). I know how I can achieve it and can program a session for it, but I am sure that this is a very common issue and therefor either there is some existing method in standard Baan OR some of you must already have developed sessions/scripts for this purpose so why invent it again...<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance!</div></div><hr />

So the text tables and other tables come all at once. I don't recall ever having an issue with this.  When we originally converted to baan we used exchange schemes, but that was so long ago I do not recall how the exchange schemes worked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your response. We need to copy certain tables between companies which creates this requirement of copying texts. I will build a session myself tomorrow and post it here at the board so others can benefit from it as well (unless someone will come up with something existing by tomorrow morning).<br />

Then Our daily jobs (or user driven programs) calls exchange schema in afs to export the data , copy the file to approprate destination where it  is  imported  using exchange import schema through custom program.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Logical Tables (Session ttaad4120m000) could be a solution for you!?<br />
<br />
You could e.g. export and consolidate the text tables than link the text table from one company to another and than reimport them.<br />
<br />
Than you can work with copying the text number...<br />
