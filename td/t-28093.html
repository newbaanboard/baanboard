<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">6th September 2006, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a requirement to update screen information when the user leaves the field on a multi-line maintable form. This update serves to several purposes.<br />
<br />
I have tried using a sql for update, but maintable io blocks it. I have tried, without calling a second session, all ways to do the update. <br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
To update the other records of the main table , u can use table alias . Also use the save.rcd.main before the function to update main table and restore.rcd.main to restore main.table values once the update is done .<br />
<br />
Alias would create a pointer to the table other than the one created by the main session itself. And hence no interruption in main table io . <br />
<br />
I also have experienced problems when updating table while leaving a field . Probably u encounter error 206 in next main table updates . So as a practice we have done table updations mainly in main table io or after.update.db.commit sections only .<br />
<br />
Also  we have used arrays at times to keep track of changes in a situations like this .</div></div><hr />

I did not see some of the functions that you mentioned in my 4c4 manual. However, I did get around my problem by creating a dynamic array of variables whose index was based on the main table key field.<br />
<br />
I was able to store what I required in the dynamically obtained arrays, and refer to them as required.<br />
<br />
It was recommended to write a sub session to do the table updates, as a function would still be under the control of the main.table.io code.<br />
<br />
So... I will be trying it out.<br />

<br />
True ,  The array with row occurrence number as index can truly serve any purpose. <br />
<br />
It was recommended to write a sub session to do the table updates, as a function would still be under the control of the main.table.io code.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed , function to update a table would create an error when leaving the field. If u do not like the session route because it starts a window for it , u can avoid it by writing a session 3GL code without form . Nevertheless I would still prefer the array route only .<br />
<br />
<br />
I did not see some of the functions that you mentioned in my 4c4 manual.<br />
<br />
Here is the help of restore function from our Baan IV c4 instance online help .<br />
<br />
   NAME<br />
    restore.rcd.main - function to restore the record buffer<br />
<br />
    SYNOPSIS<br />
    void RESTORE.RCD.MAIN ( long occurrence )<br />
<br />
    DESCRIPTION<br />
    This function copies the internal buffer of the specified occurrence in<br />
    the fields of the main table.<br />
<br />
    USE<br />
    This function cannot be used in the before.program section.<br />
<br />
Though save.rcd.main is not available in documentation , I have used it successfully as opposite of restore .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">14th September 2006, 02:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried it and it works. Actually, I have a multi-line maintable update where the left half of the form consists of display fields, and the right side, the values to be used to update other tables and of course the display fields -- realtime. By realtime the leavling of the field causes the full row display update, and a deferred update to the other tables via maintable.io -- before.rewrite.<br />
<br />
So I used your feedback about save.rcd.main() which of course is not documented.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">29th September 2006, 04:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hitesh, or any good samariton<br />
<br />
I was wrong with my earlier comments about testing the restore.rcd.main() and using it. As I mentioned in a few earlier correspondences, I have a multi-line form (no buttons), with some display fields on the left, and some input fields on the right. When I modify the input field(s), one or more display fields gets updated, and the row on the screen is refreshed. To prevent problems, I make use of the function update.occ(). In general, this works well.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, when I read a row and I need to update a field that is also an input field on the form, I encounter a problem.  I get messages such as row updated by other user. or other informational messages together with actions that block initializing the field. Even though I have made liberal use of  the update.occ() function, I am stymied.<br />
<br />
How do I read in a set of rows of a table, and initialize input fields to calculated values  (obtained by reading a second table)? My input fields are initially blank, and before displaying them on the form, may be filled in with some text data (field is 3 characters). I consistently get blocked by the &quot;record updated by other user&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, in closing. I have an input field that is blank in the table. When I read the row, I search a second table for a value to set into that blank field. When I am prepared to write the table row, I must write it with the filled in value, or with a value overwritten by the user.<br />
 <br />

<br />
For modifying an input field , u may use do.occ(actual.occ,function_to_calculate_input_value ) . That will work perfectly .</div></div><hr />

Gotcha.<br />

Les<br />
Will keep you posted on the success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">1st October 2006, 05:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have a little problem. I tried it the do.occ(actual.occ,myfunc,&quot;abc&quot;)<br />
as a test. It compiles cleanly, but I am getting a stack overflow.<br />
<br />
It appears that it cannot go in a &quot;after.read&quot;, it cannot go in the &quot;before.field&quot; for that field, and it appears to not be able to go in any &quot;before.display&quot; so can you help me by telling me which event can I place it into before my field is displayed and accepted for input?<br />
<br />
<br />
The pdf manual that I have does not say where it can to. <br />
<br />
As a reminder, this is what I am trying to do.<br />
<br />
I have a form with a field of the main table defined as  domain tcmcs.str4  code. To say the least, I am a little frustrated about using maintable.io.<br />
<br />
Leslie <br />
<br />
between the after.read and before the display of the input field, from my main table, I check to see if the field is blank. If it is blank, I want to fill it with a value I obtain from another source (via sql). If I do it the normal way, I get the message about the row being updated by another user. <br />
<br />
Definitely not what I want or need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">1st October 2006, 07:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Do.occ internally triggers before.field / after.field / before.display / after.display for each field on the form . So if any code written by u in these sections causes recursion with standard program , it will cause a stack overflow .

<br />
Following information from Baan help may be of relevance.<br />
<br />
  USE<br />
    The functions DO.ALL.OCC, DO.OCC and DO.OCC.WITHOUT.UPDATE are allowed<br />
    in the sub-sections:<br />
    before.choice, on.choice and after.choice,<br />
    before.input, on.input and after.input,<br />
    check.input,<br />
    when.field.changes,<br />
    before.zoom and after.zoom<br />
<br />
    The function ON.OLD.OCC is only allowed in the sub-sections<br />
    before.rewrite and after.rewrite and in before.write / after.write in<br />
    case of dupl.occur or global.copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">1st October 2006, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">My documentation is a pdf manual U7167 (4c4) dated 1998. We are now in 2006. My manual does not say were it can be used.<br />
Is there a more recent publication?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">1st October 2006, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally, I would like to do what I do in the after.read,  But the compiler rejects it. and if I do the assign in the after.read, the message about the record being updated by another process appears, even though I use the update.occ()<br />
<br />
Baan4c4 is missing good developper's documentation and that is causing so much waste of time in experimentation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">2nd October 2006, 03:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a pleasant surprise.  <br />
In the after.read section of maintable.io. I added an sql to fetch outside information to update the main table input field.  I followed it with a update.occ() call. and to my amazement, no blockages or complaints. <br />
So, in an after.read section, one can update any inputfield on the form, prior to the first field being displayed.<br />
<br />
I will continue to test for a while.<br />
<br />
Leslie<br />
<br />
PS. Is there more current documentation then the 1998 manual which elaborates forms management?  My documentation is very very shallow and is hardly more than  a listing of the function names and nothing else.<br />
(no doos and donts)</div></div><hr />
