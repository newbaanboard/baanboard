<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">12th November 2007, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a standard. session tssoc2121s000 (Serv.Order : Actual Mat. Cost ), now basically based on a value in table 'x' , i am suppose to allow/disallow update on session tssoc2121s000 field values<br />
<br />
So flow is :<br />
1) user invokes session tssoc2121s000<br />
2) changes some value on form like qty. or some other field which is editable<br />
3) would throw a question to user &quot;You still would like to save ?&quot;<br />
4) if user selects &quot;YES&quot;, then go ahead and allow the changes to be saved, and if user selects &quot;NO&quot; then dont update anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step No. 3 i am doing it in a dll since if i write ask.enum in dal (tssoc200), it throws a compilation error saying &quot;cant use ask.enum in dal&quot;, since i am left with no other choice other than to write in dll and call this dll via tssoc200 dal, any sugestions / comments on this ? I hope this is the right way of handling ask.enum ..... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if user selects &quot;No&quot; for question asked at step no. 4 , i am suppose to revert back the changes which i am doing it by the following code in tssoc220 DAL<br />
<br />
<br />
function extern long before.save.object(long mode)<br />
{<br />
	on case mode<br />
	case DAL_NEW:<br />
		|do something<br />
<br />
	case DAL_UPDATE:<br />
	If tssocdll.200.ask.question() = tcyesno.no then    |dll extern funct.<br />
		dal.set.error.message(&quot;tssoc2121.mes&quot;)<br />
		|You cant perform the update<br />
		return(DALHOOKERROR)<br />
	endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now although the changes are not saved because of DALHOOKERROR, but when i try to close the session tssoc2121s000 from cross mark, it again warns me if i would like to save the changes , and i select &quot;no&quot; and then able to close the session. Is this behavior normal like baan asking me again whether i would like to save changes or not ? :( <br />
<br />

If you would update the table from out another process this same question will be raised. The question is only related to the session tssoc2121s000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SergioRuiz</div><div class="date">13th November 2007, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I´m not sure to understand you well, but if you have written the checks in the DAL then UI script takes this checks from the DAL not from program script.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you want to bypass the question you can write a method in the DAL that puts one variable to true an check this variable to ask the question, so before the update you must call this method in the DAL with DAL.START.BUSSINES.METHOD . I don´t like this way but if you need it you can use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry SergioRuiz for the confusion , actually i read the reply from ARijke and wrote against that, and then i realised that probably my newest reply/explanation is not good enough, so i removed that message that very moment, :p  so probably during that time u saw that post and replied :) <br />
<br />
anyways i will update the post with few other comments soon ...<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
