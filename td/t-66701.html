<br />
Yes, its possible using many ways. One way is to create a bat file which will call a 3gl program in Baan 5 which will generate a file with the records from the required table. <br />
<br />
Now, call that bat file from your LN code. Once the file is generated, read the file and import the data.<br />
<br />
Else there are different possible ways using shells, database connections etc. Depends on how frequently are you going to use it and how much time you want to spend on building the tool.<br />

Yes file creation is a way and i don't want to use that will take time.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how to connect with shell or database by script. It seems a great idea. Can you share if you have done like this before.?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
That depends on which databases you are using at both ends. In past, I have used Stored Procedures &amp; SSIS to connect tables between 2 databases on different servers. Both my databases were SQL Server 2008 R2.<br />
<br />
It will require a lot of troubleshooting if you are new to it as well as you have to take care of the data consistency. The other way would be a better option as its more &quot;Baan Way&quot; and a safer one too.</div></div><hr />
