<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraDiehl</div><div class="date">6th August 2007, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We are writing a VB.net application that currently we are able to log into BaaN and execute a special library but what we would like to be able to do is when the user logs into this new VB.net application we want to be able to pass the user id and password to the Baan4.Application call so they will not have to enter the information again.<br />
<br />
I see that in the option there is a USER value, so is there one for password?  For security reason we don't want the default to be set in the bw config file so looking for other options.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraDiehl</div><div class="date">15th August 2007, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The question is simple but solution may not be:<br />
<br />
Is there a way to call the Set BaanObj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;) from either excel VB or a VB.net application that would eliminate the BaaN login screen other than setting up the configuration file to have the user id and password?  For security reason we do not want to have the configuration file to have the &quot;saved password&quot; checked so was hoping that along with the &quot;-set USER=&quot; variable that can be set in the &quot;command&quot; of the configuration that there is a &quot;set PSWD&quot; command for password.<br />
<br />
The idea was to use the id and password the user used to get into the VB application and pass that value to the BaaN Login script to eliminate a second login screen from popping up to run the application, will not be able to do unless there is a password command like the &quot;USER&quot; command.  That is what I am looking for, if anybody has any information rather if a password command exist.<br />
<br />
AND if that command does exist I also need an example on how to set the values to pass it along when executing the CreateObject function.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I have cleared up my request enough to get some suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
A solution to your problem is, probably, a single sign on installation, where the user is not required to input any password after he log into his client machine. This solution isn't easy at all :-(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You have to define in ttaad2106m000 ttstpoledaem as one initial session for users.<br />
<br />
If yo do this getobject will connect baan from vb using existing connection.<br />
In this way passwords are not in script, etc...<br />
