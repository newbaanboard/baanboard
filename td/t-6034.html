Is there a function to delete file on a remote machien on network. We are on NT. I tried using &quot;remove.local.temp.file()&quot;. I am not sure what should be the value of two paremeters. One is path and other is local path.<br />
<br />
Any inputs<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I do not think this is available on 4c3.  I checked my ttdllbw and it is not in there. I also can not find any help on this command.  We are also on 4c3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st August 2002, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">You could write you own application to delete a local client file and use app_start to run it while passing the file name as a parameter.  I did a quick test using a .bat file that hade erase %1 in it.  I then used rc = app_start(&quot;C:\baan_old\TMP\rmfile C:\baan_old\TMP\perfdetails.txt&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;) in a test script.  It did delete the local file.  There probably is a better way, but this came to mind first.  Please let us know what your final solution is.<br />

Good Luck!<br />

<br />
Did you try the http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_directory_file_operations_file_rm the baan standard function ?<br />
<br />
you can also consider -<br />
<br />
<br />
remove.local.temp.file<br />
long remove.local.temp.file( const string path(), ref string local.path() )<br />
pre:	local.path is temporary local path for path; local.path is<br />
	created by function create.local.temp.file.<br />
post:	If path is local (so local.path = path) then nothing will be done. <br />
If path is not local this function removes the temporary file local.path.<br />
return:	0 if path is local, otherwise the return value for<br />
	seq.unlink(local.path)<br />
<br />
<br />
This function is found in the tools dll -<br />
<br />
Library ttdllfilehand<br />
File Handling, also working for remote<br />
(38 Functions available)</div></div><hr />

My question was to remove or delete the file on remote machie. I tried using remove.local.temp.file() but I was not sure what the parameter means. While, I did this in a round about way. I create a bat file in which I wrote to delete all the files that I need to delete and also a line to delete the bat file itself. It runs and it deletes all the file that I want to delete. Only thing is I am using seq.puts to write into the bat file. I need to have &quot;enter&quot; after evry delelte line ( I am deleting 3 files).<br />

<br />
I think you can do that with the file.rm() function. Please refer to the help manual.<br />
<br />
To access/copy/remove files across hosts/servers, you need to set up the remote user data.<br />
<br />
I didnt quite understand what do you mean by ?<br />
<br />
I need to have &quot;enter&quot; after evry delelte line ( I am deleting 3 files).<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are facing a problem putting text in different lines with seq.write.local(), please refer to the posting -<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5881<br />
<br />
You can look up the available functions in a tools dlls by using the $ bic_info(version) ottdllfilehand or use the session, ttstpbaandoc.<br />
<br />
<br />
remove.local.temp.file<br />
long remove.local.temp.file( const string path(), ref string local.path() )<br />
pre:	local.path is temporary local path for path; local.path is<br />
	created by function create.local.temp.file.<br />
post:	If path is local (so local.path = path) then nothing will be done. If path is not local this function removes the temporary<br />
	file local.path.<br />
return:	0 if path is local, otherwise the return value for<br />
	seq.unlink(local.path)<br />
<br />
create.local.temp.file<br />
long create.local.temp.file( const string path(), ref string local.path() )<br />
post:	If path denotes a remote file, this function has copied the contents of that file to a temporary file local.path,<br />
created in bse.tmp.dir$. If path denotes a local file, local.path = path. <br />
return:	If an error occurs when copying the file to local,<br />
then true is returned, otherwise false is returned.<br />
note:	local.path should be removed using remove.local.temp.file (using seq.unlink may result in a serious error).<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out.</div></div><hr />

I think NPR answered your question with the link. It talks about the chr$(10) and chr$(13) use.<br />
<br />
Then again you could just use one line -<br />
erase file1 file2 file3.  Of course you need to have the path to each of the files.<br />
<br />
As to NPR's other suggestion the file.rm sounds good if you can get the security setup between the clients and the servers.  I am not sure what that takes - I can not test this because our security between hosts(UNIX) and between clients(W2K) is restricted. <br />
