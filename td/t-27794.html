<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">4th August 2006, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The r.s. function is used to print additional information on a specific moment. It can be of use when customizing standaard Baan reports where you need specific information which is not available from the program script. To explain what happens I give you an example, it may not be the most beautiful example but is show whatt r.s. can do.<br />
<br />
If you print a list of customers and you want to show a list of available countries after each customer you could create a report which prints all customers. It shows:<br />
                 customer | name | phone<br />
<br />
In the reportscript you can now add a kind of dummy detail to print all the countries available by using an r.s. function.<br />
<br />
In the script is added:<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
    domain tcbool print.ok<br />
<br />
detail.10:<br />
after.layout:<br />
       select tcmcs010.*<br />
       from    tcmcs010<br />
       where tcmcs010._index1 inrange { &quot;   &quot; } and { &quot;ZZZ&quot;}<br />
       selectdo<br />
               print.ok = true<br />
               r.s.after.detail.11()<br />
               print.ok = false<br />
       endselect<br />
 <br />
In maintain report fields you declare a variable detail.11 is is presorted, then you create a report section after.field detail.11 with the condition print ok = true. In this after field you can add the tcmcs010 fields.<br />
The result is that all records from tcmcs010 are printed after each customer.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

We used to work with layout.again functions for this purpose.<br />

<br />
I was just going thro' your example, and your mapping of index1 to full range confused me. I mean when the index is mapped for full range, it would serve no purpose for fast searching of records. Instead i think it may just slow down your query due to calcultion of index and searching values according to specified index :confused: <br />
<br />
If you have any particular reason then please rectify me. I request senior members to guide me on the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th August 2006, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">This was just an example and normally there would be something else in the script to narrow the selection down - either a specific field or maybe another table linked into the query.  So I think JP meant it as a quick example of how to use r.s.after.detail and just did not pay that much attention to the select statement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive seen numerous such examples in my system, so would really like to know if there is any strong reason for mapping full range in index which i may be ignorant of.<br />
<br />
I will probably try this out on monday , but still any backing reason would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th August 2006, 01:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I can not think of a reason to do that.  I would expect a joining field of some sort - why would anyone always want to print all records from a table in a layout?   What examples do you have?</div></div><hr />
