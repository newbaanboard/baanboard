<br />
Thanks for your reply. I have done what you suggested and checked the suppress print sheckbox. However this had no effect on the report.<br />
<br />
The results of the report are writted to a text file which is then imported into excel. <br />
<br />
My problem is that I am unsure on how to sort and group the records as there are a couple of combinations that the records can be in. At the moment I just have the records on a detail line. I have attached the output file at present.<br />
<br />
The first six lines illustrate my problem. <br />
There are six entries for a product code D3774. This product is planned to run on two machines E01 and E02 over three different shifts.<br />
<br />
I can't sort it by product code and thus have an after.field layout because the product might not change as it is possible to product this product on 2 different machines simultaneously.<br />
<br />
I can't sort it by machine code as the product planned to run on this machine can change at any time, so the product changes but not the machine. <br />
<br />
I have tried the group by clause but this causes lots of records to be output. I'm only a beginner so I'm a bit lost.......<br />
<br />
I would be very grateful if anyone could advise on where to go next....<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
:(</div></div><hr />

 <br />
sort your report first by product code and second by machine code and then create a layout code after.field machine code with totals and supress the printing of the detail-layout with output expression zero.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Is this what I do:<br />
<br />
Create a before.field layout for product code<br />
Create a before.field layout for machine code<br />
Then, create an after.field layout for machine code?<br />
<br />
thanks for your help</div></div><hr />
