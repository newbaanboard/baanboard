<br />
Is it possible to print a UTC-date in the different languages?<br />
<br />
I have designed a purchase order in 5 languages and would also print my date-fields on the document according to the language of the business partner.  My orders are built well, but the date is always printed in English.<br />
<br />
Bye, Veerle</div></div><hr />

%Dxxx[,lang]<br />
 Use for dates. <br />
<br />
xxx is the code for a date format defined in the data dictionary. lang indicates the language code to use. If this is omitted, the current user language is used.<br />

The expression that is substituted for this symbol must specify a number of days since 01-01-0001.<br />
 <br />
