Execute the print command in the session.<br />
After that, there are 3 reports displayed for selection to be printed on.<br />
One is a standard report. Another 2 are customized reports.<br />
The question is how to hide report(s) by some conditions using any available methods? so that the user can only select the available report(s) after my customized validation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other option is not to link any report with print session and based on some conditions, you can call specific report using brp series of functions. Here is a simple comparision of rprt and brp report functions.<br />
<br />
brp.open() =  rprt_open()<br />
brp.ready() = rprt_send()<br />
brp.close() = rprt_close()<br />
<br />
if you search the forum, you may find relevant threads with examples.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

I tried adding Standard Linked Report -&gt; standard report -&gt; Is Visible hook<br />
return(false)<br />
and then commit.<br />
The report is still visible and printable in the session just like nothing has been done to it.<br />
I think the hook has a bug because I have tried something (not related to this) with Menu Extension using this very same hook &quot;Is Visible&quot; to return(false). It did not work as well.</div></div><hr />
