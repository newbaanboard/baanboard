<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruce21</div><div class="date">9th February 2007, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
i have created a new session with the item table as main-table. (listgrid)<br />
I have added now some table-references and configured it for showing on my list.<br />
But if i try to define a new filter i can only select entries for the items. <br />
Do you have any ideas how to solve this?<br />
Kind Regards Martin</div></div><hr />

You have a main session with item master as the maintable.  What filter did you set on this session?  How did you set this filter?  Was it using query.extend?  More info is needed so we can make suggestions.</div></div><hr />

Filter is a new standard tools menu item in Reger and Gemini Tools versions. It is referred to as the query browser option (QBF-ttstpqbf) in the previous BaaN releases.<br />

Please add more info and screen shots in your posting, others cannot guess what's your requirement or in your mind. If you are explicit then you have a better chance that others can help you out well.<br />
<br />
Refer to the session's help -<br />
<br />
Filters (ttadv9593m000)<br />
Use this session to define, or edit filters. You can use the filters to display subsets of records in an overview session, and to define a sort order.<br />
To specify a sort order for the filtered records, click Define Sort Order on the Specific menu.<br />
Note<br />
The filters only apply to the records displayed in the session from which you started the Filters (ttadv9593m000) session.<br />

Overview of filters<br />
To use filters<br />
Field Description <br />
Filter Name The name that identifies the filter.<br />
Note<br />
When you apply the filter to the overview session, the name appears in the session's title bar. <br />
Field Name The field you use to filter the overview session's records.<br />
For a record to display in the overview session when you apply the filter, the record's data in this field must satisfy the Value field by the operator you select in the Condition field.<br />
If you define more than one field for a filter, the conditions combine to form an AND relation. That is, when you apply the filter, only records that satisfy all your filter's conditions will display in the overview session.<br />
Note<br />
You can only select fields that:<br />
Are displayed in the overview session and the details session.<br />
Are stored in the session's main table.</div></div><hr />
