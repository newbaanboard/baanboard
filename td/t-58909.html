<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iiparrag</div><div class="date">29th July 2010, 13:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know the diference between two situations:<br />
<br />
I'm trying to customize a standard session: tipcs2451m000. So I created a new one in my actual VRC. Icopied the original program source and report because I wanted to change them.<br />
<br />
I had just add some new lines in the program source code to show more information in the report, and it works fine.<br />
<br />
But now, I want to insert a new field in the form. As it's a reporting session, the standard form contains some fields to select a range, and some other fields of tcyesno domain. So, before inserting my new field (another tcyesno), I copy the standard form to my actual VRC (the production VRC, but in a test server). <br />
<br />
When I run the session with the standard form, all the tcyesno fields take default values (some YES and others NO). And I checked that I don't have default values saved for my user. I tried with other test user and the same values were shown. I checked the ttadv990 table.<br />
<br />
But when I copy this form to my actual VRC and BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING, y create RTDD for the form, and just in case for the session again(Before each step I logoff from BaaN, I login again). I run the session but the tcyesno fields are shown empty. <br />
<br />
I checked with debugger until get.screen.defaults (completely standard code) and different fields' sections.<br />
<br />
Which can be the diference?  I'm using BaanIVc4 (SP17 fot Tools)<br />
<br />
Thank you so much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th July 2010, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">First do what George recommends.  Then another thing to check - after copying the form make sure the form actually has defaults set for those yes/no fields.  I have seen some forms get out of sync from the standard VRC.  Also make a change or add some text to make sure you know you are running the form you just moved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The VRCs are at the same company. I had previously checked the default values for tcyesno fields. All of them have &quot;1&quot; value as default. Some of them are mandatory and the others take a value throuugh program, depending on the other selected values.<br />
<br />
I inserted my new field with a default value, an I can see it perfectly. But the default I changed for an existing field is not able to see. and  I converted to RTDD.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I was surprised to see &quot;1&quot; in all the fields. I had to put the default values at the customized form by myself. And now it works.<br />
I supose that if I want to use some other values for my user, I'll save them and there will be no problem, won't be?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />

In our case we just had a bad form from the SP we installed, not sure about your case.</div></div><hr />
