I have to use baan session to allow users to change their baan login password.However even in unix when we use passwd it prompts for old and new password.<br />
The user should be allowed to enter all the three passwords on form itself and then the script should be able to take care of the changing the password in Unix without prompting.<br />
How do i achieve it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">olabas</div><div class="date">2nd July 2003, 10:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Please look at http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10253&amp;highlight=passwd <br />
<br />
There are a lot of informations about using passwd and also some related links.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

This is done on purpose to prevent hack attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
But on the internet you will find alternative password programs, which will allow to pass the new password as a parameter.<br />
<br />
You can try to write a from, which collects the old and new password and then calls one of these programs. But there is a slight moment in time, when any user would be able to see the new password in the process list. <br />
<br />
So it is not 100% save, but this might be ok for your environment.<br />

The reason why you can't script 'passwd' is because it's hardcoded to require a TTY. You would need a script that can 'fake' a TTY. Expect is language with such capabilities. There's is also a PERL module that could do the same. But as Nico says, it remains insecure.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Just another suggestion</div></div><hr />
