<br />
I'm having a problem in our Baan IVc4 + Sql Server 7 probably because a mistake I did.<br />
I was building a new view session for the tdpur030 table (prices by supplier and item) and I created a new index in the table session with just the item. After this I converted it to runtime DD and did some tests in development that revealed it was working ok.<br />
The problems started when I copied the table definition and session to the users VRC. <br />
After converting the table to runtime DD (with reorganizing table indexes on) I lost all information for articles with more then one supplier (only one supplier remained). I understand this is because of the index definition I used but should this lead to data loss even when the other indexes are still defined or is the information still in the table? <br />
Also after doing the copy to the user VRC I'm getting 512 errors on the sessions that work with tdpur030. Even after I reorganized the tables.<br />
We do daily backups of the SQL Database but I'm not sure I can recover single tables (Veritas backup)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moved this to OS and DB related, you'll get better answers here.<br />
The restore depends on how your DB is backed up (I'm not using SQL but Oracle and to restore a table we have to restore the database into another system and then export that table - a point in time recovery).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">17th November 2002, 06:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using Backup Exec or Net Backup?<br />
<br />
You can only restore to the individual table space or individual filegroup.  You cannot restore an individual table.  This is probably the most common question asked about backups.  Since backups are writing at a  block level not a logical row/table  level you need to interpose another tool between the backup utility and the database.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I do not have better news.  You will have to restore to a second instance and then export/import the individual table.<br />

Thanks for the answer. <br />
I will do that. I'm only concerned about the 512 error. <br />
I think I will have to drop the table and build it again.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
I recovered the tables from backup and we are ok now :)<br />
I used Backup Exec to recover the SQL Database to a different machine. After loading the table and running convert to DD again on the table definition all the errors where eliminated and the data recovered.<br />
Hopefully the table only had relations to tdpur036.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

I just noticed that you cross-posted this thread into the Tools Development forum. Please do not do this again.<br />
<br />
Usually we delete cross-posts but since both threads already have some good replies on them, we will let them be.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry I did it. It won't happen again.<br />
I should have asked for the thread to be moved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pedro was just being careful about backups - he crossposted as backup post in case his other post got problems. <br />
<br />
I'm just kidding, of course.</div></div><hr />
