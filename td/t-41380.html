I am having difficulty getting a text field to print.  I've learned that the text field is really an integer linking to another table where the text is stored.  But I have been unable to determine how to get that text to print on a report.  Merely placing the text field on the report does not appear to print the data that is stored in the report.<br />
<br />
How do I go about getting the text to print on the report?  Do I need to use the text.read() and associated functions?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Edit:  Ok, I have found that just putting the text field on the report will cause it to display the text.  I should have tried that yesterday when I was banging my head against the wall in frustration because I couldn't understand the documentation.  <br />
<br />
Which leads to a second question:  If I want to print a number of text fields but don't want them to be printed in a detail layout, but rather just once at the end of the report how would I go about that?  <br />
<br />
I have tried placing the text field integers in an array and sending it to the report.  However, I am not sure how to add the array to the layout so that it prints all of the associated text fields.  Here is some code that I have tried in the report script:<br />
<br />
after.report.30:<br />
	before.layout:<br />
		info.array(con.ltxt, nr.dim, dim.array)<br />
		long i<br />
		i=1<br />
		while i &lt;= nr.dim<br />
			print con.ltxt(i)<br />
			i = i + 1<br />
		endwhile</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th September 2007, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this will work - in the after.report layout put your text field on the layout printing sometext(i) (in this case the domain will be tctxtn).  Sometext(i) will be your text array and no.of.texts is how may different text number you will be printing.<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
    i = 1<br />
<br />
after.report.30:<br />
after.layout:<br />
    if i&lt;no.of.texts then<br />
       i = i + 1<br />
       layout.again()<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
You can search on layout.again for more information.  Of course I am assuming layout.again works in LN like 4c4.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the insight.  I have gained a clearer understanding of how reports work.<br />
