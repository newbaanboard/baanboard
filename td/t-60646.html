<br />
<br />
I am executing a standard report(1), in this report i need data fron another standard report(2), I have written AFS for that and it is working properly. BUT the problem is when report is printed, first standard report(2) is printed and  then  report1 is printing. What I hv done now is that i am using report(2) for calculation only and stop printing each layout.<br />
<br />
Result of this is that now blank pages are comming and the standard report(1) is printing n the last page.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How Could i stop printing standard report(2), or those blank pages(same things)????????????<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestions are welcomed</div></div><hr />

I have never done anything like this, but it sounds like something is still increasing the line or page count from the second report.  Have you removed all the layouts that are not needed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I need not to print that 2nd report, only i need some data from that so i m running that 2nd report to &quot;null printer&quot; but still it is printing on &quot;D&quot; device.<br />
<br />
That's why on first page data of 2nd report is printing and on next page 1st report is printing. I remove 2nd report layouts but stilll it is printing a blank page.<br />
<br />
2nd report is executed as many times as our detail layout of 1st report is fired.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any Suggestions.....</div></div><hr />

Do you own source code of the second session?  Anyway to write code to get the data without running second report?<br />
<br />
This sounds like the problem I ran into with spool.copies - I actually export it from the AFS session and import it to the called session to get the correct number of copies.  I have found that several of the spool variables do not reset once the AFS code is started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhruv_x0</div><div class="date">9th June 2011, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only Report script of Ist report and in this report script i m executing AFS for the 2nd report and storing the required data in temprory table. <br />
<br />
No layout has been removed for the second report only they are set to false i.e they are not getting printed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th June 2011, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I can think of is to run the first report to disk, letting the second report do what ever it does to populate the temporary tables.  Then maybe run a clone of the first report to print for the user(and if necessary read the temporary tables).  That is all I can think of at this time.</div></div><hr />
