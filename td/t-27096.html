<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">12th May 2006, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;Wait for &lt;CR&gt;&quot; field is to make the cursor go to the next field as soon as the last character has been entered in the current field. Therefore the feature is useful only if the field is always completely filled in.<br />
<br />
Also, this feature (&quot;Wait for &lt;CR&gt;&quot;) works only for the old 'green screen' VT52 type monitors. It does not work for GUI forms.<br />
<br />
In any case, your requirement has to do with hardware programming. What you need to do is to 'program' the barcode reader to do a TAB instead of a RETURN. Once that is done, that barcode reader will always go to the next field after scanning.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">12th May 2006, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">To 'program' the barcode reader to do a TAB is very simple - in the user manual of the barcode reader there should be standard barcodes already printed that you have to scan to make the barcode reader behave according to your need. One is to make it TAB, the other is to make it do a RETURN, and some more. You can talk to customer service of your barcode manufacturer to get specific help with your particular barcode reader.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
as i understand, your BARCODE Reader is a keyboard wedge.<br />
The most barcode readers (Datalogic, metrologic ....) are programmed by using barcodes from their manual.<br />
You may be able to change &lt;CR&gt; to &lt;TAB&gt; by using this readers manual.<br />
I've done it with both products.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
