I plan to make a script which only removes the trailing empty lines in cases where the empty lines in the report (after headers etc) have to be preserved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klixy23</div><div class="date">6th November 2003, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">What's about ssp and rmnl unix commands?<br />
ssp removes redundant blank lines from the standard input and sends the result to the standard output. All blank lines at the beginning of a file are removed, and all multiple blank lines elsewhere in the file (including end-of-file) are reduced to a single blank line.<br />
rmnl removes all blank lines from a file (exept at beginning of file as explained below), and is useful for removing excess white space from files for display on a CRT terminal. Groups of two or more successive \n (new line) characters are reduced to a single \n character, effectivly eliminating all blank lines in the file except that one ore more blank lines at the beginning of a file remain as a single blank line. rmnl is used by the man command.<br />
<br />
To remove all blank lines from a file including beginning of file, use rmnl piped to ssp, or ssp piped to rmnl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dleijdekkers</div><div class="date">6th November 2003, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option to prevent the empty lines at the end of a report is to add the following text in the reportscript:<br />
<br />
detail.5:<br />
before.layout:<br />
spool.pg.length = 1<br />
<br />
This makes sure that the detail-line only prints 1 line. Even if the detail is printed several times, there will not be any empty lines afterwards.<br />
<br />
I also have another question though.<br />
I really would like a &quot;return&quot; after the line.<br />
<br />
When I use the file created by a baanreport in Windows, all the lines are behind eachother. While on Unix there are below eachother.<br />
Does anybody have an idea how to solve that problem?<br />
<br />
thanks very much in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walter01</div><div class="date">6th November 2003, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the Unix command ux2dos can convert the ASCII file from Unix format (only a linefeed) to Dos/Windows format (carriage return + linefeed). You can use that just like i used the grep command in the device script.<br />
Maybe (I'm not sure of this) you can print a chr$(13) which is a carriage return in the report at the end of each line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello Klixy23!<br />
<br />
We are on solaris 8 and I can not find these commands anywhere.  Also man returns nothing.  Could you tell me where I might find them or maybe they are only for your version of Unix.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
