<br />
We are facing this error while cancelling a Sales Order Line on Live Production Server.<br />
<br />
Now i have searched Infor Incidents where they have suggested that Error 111 usually occurs in case of corruption of a table and usually reorganization of Table needs to be done.<br />
<br />
Now i am going to follow up on that.<br />
<br />
But my question is when 111 Error occurs, No record found means what? If record is not found the program should not go into the loop and therefore why is the need for a Fatal Error. What am i missing here?<br />
<br />

<br />
There might be a bad character(something like a High-Ascii character) in the data which can cause the issue. I have experienced it in the past, when I was opening up a Sales Order session, when scrolled, it kicked me out.<br />
<br />
Then I found out that, one of the sales order had a note or something with a High-Ascii character which caused the bshell error.<br />
<br />
So, the basic select will fail with the bshell error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Appreciate your answer. But there is no description field in the Linked Order Line Data.<br />

We have run into something like this a few times over the years - something about the control character or what ever is in the data that just causes the fatal error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">10th January 2018, 07:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok..So what did you guys do about it then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th January 2018, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I know in one case we re-org'ed the tables.  In another case I believe we knew which record was causing the problem and just used table maintenance to clean it up(but I can't remember if we just deleted the record or re-entered the data).  Been a long time since we ran into this issue - I think we finally along the way convinced users to stop cutting and pasting from word which caused several interesting text and print issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">10th January 2018, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">In our case, we had multiple records(thousands of them) which had this data issue. I extracted all the data to Excel by exchange. I created a macro to replace all the extended ascii characters by space and then re-uploaded the data using the exchange.<br />
