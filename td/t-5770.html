<br />
I am going to be creating a new table in Baan with some new sessions.<br />
<br />
What I want to know how to do, is to be able to raise a SO on saving a record from one of these new sessions.<br />
<br />
I beleive that this can be done using EDI, but I don't know hwo to go about this.<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer me any advice?<br />
<br />
I don't have source, so I cannot perform any scripting on the Sales Order session, but if someone can explain to me how to use EDI and modify it so that I can then raise a Sales Order from my new session I will be most gratefull.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like EDI is your best option here. There are two possible ways to do this;<br />
<br />
a. Call the sales order dll, that EDI uses (tdslsdll4280) when you save the record to your new table, but ensure that you set all the appropriate variables before calling this dll (it's not that easy as there are some vague variables that are used and if you don't have the source of the DLL, you may end up missing some).<br />
<br />
b. In the session that you created (based on your new tables), when they save the new record, simply write to an ASCII file and set up a EDI Conversion Setup, to map the fields, and use the standard EDI system to read and import this file as a sales order. This is probably the easiest option, but more time consuming to setup. It will also mean, that you need to run Direct Network Communication, whenever you save a record, or have the interchange controller running (which will take another licence). This will give you locking issues with the files, as you will probably need to disable the standard communication for this network (otherwise your interchange controller will hang, waiting for the command.fil to be removed). Thus, using DNC may be the best option, but will have to be scheduled.</div></div><hr />
