<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">21st March 2018, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
so I created an Extension for tisfc001 and added a after.save.object() hook, that updates CDF (that stores production order group to which order belongs) in tisfc005. It works as it should in -almost- all situations, namely:<br />
1. When a production order group is created.<br />
2. When an order is added to some group.<br />
3. When an order is deleted from group.<br />
But when a group is deleted entirely (from tisfc3550m000) my hook does not get called! Off course all the relevant orders get updated in tisfc001. How is this possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">23rd March 2018, 08:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of curiosity I created the &quot;true&quot; UE DLL script for tisfc001 with the logic updating tisfc005 filled into ue.after.after.save.object() hook and... results are the same. It doesn't get called upon a production order group deletion :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">4th April 2018, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">So thing is tisfc001.grid is referenced in tisfc350, and Delete Mode is set to Nullifies, so when a group is deleted tisfc001.grid gets cleared on the database level ignoring DAL completely. Therefore one has to use before.destroy.hook for tisfc350 to catch this happening.</div></div><hr />
