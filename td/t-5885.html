select	distinct SUBSTR(tdsst010.sstr,64,16)<br />
from	tdsst010<br />
This syntax does not obviously work in a baan script.  Is there another way to do a similar select?  This table has a large string field with a bunch of fixed width fields imbedded in it.  I am looking to select only distinct items from this table and  in that glob field is the only place i can find item number.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
You should realize that by using substr, you are forcing Oracle to go through the entire table anyway, since the substr itself is not indexed.<br />
<br />
In other words,<br />
<br />
select  * from tdsst010.sstr<br />
...<br />
selectdo<br />
     if tdsst010.sstr(64,80) meets condition then<br />
          etc.<br />
<br />
...may look a lot less elegant but will have the same effect in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is true that the use of a function on an indexed column will negate its use in Oracle. However, Oracle 8 has a nice feature called function indexes.  It allows you to create an index that specifies a column or group of columns modified by a function so that that same configuration can be specified in a query and still make use of that index. Works really well.<br />
<br />
I know that you are trying to re-work this in Baan, but thought this might be of interest to those using Oracle.<br />

<br />
You can do it in BaaN SQL with the selectbind clause. You use the selectbind option when you are looking for records in a table based on array values, sub strings etc.<br />
 <br />
Please refer to the help manual for more details -<br />
<br />
It is also possible to use a pseudo variable in the WHERE clause. The WHEREBIND function is then used to link a value to the pseudo variable. For example:<br />
<br />
SELECT ppmod123.field1:5, ppmod123.field2:6<br />
SELECTBIND(5, my_val1)<br />
SELECTBIND(6, my_val2)<br />
SELECTDO<br />
		....<br />
<br />
ENDSELECT<br />
<br />
SELECT ....<br />
WHERE ppmod123.field1 = :1<br />
WHEREBIND(1, 10 + sqrt(a+b))<br />
SELECTDO<br />
		....<br />
ENDSELECT<br />
<br />
Used BAAN 4GL variables (with ':') are 'bound' automatically.<br />

Sorry to revive an old thread. Could you post code that would solve the original question using selectbind. I believe I have a similar situation for warehouses. Shown below is the list of warehouses and I need the distinct first 3 characters. Better explained with some data.<br />

Personally I do not believe that this is solved using selectbind. So should be a nice problem to chew on :).</div></div><hr />

In what context?   Are you trying to print a report like that?  Or, trying to select based on the first 3 char's of some field value?   If selecting based on the first 3 characters, just use a range:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
start.value = &quot;CVA&quot;<br />
end.value = &quot;CVAZZZ&quot;                  |* Fill however appropriate<br />
<br />
select   table<br />
from     table<br />
where  table.value(or index) inrange :start.value and :end.value<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure what you are trying to do though.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the responses. I have a working solution on those lines. Was curious about doing it in a better way. Since Prashanth had kindly posted the manual contents of select.bind to the forum I thought he had a solution which used select.bind in his mind.<br />
<br />
Prashanth,<br />
<br />
Look at the confusion you caused. &lt;Vamsi dons his moderator hat&gt; Stop posting those manual contents unless they are relevant to the topic at hand :D!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Vamsi,<br />
<br />
Not sure why selectbind is being suggested as the solution. It doesn't allow you to select only a portion of the field. But allows you to bind a psuedo variable to a field.<br />
<br />
EG:<br />
	select    tcmcs003.cwar:cwar<br />
is the same as<br />
	select    tcmcs003.cwar:1<br />
	selectbind(1, cwar)<br />
<br />
However, to get around your warehouse problem, why not just create a variable that is only 3 characters in length and bind that variable to the warehouse code. Thus, the variable will only hold the first 3 characters of the warehouse. For example;<br />
<br />
<br />
	string	my.cwar(3)<br />
	string	hold.cwar(3)<br />
<br />
	select	tcmcs003.cwar:1<br />
	from	tcmcs003<br />
	order by tcmcs003.cwar<br />
	selectbind(1, my.cwar)<br />
	selectdo<br />
		if hold.cwar &lt;&gt; my.cwar then<br />
			hold.cwar = my.cwar<br />
			| Perform functions here<br />
			| rprt_send()<br />
		endif<br />
	endselect</div></div><hr />

I wanted to try out something which might work but it didnt... I didnt want to be lead in a known path so I wanted to explore a different solution.<br />
<br />
I know you are too smart and I knew you had a solution for your problem.<br />
<br />
Here is a possible solution/example if you like -<br />
<br />
if spool.open(&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;, 1) then<br />
	select	ttadv200.cses<br />
	from	ttadv200<br />
	where	ttadv200.cpac &lt;&gt; &quot;tt&quot;<br />
	group by ttadv200.cses<br />
	order by ttadv200.cses<br />
	selectdo<br />
		if name &lt;&gt; ttadv200.cses(1;5) then<br />
			name = ttadv200.cses(1; 5)<br />
			select	ttadv200.*<br />
			from	ttadv200<br />
			where	ttadv200.cses(1;5) = :name<br />
			order by ttadv200._index1<br />
			selectdo<br />
				spool.pr.line = ttadv200.cpac &amp; ttadv200.cmod &amp; <br />
						ttadv200.cses &amp; ttadv200.vers &amp; <br />
						ttadv200.rele &amp; ttadv200.cust<br />
				spool.line()<br />
			endselect<br />
		endif<br />
	selecteos<br />
		spool.close()<br />
	endselect<br />
endif<br />
<br />
<br />
I post the contents of manual here, and its relevant because all the commands/options are not available on all BaaN Versions. <br />
<br />

Thanks for everyone's input. Basically you have confirmed my interpretation.<br />
<br />
Just one more thing to note. The documentation that I have on appl.delete does not mention that only the owner of a lock can remove a lock.<br />
<br />
It is helpful to know such things. - Joy<br />

We all know how good BaaN documentation is. :D <br />
