  <br />
I have a question about of tables in LN.  <br />
  <br />
I am working with Infor LN 6.1.  <br />
  <br />
In old BaaN versions when I have placed data in a baan table  from an external source, never these tables have had DAL.  (Temp. Tables)  <br />
  <br />
Now I am making something similar for LN in a Baan table that has DAL.  <br />
  <br />
Would I have a problem with this when the external source places data in this table?  <br />
  <br />
For example of external source: May be a oracle trigger; that is, the data is not saved in the table by baan sessions.  <br />
  <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

If all checks are successful and the data you are trying to save into the table is validated by the DAL, then there should not be any problem. If not, the DAL will return a suitable error message which will tell the external source what the problem is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not correct &quot;NVP&quot;. Dal functionality is only available inside LN. If you modify the table from outside (Oracle, ODBC,..) no DAL checks or update of related tables are done! You could basically end up with corrupted data. If you have to fill  DAL-enabled Tables from outside LN you should use something like OLE-Automation which actually fills the Table using an LN DLL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you a lot for your answer, I understand you, the dal only will have validations of data, in my caso; that is, the dal doesn't have updates to other tables, then, in the case that I explain you.   <br />
  <br />
Would I have problem in this scenario when I put the data from external source?  <br />
  <br />
Would I have problem in this scenario when I entry to the data from Baan Sessions, obviously, this action after that I put the data from external source?  <br />

Thank you...</div></div><hr />
