I have gone through some of the posts on signature on checks, didn't get any idea.<br />
<br />
We are already of check printing on place. but the accountant is getting a new cpu. so we have to install all of these softwares on to her new machine.<br />
<br />
I installed the IDAutomation software on the new machine. After that I dont know how to move further. Baan check report already has the signature character adn the userfont 12. <br />
<br />
Can you tell me how to make the signature as a user font or character? how to do that? Should is save the picture as jpeg file?<br />
<br />
this is a bit urgent and any reply ishighly appreciated.<br />
<br />

Worked well for company logo's, simple signatures and was easy to use.  This can create a font from your graphic and then assign this font to your user font of 12.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not the perfect way, but just thought I'd throw out this option.</div></div><hr />
