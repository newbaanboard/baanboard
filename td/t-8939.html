Under the &quot;objects&quot; sub-directory in &quot;BaaN application&quot;, there are some files starting with &quot;u&quot;. The format is-<br />
<br />
&lt;script name&gt;|&lt;some number&gt;|&lt;table field/table name/etc.&gt;<br />
<br />
These files are avialable for only customized sessions. Also, this &lt;some number&gt; is one for all the fields mentioned, one for all the table names, and so on. These files are created after the script is compiled, and in case the files are deleted, there is no effect on the customization.<br />
Any idea what these files are about!!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
those file are like - u&lt;module&gt;&lt;scriptcode&gt;<br />
<br />
these are the where used files generated when you compile a script.<br />
<br />
So this file contains, the where-used domains, tables, libraries etc.<br />
<br />
I think its &quot;OK&quot; if you like to delete those objects but leaving them doesnt harm you too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">19th February 2003, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the deletion seems to be making no difference.<br />
Thanks NPR!!:)<br />
<br />
But, does that mean the where-used sessions have something to do with these files!?</div></div><hr />

No. I dont think so. The where-used sessions read info from the tools tables and not from these files. <br />
<br />
But I am still not sure why does BaaN-Tools generate these u-files and what is their purpose?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaapzwaan</div><div class="date">6th March 2003, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">THe compiler (bic6.2) reads the program script &quot;p...&quot; and creates an object (&quot;o....&quot;) if the compilation was succesfull. Besides the object, it creates a &quot;u....&quot; file that is read by the session &quot;Program scripts&quot; after the compilation. The content of this file is information about used components by the sources (program scripts and includes). After this reading (which is done directly after the compilation), the file is useless.<br />

This session reads those files and updates the where-used tables.<br />
<br />
So the files are not useless, but have a limited life-cycle.<br />
<br />
After the reading by the session, they are obsolete.<br />

<br />
Jaap, if you're still working for the Baan company could it be something that you can arrange?<br />
<br />
It would help to keep our systems clean and tidy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">6th March 2003, 22:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hans, I think the same holds true for the &quot;,v&quot; script revision files. <br />
They can be deleted automatically when the script is deleted.<br />
<br />
I hope Jaap will consider these minor issues.</div></div><hr />
