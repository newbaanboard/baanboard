<br />
Is there anybody on the board that has developed report layouts that produce XML documents and would be willing to share them?  I am trying to avoid recreating the wheel.  Ideal would be if the document were according to some standard like CIDX but beggars like me can't be choosers.<br />
<br />
If you cannot share freely maybe we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement?<br />
<br />
I am looking for XML layouts from the following: <br />
Print Purchase Order (tdpur4401m000),<br />
Print Order Acknowledgement (tdsls4401m000), <br />
Print Packing Slip (tdsls4403m000),<br />
Print Sales Invoice (tdsls4404m000)<br />
<br />

<br />
here is a zip file containing my attempt at generating Order Ack in XML-Format. It was only done as a kind of proof of concept and a personal challenge. It did work but I would probably now do it in a program script as we do have development. <br />
<br />
PS: The report is in German, you probabely should be able to copy it to english and compile.</div></div><hr />
