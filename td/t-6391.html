Then I copied all the personalizations from the c2 vrc to the c4 vrc.  Converted to runtime, compiled all scripts, dumped all forms and menus.  When we try to open a personalized session, it gives the error 'can't read session or object (session code)'.  The message in the log.bshell file states that it's a bdb_errno_111.  Oddly, this occurs with most personalized sessions, but not all of them.  Is there anything that I can check?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope..tried that already.  Still get same error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Please try explode6.1 on the object to see which VRC level it exist if it exists at all. Also check your fd6.1 file if you have the package combination existing there. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">ok.. i tried explode6.1 on the object file and it did appear to be in the correct vrc directory.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what to do with the fd6.1 file.  I did a search for that file, but it was not found.  How is the file supposed to be used?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be under your BSE/lib folder. It would have files like fd6.1&lt;package combination&gt;. I was curious if the file on the package combination contains a line like otd (object for sales) and then whether the VRCs are there.<br />
<br />
good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">this is what the otd line in the file states:<br />
<br />
otd:/app/baan4/bse/application/tdB40C_c4_obg4:${BSE}/application/tdB40U_c4_stnd:${BSE}/application/tdB40_c4:${BSE}/application/tdB40_c2:${BSE}/application/tdB40_c1</div></div><hr />

<br />
The otd (object for td package) is just an example. Perhaps let us know what is the session number you have problem. So we know which package youre in. When you explode which VRC is it existing?<br />
<br />
My suspicion was the object compiled correctly and placed it in a specific VRC but the fd6.1 file does not point to it. As this is personalization you might have personalized packages, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">This particular session code is:  tdobg0400m200.  <br />
The obg is our personalized module.<br />
<br />
The script attached to this session is: tdobg0400rec.  <br />
This is what I'm exploding on.  The explode6.1 states that the object is located in:  /tdB40C_c4_obg4/otdobg directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 22:23</div></div><div class="posttext">The object resides on your highest VRC. The only ones who can see it are the users linked to the highest level. Make sure you have a company linked the highest Package Combo and the user executing the session is linked to it. Other users below that will never see that object.<br />
<br />
You can also try copying that object on lower level, say tdB40_c4. Explode6.1 to check and try running the session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked what package comb. that my username is linked to and it looks to be the same level as the vrc that this session is copied to.  <br />
<br />
I did copy the session to a vrc lower (B40C_c4_stnd) ran the session and it worked.  Then I deleted it.  I ran the session and this time it did go right in without any errors.   Am I going to have to copy every session down a lower level, and then delete it before those sessions will run?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest to just leave the sessions and objects at a lower level. These are personalized sessions so you dont have to worry about patches delivered by Baan.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't have worked after you deleted it. My only explanation is that shared memory thingy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Natasha</div><div class="date">28th August 2002, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">timb25<br />
Try  create  runtime DD for you personalized session by VRC (no convert).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you do ttadv1115m000 in which you have to maintain the directories for ALL software components for that VRC?<br />
