It is the same problem as printing a company logo and if you do a search for that on any of the Baan boards, you will find that you are not the only one who ever struggled with this problem.<br />
<br />
My favorit solution for logos, that you might want to include as option 5 is the simplest by far....pre-printed froms.<br />
<br />
If the signature is too sensitive for that, than I would say no. 4 is your best bet. Here is a thread that covers the subject: Graphics in report (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=1808&amp;s=&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;display=show)</div></div><hr />
