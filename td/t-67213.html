Is there a way in Baan program to read a file in the reverse order which is from the last line and backwards to the first line. Please do let us know the options that are available for this. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One way I can think of is, use a string array of some max length. Read the file until end of file and keep filling the array with the line read and keep counting the number of rows.<br />
<br />
Now, you can use a for/while loop to read the filled array in reverse order.</div></div><hr />

Another option is you could create a table and read each row and load it into the table, using an index number.  Then do a select with order by descending.  Or another way is to look at seq.seek() and see if you can use it.  I think maybe if it is a fixed length type file you could use the number of bytes in the row and just keep moving up the file using the from end-of-file mode.</div></div><hr />
