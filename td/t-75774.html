<br />
However, I've observed that is does not work as one would expect.  Before.save.object and after.save.object work as expected.  When  record (X) is updated by user, then those hooks are correctly called --- for record X,  but continue debugging, hook after.commit.transaction is finally called, but for record W  ( the first record displayed on the form (top)  ).  Record X was #2 <br />
<br />
Note,  form type 3 grid.  I expect the hook is designed to be called generally but it makes no sense.  I suppose the work-around is to use synchronized dialogue with detail session, but I don't want to.<br />
<br />
Any comments or advice?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
