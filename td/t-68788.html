<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dullawolf</div><div class="date">5th April 2016, 22:34</div></div><div class="posttext">So here's the skinny. There is a user in our company that cant view part of his BOM Tree (Picture attached and missing area circled.) I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software and that hasn't fixed the issue. So he will log into another users computer and the issue follows him. When he logs off, the person who's computer he logged into is infected with the same error. <br />
<br />
I scoured through registry settings, program files, program data, local app data and whatever else my house the data for baan. I have been unable to get that missing portion of data back. I am at my wits end and now i am seeking the help of the baanboard. Any help or suggestions will be great. <br />

We are using Infor Baan Client 7.7</div></div><hr />

Not really sure where this post would best be.  My SWAG would be it is something with the user or maybe when they generate that view - is it in a table or temp file somewhere when this is view is generated?  Not something we have on our system.</div></div><hr />

Mark, If it is with the user, it isn't generating anything that would show otherwise. I am not the one that manages the baan software, that guy can't figure it out either. I wonder if I can see something within the user's created profile that may be causing the issue.</div></div><hr />

Here is the kicker tho, the issue i am having only follows one user around and his profile infects other profiles with this bug. Someone well be able to see their entire table, but if he logs into baan on their computer, they will start having the same issue he is having. <br />
<br />
I appreciate your reply. Unfortunately tho, i am not one who programs this stuff. I dont even know how to use the program. I am hardware support for a company and i have good troubleshooting stills and somehow i got roped into this mess. <br />
<br />
 I am sure i can make an attempt to figure it out. What program do you use to edit baan? SCITE?</div></div><hr />
