We need to increase from 30 to 80 characters the Description Field located in the ITEM - GENERAL Table.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to do that ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">22nd October 2008, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You have 2 ways to do so:<br />
<br />
1) by changing the definition of tcdsca, increasing to 80 chars the description<br />
2) by defining a new domain, say tcdsca.c and linking to the item description.<br />
<br />
If you choose option 1 the disavantage is that all the fields that have tcdsca will be increasing to 80 chars.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We just need to increase the size of the Description field as described above to 80 characters.<br />
<br />
Shall be perfect if we can do so with a simple modification.<br />
<br />
What do you think of it ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">23rd October 2008, 10:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The changes are simple, but requires some use of tools. Seems from your question you never used yet, so I can resume all the steps:<br />
<br />
1) Have you already a custom PVRC?<br />
2) If yes, have an user with customization authorizations and is positioned on this VRC?<br />
3) If yes to both, you have to go to maintain domains, create a new domain, says tcdsca.c with 80 chars.<br />
4) Then go in maintain tables, copy tcibd001 to the current PVRC and change the domain of tcdsca with tcdsca.c<br />
6) Run convert to RTDD<br />
7) Compile every session in which there is dsca<br />
8) Go in every report on which there is dsca and do the necessary changes to the layouts, then compile them</div></div><hr />

<br />
No we don't use PVRC because we never did any dev. on it...<br />
<br />
The company working with us don't want to do any modification on the software, saying it is impossible!<br />
<br />
What do you think of that ?<br />
<br />
Do you think i can increase the size of the field by myself?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

As Zardoz says - nope.  <br />
<br />
Of course you can always pay infor to make the changes for you.  And for a fee I am sure they will support it going forward.</div></div><hr />
