<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th June 2011, 06:15</div></div><div class="posttext">It is based off the index so there is not a lot that can be done with it.  At least in 4c4 the best I found was to create an index with what I wanted or to skip fields on the find that, by default, were empty.  Exactly what are you looking to do with the find?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">13th June 2011, 20:11</div></div><div class="posttext">find.data actually refreshes &amp; displays latest values of current record based on current index values . And there is def.find which lets u search &amp;  display records based in key values input by users. Both these sections has before.choice and after.choice sub sections where developers can write their own code to do something different.<br />
<br />
If  u want to do something drastically different from what def.find does , u may use a user choices to accomplish the objective rather than trying to work around with def.find.</div></div><hr />
