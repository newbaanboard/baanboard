<br />
After a bit work in Baan IV tools I started to make fun with BaaN ERP. On start I have some maybe stupid questions:<br />
- does session generator really generate only dynamic sessions (field is marked and greyed out)<br />
- why after generation session does not work - message &quot;cannot start session&quot;)<br />
- why after generation dynamic form is empty?<br />
I think i am missin something important.<br />
<br />
And most important : are there any tools to migrate form Baan IV to ERP mot with data , but with self developed customizations like new tables, sessions, forms, reports ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dynamic forms get created empty, and you need to go to the Dynamic Form Editor to place even the basic table fields on the form before it will run.  There is a button called add all table fields or some such that will put all the main table fields on the form.  It won't run directly after generation.<br />
<br />
Why is your Dynamic option always checked?  I don't know.  Mine is checked by default, but I can change it.  Perhaps you need an updated tools patch...?  What service pack are you running on?<br />
<br />
As for moving your own customizations from IV to V - there is no tool but &quot;Export Data Dictionary&quot; from Baan IV and &quot;Import Data Dictionary&quot; in Baan V.  The 2 versions should be compatible.  You can run the printouts &quot;Print Components in Package VRC&quot; to find out what is custom on IV.  You then need to upgrade them by hand to the Baan V environment (ie, new table names, etc.).<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

ttadv2900m000 - Convert Session to Dynamic.<br />
<br />
It converts all the Static forms to the dynamic forms.</div></div><hr />
