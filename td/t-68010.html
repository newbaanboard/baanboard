I guess you can't delete the record. If you unlink the address code from the masters, the record will be removed automatically.<br />
<br />
e.g If BP X has address A and B.<br />
<br />
If you replace address B in masters (Sold To, Ship To ... Roles) it will delete the record of B from tccom133. But the standard won't allow you to delete the record as this address has a reference in other tables.</div></div><hr />
