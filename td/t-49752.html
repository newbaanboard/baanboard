It has its own unique key. I would very much like that to be the key in Baan.<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can disable the series ? I know programmically I should be able to , but very much like to control it with parameters, settings etc<br />
We run 5.2a but believe it is similar in LN<br />
<br />
Grateful for any assistance<br />

We already have loads of records generated by the FFN. now external records have their own numbers which I want to have as the key.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">28th March 2008, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, First Free numbers cannot be disabled - the concept is embedded (at least in BAAN IV) in all the Order Type documents. You can, however, choose (at least in BAAN IV) between &quot;No Series&quot;, &quot;One Digit Series&quot;, or &quot;Two Digit Series&quot;, taking an example from Purchase Order Parameters.<br />
<br />
The other assumption is that your document number is numeric and sequential starting from some start number.<br />
<br />
If you were lucky enough to have chosen &quot;No Series&quot; in your parameters, and you do not have any data yet in the system, then you just have to load the data, and then adjust the First Free Number to the maximum document number loaded. <br />
<br />
It becomes more complicated if you have chosen other than &quot;No Series&quot;.<br />
<br />
It would be even more difficult to recommend a process where you already have data in the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">1st April 2008, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I did something like this in 4c4, I was loading data via exchange. Initially I had a condition script that looked up the first free number for a specific series then used that number to create the number and then updated the first free number table. But I later changed it so the external program created the number. So that the number series I used in my program couldn't be used in Baan, in the first free number session I changed that series to be blocked for input. If the data is loaded externally to baan then the block on the series just stops it from being used in a baan session. But your external application generating the data will have to take care of any duplication of the series number. The best way to start this is to create a specific order series for the external application. Block this series and then configure the external application to use this order series.</div></div><hr />
