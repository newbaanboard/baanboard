<br />
I wrote a program script that uses the command server2client several times..<br />
<br />
When I run my program on BW it works fine but when I run it on Webtop it hangs on the second call of server2client.<br />
<br />
Here is the first call of server2client in my script, the one that works,<br />
rt = server2client(WORK1_PATH&amp;&quot;/file1.txt&quot;, &quot;file1.txt&quot;, 0)<br />
<br />
This is the second call, the one that hangs,<br />
rt = server2client(WORK2_PATH&amp;&quot;/file2.txt&quot;, LOCAL_PATH&amp;&quot;\file2.txt&quot;, 0)<br />
<br />
WORK1_PATH and WORK2_PATH are both paths on the server.<br />
LOCAL_PATH = E:\Documents and Settings\user1\Local Settings\Temp<br />
<br />
What could cause server2client to hang ?<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

Thanks for your reply... <br />

have you tried the debugger to see if the expanded path variables fit - so is the length of your declared variables ok?<br />

I checked that already. It's not it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd August 2007, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I have never see server2client hang - I have seen it not work, but never hang. Does this rt = server2client(WORK2_PATH&amp;&quot;/file2.txt&quot;, LOCAL_PATH&amp;&quot;\file2.txt&quot;, 0) hang even without the other server2client statement?  I am also curious why you use 0 instead of 1 for the last argument - I always use 1 for text mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lvdvelde</div><div class="date">23rd August 2007, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">As a matter of fact I have the same problem.<br />
<br />
This works (the path variables have fixed paths):<br />
<br />
function send.report.to.client(const string src(),<br />
			  const string dest(),<br />
			  long mode)<br />
{<br />
        long err<br />
<br />
        err = server2client(src, dest, mode)<br />
        if (err) then<br />
            message(&quot;Error %d copying file to PC (may not have permission)&quot;,  <br />
                err)<br />
        endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
And this doesn't work (in the WebTop client):<br />
<br />
        e = server2client(prog.name$ &amp; &quot;_&quot; &amp; str$(comp) &amp; &quot;.xml&quot;,<br />
        &quot;${TEMP}\&quot; &amp; prog.name$ &amp; &quot;_&quot; &amp; str$(comp) &amp; &quot;.xml&quot;, 0, 0)<br />
<br />
Note that one of the path variables is relative, by using ${TEMP}.<br />
<br />
In the Java console I think I see the problem related to this:<br />
<br />
network: Cache entry not found [url: http://baanwebtop.intravialis.nl:81/webtop/servlet/com.ssaglobal.erp.servlet.FileTransferServlet?method=downloadFile&amp;dialogTitle=&amp;serverFile=/app/bse/tmp/tmp079640145&amp;textMode=FALSE&amp;clientFile=$%7BTEMP%7D%5Crtpppco475110081_120.html&amp;readOnly=FALSE&amp;toOrFromBaanServer=TRUE&amp;size=167333, version: null]<br />
<br />
Error, could not open ${TEMP}\rtpppco475110081_120.html for read/write access<br />
<br />
... so I think the problem is caused by the ${TEMP} part in the path variable.<br />
<br />

<br />
don't mention the difference in html/xml extension, this is another part of the same script. I didn't copy the corresponding section from the Java Console, but the error message is there. Sorry for that!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lvdvelde</div><div class="date">23rd August 2007, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I was right, when I change ${TEMP} into &quot;c:\temp\&quot; the problem is fixed. Conclusion: server2client definitely does work in WebTop, but you have to use fixed paths!<br />

LOCAL_PATH = &quot;E:\Docume~1\user1\Local ~1\Temp&quot;<br />
<br />
otherwise, first try if it works to LOCAL_PATH = &quot;c:\temp&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe you have to strip LOCAL_PATH with strip$(LOCAL_PATH)<br />
You must be able to see what's wrong with the debugger.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiba_t</div><div class="date">23rd August 2007, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I already tried LOCAL_PATH= &quot;c:&quot; and it works.<br />
<br />
But when I try to copy to temp path with &quot;~&quot; or without it (I mean with full path) it doesn't work on webtop but works on BW. <br />
<br />
As you know there's no debugging option on webtop !!! So I tried to write some information to a file to know where exactly it hangs and that's when I found out that it hangs on this server2client command.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before in my original post my code works fine on BW my problem is only on webtop. <br />
<br />
Please help !!</div></div><hr />

Also, server2client() will definitely hang if the session is run as a job using start.job, since there is no concept of a 'client' then - have to use FTP to transfer the file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOCAL_PATH variable contains some spaces. But could these spaces be the cause of it to hang ?<br />

It's definitely not a job.</div></div><hr />
