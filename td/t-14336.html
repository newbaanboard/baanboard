I have made a new session where i have 6 multi-occ view fields . i have put epcom003.orno on single occurance view field and epcom003.pono on multioccurance field. i'm able to insert and delete the data but when i do the searching or scrolling its showing nothing in the multi-occ. fields. but i'm able to scroll through single occurance view fields. when i change epcom003.pono to single occurance the i can scroll through the data but one at a time. it is not showing corrosponding epcom003.pono of epcom003.orno at one time. please guide me how to solve this problem.<br />

The index should contain epcom003.orno as the first field of the index.  Is there a script with this session?<br />

Thanks for replying. I have set the index in the same order as they are appearing on the form with epcom003.orno on the top. since pono is appearing on the multi-occ field so i have kept it in the last in the indices. Script is also there but just to iterate the pono and orno and nothing else. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th January 2004, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">You may want to try removing the script and just let Baan control it to start with.  Have you tried that?  You really do not need a script for a simple maintain multi-occurance session.  You may also want to try deleting the session, form or script and run the generate session(ttadv2290m000) on the table in question to regenerate the session. Or run the generate session and create a new session to compare to your session.<br />
<br />
I am assuming your form looks something like this:<br />
<br />
epcom003.orno  xxxxxx    <br />
<br />
<br />
epcom003.pono  keyfield3  keyfield4  field5 field6<br />
XXXXXXXXXXX     XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXX  XXXX    XXXX<br />
XXXXXXXXXXX     XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXX  XXXX    XXXX<br />
<br />
Where orno is single occurance and all the rest are multi-occurence. When you click on find it should contain all of your index parts in it(orno,pono,keyfield3,keyfield4).  Does yours?<br />
<br />
Another thing you may want to try is create RDD on the form and session.  Once or twice before I had to do that to get the new form or reports.<br />
<br />
More thoughts than I am allowed for a day.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

If it was table or session permissions I would expect you to get some errors.  Since you do not mention any errors I assume they have permissions to session, tables and forms.  The only thing I can think of is to create RDD to make sure that it is current.  Is the user in the same company and VRC?  I am drawing a blank on this right now.<br />
<br />
Also could you please post what was the actual solution?  It may help someone else solve the same problem.<br />

Also could you please post what was the actual solution <br />
 - Well it was a my mistake. in the script, to iterate the position no, i used before.field instead of before.input. thats why it was not showing any record in multi-occ. fields. <br />
<br />
Is the user in the same company and VRC ? <br />
 - Yeah, the users are in the same company and vrc. i have not set any authorizations so far on this particular table. i tried by copying  the session and table to upper vrc. and try using another super user's login but still no use. <br />
its not showing any error also. If anyone have any clue or any wild guess about what this problem could be, please please help me out.<br />

Can you logon as the other superuser and go look at the table in table maintenance?  Do you see data?  What happens when you step thru the script in debug mode for this other user?<br />
