<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KBacca</div><div class="date">4th February 2011, 05:00</div></div><div class="posttext">OK - I'm developing a report and I needed an SQL select coded to get records from the tfgld106 table (Finalized Transactions).<br />
<br />
I originally wrote my SQL query as:<br />
<br />
<br />
select tfgld106.*<br />
from   tfgld106<br />
where<br />
         tfgld106.leac INRANGE {:leac.f} and {:leac.t}	 <br />
   and tfgld106.fyer INRANGE {:fyer.f} and {:fyer.t}   <br />
   and tfgld106.fprd INRANGE {:fprd.f} and {:fprd.t}     <br />
<br />
Where the leac.f/leac.t is the General Ledger Acct # range (From/To)<br />
               fyer.f/fyer.t is the Fiscal Year Range (From/To)<br />
               fprd.f/fprd.t is the Fiscal Period Range (From/To)<br />
<br />
<br />
This worked just fine until we hit 2011 and when the report is run with a range like:    <br />
<br />
Fiscal Year   FROM: 2010     TO: 2011<br />
Fiscal Period FROM:    10      TO:     1<br />
<br />
Obviously my SQL didn't account for this because of the Fiscal Period Range.<br />
<br />
So - I modified the SQL to the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
select tfgld106.*<br />
from   tfgld106<br />
where<br />
         tfgld106.leac INRANGE {:leac.f} and {:leac.t}	 <br />
   and (tfgld106.fyer &gt;= :fyer.f and tfgld106.fprd &gt;= :fprd.f )   <br />
   and (tfgld106.fyer &lt;= :fyer.t and tfgld106.frpd &lt;= :fprd.t) <br />
<br />
<br />
For some reason - this Select Statement didn't return any rows - which I'm sure are there.<br />
<br />
Can anyone see something I'm not doing right?   <br />
Does anyone have any suggestions or comments?<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the logic in the SQL looks right....<br />
It's been a long day and I'm afraid my mind is scattered right now...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your First Select Query is Correct, the only thing that has to be taken care of is your Fiscal Period Range..<br />
<br />
Fiscal Period Range has to be in Ascending Order and not descending ...<br />
<br />
Fiscal Period Range : 1 to 10 - Correct<br />
and<br />
Fiscal Period Range : 10 to 1 - Incorrect<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">4th February 2011, 07:17</div></div><div class="posttext">To make this work for multi-year queries, you would need to make the &quot;and&quot; between the two parenthetical statements into an &quot;or&quot;.  However, that then causes an issue when you are doing a single year query.<br />
<br />
You could do an if statement &quot;if fprd.t &gt; fprd.f then&quot; and execute the statement for the particular situation, but if you have a lot in your selectdo, that needs to be duplicated and that could get to be ugly code.  Trying to think of a way to do this in a single select.  I'll update if I think of something.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

This Query worked very nicely!   <br />
<br />
Did just what I was describing!   <br />
<br />
And it looks like all 3 of you read this replied within minutes of each other.<br />
Again Many Many THanks!</div></div><hr />
