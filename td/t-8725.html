To do so, you will either need the source, find a consulting partner that has the source code, or (in some situations) use a tool that allows customizations without having the source code (for example, RMCgen or QKey).<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">REETA1967</div><div class="date">5th February 2003, 04:43</div></div><div class="posttext">please write in details about RMCgen or QKey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">5th February 2003, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">RMCgen and QKey both allow you to modify (to some extent) the functionality of Baan program scripts, libraries, etc.  It would take a while to fully explain, but let me give a program script example.  In the program script, there are sections of code for all of the various form fields and actions.  Using these programs, you can add new sections, add new code before or after the standard Baan code for a section, remove the Baan code for a section, etc.  What you can't do without knowing the Baan code is pick and choose which lines of standard Baan code within a section you want to execute.  I hope that makes sense.<br />
<br />
With that said, these tools can be extermely powerful.  For more information on RMCgen, you can go the RMCis web site (http://www.rmcis.com) .  QKey is made by FullScope.</div></div><hr />
