When inserting a before layout I often forget to unmark the new page option in the layout details. It may be simple as this ore its a page length problem. Are you using skip.to() in the report scripts? When skipt.to() places the printing position near the end of the page and a layout is used which extends the range (using to many lines in the layout) the result may look strange. But I can't remeber, whether I had empty pages printed linked to such errors or not.</div></div><hr />
