<br />
I am a Finance guy and very much interested in learning tools (majorly development) My tools guy is too too tied up to teach me (though he can just give tiny tips now and then)<br />
<br />
But is there any way to learn tools systematically?<br />
<br />
I generated my own session (simple one, based upon a single table). Then went through the p.script, made some modification here and there, fairly well... but I dont know how to put specific actions/logics into the script. Where can I get a list of standard functions, their uses, and examples how to use them...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
That aside - go into the wiki attached to the board and look through the programmers manual.  It sounds like you got the first step over with and can move on with things that are a little harder.  I think most of what you will need is covered in the wiki's programmers manual. And if you still have tools questions just come on back and create a new thread.  Of course I do recommend searching this forum first - never know when you might find the exact answer to your question.<br />

Good luck!<br />
