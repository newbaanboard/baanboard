<br />
Attached please find herewith the screen shot of a barcode report. Barcode is getting printed correctly, when the report is triggered from BW, but it is printed junk when it is in preview in LN UI. May you please help?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">28th February 2017, 11:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Please check KB 1858850. You need to check the requirements of printing barcodes with LNUI. <br />
There are some other problems mention in Infors's KB worth checking: <br />
KB 1889630 PDF Barcode: CODE128 (Type 10) Barcode cannot be read by the scanner<br />
KB 1889631 PDF Barcode: barcodes cannot display the full unicode range<br />
KB 1867362 Barcodes are not printed in PDF<br />
KB 1868590 Barcode print: different behaviour with device D and PDF in LNUI<br />
<br />
KB 1858850 PDF barcodes tweak guide for LN UI (PDF barcode printing)<br />
<br />
I did collect this KBs because where migrating an LN FP6 Server to LN 10.5 right now. Barcode printing is something we still have to check. (But we've already updated with the latest available LNUI last week. So think it will already work.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks you very much for your help. We are using QR Code in which we are using the script in the report as following:<br />
<br />
	#define BC.TYPE.C  1010                    |barcode type QR Code 2D<br />
	#define BC.HEIGHT.C  2                     |barcode height<br />
	#define BC.MODE.C  0x000c80                |barcode mode byte<br />
<br />
barcode_pdno = bc$(BC.TYPE.C, BC.HEIGHT.C, tisfc001.pdno, BC.MODE.C)<br />
<br />
I have gone through the attached file, but not being able to realize where/how to use those script?<br />
<br />
Please advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">28th February 2017, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know barcodes are now usable when printing into a pdf file. (It is possible to configure preview to use pdf.)<br />
When using LNUI pdfs are generated using a java library. Well, there's in fact a java directory existing in every LN $BSE directory. If you take a look at its files, you'll find some TXT files dealing with pdfs and properties.<br />
<br />
You'll find a copy of your attached file in $BSE\java (PDF-BAR-Codes-Guides.txt)<br />
<br />
This file explains: &quot;The bar codes can be adjusted/tweaked via the PDF.properties file.&quot;<br />
The file PDF.properties is presented in the $BSE\java directory also. So I think Infor is telling us, to modify the given file PDF.properties.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried this, because printing barcodes did work fine today. (We performed a test just some hours ago.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bumbaermail</div><div class="date">28th February 2017, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much. May I request you to send the PDF.properties file? May I also request you send the script of report in which Barcode is working properly?<br />

Thanks for your help once again.</div></div><hr />

Used an other printer today (windows server printer using bwprint.exe on our printserver) and the outcome is indeed different.<br />
<br />
The may be readable, but the scaling is completely different. Let's say it's around 18cm in the created pdf and around 6cm in the printout. The barcode was readable when using barcode type 9 and 10, when scanning the short version printed with bwprint.exe on the printserver (didn't test other types).<br />
<br />
I tried modifying PDF.properties with some new parameters. It didn't work (I could not see any effect.) Even the given example did not change anything.<br />

left-margin=1.5<br />
right-margin=1.5<br />
top-margin=1.5<br />

I will contact our support partner. Maybe we'll create an incident on InforXtreme.com.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it should be in <br />
&lt;LNUI install Dir&gt;/web/WEB-INF/lib<br />
<br />
Both the folders have independent properties files.<br />
<br />
PS: bc$() is not needed if you are using java4less classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klesch</div><div class="date">2nd March 2017, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much once again. Attached please find herewith the output of the barcode report from BWPrint and LN UI. I have already reported an incident to Infor and still awaiting for the feedback from them.<br />
<br />
On 14th February 2017 I got a feedback from Xtreme that barcode problems in LN UI will be solved in LN UI 12.0.3. The solution is published and becomes available for customers when generic defect 572996 is completed. Planned resolution date is 31st March 2017. I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bumbaermail</div><div class="date">3rd March 2017, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">But, here the bar codes are little wide. Do you know how can the width of bar code be reduced? I have tried to get it done through PDF.properties file. But, it is not impacting at all</div></div><hr />

Well, that exactly what I've been observing. I created ticket at our support partner and are still awaiting feedback. <br />
I think it will present the same solution as mentioned by klesch: update to latest LNUI, when it will be available at end of march. <br />
<br />
So I think I will be wailing, till the new LNUI version will be released. It may take some additional time to install the new LNUI. If it's installed, we'll see if PDF-properties is working properly or not.<br />
<br />
It may be helpful, if you open a ticket at Infor (or your support partner), too. So Infor will see, there's something going on. :D</div></div><hr />
