<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">14th October 2022, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I have added CDFs to table and same can be seen using GTM; The fields are also visible on session under tab 'Configurable Fields' but am unable to move those fields (in personalization) to other tabs(forms/groups) The session is tpppc4540m000. <br />
<br />
Any advice appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">17th October 2022, 01:27</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem has been solved by me using the arrow keys to move across and not using the 'drag and drop' method. But in another environment (same in all aspects), both methods are not moving CDFs across forms.<br />
Looks like something is struck beneath and there is no interactive message at all. and cant find any log either</div></div><hr />

I have also added CDF fields and was able to move them to the right place for me. I could pick them up from the &quot;Configurable Fields&quot; tab and drop them on one of the other tabs to open that tab and then put the field down somewhere.</div></div><hr />
