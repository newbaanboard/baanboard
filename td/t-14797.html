<br />
In purchase company I use the session tfacp0100m000 and on form 3 there is a field tfacp000.ttyp (Transaction type code).<br />
<br />
When I read invoice from the supplier using EDI, I wont to achieve the following:<br />
<br />
- in case of normal order (invoice), there should be Transaction<br />
  type &quot;NOR&quot;<br />
- in case of backorder (credit note), there shoud be Transaction<br />
  type &quot;BAC&quot;<br />
<br />
How can I do this, since there is only one option in<br />
ACP parameters, like i state on beginning?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incoming EDI messages (especially for sales orders) have an order type conversion in the 'Maintain EDI Messages Supported by Relations'. Perhaps, if you try two different records in this session, for your supplier relation, with different order types, it might work.<br />
<br />
If not, then I belive the library that is used, to generate incoming purchase invoices, is tfacpdll1250. You will need to amend this library, so that the different transaction types can be handled. You will still need two different incoming EDI order types, to diferentiate between the normal and credit invoices. Then the library can have a mapping to the correct ACP transaction type, depending on what EDI order type has come through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I allready tried order type conversion to no avail.<br />
So I guess that customizing DLL is the only solution.<br />

<br />
for 810IN is'nt tdpscdll4288 DLL used?<br />
<br />
I have been looking at the functioning of the 810IN EDI functionality and trying to anser some questions I had. I had come across some information which mentioned tdpscdll4288 as the dll used. I will also check the library you mentioned.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you could help me with figuring out that if we run the 810IN function, would the system actually process and automatically match (assuming the data matches with the PO/receipt details) and Approve the invoice after having created an finance batch and loaded the transactions. (Although will remain non finalized).<br />
<br />
Is this the funtionality when processing the 810IN? or does the 810IN only load the data into a batch and transaction and we have to go thru individual transactions to automatically or manually match the transactions.<br />
Id there a set-up/parameter to contol the option to only load and not goahead with the auto matching (if automatching existed.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Appreciate if you could give me some insight into this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
