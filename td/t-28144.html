<br />
We no longer can call unix shell scripts, so we have a .bat file that was created in place fo the shell script.  I've written a wrapper type program in Baan to call the .bat, but the command doesn't seem to work for me.  I've tried using app.start (this give me a unresolved reference error when compiling) and run.prog (nothing seems to even happen when I used this command).  Possibly, I have something coded incorrectly.  I tried to use a few of the threads I found that were related, but I can't seem to get mine to work.  <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated....<br />

This is basically the jist of my script.  I'm not sure if I need the #pragma part any longer (had it when I was trying app.start).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">13th September 2006, 02:22</div></div><div class="posttext">couple of things to try <br />
<br />
run.prog(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;, &quot;cmd /c e:\baan\flexfab\bin\ChangePW.bat&quot;, RP_NOWAIT)<br />
<br />
also run.prog runs on the server (I think) so I assume that e:\ is a local disk on the baan server and not a mapped drive on the client otherwise it doesn't have a path to the bat file.<br />
<br />
there are also a lot of security settings in windows 2000/2003 that could cause you a problem as the user account that runs the session may not have the rights to run a bat file on the server. try it with a user that has atleast local admin rights on the baan box to test. there is a security policy that controls what users can logon as a batch job this maybe causing the problem if it works for a user with local admin rights try adding the users you want to run the session to the logon as batch job security setting (you are potentially opening a hole in the server security by doing that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where is your batch file located? On the client/server?<br />
<br />
If it is on the client PC you should use app_start(). Read about it here:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_client_file_access_app_start<br />
<br />
You should define the right library in your declaration like this:<br />
#pragma        used dll ottdllbw<br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />
