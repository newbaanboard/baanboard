<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">3rd July 2003, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume you are talking about the font that is displayed in the input form fields.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the font is derived from the client.  From memory, I believe the BW client uses regular Courier Font (size 11 or 12 pt?), and as you mentioned, unless you're a hawk you can not tell the difference between a zero (0) and a capital oh (O) with that font.<br />
<br />
One method that I have employed for clients in the past who absolutely needed to tell the difference because they regular used item numbers with oh's and zeros was to edit the standard Courier font.   I editted the font and placed a normal dot in the middle of the zero so you could tell the difference between the zero and capital oh.   That font then needs to be installed on the client machine in place of the old courier font.  It is not hard, but needs to be done on each client.  You can also run Baan using a different font in the background, e.g. Times or Book Antiqua.  You should use a proportional font.  Neither of those fonts look that great to me.<br />
<br />
One con of editting the courier font, is that if you use any other program on the PC, that 0 with size 11 (or 12) will have a dot in the middle of it - but I prefer that anyway (e.g. if you're using Word or something).<br />
<br />
I don't have the font handy, but if you want it PM me (don't have it handy on this laptop) and I'll look for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andrea</div><div class="date">10th July 2003, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have tried changing my font on the BW Configuration, but the only place I can see the change is in the help text.  I need it to show the change in the form fields on a display session.  Also, I don't want to change the font size, but rather a different font where users can easily tell the difference between the number zero (0) and the capital letter &quot;O&quot;.  The BW Configuration doesn't seem to make the change where I  need it to, unless I am just missing something.  <br />
<br />
I also tried to play with different fonts on my display properties (right - clicking desktop).  Nothing seemed to make a difference with actual form fields on a session.  (Only the title bar, menu, etc.)<br />
<br />
If anyone has any other input, I would appreciate.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Andrea - reread my post!<br />
<br />
Probably you should copy that courier font to something else on the client.  Call it &quot;Andrea&quot; font or something - edit it to make the difference between the oh and zero,   save this font in a file and deploy it wherever needed on any client,  and then when running the client put the command.  <br />
<br />
-- -set FONT=&quot;ANDREA&quot;<br />
<br />
PM me if you need more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shriram</div><div class="date">9th May 2006, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the same thing. I tried changing the font on the BW client to &quot;WST_Engl&quot;. But it does not show up the difference between zeros and ohs. Not sure if I am missing something. <br />
<br />
I also copied the font to another font name and tried using it by command set option, but it did not seem to work. <br />
<br />
My OS is XP and we have baan 5c on windows 2003. Let me know if you have other ways of doing it. Thanks for your help and support. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shriram</div><div class="date">9th May 2006, 23:54</div></div><div class="posttext">NP, I could get it to work as per ur suggestion. You are correct, on Baan 5 onwards, it seems like it only uses the MENU fonts set on the users desktop. One cannot override it in the BW configuration. The FONT tab and the -- -set FONT also does not override the user desktop setting. <br />
