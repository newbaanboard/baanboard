<br />
Has anybody created Help Topics for user-defined sessions (ERP 5.0c / Win2000)? I can't find anything in the Tools Help or Programmers' Guide on the subject. <br />
<br />
There are some Tools sessions (e.g. ttadv8240m000 &quot;Generate Help Topics&quot;) but I'm not quite sure how to go through the process of writing some text, &quot;converting&quot; it to Help-format and finally viewing it online after pressing the &quot;Help&quot; button in my session.<br />
<br />
Any help ;) greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">25th February 2003, 02:54</div></div><div class="posttext">This is how I would do 'Session Help' in BAAN IVc (I would think the same should apply for BAAN ERP):<br />
<br />
- Copy the session to the current VRC.<br />
- Click &lt;Text&gt;<br />
- You are asked which type of help you wish to create (Session Help, Technical Note, etc.) Choose Session Help<br />
- Assuming that no help already exists, it will ask if you wish to create text (or copy or select, etc.) Chose &lt;Create&gt;.<br />
- It then asks for a text group. Assuming you have declared a text group 'text' for session and other such help, type in the group 'text'<br />
- It then opens up the text editor and off you go describing what you need.<br />
<br />
After you are done saving the help, run the session to create Run Time for Help for just the session. Exit BSHELL, restart and start your session and you should be able to bring up the help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply! - OK, after digging around and calling Baan Support, I see that it's mostly the same procedure in Baan5 IF you want to create ASCII help only. <br />
<br />
Creating Windoze Help for BaanV is somewhat more complex - if and when I actually get around to creating some (assuming I can ;) ) , I'll put together a short guide on how-to  - for all the folks back home...</div></div><hr />
