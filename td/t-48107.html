When we have process any report through WIN device, it is not showing the related WIN at all. This problem has been occurring on only one PC (Client).  Also I have checked that related temporary file in baan \ tmp location is not created. <br />
<br />
Pl. suggest as soon as possible.<br />

First thing comes in my mind is that<br />
Did you check user permissions on windows side. If it is OK did you try with different login into windows and try to get report. According to these we can think other possibilities.<br />
