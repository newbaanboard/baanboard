<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy2609</div><div class="date">11th June 2021, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing a process that creates an output file on the $BSE and want to limit it to a certain size (5MB), before closing it and continuing with writing to a new file.<br />
<br />
I have tried using both stat.info() and stat info(), but both return size zero whilst the file is still open.  Once the file is closed, stat.info() returns the size correctly, but the point is that I want to keep writing to the file until it reaches 5MB, then close it and open a new one.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what function can be used to check the current size of a file whilst it is still open (active file pointer with seq.open) and being written to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">11th June 2021, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the function - seq.tell() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_directory_file_operations_seq_tell)<br />
Just be aware - Before calling seq.tell(), always call seq.flush() after you have written to the file with seq.write().</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes sense to use seq.flush() to write the assembled data to the file first, but does this only apply if seq.write() has been used to write to the file?<br />
<br />
If seq.puts() has been used to write data to the file, does this still apply, or does seq.write() have to be used instead of seq.puts(), in order to be able to use seq.tell()?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">15th June 2021, 00:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you still have to use the seq.flush() to write the file to the desk from the memory buffers of the Operating System. <br />
<br />
Refer to - <br />
seq.close()<br />
Syntax:<br />
function long seq.close  (long fp)<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
This flushes the buffers associated with the specified file and closes the file. fp is the file pointer returned by seq.open() when the file was opened. Buffers allocated by the standard i/o system are also flushed and closed. These actions are performed automatically when the process exits. <br />
<br />
<br />
Arguments<br />
long fp fp is the file pointer returned by seq.open() when the file was opened. . <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Return values<br />
0 Success. <br />
-1 Error. Probably fp not connected. (the last system error is available in the e variable - for example, for file system full, e will be ENOSPC (that is, 28) - for a list of error codes, see Infor ES errors and messages)  <br />
 <br />
Context<br />
This function is implemented in the porting set and can be used in all script types.</div></div><hr />
