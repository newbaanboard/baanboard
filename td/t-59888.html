<br />
I have a scenario, where in i need to display Current running time / clock. I did this Using Interrupts Section (with set timer of 10 secs). But now due to this, when interrupt is executed every 10 secs, its intervening the normal user Input in the form. Is there a way to avoid this? So that interrupt functions in the background or User input is not disturbed. <br />
<br />
Your response is highly appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thx <br />

Thanks for your response. I did the same way to reduce the instances. But though the issue is reduced , but still not satisfied by users :) <br />

Instead of using a normal form field for displaying current time, you can try to introduce a field using dscfield() function. This function puts a field on form Even if it is not a part of form design. Try to visit help file for all the dsc* functions. May be you could find some way to refresh time without interrupting user operation. <br />
<br />
If you are using a normal form field or a table field for displaying time, then there may not be appropriate event section, which you can use to refresh time-field.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply. Even the Dsc field creates an object and it needs to be changed on regular intervals to have a running time, this again i tried using interrupts, but the same thing. <br />
<br />
For now as George said, i have made it to 60 secs as the time interval. <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
How about running a new application that should show the time/clock?<br />
<br />
This new application (ex: Visual Basic Executable) can be, as the windows task manager, always on top of every other window so that the user can see it. You can customize it as you want.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

Good one. Didnt think of this option. I will have a go with separate clock. <br />
