I have a little query. I want to generate power consumption report for my industry. Their requirement is that they want Workcentrewise powerconsumption report on daily basis. Each dayz reading is being entered regularly. I have to write a code to find the difference between each dayz reading for each work centre and display them. They also want a cumulative consumption report for each month.<br />
<br />
Please neone suggest me .. how do i go about it.<br />

<br />
To tell you in brief, i had developed a form for entering day to day readings, One more form which constituted of the equipment master where the list of machines with their workcentre was defined. <br />
Using these as the base i had developed a seesion for power consumption report where in i send each record from the session to the report and there by clubbed it according to the Workcentre by using after.field in the report layout.<br />
The calculation for cumulative consumption was done in the report script itself.<br />
<br />
Hope this is more clearer now.<br />
