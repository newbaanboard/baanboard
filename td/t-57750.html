<br />
Hello all,<br />
<br />
first of all you have to know which part(s) you have to be &quot;compliant&quot; with:<br />
<br />
CFR (Code of Federal regulations) title 21 contains the whole food and drug act. It has many different parts, as for example part 820 - quality systems regulation, or part 11 - electronic records/electronic signatures...<br />
<br />
The &quot;out-of-the-box-system&quot; (baan) itself can not be compliant like you may need compliance in your company (also if it is perhaps sold like that - I don't know). <br />
<br />
You always have to look at your processes which should be computerized with baan, which regulative requirement, norms and guidelines applies to it, and then normally you have to validate the system as a whole.<br />
<br />
If you are in the pharmaceutical or medical industry, you should know how to proceed ...<br />
<br />
In our company we have validated the ERP Ln system according to the specific european and american (fda) guidelines - therefor we can say we are compliant with the above mentioned, and for our company applicable parts...<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />
