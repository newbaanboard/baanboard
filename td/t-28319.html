Unfortunatly you could do a lot with text color/blinking etc on the ascii mode that you cannot do on the Grey GUI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to source code posted by Rupert in the thread - Anyone for a game of BaanNibbles (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9470) This has code which has similar functionality of ttdskcs. You have to explore more based on your requirement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th October 2006, 00:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I see - not ASCII.  You would have to build your own screens using 3gl.  <br />
Note:  this is NOT what they did for Color Changer, that's a different method.  You could not color the current standard screens using that stuff, just create your own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 It was a good thread , but they are not using the ttdskcs , instead they are using create.object() functions itself and pass the color parameters in it<br />

I think so nija. I believe it should be possible in Baan not using by only objects. AFAIK Nazdag did it. I don't know they used object or not ?. Anyway, I will wait others knowledge on this useful thread. <br />
<br />
Thanks alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What NPRao has posted is a great example on how to work with this function and how to handle the form. <br />
You can also read the example in the link that I have posted about create.object(). <br />
As you will notice 3GL Programming is very different than 4GL programming so you will need to learn step by step until you get used to it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">18th October 2006, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I see George. That 's good code. But How you can apply it for whole baan forms. For example we have three companies. I want to use diffrent colorer forms for each one. How can I use create.object with it ? There are thousands of  forms , Icould't imagine solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">18th October 2006, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I see you are talking about the Baan Color Changer Product. As I said before, it is not programmed in Baan Tools.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">18th October 2006, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked for the method. Both you said I can do it create.object and external program ??? I am confused. I think that you did it by using 4GL. This means that you did it on baan. Is that true ? . But How can I use object with all forms ?<br />
&#305; think that you understand what I mean .<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">18th October 2006, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan Color Chager does not use create.object() at all. It uses another Windows method to color the Baan forms from outside of Baan.<br />
<br />
create.object() is used in other products but not in Baan Color Changer.<br />
<br />
I hope this makes it clear.<br />

<br />
normaly such software works like:<br />
<br />
You catch the windows api message from the windows form (has nothing to do with baan) (e.g. Sessioncode, Sessionname, Company number), and you manipulate the message (change the colour) with e.g. Visual C++. ( Baan Form ----&gt; Winodws API Message ----&gt; Your Code (old: white // new: green) ----&gt; Send Message to windows.<br />
<br />
With colour changer (a very great tool by the way, and totaly pays back the invest in reduced support because of users working in wrong company) there is only one constraint, if the company number is not fully displayed on the form (e.g. a very long session name sample ::   &quot;tiitm9101m000 Very long Session Name [10&quot;), then you have not all informations to colour the form.<br />
<br />

<br />
Just now while going through the sessions i found that ttdskcs is used in ttdsk3160m000 &quot;maintain runtime resources&quot; and can be used to change the colors of forms etc of bx , terminal based gui .<br />

<br />
I guess it will work only in X-windows environment  , so it will work only if you run it using bix , and i guess you have windows client and if at all you have linux clients , i guess you are using wine to run BAAN .<br />
<br />
I might be wrong .<br />

<br />
I tried changing the color in ttdsk3160m000 , in tt gfd.bx , for formwindows and change the color to blue , i thought it didnot work , but when accidentally as there was a session timeout , the box which appeared had a changed color , i.e. blue which i changed .<br />
<br />
Try it and comment if you get something more<br />

        I also noticed that the color when i open employee dialog from enterprise modeller , its color was blue , any more updates please post<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">15th November 2006, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that I won't get new updates. We can manage colors in baan by using only objects. Look at Baan bibbles sample . Search board. It has good logic about color.<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />
