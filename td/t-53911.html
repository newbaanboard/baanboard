<br />
You might want to use the following tool to generate the ASCII file:<br />

<br />
Then read it from LN.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

 the link given by you seems to taking the backup of baan4 by baan 4 session, can i take the baan4 table data by a session in Ln, if both Ln and Baan4 are on different server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">8th October 2008, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The link I gave you exports a Baan IV table to Excel. This is half the way.<br />
<br />
Now you have an Excel file (that can easily be converted to CSV / ASCII) that you should import in LN.<br />

Create new  database definition ttaad4110m00 with server host as baan IV  host and assign this table to this new database and convert to runtime . It should let u read the B4data in Ln . <br />
<br />
Please test this scenario for 1 table only before doing it for others. Problem of this apprach will be that if the same table exist in baan IV and Ln with different dd , it will not work .</div></div><hr />

   I created a table in Baan IV (tccom101), and improrted that definition in the LN, Then in Ln i created a database definiton like as attached document.<br />
<br />
But i am not able to understand &quot;how to assign this table to this new database &quot;.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Assume both server have same MSQL7 driver (for SQL 2k or sql2k5) .<br />
<br />
Use session ttaad4111m000 to assign the db to the table for a specific company. Convert to runtime  and tabledef6.1 should reflect new definition . Then test whether u can access the table or if not what is the problem .</div></div><hr />

be carefull when playing with DD to log on and log in, before any other action..<br />

<br />
I also want to know, how to export the data from BAAN IV and import it in LN?<br />
What you have said is quite unclear to me:confused:. Will you please explain it in more detail?<br />
<br />
Or anyone, who understood what Cesar Lopez has written.<br />
If possible, please help me out in understanding it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank You All<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cesar Lopez</div><div class="date">3rd November 2008, 02:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.. i´ll try to explain:<br />
<br />
When you create a dump it has a header, this is to specify the version, something like this in the first line of the file &quot;#$!pre-dump!$#00037cv&quot;, to make compatible a dump for one version to another you need to change the header of your dumps, replacing the header from the source environment for one of the target environment, yo can do that with a script, once yo do that your dumps are compatible(only for ascii dumps, better option is with specific delimiter).<br />
<br />
Then you just have to load this in the target environment, but how to do that?, the only thing that may fail is the DD, thats why you have to copy your DD from source environment to target environment, but baan is only going to be able to read it if it´s called as the same as the original(example: Vrc in target= DDVRT vrc in source= DDVRS put DDVRS in target environment and rename it as DDVRT), that is almost 100% compatible, because as we know those are flat files, the only thing you have to do is one scrpit like the previus one to change the header (:RELE:6.1 -&gt; :RELE:6.2) between B4 and LN or viceversa, before load log off and log in to the system. <br />
<br />
after you load that, you have to flip back your DD but you will need to reconfigure all the tables as necessary, how?, delete your DDvrc folder, mm?? is better to rename it, then run create DD for this VRC with reconfiguring option, you may run this twice to ensure..., <br />
<br />
this is posible from a technical point of view, but the problem is from functional side, because from a higher version to a lower one, is possible that when you flip back the DD, and removes te extra fields you may loose some important data, but for catalogs works.<br />
<br />
and if you have previus data in that tables, firs you have to dump it, delete the tables, do all the thing, and the reload.<br />
<br />
i hope this explain better, extensive test is recommended, before do this with something serius!!<br />
<br />
