Your solution works fine (thanks!) but it's only information for the user, so i don't want the user to have to click ok.<br />
<br />
My code doesn't work<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
	mess(&quot;tdebns0020&quot;, 0, &quot;starting program...&quot;)<br />
	refresh()<br />
<br />
I can't find any information in the help why it doesn't work.<br />
Could it be i am doing something wrong, or is it the functionality of mess()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th January 2008, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are doing it correctly.  I think the form setup itself clears the message.  That is why I was asking if there was possible another place in the program to do the mess() command.  I tried it on a before.display on a field - in debug mode it displayed, but went away as soon as I clicked continue.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
maybe this will be a solution/suggestion.<br />
<br />
It works in ASCII and i found the problem in GUI, there it does'n work.<br />
The message is not shown in statusline in GUI.<br />
<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
<br />
mess(&quot;tdebns0020&quot;,0)<br />
<br />
<br />
field.abcd:<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
<br />
clean.mess()<br />
<br />
<br />
The message is shown at startup, and automatic cleaned, when the user enter a value in formfield abcd and press tab to the next field.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

In before.program the form is not initialized, so put the mess function in init.form.<br />
The clean the message in after.input of the first formfield.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
this works in ASCII and GUI:<br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
init.form:<br />
        mess(&quot;dhmess0011&quot;,0)<br />
<br />
<br />
        get.screen.defaults()<br />
<br />
<br />
field.item.f:<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
        item.t = item.f<br />
<br />
after.input:<br />
<br />
        clean.mess()<br />
<br />
The message is shown in the status bar of the form by startup 'til the first input is taken.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

I think it's nog possible to do it the way i thougt i could do it.<br />
thanks for your input!</div></div><hr />

hmmmm... not nice<br />

But thanks for your input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st January 2008, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">If your session is a Type 2 session (Update), then it will work in the init.form: section. You are then responsible to clearing the message when you do not need it anymore.<br />
<br />
For Type 1 session (Maintain), if it is o.k. for the message to display for a small duration, you can use (for example) suspend(1000) after the message - in this case the message displays for 1 second and then goes away. This is because of the way the Type 1 session behaves when first presenting the form to the user. Again, this can be done in the init.form: section.</div></div><hr />
