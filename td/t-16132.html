<br />
I have searched the forum. <br />
Since I do not have the source to change and add in check.input, I have<br />
no other choice but to make field mandatory through table definition.<br />
<br />
I want to do this but even after create runtime, the option don't get activated. I still can save if I leave the field tdsls040.creg empty.<br />
<br />
Can someone out there give some hints if you already have done it before.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

After create runtime, log off Baan application and log in back.<br />
Even if it doesn't work, convert tdsls040 and all the refered tables (tables used in tdsls040) to runtime dd.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">28th July 2004, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's a table field, you can't use the form option for mandatory - the table setting takes over.  The form option can be used for any non-table fields you have on the form.<br />
<br />
Changing the table should work as described, and people do correctly change this to handle this problem.   The wrapper tools like RMCgen (my company, read:  Sale Pitch) and QKey (FullScope), the freeware 'rush' on these boards, are also used to solve these types of problems.  These tools generate script that will wrap around the standard objects, no source required.  You can add check input code without having the original source code.   You can add to any section in the code, you do not change the original code in anyway.  If you find you need to do that a lot, the wrapper tools are generally safer and more versitile than changing the table defs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already logout and login and convert to runtime.<br />
But only did it for tdsls040.<br />
Are you sure we need to do it for all reference tables??<br />
<br />
Lisa, is RMCis software a freeware? Where can I get it?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th July 2004, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - you need to do it for all reference tables.  Rush is the only freeware. RMCgen and Qkey by fullscope need to be purchased.  I am sure Lisa might be able to provide you with a demo version.  If you do not mind the extra work I would say use the Rush version in the Code and Utilities forum.  Otherwise I would recommend reviewing both RMCgen and Qkey.  We have been using Qkey for about 5 years now - not sure if RMCgen was out then.  I find the product very useful - we now have dozens of changes to standard sessions. Changes from adding additional checks to adding additional fields - all of which we did without modifying the standard session code or the standard table.<br />

I did this early on just to give people an idea of what you could do.  There are some limitations as pointed out in this thread.<br />

<br />
How can a field be made mandatory from the form? Could you please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SriksAdi</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 06:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
While edifitng the form, in the session Maintain Form fields (ttadv3101s000) the field properties have an option called Mandatory Input. If this check box is selected on, then the field becomes mandatory on the form.<br />
<br />
This applies only to form fields and not table fields. In case of table fields, the table definition has higher priority.<br />
