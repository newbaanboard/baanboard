<br />
One of the Baan session printed arnd 800 invoices to a printer dedicated only for Baan. I dont know, who ran this session...whether its by some person or some Baan Job. I want to trace this. <br />
<br />
Following is the information that I have:<br />
1) I know the session. This session is a normal print session without any updates to the Baan tables. <br />
2) I know the IP address of the printer. <br />
3) I know the time when the documents were being printed.<br />
<br />
What am I looking for, are the log files :)<br />
At the Baan end, where can i check for the login\userid that initiated this session? Do i need to check at the database level?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Kartik</div></div><hr />

That may show you who ran the report.  On unix I can then look in the $BSE/tmp directory to check sizes of the reports to make sure I have the correct user.  Usually I know the user name because they call about the printer not working and needing something deleted.  Early on when we first went to Baan what users did was click on continue, not cancel the report, send it to someone elses printer because they did not want it.  After tracking a few of these down the users stopped it.  Sometimes it was just easy as doing a ls -ltr on the $BSE/tmp directory to see who had an incredibly large report.</div></div><hr />
