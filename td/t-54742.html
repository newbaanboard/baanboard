<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">d.schingenga</div><div class="date">13th January 2009, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed the Infor Dynamic Form Editor 8.4a.8. and use the Infor BW8.5a and the Worktop version 2.5.3.<br />
<br />
Problem now is that I go into Sessions, select from the list a Session and choose Edit Form..., now the error message pops up &quot;Unable to create OLE-Object!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think this has to do with a DLL that is not proper registered (I am working on Vista), but can not find out which and where the DLL (s) are regarding the Dynamic Form Editor.<br />
<br />
I hope someone can help me with this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the hint, however this does not work. I made a new configuration in BECS, and then also a new entry for the Worktop, but I still get the message.<br />
<br />
Hope you have some other suggestion.<br />

Solution Description <br />
English Latest version of Setup for Client Binaries (bw.exe, becs.exe, bwprint.exe, etc) BW <br />
VERSION(S): B40a, B40b, B40c, B50b, c, 7.0a, 7.1x, 7.3x, 7.5a, 7.6a, 7.6b, 8.2b, 8.3a. <br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: <br />
BW (bw.exe, bwprint.exe, becs.exe, etc). <br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
The newest version of Baan Windows interface (BW), BWPRINT.exe and related files. <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
BW is supported on Windows XP, Windows2003, and Windows Vista. <br />
Vista support is only given with UAC enabled <br />
(Windows CE is not supported) <br />
<br />
NOTES <br />
1) We advice to have always the latest BW version installed. But you can use a newer BW version against an older porting set version. <br />
So it is not mandatory to update the portingset on the Baan server also, when installing the newest BW version on the client computers. <br />
Although we advice to have also the latest version of the portingset installed on the Baan server. <br />
<br />
2) The portingset and BW (bw.exe, bwprint.exe, etc) are always created as one build, and secondly the portingset components and BW components are separated from each other. So we end up with a &quot;BW install&quot; and a &quot;portingset install&quot;. <br />
This means that a certain combination of a BW version and a portingset version do have the same source code base. <br />
Refer to the tables (PORTING SET VERSION VS. BW VERSION NUMBER) for these combinations. <br />
<br />
3) okt 22 2007 Note regarding Vista support. <br />
As of 8.4a.02 the BW is certified for Windows Vista. This BW can be used in combination with the 8.4 portingsets as well as with the 7.1d portingsets. <br />
3b) nov 12 2007, now also avaiable for B40 with B40c.88 <br />
This is both for 32bit and 64bit Vista. <br />
3c) okt 13 2008, Vista support is only given with UAC enabled <br />
<br />
with the next link you can download the installation guide for the Vista enabled BW: <br />
/ftpdownload/updates/port/BaanWindows/Infor_ERP_BaanIV_Baan50_ERP_LN_61_Installation_Guide_Infor_BW.pdf <br />
Here are useful links for UAC (http://www.petri.co.il/disable_uac_in_windows_vista.htm) and UAC &amp; Vista Compatibility (http://www.helpware.net/VistaCompat.htm)<br />
If that doesn't fix it, you have a open a new case with Baan Support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your  solution it works fine now. I had UAC disabled to get rid of the annoying messages from Vista every time you start some program or open some files.<br />
<br />
I enable UAC and everything works fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
