<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BurghMan</div><div class="date">27th March 2013, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We are attempting to print checks on a preprinted form with a customized Baan check report. The page length of the preprinted form is 5.5 inches. I have the report page length and the Baan device page length both set for 33 lines (6 lines per inch * 5.5).  Instead of each check and remittance printing on 5.5 inches it seems to be doing a page break and is printing on 11 inches.  I have the printer page length set to 5.5&quot; also.<br />
<br />
We are doing this for our Costa Rican facility....we have been told that it is a banking/government requirement to print checks in this fashion.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have experience with printing from Baan on a preprinted form with an impact (dot matrix) printer?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Rob</div></div><hr />

See if that is checked or unchecked - you might want to play with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BurghMan</div><div class="date">28th March 2013, 14:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply Mark.  I got a response from our friends at Infor.   It involves setting the paper size on the printer then assigning the bin on the report in print preview mode.  I will attach the solution. This solution is specific to an Oki dot matrix printer but the concept could be applied to other printers and any application that would require a non-typical paper or page length.  Label printing on non standard 8.5 by 11 sheets would be another application that I believe could use this type of setup.</div></div><hr />
