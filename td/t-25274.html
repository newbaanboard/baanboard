<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">5th October 2005, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a form field that is a 100 character string, and it is used to hold descriptions.  Among other things it is used to hold item descriptions that are eventually mapped back to the Item Master.  Therefore, the length cannot be greater than 30 characters.  I am doing a length check in the check.input section, but this only tells them they have gone over the allowable length then wipes out what they have typed.   Since I know how long the field can be before they input a value, is there any way keep them from typing more characters than are allowed during input?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th October 2005, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you saying sometimes they will be allowed 100 characters and sometimes you want to limit them to 30 characters?  Just trying to understand the problem a little better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">5th October 2005, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.  The session is used to enter different types of data, one of them being items.  Since the item description on the item master is 30 characters we can't let them enter more than that even though the field is 100 characters long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 10:36</div></div><div class="posttext">After your check in the check.input: if length of input &gt; 30 then<br />
message(&quot;not allowed to enter description longer than 30 pos&quot;)<br />
stp.reset.value() |this resets the value of the field to the previous value<br />
choice.again() | this stops execution of the program, passes control back to user.<br />
<br />
You can also use set.input.error()<br />
<br />
Hope this helps..<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">how about assigning the std. domain for description field on the form?<br />
<br />
you may not need to change anything in the code. Only the change in the form will do.<br />
<br />
edit: I noticed that the same form field may be used for other field inputs,<br />
if those are going to be longer / different, you may have to code it before input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">As Jcook explained, IF I understood him correctly, the field is used for different purposes, not only for item description... that's why he has to enable upto 100 characters... so he needs to check in script during runtime...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I am aware of nothing that will limit the input on a string field at run time.  You can check attr.maxlen, but I tried it once and it did not do what I wanted.  Of course you can always write your own form field and use things like pending.event, next.event.  Never really done it, but it is possible - too much work for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way to do this may be:<br />
<br />
have a new form fieldpurely for item desc and control input/visibility to this and the current field based on your prior knowledge of where the user needs to go ( Quote : &quot;Since I know how long the field can be before they input a value&quot;---it appears that you know prior to this field input if the user is going to enter item description or other ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 22:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm getting &quot;Unresolved reference to function stp.reset.value&quot; when I compile.  Is there something I'm missing.  <br />
<br />
stp.reset.value()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Check this thread out (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7813&amp;highlight=stp.reset.value).  Seems attr.previous solved one problem and nothing was ever resolved about stp.reset.value.  I get the same error as you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">10th October 2005, 11:34</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan V stp.reset.value() works fine. I guess in Baan IV it just doesn't... But then indeed attr.previous$ should do the job...</div></div><hr />
