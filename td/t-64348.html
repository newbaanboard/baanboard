I wanted to create maintain session for a table but for large labels, generate session gave does not fit, generation aborted error so I am creating session manually. <br />
<br />
Issue: when i try to insert next record and click save, session says record already exists however there is no record as such. I can guess that the last record buffer is still taken by program. <br />
<br />
Any idea how to fix? Check attachment.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

If the problem still exists, you can put the session under debug mode and check what's happening in the script. Also, make sure if the index fields for the table are set properly, may be the records have similar index values. <br />
<br />
A trick :- I have experienced this a few months before, and I was able to tackle it by converting the maintain session to update session. By it may not be advisable in your case. <br />

As bhushan  said check the records if the tables (not required to delete )<br />
<br />
if  records does not exists the the possible cause for the error may due to buffer at you said.<br />
<br />
let me help you with example<br />
<br />
-     <br />
                    key 1          key 2       <br />
<br />
                 lower.limit    upper.limit <br />
  record-1      10               20<br />
  record-2      30               40  <br />
<br />
record 1 and 2 are unique but  my requirement is   that it should have unique range and should not over lap  (ie the 2nd record cannot be 15 -30 , as records 1st upperlimit is 20)   in this case you might be fetching data  from main table ,  during that process you fill the table fields(nothing but buffer) with fetched record  (this might not be visible in the form )  and hence the error<br />
<br />
check out on.main.table   or use alias  or bind variables of select fields while reffering to main table while checking</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
before creating own tables, you always have to consider the database rules for normalization.<br />
Always try to use 3rd normalform.<br />
