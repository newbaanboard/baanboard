<br />
which version of ERP do you have exactly? When your Vault Server is correct configured it could be the problem that your documents can't set to Released. It's a bug in higher version of ERP LN. You can find out that if you are looking into table dmdoc430. When you find records there with dmdoc430.fnid equal 0 you need a solution from Infor. You have to search in INFOR Knowledgebase.<br />
We had the same problem in ERP LN FP8 and now we are waiting that INFOR migrate an older solution version to FP8.<br />
<br />

Yes, we too have a FP8. Problem is, how to set that a users could save attached files on server machine, and not to theirs local path on workstation. How to set a workarea and vault, to  works this right . Is there a bug, because sometimes it work fine and save attachment  to server, and sometimes again not?<br />
