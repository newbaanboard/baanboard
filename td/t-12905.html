We do have Q-Key but don't have source code.  Is this possible?<br />
<br />
We tried using the 'query.extension' but it did not seem to work properly with index. Could you use the main.table.io section?<br />
<br />
we had:<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
   query.extension = &quot;tdinv700.cwar &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;GGG&quot;&quot; order by tdinv700._index1 desc&quot;<br />
<br />
Any ideas greatly appreciated!?<br />

I think you cannot use query.extension as this is adding to the where clause. So the system rightly gave an error message.<br />
If you want to change the sort order without having a index change it might be little tricky.<br />

Even with Q-key I can not think of a way to change the sort order.<br />

What I would do was close out the function and leave the last function open again to deal with the standard functionality.<br />
<br />
Could you maybe try :<br />
<br />
 query.extension = &quot;tdinv700.cwar &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;GGG&quot;&quot;) order by tdinv700._index1 desc |&quot;<br />
<br />
My thinking is that it looks like the query.extinsion is wrapped in &quot;()&quot; so close it yourself and then I put a comment at the end to hopefully suppress the &quot;)&quot; at the end.<br />
<br />
No clue if it will work or not... but you just might get lucky.<br />
<br />

The query.extension is actually appended to the normal query, and not during compilation, where the comment would have worked.  But the string is appended as is, and this will therefore result in an error.<br />
<br />
The proof that the query.extension is not considered during compilation lies in the fact that you can modify the query extension on the fly (eg. based on some input in form fields), and refresh the data with an execute(first.set) or execute(find.data) to reflect the new limits imposed.<br />
<br />
As for the exchange side, that works:cool: Used it recently to build a complete interface, consisting of many input files, and according to the exchange scheme it is only importing one file, being the parameters needed to steer the rest of the interface.  The rest done in functions.  Works perfectly!</div></div><hr />
