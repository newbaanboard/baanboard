<br />
Our user's didn't enter Confirmed Receipt date in Purchase order header(tdpur400.ddtc). So I copied tdpur400.ddtc table in customized VRC and made this field as Mandatory field. But due to this Planned purchase orders are not getting converted into Purchase order as this field is mandatory. Now again made this field as non mandatory field and tried to Convert Run time data directory. But it gives some error messages. &quot;Dumping table definitions/domains not possible for package combination b61aprod.<br />
Convert to Runtime Data Directory(ttadv5215m000) has not finished re configuring tables yet&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
Infor is also not ready for table in customized VRC. <br />
<br />
Can anyone help me in how to remove table from customized VRC and use it in STANDARD VRC.<br />
<br />
Please tell me step by step solution for this<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the data in tables ttadv501,502,503,504? Did you checked the file in the dict for that table under your customized package combination? Did you tried expiring that table in your customized VRC? Not sure if that works or not but just a thought.<br />
<br />
Well, I will first check my log files, event viewer, and the dict files. If found nothing, will try to run Create Runtime. If it doesn't work, will clear the data in ttadv501,502,503. Remove any application locks present related to that. Make some change to that table i.e. Make one of the field property change etc and check if entry has been added to table ttadv501 and then do a Convert to Runtime. <br />
<br />
And do go through all the logs first.<br />
<br />
Next time make sure not to mess with the standard tables. If you wanted to make the field mandatory, you could have written a UE DLL or made form changes if UE was not available. But, think before going ahead and changing standard. Just an advice. Else, you have to enter the battlefield against tools :)<br />

Checked  log files, event viewer, and the dict files. Found R.tdpur400 file that's why RDD not working. Renamed that file but again for next time when I tried RDD it shows same file. Also cleared data in ttadv501,502,503. Didn't found any application locks present related to this. <br />
<br />
Tell me one thing, If I took sequential dump of tdpur400 and then drop this table and recreate it by restoring data from sequential dump. Does it work ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taking the dump would be advisable. Did you made any changes to the table definition after clearing the ttadv tables?<br />
Unless you don't do that, reconfig wont happen. So, again, check if ttadv tables are empty, make some change to customized table definition. You will see entry in ttadv table. Now, you can go ahead and run Convert to runtime for your customized package comb.<br />
<br />
Backup is advisable as I guess, R.* files might do the mess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if the R.-file still exists: go to the directory where it is stored and enter the command: bdbreconfig -N &lt;table&gt;&lt;companynumber&gt;+<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
bdbreconfig -N tdpur400100+<br />
<br />
This command uses the R-file to rebuild the table.<br />
<br />
After that I would check if the table is as desired. If not: Take a seq. dump of the table and run session create rtdd with reconfigure=yes.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
