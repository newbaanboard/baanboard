<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cucucucu</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 06:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear all,<br />
     In a form, there is<br />
<br />
     from date.f time.f  to date.t time.t<br />
<br />
     The error script is:<br />
<br />
     where date between date.f and date.t<br />
     and     time between time.f and time.t<br />
<br />
Is there any function can integrate date and time to compare?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
what kind of error message do you get?<br />
<br />
It might be that you only forgot the &quot;:&quot;.<br />
<br />
where date between :date.f and :date.t<br />
and time between :time.f and :time.t<br />
 <br />
<br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cucucucu</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 08:15</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry I missed the &quot;:&quot;, but this script is wrong, we should not compare date and time respectively</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Change the form fields date.f/t and time.f/t to one date.f/t by using a utc format, which includes also the time. Then in the program script you can easily call &quot;where ttmmm999.date inrange :date.f and :date.t&quot;<br />
<br />
on form you make two input fields: <br />
- date.f (domain tcdate or similar utc-domain)<br />
- date.t ( &quot; &quot;)<br />
You will see that there is a time field on it as well, because utc format is a date calculated in number of seconds...<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cucucucu</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi En,<br />
    Do you mean that I should change the field domain to utc-domain? I am not very clear this :( <br />
<br />
Cu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">do not change the domain, just assign a different domain to the field. For instance check domain tcdate, the data type is normally utc-date. So in the declaration of the form field, you should assign the utc-domain to the field, and also in the program scrip field-declarations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">UTC Formats are not default in Baan IV.  Most date fields are non-utc.  In Baan IV the tcdate domain is not UTC.  <br />
<br />
You can combine the date and time fields in SQL to get a good combined field range.  It's the one good use for the 'between' option!  I use this trick a lot in Baan IV:<br />
<br />
<br />
|* stdt = Start Date<br />
|* sttm = Start Time<br />
<br />
select  tihra900.*<br />
from    tihra900<br />
where  tihra900._index1 inrange {:emno.f} and {:emno.t}<br />
and     {tihra900.stdt, tihra900.sttm} between {:stdt.f, :sttm.f}<br />
                                                   and        {:stdt.t, :sttm.t}</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 08:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course Lisa, to program it is not a problem, but I meant more the general way of working. Why using two fields date/time in they are actually just one field, and that one field can perfectly be handled by using utc-format...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">En - you are 100% correct in the Baan V environment.  Dates on the tables are stored in UTC format.<br />
<br />
However in Baan IV they are not.  They are 2 separate fields on the table, with non-utc domains.  If you create a utc domain field on the form and try to read the tables with it, it will not find a match.<br />
<br />
UTC format is one of the big tools improvements they made from IV - V.  The UTC domain availablility in Baan IV was ported to IV for the conversion programs from IV - V.  The tables in Baan IV were not changed to use it.<br />
<br />
Baan IV uses the date.num() and related expressions, or what get in Baan V when you use the 'utc.to.local' command for date and time separate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">When you are checking date and time seperately, you need to provide more conditions.  If the date is between the from and to date, there may not be a need to check the time because you are between the two dates.  If you date is equal to the from date, the time should be greater than the from time.  The way that your code example reads implies that I want information for every day from the from date to the to date, but only betwee the hours of say 1:00 and 3:00.  You may really be asking for all information between 1:00 on the from date to 3:00 on the to date.<br />
<br />
I hope this was clear enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th August 2004, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Lisa, you're right. Sorry, am lately so involved with Baan V only, that I didn't even think of non-utc table-date-fields when using date/time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">9th August 2004, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, Toolswizard - the 'inrange' and 'between' are to solve exactly what you described.  The 'inrange' would check each field date and time separately, and need a lot more checks as you mention.  The 'between' option is what combines them, and allows for a true range for Date and Time together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">9th August 2004, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry but I disagree.  The inrange will seperate each field into its own condition.  You need to look at the time on the start date and end date differently than you would for the dates inbetween.  However, I do like your example of combining the fields first, then using a between.  I am going to give that a try and see if it gives me the same results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">9th August 2004, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">We do not differ - maybe I did not explain right.<br />
<br />
inrange = each field separate<br />
between = combined fields as a range<br />
<br />
Between is only relavant with combined fields, otherwise it acts the same as inrange.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you said in your note that you have tried this with between as well, I think Marcel's solution won't deliver much result. <br />
<br />
Try to give us some more information. The variables yr04.f and yr04.t, are they of type long? [They should be]<br />
When you say not all the data is selected, can you give me a few examples of records that should have been selected but do not; and what is their transaction date? Do those records answer all the other conditions? <br />

I changed two importand lines in the select statement that I think could cause that behaviour.<br />
<br />
First:<br />
select sum(whinr110.qstk):total.production,<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
group by whinr110.item,whinr110.koor,whinr110.kost,whinr110.trdt<br />

Please give it a try anyway. It can't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">renzosing</div><div class="date">14th October 2004, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The  variables yr04.f and yr04.t are of type tcdate, I tried setting them to long, but no luck.  When I say not all the data is selected, I mean that without the date condition I get all the records with the other conditions. Within those conditions, all the dates are within the range that I look for when I add the date condition, i.e. they are all in 2003, but when I put the date condition in, it doesn't retrieve all the data that is within that year range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">renzosing</div><div class="date">14th October 2004, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I just noticed that if I don't use the date range condition, but just select the date, I don't get all my data.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">14th October 2004, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you still have the group by condition in there and only select the transaction date?  I don't think that will work, actually I don't think it compiles, so maybe I am mis understanding.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it does not look bad to me.  I agree, give us the full key for a record you are expecting to read.  What is the:<br />
<br />
item<br />
koor<br />
kost<br />
trdt<br />
<br />
Also, when you debug, what is the value you hold in yr04.f and yr04.t, we can translate those and make sure the proper range is taken - the statements look fine.<br />
<br />
Also, just to clarify - malutz's similified code did not work either?  Lets get that going then get the group by / sum in there when we are getting the records.</div></div><hr />
