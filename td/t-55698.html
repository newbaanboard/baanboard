<br />
I'm sure I'm overlooking something really simple here. I'm not very hot on creating reports in Baan<br />
<br />
I'm creating a simple report to generate a payment file. I have a before.report layout and a detail layout. When I print the report both layouts are being printed on the same line. What have I done wrong? My before.report layout has text, a couple of Baan fields and blank space. Nothing at all complicated.<br />
<br />
The report script has a couple of lines for before.report (before.layout) that are formating dates.<br />
<br />
I've even created anew report with a before.report and detail section. In the before.report layout I have some text that says &quot;top&quot; and in the detail layout I have some text that says &quot;test&quot;. I have an empty script. When I run the report i get one line of text saying &quot;toptesttest&quot;<br />
<br />
I must be doing something fundamentally wrong here.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

In the layout page, for each layout, you have a value of multicolumn different from 0?</div></div><hr />

I was sending my output to a file and opening this from a Samba share on our Linux server. Due to Windows formatting it was putting all the data on one line. When opened from vi on Linux the format was okay.<br />
<br />
The duplication of the details layout was resolved by putting - &quot;if details then lattr.print = false&quot; into the script. I got this by looking at some of the other reports I was basing my report on. Not sure why i need to do this but it fixes the duplication error??</div></div><hr />

<br />
What editor are you using to view the file off the Samba share?<br />
<br />
I would hazard Notepad. If that is the case, try Wordpad or any decent replacement for Notepad.<br />
<br />
Unix files use linefeed &lt;LF&gt; - chr$(10) - as line endings. <br />
Mac files use carriagereturn &lt;CR&gt; - chr$(13) - as line endings.<br />
<br />
Dos/Windows use &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; as line endings. Notepad requires that files be formatted only with Dos/Windows line endings. Other editors usually do not have this limitation.<br />
<br />
Based on Scintilla (the same widget used in SciTE: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=603), here is a replacement for Notepad: http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your tips on editors.<br />
<br />
The problem I had with the duplicate details layouts, although fixed by putting lattr.print=false in the script, is now giving my problems in my after.report layout. I have to create a count of records printed in the report detail. So where I have one detail line (remember the duplicate detail line is not being printed beacuse of lattr.print = false) my count is including the one I'm not printing. How do I ignore the 'hidden' detail line in my count?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
