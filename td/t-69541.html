<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaBernd</div><div class="date">14th December 2016, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello to All,<br />
<br />
within a function I'll execute a select on table cprrp041 (is not necessarily important which table). In the selectdo area the function tccom.dll0010.print.record(1) transfers the record set to a report.<br />
But I also like to transfer a calculated variable (here cal.week) within this selectdo area to the report. But it doesn't. I also tried the export()-function within the selectdo, but I haven't also no success.<br />
Does anyone has an idea how I can join the result of the variable with the record set for transfer.<br />
<br />
Here an example of my problem:<br />
function long print.production.order.selection()<br />
{<br />
select cprrp041.*<br />
from cprrp041<br />
where cprrp041.koor = 3<br />
selectdo<br />
	cal.week = val(sprintf$(&quot;%u(%02W)&quot;,cprrp041.date)  |* calculated calendar week<br />
	tccom.dll0010.print.record( 1 )  |* record set transfer<br />
endselect<br />
}<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

I know in 4c4 we use print record in a few programs which are in our version of tccomdll010 which does I think the same thing.  I am assuming you use the open.report and point it to the correct report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hklett</div><div class="date">14th December 2016, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">As Marc mentioned you have to make this field as an input field in your report.<br />
Did you declare this variable as extern?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaBernd</div><div class="date">15th December 2016, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I also added this field in the &quot;input fields...&quot; for the report, before. But I've got the error<br />
&quot;Process xx - Fatal Error: process xx: mv_symbols error: INCOMPATIBLE TYPES: (cal.week LONG|ARRAY|EXTERN|NO_ALLOC_MEM, cal.week LONG|EXTERN)<br />
Process xx - Fatal Error: Can not continue in rtisfc0401010010 in DLL: ottstprepdll (r.main)[handle.report.pool]&quot;<br />
<br />
So I've thought to export and import the variable value. But with that methode I've got no values into the report.<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
when I've created the input field I set the depth = 2. I've mixed it with the Domain property &quot;Digits before Decimal = 2&quot;<br />
Now I've changed the value &quot;depth = 0&quot;. The INCOMPATIBLE TYPES-Error doesn't occur. And the values will be correctly transferred to the report.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help. Therefore I've recognized that I'm on the wrong track with my thread &quot;joining record set and variable&quot;. Problem was the wrong defined input field.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
