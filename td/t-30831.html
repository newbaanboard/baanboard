<br />
I have an oportunity to play around with ERP LN tools lately. My goal is to investigate, how to move a remarkable number of customizations and self developed sessions from BaaN IV to LN with less effort posssible. I can already move the data model, however some tables (just as whole ideas and functions) have to be redesigned (at least because some domains like tcitem or tcctod are not present anymore). I can also move other software components - forms, reports, sessions etc. But, I have some questions ant I hope somebody can give me some hints.<br />
<br />
1. When I insert a new session in my LN environment, the field &quot;Dynamic&quot; and &quot;Integrated&quot; are always marked and greyed out. I remember, that in first Baan ERP releases the situation was the same, and a solution had to be installed to make these fields R/W. But, when I move a session and a form from Baan IV by filling tools tables like ttadv200, ttadv300 and others with proper values, I get a non-dynamic session and a good old, editable with old -fashioned text form editor, non-dynamic form, which is working properly in ERP LN, even in webtop. So, I would like to know the truth about dynamic sessions - are they really mandatory? Is there a solution to install, enabling non-dynamic sessios creation in ERP LN?<br />
<br />
2. Does anybody know how to write help texts for self- developed sessions in ERP LN. Is there any piece of documentation available? If yes, please, give me the document number. I can move help texts, but I can't get them displayed in runtime.<br />
<br />
3. When I create a print session, the button &quot;print&quot; does appear automatically on the form,but not as a first button from top, but somewhere under &quot;make job&quot; button. Is it my error or a solution missing?<br />
<br />
4. I have noticed, that &quot;choice.user.*&quot; buttons on forms are handled in completely different way in ERP LN. Does anybody have experiences with moving forms with buttons from BIVc to ERP LN automatically?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Open the session properties session(ttadv2100s000) thro' session ttadv2500m000.<br />
<br />
2. Goto third tab named &quot;Form&quot; in session ttadv2100s000<br />
<br />
3. At the bottom you can see a group box named &quot;Default Button&quot;. Set following parameters Command Type as &quot;Standard Command&quot; and Default Button as &quot;print.data&quot;<br />
<br />
This should work for you.<br />

Based on the LN Development Methodology all Sessions/Forms are Integrated/Dynamic.<br />
I don't think there is any solution to change it back to static. This is the Go-forward strategy for Thin Client Compatibility.<br />

In LN, there is no more old BaaN help viewer. The help is integrated with Webtop as &quot;web-help&quot;.<br />

Refer to the thread - BaanIC forms to ERPLN dynamic forms (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=30195)<br />
