What do you mean by &quot;the file it self pop up&quot;? The file opens on the client PC or the baan Server?<br />

<br />
The file pops up on client PC itself. We know that seq.open is meant to write some records in text file on backend so that it can be used to create a log fil e or input to other 3rd party software. But some times its opening up physically on client PC.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<br />
seq.open can open a file for read, write or append. Sorry, but your comment is completely wrong.<br />
<br />
What happens when the file pops-up? There must be a window, I suppose, and what title is in it?</div></div><hr />

E.g. program is  writing .txt file  and at the end if this  file is invoked , using any of above function , it will open a notepad . If on the client the file association is not  then for the file u write , the popup may fail. This may explain erratic behavior .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thansk for your time in but i had found the problem and fixed it.<br />
It was an interesting one.<br />
What was actually happening that while processing a session it used to print a report and at the same time create a log file on backend.<br />
But in some scenario the log file was overwriting the file created by baan for printing finally either on Dispaly report or whatever the Device was selected by the user.<br />
<br />
So actually it was the report getting printed i mean Dispalyed but with all the data written in Log file and not the Data for which it was meant.Actuall the client had given a snap sghot of the report it used to get soem time.<br />
But we were nto able to reproduce it but finally some how hwen reproduced the error we found that the report is getting printed is correct one i mean in the report header the report code was the correct one but it printed the complete log file .</div></div><hr />
