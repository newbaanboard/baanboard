<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th June 2018, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">More information is needed.  Because if you enter a few records hit save, then you could mark record 1 and 3 and hit the delete button in 4c4.  That would delete those two records.  Just don't give a user the delete range functionality.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sahil Sharma</div><div class="date">6th August 2018, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">first of all take out the maximum and the minimum sequence and then check whether the record exists between these two limits. If Yes, then return DALHOOKERROR.</div></div><hr />
