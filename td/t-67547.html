<br />
The question cannot have a very specific answer as the concept of Company is large.<br />
<br />
Company can define a particular Business Unit. A company can be either Financial or Logistics or Both depending on what kind of transactions are done in that. For every company there can be an Archive Company which has archived data of the main company. <br />
<br />
Scenarios can be numerous depending on individual businesses. <br />
<br />
e.g. If you are a manufacturing company with 3 locations, with each company has its own warehouses, business rules, customers, suppliers, products, employees, financial statements etc, you can create 3 companies each having its own set of data and parameters.<br />
<br />
The scope of usage is too vast to define. But in general it goes what is mentioned above.</div></div><hr />
