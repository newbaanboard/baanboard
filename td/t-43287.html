<br />
I am running a query against the table tfgld410.  It returns &quot;No data in selection&quot; when I add the date field to the query.  Is there a format issue that I am not seeing when I am trying the following query?<br />
<br />
<br />
tfgld.date date.f, date.t<br />
<br />
SELECT tfgld410.*, ticpr010.*<br />
FROM tfgld410, ticpr010<br />
WHERE tfgld410.ocom = :ocom.f<br />
AND ((tfgld410.tror = tctror.sls AND tfgld410.fitr = tcfitr.revenue)<br />
	OR (tfgld410.tror = tctror.sls AND tfgld410.fitr = tcfitr.invoice)<br />
	OR (tfgld410.tror = tctror.sls AND tfgld410.fitr = tcfitr.issue)<br />
	OR (tfgld410.tror = tctror.pcs AND tfgld410.fitr = tcfitr.ecp.sales)<br />
	OR (tfgld410.tror = tctror.pcs AND tfgld410.fitr = tcfitr.acp.sales))<br />
AND tfgld410.cprj INRANGE :cprj.f AND :cprj.t<br />
AND tfgld410.trdt INRANGE :date.f  AND :date.t<br />
AND tfgld410.item INRANGE :item.f AND :item.t<br />
AND tfgld410.sint &lt;&gt; tfgld.sint.no.fin<br />
AND tfgld410.podt &lt;&gt; 0<br />
AND tfgld410.cpcp REFERS TO ticpr010<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The query returns data when the date line(bold) is commented out, but when the query is run with the date line no data is returned at all.  <br />
<br />
I have checked to make sure that data actually in the range from which I am selecting and it does.  What am I missing?</div></div><hr />

Where are the dates set?  On the form?  Have you made them external(just tfgld.date in the sample)?  In debug mode check to see if they are correct.  You might also want to run it without the date to see what dates you do get for the data.  Then hard code one of the dates.</div></div><hr />

Which Baan version is this issue?<br />
<br />
In 5.2, LN versions, the tfgld.trdt is a UTC date/time field using the tcdate domain. The tfgld.date domain has a date data type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for all of the insightful advice.  I apologize for not getting back to you sooner, but I had to spend some time going through the data with a fine toothed comb.  As I have done this I have realized that my query is returning correct data for the test ranges that I have set up.  Although there are records inside the date ranges that I am testing against, the records are--correctly--being excluded by another part of the query.<br />
<br />
Thank you, en@frrom, ahmer91, Hitesh Shah, NPRao, and mark_h for your time and attention.  Your suggestions helped me to get in and look much closer at my data and what my query was doing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ben.kansas</div><div class="date">24th October 2007, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Much Venerated Gurus and Moderators,<br />
<br />
I have solved my earlier problem, which was due to not being entirely sure what my query was selecting. :o <br />
<br />
However, I now have another problem.  When I have my query run against another company, ie 351 instead of 851, no data is returned in the report.  I am able to look at the tables and see that data does indeed fit the criteria of the query ( I made double sure after my last escapade).  Using SQL Server managment Studio I ran the query just to be sure that it returned data, which it does.  So I know that the table has data in it I just am not sure how to get baan to return it in a report.  I would appreciate any insights you might have.<br />
<br />
Also, the date fields have been declared extern since they get their constrants from the form.  I am using Baan IVc4.  Debugging shows that the correct company number is being used in the query.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Ben</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th October 2007, 21:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you running this query in one company against another company?  In other words are you running this in company 851 expecting to pull data from 351 or are you changing companies and running the same query?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ben.kansas</div><div class="date">24th October 2007, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark,<br />
<br />
That's a good point.  I was trying to run the query in 851 and pull data from 351.  However, I have run into a bit of a Catch-22 in trying to change my company.  I can't change my company because my VRC is wrong.  Changing my VRC to the correct one can't be done becuase it is not allowed in the current company.  <br />
<br />
Do you have any idea how I might go about changing my company and VRC package combination?<br />
<br />
Ben</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th October 2007, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry - that is an admin question.  I am not really sure how you can do that if the companies are in different VRC structures.  You might be able to get away with tfgld410._compnr = 351(same for ticpr010), but without understanding how the two companies are setup I am not sure it would work.  At my site I would just create a customization to move to the other company(only production companies share the same VRC structure).  Then log into the other company and run the session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th October 2007, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Queries across companies with different package combinations may probably work . But it's not advisable . Rather u should change PVRC / get an authorization for the company and VRC  / repair company numbers (if data is copied from 351 to 851 using tfgld9004m000) .</div></div><hr />
