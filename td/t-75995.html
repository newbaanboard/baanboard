How could we trigger the web page in new window for the input given through function open.url.local().<br />
when we execute this function with mode as OPEN_URL_WAIT the embedded will be appeared in new tab, but due to iframes issue for web page. Required to get the web page in the new window or any other solution to achieve this requirement.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help to resolve this.<br />

<br />
Thanks Mark. I'm getting the response as required but for some webpages we are getting iframes issue and it unable to open the URL which it is getting 'refused to connect'. As a trail and error, we thought to open the URL in the new window so it wouldn't be problem.<br />
Is there any functions that allows the URL to open in the new window and gets the response?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Of course I have never used any of this so I can only post what I see on this board.</div></div><hr />
