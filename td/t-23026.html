<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">31st January 2005, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Just write:<br />
kill(parent)<br />
<br />
The function kill(&lt;process_id&gt;) kills the specified process. The predefined variable 'parent' contains the pid of the parent process.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />

<br />
Maybe this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=23023)   helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">1st February 2005, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Not tested yet . Would like to test however for all zoomtypes like modal child dialog , modal dialog , modal without title etc . I would test the same and get back . In the meanwhile if you or anybody  has clear results from experience, results can be shared here.<br />
<br />
Also  would like to know the value of the parent after killing . Is it set 0 .</div></div><hr />

En,<br />
<br />
That is true as long as the parent and child processes are in different/indepedent process groups like Synchornized sessions. It depends on how you have coded/used. <br />
<br />
Refer to this thread for more information about wait().<br />
<br />
Return Field for Calendar (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9778&amp;highlight=wait) <br />
wait()<br />
Syntax<br />
<br />
string wait( ref long process_id, long option )<br />
Description<br />
<br />
This waits for one or all child processes to exit.<br />
Arguments	process_id<br />
	<br />
This returns the process number of the child process that exited. If no child <br />
exited, it returns 0. If there are no child processes, or if all child processes<br />
were already ended before the function was called, it returns -1.<br />
<br />
option	This can have one of the following values:<br />
<br />
WTHANG<br />
	<br />
If the parent process ignores child signals (see signal()), the function waits<br />
until all children have exited. The process_id argument returns the process ID<br />
of the last child process to exit.<br />
<br />
If the parent process does not ignore child signals (see signal()), the function<br />
waits until one child exits. The process_id argument returns the process ID of<br />
that child process.<br />
<br />
WTNOHANG<br />
<br />
If the parent process ignores child signals (see signal()), the function does<br />
not block. If one or more child processes have previously exited and are in a<br />
zombie state, the process_id argument returns the process of the last child<br />
process that exited.<br />
<br />
If the parent process does not ignore child signals (see signal()), the function<br />
waits until one child exits. The process_id argument returns the process ID of<br />
that child process.<br />
<br />
Return values<br />
<br />
The exit value (a string) of the child process identified by the process_id <br />
argument.<br />
<br />
If you make independent processes then you would be able to kill the parent process.<br />
<br />
Refer to the thread -<br />
<br />
Launching a Session from within a Session (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=22322&amp;highlight=process)<br />
<br />
The easier way to check is to see the process id's, groups and parent process ids from the start shell option.</div></div><hr />
