<br />
  In Baan V, The item domain tcitem is segmented with project.<br />
So... wherever this item needs to be selected... the project is always part of it, if project is present.<br />
<br />
It is possible that Item No. 100 in present in multiple Projects.. say A, B &amp; C<br />
So Item master tcibd001 will have records as..<br />
A  100<br />
B  100<br />
C  100<br />
    100<br />
<br />
How is it possible to create an index on only the Item segment ? <br />
<br />
I can select only the item segment programatically.. but can i create a index and be able to select only the item.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of creating a new domain with just the item length of say 38,<br />
add a new field to tcibd001, populate that field with the item segment values &amp; add a new index to the table.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there is a better way. All suggestions are welcome. Thanks<br />
<br />

<br />
 Thanks for your response. Thats a great workaround... but am limited to 16 characters. But this should work for now... but I'll eventually have to do something to utilize all the 38 characters or just shoot the user if he uses more than 16  :) <br />

<br />
One last shot, the Derived from Item field - is that by chance filled?  I thought it would fill with the base item, but I do see some on my test data that are not filled in.  Maybe it even fills with another project item, it's the domain tcitem as well, so not sure there.  Maybe check your data and see, our data is pretty unreliable.  It's also an index.<br />
<br />
Also, one of our clients did change the segementation from project / item to item / project.  Damned if you do damned if you don't on that one.  I think they eventually changed it back, too many other issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think i'll continue using the Search Key II .... and till such time.. the user is spared :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the replies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The field dfit is filled on request if you copy a standard item to a project item and you would like to keep the connection to the standard (has somthing afterward to do with requirements planning). Thats the way it behaved in Baan IV.<br />
So, I would not put values in that field, which are not for this purpos.<br />
