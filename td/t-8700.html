	I have two different problems related to Double data type, i.e. comparing doubles and grouping doubles, my requirement is some what specific so I want to make it. When I group &lt;see first query&gt; pric field, it will not give error but in the output it shows duplicate values. In the second query, it shows &quot;No data within selection&quot;, I tried greater than and less than funda as well as double.comp function but problem not yet solved, any help appreciable. Might be it is related to my tcpric properties problem. I have BaaN IV C4 with SP10.<br />

<br />
I think regarding your first query, can you try selecting tdpur041.pono in select / group by / order by statements?<br />
<br />
It seems like for the Supplier - Item - Order - UOM - Qty, there are multiple lines in the same PO with all these details same.. so mostly it will solve by including the PONO field.<br />
<br />
Regarding second query, <br />
<br />
1. check the domain of &quot;pric&quot; variable (Form / Program variable), it has to be same as that of your database field.<br />
<br />
2. In your where clause you are trying to equate the database field value with Screen field of &quot;From&quot; and hope you are giving the exact value for this field on screen (and not domain min / max value)<br />
<br />
Hope this may help you..!<br />

<br />
 Forget my queries, please give me tested examples of grouping and comparing double data type, I think that is enough for me.<br />
