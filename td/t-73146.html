<br />
I have created a new session to print the report and there are 1 input field &quot;f.backflush.date&quot; for users enter date.<br />
<br />
In script, I set default value of f.backflush.date is  today and users can select another date.<br />
<br />
When I try to print the report by manual it is worked well but when I print the report by use Job Data it show the error &quot;Form field (f.backflush.date) missing in Job Data&quot; <br />
<br />
Could you please advise how can I fix this?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

In 4c4 I could go and print the job data and see that the date was set.  For example date.f = date()-100 and date.t = date()+100.

Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
The date.f was not set in the job data but the date.f was set in choice as the below script only.<br />
<br />
field.f.backflush.date:<br />
before.display:<br />
	f.backflush.date = get.backflush.date()<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know how to set the date.f in the job data, could you please advise?<br />
<br />
Thank you.:):)<br />

<br />
choice.cont.process:<br />
on.choice:<br />
	check.all.input()<br />
	if job.process then<br />
                   â€¦..set variables needed...<br />
        endif<br />
        ...call report routine....</div></div><hr />
