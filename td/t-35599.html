<br />
Is there a way to specify which user name to be logged on with when using the default BW in OLE automation. <br />
<br />
Typically we can change users in command line in BW config. Is there a way to specify the command line in OLE automation?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help and support. <br />

Or maybe just add the command line to the .bwc file before running? Below are commands in one of my .bwc files - I could probably replace the command line with something different, save it, and launch it.  There might be another way but this is what popped into my head.<br />

[ApplicationServer]<br />
bse=/apps/baan/baaniv/bse<br />
bshell=bshell<br />
command=-- -set DDC_DELIMITER=| -set DDC_UPDATE=YES -set DDC_TIMER=9999 -set SITE=660<br />

The problem is two-fold:<br />
1. Baan Automation launches the BW file that is categorized as &quot;Default&quot; in BECS. So the possibility of having multiple BW configurations for different user names and passwords and being defaults is not possible. <br />
2. We are trying to launch this from a .NET script, so the possibility of changing the BW command line at runtime seems difficult. <br />
<br />
The objective is that each user that logs on to the .NET application and connects to Baan to update a table then this connection to Baan should use the user's Baan user name and password so that the audit on the changes is still retained in Baan. <br />
<br />
Can we configure the BW command line as an argument in OLE automation?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Well for (1) I did not know that - I have only used it in some VB code with Excel.  In using that I could specify which .bwc was used.  And (2) is out of my league.  I am not sure about the bw command line arguments - you might want to search the board for command line options.  I think I have a post book marked and when I get to work tomorrow I will look for it.</div></div><hr />

I will try and check out the possibility of launching specific bwc. Do you have sample code for the same?<br />
<br />
Do we just mention the class name as &quot;Baan.Application.&lt;specific&gt;&quot;?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

On the automation tab on the bwc file this is where I name them.</div></div><hr />
