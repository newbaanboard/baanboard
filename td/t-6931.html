<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have exported the sales budget(tdsst050) from Exchange in BaaN IV C4 and I have copied the new values exactly as the file exported file(old values plus new values) and saved it as a CSV file. <br />
     However, when I try to import the CSV file back via exchange, it keeps on accepting all the old values but rejecting the new values.<br />
     Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong and if I on theright track?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Abuibra,<br />
What does the log file say for the rejected records? A log file is created for every run of import and the directory for this file is defined in &quot;Maintain Exchange Schemes&quot;.<br />
Usually, the log file logs a mesasge no and the message can be read thru session &quot;Maintain Messages&quot; (ttadv4151m000).<br />
<br />
One common problem is that, if the ascii file field length is less than the corresponding field in BaaN, then it has to be padded with blanks either left or right as the domain of the BaaN field applies.<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />

box check marked for adds (Maintain Table relations form 2).<br />
<br />
<br />
In maitain field relations, do you have the field (values) marked<br />
as overwrite yes?<br />
<br />
just some suggestion to check out</div></div><hr />

The old value should bring up an error. You should get a hint from the error message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">1st October 2002, 02:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your quick response,however, I have already done all your suggestions, the prcoess goes through alright but it does not give out any error message. So usually after importing the file, I just checked with the log file and saw that the records have been rejected. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">1st October 2002, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Try exporting and importing without delimiter, ie fixed-width. I really can't explain the logic of this but it worked for me before.<br />
<br />
Another thing is, try importing with default instead of field values on suspect field...you should be able to narrow down which field gives you problem.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Hard as heck to understand some of it, because you see all the standard processing, but you should be able to see if it is reading your records properly, etc.</div></div><hr />
