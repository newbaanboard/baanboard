<br />
I'm using my own BaaN tables &amp; sessions/scripts, interacting with the BaaN Text facility.<br />
<br />
The message below appears when I delete all the text from the Notepad:<br />
<br />
The c:\baan\tmp\tmp..... file is empty and will be deleted.  This file cannot be saved because it is empty.<br />
<br />
If I try saving just a single space, this saves, but then doesn't allow you back in.<br />
<br />
So, I can't delete text.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've tried to add a button onto the screen with some code behind it in the script which does a &quot;TEXT.DELETE&quot; (a BaaN function), but this doesn't seem to work properly.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions please?</div></div><hr />

It seems to me after a patch we had a problem like this, but I do not remember the solution.  Also this was with Baan sessions.  Anyway maybe the code will help one of the real experts.<br />

<br />
Also, please check that you have the text field in your table where it is supposed to be writing, e.g.<br />
<br />
Maintain Session &gt; Text &gt; Maintain Available Text field by Session (ttadv2113s000).</div></div><hr />

We had the same problem.<br />
It happens when the text editor is different then the baan Text Editor.<br />
Check your BW version.<br />
<br />
If it doesnÂ’t work you can write a code which delete the code number from your table and delete the code tttxt010,tttxt001<br />
