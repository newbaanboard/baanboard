Thunk you for answers. We have found decision of the problem.</div></div><hr />

We created a screen for a different type of inventory counting (Baan doesn't handle it the way we need).  I'll try to give you a screen shot here to see if it is the kind of thing you are looking for.<br />
<br />
I saved it as 256 color BMP so it may look a little green, but you should get the idea.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the top fields are detail fields from the selected record below.  If this is what you are looking for, I can give some advice on setting it up (it was quite a while ago I wrote this so it might take me a few minutes to remember everything I did).<br />
<br />
Let me know.....</div></div><hr />

You could do it simply drawing a matrix in a corner of your form, filling this matrix with the infos you'd like to view in on.choice section of choice.mark.occur and displaying it with a display(&quot;field&quot;) (or a display.all() if you want to use several variables istead of a single matrix) in its after.choice  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Form is build from 2 separate forms ...the top form shows the orderlines, the lower form shows all orderline details....</div></div><hr />

You to create 2 sessions one for lines and another for detail forms. <br />
In that sessions you must switch control from one to another when an event occurs. Additionally you can transfer info about that event to reproduce it in list session.<br />

<br />
I disagree; it's too difficult and it could take too many times for this purpose.<br />
You have to choice this way if you need two different maintain forms with the possibility of marking some occurrence in both forms; but if you'd like to create just a little side of a form to display some infos you should do as explained above.</div></div><hr />
