<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">1st May 2005, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to use the domain SET definitions for bit operations where, if <br />
A is a member of a set, and B is an equivalent value, I can replace<br />
<br />
bit.long(A,B) by   A*B<br />
<br />
I refer you to the Baan function guide <br />
You can also use the mathematical operators +, -, and / for computing bit<br />
operations. The operands must be declared as variables of type SET. You can<br />
declare such a variable only with a domain declaration where the domain is of<br />
database type SET.<br />
* The operator + equates to the function bit.or().<br />
* The operator * equates to the function bit.and().<br />
* The operator / equates to the function bit.exor().<br />
* The operator - equates to a special form of the function bit.and(). That is, to a - b<br />
for sets equates to bit.and(a, bit.inv(b)) for longs. <br />
<br />
Can someone show me the declaration for a variable of type SET.<br />

Does big.and() bit.or() actually call a function or does the compiler generate inline code?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">2nd May 2005, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Leslie,<br />
you have to define a domain with data type 'set' in ttadv4500m000/ttadv4100s000 (sessions for Vc).<br />
After that you can declare your variable like <br />
(extern) domain domainname variable</div></div><hr />

Does big.and() bit.or() actually call a function or does the compiler generate inline code?<br />
<br />
Maybe it's delayed response  and u know what i write.<br />
<br />
'Set's are nothing but long (just like text numbers) . It represents a bit pattern  which is used to have enum-like field with multiple select option. (as against single select option for enums) .  From the value of  set (etol(setfield)) , u can decrypt the user selection e.g.<br />
<br />
if bit.and(etol(setfield),lpow(2,enumnumber -1)) then<br />
       set option is selected<br />
endif<br />
<br />
bit functions can not be used in select queries (thus making larger selects). However u can use the dynmic SQL  with IN clause if  u want database driver only to filter out records for u . <br />
<br />
We use set fields extensively where users need multiple selects for enum fields . <br />
<br />
As sets are actually long , u can only have maximum 32 options (2**32) . Sets with more than 32 options may not work.<br />
<br />
Thus bit functions are actually bshell functions which work directly on the bit image of  a long (4 bytes / 32 bits) and boolean algebra with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">25th May 2005, 02:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked if the bit.or, bit.and etc, were inline functions. That is, the interpretor determines that both arguements are long, and does the and/or,xor,not, or shift operations inline. <br />
<br />
I have written an application that sets 8 bits in a long, and with the appropriate masks, I query the condition. <br />
<br />
One idea I had was using the bit.and, bit.or to have seven bits set up as days of the week. Then the test for a monday or thursday, or any combination would easily be done with one bit.and() operation.<br />
<br />
I setup an enum as a set, but could not get the sets to work. I determined that the range of values to assign to sets consided of bit positions from 1 to 32. I did not pursue this further.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all for replying. If you have used sets, please email me or respond with a trivial example. I can take it from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th May 2005, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is an example .<br />
<br />
Table tihra100  has an enum field dayn of domain tcdynm (representing the 7 week days).<br />
<br />
If  the user wants to get records for any combination of these 7 days (in all 127 ) , from the table ,  u can use sets for that matter.<br />
<br />
U need to create a set (say tcdynms) for with same enum options . Each set option has the follwing values<br />
<br />
Sunday - 1<br />
Monday - 2<br />
Tuesday - 4<br />
Wednesday - 8<br />
Thursday - 16<br />
Friday - 32<br />
Satudrday 64 <br />
Total = 127 <br />
<br />
Now in program use a variable (say day_selection) of set domain to allow multiple select for 7 week days.<br />
<br />
In dynamic SQL or embedded SQL  u can use follwoing statement to know what are the set options selected by the user.<br />
<br />
if bit.and(etol(day_selection) , lpow(2,etol(tihra100.dayn)-1)) then<br />
	|day is selected in the set option by user<br />
else<br />
	|day is not selected.<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Hope this clarifies ur query . We have used this in our divisional reporting wherein users can ask and enquire results for any combination of about 10 divisions (about 1023 combinations).<br />
<br />
I am still not clear about ur question about interpreter . Bshell itself returns true or false based on the physical representation of the long arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">27th May 2005, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been more than successful in using bit operations on long variables. I would like to use the set options that the manual describes. But I was unable.<br />
<br />
When two variables, A, B, for example, have domain types of sets, the manual states that that an AND operation can be written as <br />
<br />
A*B    and an OR operation can be written as A+B, with A-B for symmetric differences. <br />
<br />
Since I could not get that to work, I ressorted to the bit.and(), bit.or() and other bit.x() operations.<br />
<br />
My question was, Does the interpretor actually call a function for bit.and() and the other bit.operations, or is it smart enough to generate the code in-line?<br />
<br />
My thanks to all who have responded to this question. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">28th May 2005, 06:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tested only the bit.and and bit.in functions . I have not tested the arithmetic expressions as illustrated in documentation . I take ur  experience as a guide not to  use arithmetic expressions bcos bit functions already are doing the same job (working as per documentation).<br />
<br />
My response to ur question also is based on documentation and i do not have exact knowledge how it works . According to me bshell (logic service  / interpreter whatever one calls ) compares the physical memory address (On-off status ) of longs in the argument and then returns the result . Think / guess , it does not call any other function internally.<br />
<br />
Probably some tools developer, can answer ur query in prescise manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">29th May 2005, 06:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
The question I was asking was whether these functions actually are called or are the instructions inline.<br />
<br />
Here is what I mean<br />
<br />
somewhere there is a declaration<br />
<br />
function bit.and (long arg1, long arg2)<br />
{<br />
   do what has to be done<br />
}<br />
<br />
or is it inline as the pseudo assembly code below suggests<br />
<br />
bit.and:<br />
         load   rega,arg1<br />
         and    rega,arg2<br />
         store  rega,result<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have the answer?<br />
