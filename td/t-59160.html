In attempting to use devices that are setup for ASCII or HTML output (rewrite devices), we have come into a problem where I use the HTML Baan device and set the path to \\server\folder\filename.ext but no out put is generated in that location.  I've checked premissions and through Windows Explorer I can create a new file in that location.  I've also encapsulated the path in single and double quotes to see if that worked, but the file isn't placed in the location specified.<br />
<br />
The file does appear (intact) in the our $BSE\common directory on the Baan server.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone provide some insight?  Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

Maybe something new in your version, but on ours we had to use ttstpconv to get the converted html file - then we had to move it to the client(or client mapped directories).  I only did this to test this to see if html reports would solve a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On our server, the path in ttaad3100m000 uses the drive letter as if you were running it from the server e.g.<br />
<br />
e:\reports<br />
<br />
Thinking back, I don't think \\server\folder format worked.</div></div><hr />
