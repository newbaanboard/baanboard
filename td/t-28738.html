Hi, <br />
<br />
How to assign this timestamp field? I mean in the SQL Server or the Baan Development UI?<br />
<br />
And I wonder should I really add a timestamp field to the table? I seldom saw such a field in other tables originally existing in the system. (Note: the name of the table I made is NOT &quot;ttadv436&quot;!)<br />
<br />
ThanX &amp; Regards</div></div><hr />

I think that something is wrong in your tools. Do you have installed tools solutions? if yes check if it was needed to do a reconfig of the tools tables (create RDD for  TOOLS)<br />

I checked our LN environment and there is no tools table ttadv436. Did you create that table yourself? If so, you are not supposed to create/modify tools tables. ttadv5213m000 is the session for Runtime for Tools and not ttadv5210m000 - which is Create Runtime DD (non-Tools, Application Packages).<br />
You have to be explicit, how did you generate this error. <br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
I searhed my disk and found files &quot;dttadv436&quot; with a size of 7kb and &quot;oadv436&quot; with a size of 6kb. I don't know how them exist. actually we didn't create this table. And they contain some functions we didn't touch before. So I guest that perhaps it was added in from a certain patch, if you are sure there is no such a table in your LN environment. Yet the strangest thing is I can't find the corresponding table in the database. I really in confusion now.:o</div></div><hr />

We are on Porting Set 7.6a.02, with SP1 and latest tools patches. This table/object might have been part of FP2 or FP3. You didn't specify this information in your posting. If this is a core Tools issue, are you working with your local BaaN Support?</div></div><hr />

The problem had been solved. what nidyar said is right, but I didn't actually understand the meaning of his words, as I am a begginer. Thanks nidyar! Also thanks all that offer me help!:)</div></div><hr />
