<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">26th November 2002, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I am receiving the following error:<br />
<br />
Fatal error : object 0 in process 62 not found<br />
<br />
I debugged and the error occurs in my session script between the following two lines:<br />
<br />
input(&quot;tdobg010.frgt&quot;)<br />
input(&quot;tdobg010.prft&quot;)<br />
<br />
I am in Baan IVc4 and am creating my own session to hold a tracking number and yes/no toggle if a shipment was sent premium freight or not.  <br />
<br />
The form is a type 3.  <br />
The packingslip, order number, position number, and sequence are header (index) information.  These two fields (above) are not multi-occuring fields, so I set them as input only on the form and am using the above commands in the after.input: section of the packing slip field.<br />
<br />
Is there a log I can view to see what the problem is?  Or can anyone point out what lunk-headed mistake I'm making.  I've never really developed with a customized form type 3 before, and could easily have made a mistake I'm not aware of.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">26th November 2002, 23:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm..you are using the input only option on the form, and the input() function to force the input.  I have not played with that - is there a reason?  <br />
<br />
If not, the standard is to declare these fields on the form as just input, not input only.   On the form is the option for multi-occurance or not.  If they are declared as input, not input only, you do not need the 'input()' function to get the user to the field, it's all controlled by the standard program.  No coding required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">26th November 2002, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">O..if they are not view fields, and you still want to make them single occurance, like in hours accounting...?  You need the command in the before program:<br />
<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
	single.fields.on.mocc.form(&quot;tdobg010.frgt&quot;, &quot;tdobg010.prft&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
You also have to mark the current record you are on, at least that is how they do it in hours accounting.  Then, when you are ready to go to that field, use the to.field(...) command.</div></div><hr />
