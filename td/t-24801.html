<br />
How is session ttdsk2003m000 (Change company) able to change the company of the user?  I want to create a custom session that does something similar.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Francis</div></div><hr />

<br />
But those functions only change the company for the duration of that session/script.  I need to create a session that changes the user's company the same way that ttdsk2003m000 does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">9th August 2005, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Francis, this is not possible, the program has an internal hardcoding to check if its started from menu browser or worktop or webtop. If true changes the global company for the connection else it does not change and you will still be in the same company.<br />
<br />
what are you trying to do ?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just read NP's post.  Seems like something hard coded - may not even be possible via an API.  NP - do you know what exactly is hard coded?  if it's checking a variable that is read/write, maybe it can be faked out...?</div></div><hr />

I do wonder how the Change Company script manages to change the global company for the connection.  Some undocumented function perhaps?<br />
<br />
I have found a workaround.  What I'll do is have the custom session call switch.to.company, look up the user's startup menu and zoom to/activate that menu.  So it'll open up a new window with the user's startup menu in the target company.  Not quite as clean, but it'll suffice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">9th August 2005, 23:20</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, it may be that the Change Company session is able to change the session globally because it is a subsession.  If a parent session launches a child session, and the child session calls switch.to.company, would that change the company of the parent session?  In the case of Change company, the parent is the menu browser.  Somehow Baan allows ttdsk2003m000 to be run as a subsession, when you can't normally run subsessions from the menu.</div></div><hr />

I have already tried AFS/tools dll calls, worked with BaaN support and I do not have any solution yet. The functions which are called to change the global company have some internal hard coding to check for &quot;ttdskbbrower&quot;, worktop/webtop interfaces. <br />

Your idea would work only in BaaN-4 and not in all the BaaN-5 series with Worktop because the zoom.to$() is depreciated and a menu can no longer be started. <br />
Alternatively, you can use the BW command option: -set BSE_COMPNR=100<br />
and make different BWCs to log into different companies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am more curious about your requirement but following code worked for me for a display session.<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
	domain	tdstr3	comp<br />
|********* form section **********************************<br />
choice.user.0:<br />
on.choice:<br />
	comp=zoom.to$(&quot;ttdsk2003m000&quot;, Z.SESSION, &quot;&quot;, comp, 0 )<br />
	switch.to.company(lval(comp))<br />
	display.all()<br />
	execute(find.data)<br />
<br />
