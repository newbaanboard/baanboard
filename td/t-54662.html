afaik there is no easy method to define a session that has to be executed when a bshell ends.<br />
If your users should work with the ascii interface instead of GUI, then it will be easy to alter their shell profile and add a session after ba6.1 is called. Like:<br />
---old .profile---<br />
BSE=/baan/bse<br />
export BSE<br />
BSE_TMP=$BSE/tmp<br />
export BSE_TMP<br />
PATH=$PATH:$BSE/bin<br />
ba6.1<br />
exit<br />
---end old .profile---<br />
add between ba6.1 and exit:<br />
TERM=vt100<br />
export TERM<br />
BAMODE=1<br />
export BAMODE<br />
ba6.1 SESSIONNAME  2&gt; /dev/null<br />
<br />
I can't think of an easy way to do something similar with the GUI.<br />
What about monitoring user activity (e.g. every 5 Minutes) with a script and starting the session once you notice a user that has logged out?<br />

Yes monitoring 3GL session as a startup session is definitely a way . U can check jwx9999 in (Replicate FS objects across servers  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=10551) ) for an example . I think 5 mins delay is too long . We used to copy changed script / programs to remote server with such monitoring program every second (suspend 1000 ) , and it has given great results to us.</div></div><hr />
