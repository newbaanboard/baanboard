I am currently working with the Report Designer in Infor LN 10.7. I would like to hide fields and their headline if the content of the data field is empty. How can I implement this?<br />

Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th February 2021, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I don't think I ever hid a report field on its own.  In 4c4 I did have sessions where based off the data(or user selections) I would sent it to different reports with different formats.  Now if I want to clear a heading (Normally I would change it) I would use the print expresssion on the field. So I would make the heading lets say a string field. I would then use a print expression - like if hours.weekly&gt;0 ? &quot;Weekly hrs&quot; : &quot;Daily Hours&quot;. This would allow me to change the column heading and I could do the same for the data column in the report.  I don't recall setting a column to like &quot;&quot;, but the same could be done here.  <br />
<br />
Of course I just noticed it is LN so wait - LN might have a much better solution.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
If you are talking about the Report Personalization, find a screenshot I've attached. <br />
Select the field you want, set the print condition as per your requirement. <br />
<br />
Note that, this personalization is on user level.6875</div></div><hr />
