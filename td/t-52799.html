<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_player</div><div class="date">19th June 2008, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All<br />
<br />
I have a question regarding report printing in Multiple languages.<br />
<br />
Eg. If I am printing Statement of Account report for a range of BPs say BP1 - BP5, and <br />
BP1 language is English an<br />
BP2 is French <br />
BP3 is English<br />
BP4 is English and<br />
BP5 is French... so on<br />
<br />
and when my selection range is BP1 - BP5, i want to print Statement of Account of BP1, BP3 and BP4 in English and BP2 and BP5 in French.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to do that without changing the selection range i.e just in 1 print click?  <br />
Is thr any other option for this??<br />
Because selecting the language in 'Select Device' session for every BP would be very time consuming.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oleska</div><div class="date">19th June 2008, 19:15</div></div><div class="posttext">one of the options is to make your lables dynamic, based on the language of your BP.<br />
Another option is to get device and then pass it to report function in the script and then call report based on the language.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Oleg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_player</div><div class="date">19th June 2008, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot Oleg<br />
<br />
But can you please elaborate little more the options that you have suggested.<br />
I am not very clear on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oleska</div><div class="date">19th June 2008, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">dynamic lables:<br />
<br />
in report editor instead of  lables you use fields. Ex. variable bp.name, in the script you populate bp.name based on the language.<br />
<br />
separeate report per language:<br />
<br />
use brp commands.<br />
<br />
id1 = brp.open( &quot;language 1&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, 1 )<br />
id2 = brp.open.language( &quot;language 2&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, 1 )<br />
<br />
if language 1<br />
brp.ready( id1 )<br />
else<br />
brp.ready( id2 )<br />
<br />
brp.close( id1 )  <br />
brp.close( id2 )<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope it's clear. good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">20th June 2008, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You can even connect the report in different languages to each other. In that case the layouts are linked, modifications in f.i. language 1 will automatically be ported to the other languages ( just compile ). The labels are dynamically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">20th June 2008, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Jp, all you said is valid for Baan IV, but in Baan LN reports are only dinamically connected. You cannot have different layouts for each language, only the labels changes. <br />
You only compile the report. This is valid for all languages.<br />
To have different layout scheme for each language, you have to do different report names...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">20th June 2008, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't say that layouts can be different when reports in different languages are connected to each other. As you mentioned, only the labels are dynamically in that case. The same goes for Baan IV. Building reports in LN isn't very different from Baan IV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">22nd June 2008, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">No, Jp I said that in baan IV report layouts can be different for each language (As you said, the field &quot;link to language&quot; could be filled or not). <br />
In Baan LN this possibility doesn't exists. If you want different layouts for the same report in combination of language you cannot use the same report code.</div></div><hr />
