<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">23rd July 2008, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">With certain Terms of Deliveries our company is responsible for paying freight, which we then will pass on as a freight charge to the customer.  <br />
<br />
We have been asked to notify the user when they are entering a quote that the customer's term of delivery requires a freight charge.  <br />
<br />
We do not own source code, nor do we have access to QKey, so the 2-3 lines of code that it would take to conditionally pop a message up to the user when certain Terms of Delivery are used on a quotation is not an option.<br />
<br />
I’ve investigated the option of automating the zoom functionality on certain fields to zoom out to a hidden sub-session which will conditionally pop the message up based on the Term of Delivery, but since all of the fields I would use to place this automatic zoom on also have ‘standard’ zoom functionality, I would be creating a scenario where the standard field zoom would execute whether the user would want it to or not (in addition to the requested functional enhancement).<br />
<br />
Are there any other tricks which could be used?  I have thought of these other possible options:<br />
<br />
 Nightly audit report (after the fact)<br />
 DB based trigger to send e-mail when no freight line is added to quote (after the fact)<br />
 Pre-session which user would enter the customer number which would go through checks, display any necessary messages, then pass control to the Maintain Quotations screen.<br />
 Mimic of Maintain Quotations session which will then use AFS to pass values to the real Maintain Quotations session and then take the user to the Maintain Quotation Lines session.<br />
<br />
<br />
The first two aren't the best as they may force the user to go back into the quote instead of notifying them ahead of time.  The third I liked, but the user's didn't.  The forth option could be done but cost/benefit isn't there.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm being too picky about options... personally I think that it would be the quotation's officer's job responsiblity to check the Term of Payment and though their supervisor agrees wtih me, he still wants the functionality.<br />
<br />
Anybody have any other 'easy' suggestions that I missed?  If there aren't I think I'm going to push for option 3.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">23rd July 2008, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">If u have to check the small functionality only at the time of say insert , u can still use zoom to hidden session functionality. In that hidden session u have to import choice and compare it with add.set. In case of modify.set or dupl.occur u can still use the standard zoom.to functionality  using zoom.to$ function in before.program of  hidden session and  storing the return value of zoom.to$ to exit.val$ of the hidden session. <br />
<br />
U can also use empty procesinfo$ variable in all session to intiailize/re-initialize at appropriate events.<br />
<br />
4th  option to have pre-entry AFS  session is  ok but it will require more efforts .</div></div><hr />

Thank you all for your suggestions.  I have looked into george7a's option and it is fantastic!</div></div><hr />
