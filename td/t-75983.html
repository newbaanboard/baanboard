10.7 OP.<br />
<br />
Main table Z, has reference to table X  (combined field) 'mandatory unless empty'.<br />
<br />
Session based on Main table Z contains a field from referenced table X.<br />
<br />
- Field X.abcd displays correctly <br />
- Field X.abcd is available in 'filter' option of session (BECS)<br />
<br />
However, in 'filter - define sort' option, the field is not available.  What is causing this?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me try, You say table X has field abcd with a reference from table Z to table X (say field Z.key1 = X.key1)<br />
In session &quot;Filters&quot; [ttadv9593m000] in bw you can select field X.abcd and set a condition.<br />
This implies the field is visible and can be filtered on although is is added to your session via the reference from Z to X (on field key1).<br />
You do not mention if field X.abcd is part of (any) index on table X. Is that the case?<br />
<br />
But to be able to use field X.abcd as a sort field, then more is needed.<br />
<br />
For using a field of table Z in the sort option, you would have to set the index use in the session: Maintain Sessions, select Specific, Indices... &quot;Available Indices by Session&quot; [ttadv2101s000] There you can change the sort order and availability of keys on the (main)table.<br />
<br />
Normally it is not possible to sort on a secondary table due to the internal links that are needed to achieve that. There is an undocumented (!) function &quot;query.extend.order&quot; to change the sort order of a session (which works fine when applied on the fields in the maintable itself).<br />
<br />
I had one situation where I would sort on field non index field X.sort based on the reference from Z.key1 = X.key1. Table Z used an attribute name which was defined in table X, as Z.attr = X.attr and display order as X.sort.<br />
I used query.extend.order in the past with moderate success to sort (like you want) on (in my case a non-index) field of a secondary table. (Had to fix the TIV to a low level to have something sorted).<br />
<br />
Infor Support urged me to use query.define.sort.order (&quot;new&quot; since TIV 1900) instead. But this can only be used when the field in the secondary table is in any index, as far as I understood.<br />
<br />
In my case the problem is that LN-UI would show wrong data, even with a low TIV fixed.</div></div><hr />
