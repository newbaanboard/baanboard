Implementing HTML UI support<br />
Introduction<br />
As HTMLUI does not support functionality that requires a higher privilege level on the client, some client access functions are not allowed anymore. Calls to these functions have to be replaced with other client access functions which are allowed to be used when running in HTMLUI mode. Also, when a session has fields on its form for specifying a client file or client folder, these fields have to be hidden when running in HTMLUI mode. <br />
<br />
unsupported client functions in HTMLUI mode<br />
The following functions are not supported when the client runs in HTMLUI mode:<br />
<br />
client2server() <br />
server2client() <br />
create.local.file() <br />
create.local.directory() <br />
dir.select.dialog.local() <br />
get.client.directory() <br />
get.client.hostname() <br />
get.local.filename() <br />
remove.local.directory() <br />
remove.local.file() <br />
seq.fstat.local() <br />
seq.open.dialog.local() <br />
seq.open.dialog.next() <br />
seq.saveas.dialog.local() <br />
start.application.local() <br />
When one of these functions is used while running in HTMLUI mode, the following message appear:<br />
<br />
This function is not supported in the HTMLUI WebUI: &lt;function&gt;<br />
<br />
HTMLUI client functions<br />
The following functions have to be used when the client runs in HTMLUI mode:<br />
<br />
Single file functions:<br />
<br />
client.upload.file <br />
client.download.file <br />
client.show.file <br />
Multiple file functions:<br />
<br />
client.prepare.download <br />
client.add.download.file <br />
client.start.download <br />
client.upload.files <br />
client.get.upload.filecount <br />
client.get.upload.file <br />
client.delete.upload.file.object <br />
Assisting functions:<br />
<br />
get.ui.mode() <br />
tc.is.html.ui() <br />
tc.is.thin.client() <br />
client.get.media.type <br />
When one of the HTMLUI client functions is used while NOT running in HTMLUI mode, the following message appear:<br />
<br />
This function is not supported in the WebUI: &lt;function&gt;<br />
<br />
HTMLUI detection<br />
Two functions are available to detect whether a session should run in HTMLUI mode<br />
<br />
get.ui.mode() <br />
tc.is.html.ui() <br />
Implement HTMLUI support<br />
To Support HTMLUI, the developer has to:<br />
<br />
Cleanup the UI of the session by hiding form fields used for entering a client file or a client folder. Note: also remove checks of these fields (check.input or DAL is.valid hook) <br />
Implement an alternative path for accessing client files based on legitmate HTMLUI functions. <br />
Restrictions to HTMLUI support:<br />
<br />
Starting a client application without a file is no longer supported. <br />
It strongly depends on teh user (as the user is in control when HTMLUI) whether a client application is opened. <br />
Hiding form fields<br />
Characteristics: session allows user to specify a file on the client. The entered client path is used to access (create, open, etc) a file on the client machine <br />
<br />
before.program<br />
The location to hide the fields is the before.program section of the UI-script. Add the following code in this section with the appropriate field names: <br />
<br />
if tc.is.html.ui() then<br />
	inputfield.invisible(&quot;&lt;name of field 1&gt;&quot;)<br />
	inputfield.invisible(&quot;&lt;name of field 2&gt;&quot;)  ... etc<br />
endifSkip validation of hidden fields<br />
Although you've hidden the field, validation checks might still go off. Use the tc.is.html.ui() function to check the UI-mode and only validate these fields if the UI-mode is not HTMLUI. E.g.: <br />
<br />
field.curr.impf:<br />
check.input:<br />
	string	impf.dir(255) mb<br />
	string	impf.file(255) mb<br />
	long	size<br />
	<br />
	if tc.is.html.ui() then<br />
		if isspace(curr.impf) then<br />
			set.input.error(&quot;ttadv227006&quot;)<br />
			|* Enter (correct) path.<br />
		endif<br />
	endifDisplaying File alternative<br />
Characteristics: session displays a file with server2client followed by start.application.local.<br />
<br />
The construction usally looks something like:<br />
<br />
if server2client(aServerFile, aClientFile, textMode) = 0 then<br />
	aClientApplication = &quot;anApplication.exe&quot;<br />
	start.application.local(aClientApplication &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; <br />
			quoted.string(aClientFile), aWaitFlag, someExitCode)<br />
endifDisplaying a file in HTMLUI mode can be done using one of the following two functions:<br />
<br />
client.show.file <br />
client.download.file- followed by the user opening the downloaded file <br />
The main differences between these functions are:<br />
<br />
client.download.file shows a dialog in whitch the user can choose to download the file. client.show.file does not show a dialog but directly shows or downloads the file. <br />
client.download.file waits until the user closes the download dialog. client.show.file returns immediately. The actual file transfer to the client is done later so the file cannot be removed immediately after client.show.file returns. The optional parameter &quot;remove.after.download&quot; of client.show.file can be used to control automatic removal of the server file after the file has been downloaded by the client. <br />
client.show.file will show some browser recognized file types immediately inside the browser. client.download.file will always download the file to the client file system. <br />
Browsers typically recognizes files with the following file extensions:<br />
<br />
.txt - mime type: text/plain <br />
.pdf - mime type: application/pdf <br />
.htm(l) - mime type: text/html, <br />
images - mime type: image/* <br />
Note<br />
it is highly recommended to use client.show.file(). Using the client.show.file() results in the file being streamed to the browser directly without the download question being ask. <br />
<br />
HTML support - for other file types than .txt, .pdf and .htm(l) and images<br />
For commonly used extensions (e.g. .xlsx, .docx) the client will most likely have an application associated with the file extension. For unknown file extensions, the user will be asked which application to associate with the file extension of the downloaded file. When the user decides to open the file, the associated application will automatically be launched to open the file. The HTMLUI support code will look something like: <br />
<br />
if tc.is.html.ui() then<br />
	client.show.file(aServerFile, false, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, aMimeType) <br />
else<br />
	… original code as depicted in the box above<br />
endifNote<br />
Either the file extension of the file name should be set correctly (e.g. “.txt”) or the mime type should be set accordingly (e.g. “text/plain”). This enables the client running in HTMLUI to use the correct application for opening the file.<br />
<br />
HTML support - for .txt, .pdf and htm(l) and images<br />
For files with a.txt, .pdf, htm(l) and images extension, the file can be streamed to the browser without actually downloading the file. This means that the user will not be asked explicitly for the download. This function automatically shows the content of the file in a new tab or a new browser. <br />
<br />
if tc.is.html.ui() then<br />
	client.show.file(aServerFile, aNewWindow, aTitle, aMimeType) <br />
else<br />
	… original code …<br />
endifNote<br />
this variant may open a separate window when aNewWindow is set to true.<br />
<br />
Editing File alternative<br />
Characteristics: copy a server file to the client with server2client followed by start.application.local to edit the file and copy the changed file back to the server with client2server <br />
<br />
The construction is usually something like:<br />
<br />
if server2client(aServerFile, aClientFile, textMode) = 0 then<br />
	aClientApplication = “anApplication.exe”<br />
	start.application.local(aClientApplication &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp;<br />
			quoted.string(aClientFile), aWaitFlag, someExitCode)<br />
	client2server(aClientFile, aServerFile, textMode, true)<br />
endifThe Single action for editing has to be replace with two actions:<br />
<br />
An action to download the file from the server to the client. Afterwards the user can edit the file with the appropriate application. <br />
An action to upload the changed file from the client to the server. <br />
HTMLUI support - download/edit part<br />
if tc.is.html.ui() then<br />
	client.download.file(aServerFile, aMimeType)<br />
else<br />
	… original code as depicted in the box above<br />
endif	HTMLUI support - download zipped archive<br />
long	handle<br />
<br />
if tc.is.html.ui() then<br />
	| Zip files and directories in file with .zip extension<br />
	handle = zipinfo.new(aServerZipFile)<br />
	zipinfo.add(handle, aServerFile1)<br />
	zipinfo.add(handle, aServerFile2)<br />
	zipinfo.add(handle, aServerDirectory1)<br />
	zipinfo.add(handle, aServerDirectory2)<br />
	zipfile.build(handle)<br />
	zipinfo.delete(handle)<br />
<br />
	| Delete intermediate zipfile <br />
	client.show.file(aServerZipFile, false, ””, ””, ””, ””, true)<br />
else<br />
	… original code as depicted in the box above<br />
endif	HTML support - upload part<br />
The upload part requires the following two changes:<br />
<br />
a form command implementation that will upload the file from the client back to the server. <br />
a command on the session/form to call this implementation. This command is only available if the client is running in HTMLUI mode. <br />
The form command implementation will look something like:<br />
<br />
Function extern upload.file()<br />
{<br />
	client.upload.file(aServerFile, theSelectedClientFile, aMimeType)<br />
}		or with uploading a zip archive<br />
<br />
Function extern upload.and.unzip.archive()<br />
{<br />
	client.upload.file(aServerArchive, aServerZipFile)<br />
	zipfile.extract(aServerZipFile, theRootSelectedArchive)<br />
	| Delete intermediate extracted zipfile<br />
	file.rm(aServerZipFile)<br />
}		Note<br />
there is a risk that the server file was changed in the mean time. Uploading an old version of the file will overwrite these changes. When implementing this two phased (i.e. download/upload) approach for editing a file, a mechanism should be added to determine whether the server file has been changed in the meantime. If a changed server file is detected, the user should be warned and ask to continue before performing the actual upload. <br />
<br />
The form command can be removed from the session by:<br />
<br />
after.form.read:<br />
	if not tc.is.html.ui() then<br />
		remove.form.commands(&quot;upload.file&quot;)<br />
	endif	GBF<br />
GBF is fully supported in HTML UI but there is one usage pattern which is difficult to support in HTML UI. Node descriptions in a tabular manner in BW only works when using fixed-sized fonts. (all characters have the same width) <br />
<br />
Using a fixed-sized font is archieved in Worktop/BW due to the fact that the application passes the value: GBF.OPT.FONT.FIXED in the gbf.init() call. <br />
<br />
In case of Webui, the WebUI is not able to determine the column bounderies.<br />
<br />
HTML support - use fixed fonts (not recommended)<br />
By using fixed width fonts in HTML-UI for GBF descriptions, the alignment of the characters in the description remains correct. As described above, this can be achieved by performing a gbf.init() call with the GBF.OPT.FONT.FIXED passed. However, fixed width fonts are not that pretty to and might even harm the overall look and feel of the UI. <br />
<br />
HTML support - use variable width fonts (recommended)<br />
To display descriptions in a tabular manner with variable width fonts, the function gbf.desc.to.column() can be used.<br />
<br />
So, whenever the gbf.add.object is called with a ‘formatted’ description (see example below:<br />
<br />
func.ret = gbf.add.object(where.used.key,<br />
		sprintf$(&quot;%4d %3d %47s %15s %13.4g %3d %6s &quot;&amp;<br />
		&quot;%u002 %U001 %6s %u002 %U001 &quot;,<br />
		tibom010.pono,tibom010.seqn,<br />
		tibom010.mitm, tcibd001.dsca(1;15),<br />
		tibom010.qana, tibom010.opno, tibom010.efco,<br />
		tibom010.indt, tibom010.indt,<br />
		tibom010.exco, tibom010.exdt, tibom010.exdt),<br />
		WHERE.VAL, GBF.LEAF, par.leaf.val, 0, 0, 0,<br />
		MASK.TOOLS, line.col, line.style)	the call must be changed into:<br />
<br />
func.ret = gbf.add.object(where.used.key,<br />
		gbf.desc.to.column(<br />
		tibom010.pono,tibom010.seqn,<br />
		tibom010.mitm, tcibd001.dsca(1;15),<br />
		tibom010.qana, tibom010.opno, tibom010.efco,<br />
		tibom010.indt, tibom010.indt,<br />
		tibom010.exco, tibom010.exdt, tibom010.exdt),<br />
		WHERE.VAL, GBF.LEAF, par.leaf.val, 0, 0, 0,<br />
		MASK.TOOLS, line.col, line.style)Note<br />
as gbf.desc.to.column also works for other UIs (e.g. bw, webUI, workspace), there is no need use tc.is.html.ui() to check client mode. <br />

Just trying to understand the thread above. To read one on client can I use client.upload.file()?<br />
The third argument here is filename, and then it returns server side file name? What should be given  as third argument in client.upload.file ?<br />

There I posted two simple routines I'm using to upload or download a file within the LNUI. And Benito did some additional debugging to find out, what’s supposed to be in the parameters.<br />
<br />
I'm using the download routine to display CDF files in Excel. But you need to configure your browser to start Excel, when you download a CDF file.</div></div><hr />
