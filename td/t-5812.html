<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ken bohnenkamp</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I am creating a table that will have at least 125 fields in it. It will probably be over 700 bytes long. It will most likely have 4 indexes. I use Informix on a unix box. What will be the overhead with a table like this. It may have 20,000 records. Will processing suffer if I am running reports, forms and queries against this table. What will response time be like. Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just going by your table specs I wouldn't be too concerned, there are (as Richard points out) bigger tables in Baan.<br />

Remember though that normalizing is a thing of the past, and that it sometimes does pay performance to break tables up.</div></div><hr />
