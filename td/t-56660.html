<br />
I'm new to baan and to this board, so I hope this is the correct section.<br />
<br />
I'm a system admin and have been asked if it would be possible to launch multiple sessions through a macro or something.<br />
<br />
Typically some users, when they arrive to work in the morning, they go through the process of starting multiple sessions which they use through out the day.  The same sessions (12 of them) are launched manually.<br />
<br />
Is there a macro or somewhere I can configure so when a user logs in, automatically the most common sessions are launched?<br />
<br />
I know I can setup &quot;Key map settings&quot; so they can launch sessions by pressing F1..F2..F3 etc..<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

That was the incorrect forum - we will try this forum and see what hits you get.  What we did was create a different version of run program - but they start this session and then pick the sessions they want to run.  Nothing automatic about it.  I know you can launch one session with the .bwc client, but not how to do mutliple sessions.</div></div><hr />

They manually launch all those every morning and use through out the day, and if the Laptop Crashes or for whatever reason they have to re-boot during the day its a pain to re-launch all those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now if I have similar questions like this which forum/thread should I post in?<br />
<br />
For example, I wont to know how to add an item in the main Baan Browser window, we had a training session and we ran out of time and never covered the topic.</div></div><hr />
