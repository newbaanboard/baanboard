<br />
There is an inbuilt progress indicator in baan IV .Check object ottstpprogress .It contains functions for creating and manipulating progress indicator  .Only thing one has to do is to calculate percentage in script.<br />
<br />
ottstpprogress must be linked as dll for program script.</div></div><hr />

Now if you want to include an example of how you used ottstpprogress then that makes if a different story - with a really good example I could move it back to the code and utilities forum, but as it stands this is only a coding tip or recommendation.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Is this available now . If yes , which SP it is made available . <br />
<br />
Also if u can post a sample code , it will be great .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kysersoze12</div><div class="date">26th March 2007, 07:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys I thought it was enough to specify the standard object ostpprogress .<br />
<br />
Any way as you requested I have created a small code to show use of inbuilt progress bar functions .<br />
<br />
ottstpprogress must be included as DLL .<br />
<br />
functions from this library are:-<br />
create.progress.indicator()<br />
change.progress.indicator()<br />
destroy.progress.indicator()<br />
<br />
Do bic_info on ottstpprogress to learn what parameters and return values mean from above function .<br />
<br />
I can't tell from which service pack it is available as I am a developer and never worked as baan administrator.Check your ottstp folder for the ostpprogress dll.<br />
<br />
I hope it works for all who use it .</div></div><hr />

Have u run the same successfully at ur end . If yes , tell me  the object date from bic_info .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">26th March 2007, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure if this session is available in BaaN-4 or not. You can use ttpmc2460m000 - Print Solution/Patch History based on component type and code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but this is definitively an old story.<br />
<br />
For Baan IV, it seems the best solution to use ottdllinstall, see this thread:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=12849&amp;highlight=ottdllinstall<br />
<br />
The code posted above gives (at least on my system) 3 errors for each loop, about: Fatal error: object ... in process ... not found.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kysersoze12</div><div class="date">26th March 2007, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Comment following lines in above script .<br />
<br />
| window.id = create.status.bar(current.window())<br />
| if window.id &gt;= 0 then		<br />
|	child.id = create.status.field(window.id,&quot;Testing field&quot;,100)<br />
| endif	<br />
<br />
They are not required .dllinstall has nothing to do with this topic .<br />
Only ottstpprogress is required .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kysersoze12</div><div class="date">26th March 2007, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Please don't use above mentioned script .I m reposting the script without any confusing code .I am attaching the screenshot of how progress indicator looks like .The ostpprogress.txt is a result of bic_info on ottstpprogress .<br />
Currently we are using sp18 .I am not sure about performance of these functions .<br />
<br />
<br />
I have also attached image(progress1.jpg) of progress bar which I created 1 year ago  using graphics functions .<br />
<br />
Thanx for your replies .</div></div><hr />
