<br />
Iam trying to convert the dyanamic tdpur4404m000 to normal session.<br />
<br />
When I copied the components and started the session, only one form is displayed(the session has two forms).<br />
<br />
Does anybody has any ideas how I should do this conversion.<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

There is a session to convert regular sessions to dynamic, but not dynamic to regular.  I think that will be more manual.<br />
<br />
Using 'd' for dynamic and 'm' and 's' for normal multi and single occurance forms - <br />
If you have just copied the 'd' version to 'm' and 's' versions of the components, that's fine for the session, but the form and script are not the same.  A dynamic form has only one form number for any number of forms it displays.  You may have to create or generate multiple forms to replace the dynamic one.   Remember to attach all the forms to the session so it can see them all.<br />
<br />
Then, in the script, dynamic forms use 'groups' instead of 'form.1' etc.  You may have to change the script to match normal forms as well.</div></div><hr />

But try changing the Value of  the flag &quot;Dynamic Session&quot; from Yes to NO in the form grouping named &quot;Session Behaviour&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is just a guess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 00:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure where you are stuck in the process, what have you done so far and what problems are you seeing?<br />
<br />
The form will not directly copy - it is stored completely different from dynamic to regular.  Dynamic is done using a VB editor, and regular uses the Baan Forms editor.  Baan Editor creates forms exactly how you see them in the editor, each field start / end position is stored, etc.  Dynamic forms only have 1 form, and define all the fields and groups in the one form.  How that gets displayed is 'dynamic', so it can't know how many forms it will be displaying in the end.   It's a completely different concept.  So that is why you are seeing only 1 form attached to the session, but displaying many.  To convert your dynamic form to normal, I think there is not a session.  You would have to recreate the forms using the normal editor and attach these forms to your session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 00:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Also should mention, because they are dynamic, dynamic sessions take the place of multiple normal sessions.  They can display to the user as a Multi Occurance or Single Occurance session depending on how they are called.<br />
<br />
To convert the dynamic to a normal session, you would need to know all the uses of the dynamic session, and create a new static session for each use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">O..the group sections.  You need to first create the forms, so you know which form each group really falls on.  Then, the group sections are generally converted to form.x sections.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kevobr</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know if you are aware but the tdpur4404m000 session was not dynamic at 5C release, it must have been changed as part of one of service packs, looks like after service pack 2 at least.<br />
<br />
So on our system we have both sets of forms etc..<br />
Guess it all depends on which version of Baan you are.<br />
<br />
If you don't have them then probably best to create the forms from fresh, it shouldn't take long and you can check all the field conditions on the dynamic form so you shouldn't miss any important bits.</div></div><hr />
