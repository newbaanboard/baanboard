<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">15th February 2002, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Only two sources of 'help':<br />
<br />
- The On-Line help from the menu (The Chart Manager help really clears up certain basic fundamental details).<br />
- Study one of the existing programs that display the graph and 'skim off' what will be of use to your situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ramchand50</div><div class="date">1st March 2002, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Even though there is lot of information about CHM functions in BaaN help, there is nothing that talks clearly about the procedure.   <br />
<br />
I have tried using the sample script given in the help text, but it is throwing up lot of errors while compiling (please see the attached file).<br />
<br />
Any inputs would be highly helpful.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">2nd March 2002, 02:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is one more place to refer to:<br />
<br />
the INCLUDE file 'tccom0000 - Chart Manager Interface Functions'.<br />
<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to stick to 4GL. With the help of the above include, and one of the SFC Graph sessions as reference (I do not remember the session ID - possibly tisfc07xxm000), the entire code should be of fairly reasonable size, and all of it in 4GL. <br />
<br />
In the example SFC session, IGNORE all the coding related to the VTxxx terminal interface. (It is exceeding 1000 lines mainly because of all the code to put the 'x's on the VTxxx (green monster) terminals. The code necessary for GUI is less than a couple of hundred lines). In fact, here is what you can do: Put the session in debug and step through to isolate the functions that you will need. Since you will be executing in BW, only BW related route will be executed. Based on that study, create your own program logic.</div></div><hr />

It is supposed to be considered training material.  But when has Baan every really published good training material.  It does however provide some detail that you may find helpfull. It is also part of knowledge quest.</div></div><hr />
