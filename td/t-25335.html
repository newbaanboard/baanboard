<br />
I have a (multi-occ+view+main) form where users want to zoom from the primary key field to another session. This field isn't as an input field, since is the primary key.<br />
<br />
Good sample of this is, sesson tirou2110m000 Mantain Routings. User wants to zoom from the Manufactured Item field.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Is there any problem making it input field.</div></div><hr />

If the modify only is the problem, you can put the following in the before.program section, if you have the source (or a wrapper tool to add to the source).<br />
<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
    modify.prim.key = 1<br />
<br />
<br />
By default this is set to 0 - do not allow modify.  <br />
<br />
It's not perfect, as they move back and forth they loose the ability to get into that field, but generally it works.<br />
<br />
Another option would, instead of making a field level zoom, instead make a button that requires them to have 1 and only 1 record marked and then zooms based on that record.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hitesh Shah, it is an Input field already, but BaaN when is a key field it does grey out the field automatically and you can't zoom.<br />
<br />
lbencic, by doing this, it let me zoom in the position field not in the Manufacturing Item field.<br />
<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
    modify.prim.key = 1<br />
<br />
<br />
For now, my work around is. In the zooming option from the Manufacturing Item field, I changed the session to the one I want zoom to and with the find button it opens the session I want. My session is a sub session where the user is not allow to navigate with the group arrow keys nor insert a new group .<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Maybe some misunderstanding  . I thought it's a display field .<br />
<br />
U should try modify.prim.key in the before.form section of the form instead of before.program. It allows u to input / zoom on index field .</div></div><hr />
