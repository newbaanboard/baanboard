<br />
i want to create a new index, maybe with query extension, in a session script. The session is a new session custom, i cannot use the index of the main table and i can't create a new index on the table because the table is standard and we want to be cloud ready..<br />
<br />
(the session is based on BP on header, while in rows there are orders, positions and sequences and i wanted to order by the last ones).</div></div><hr />

<br />
What we do (since we are stuck on 4c4 - 1 more day and baan is shutdown basically) - is we create an extension table.  So lets say we want to take tiitm001 and query by lets say production code.  So we build tiudi001 (extension table) - we then use qkey(code extender) so when they make a change on the item master it is reflected in our extension table.  Then we build an index a second index on our table - which would be product code, item.  Then we can search our table with our index and then link it to tiitm001 to get any fields we need.  We no longer modify any standard table in baan - even for an index.  We might have 1 left that was done during conversion, but that is it.</div></div><hr />
