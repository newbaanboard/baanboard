<br />
Is there any report script function which I can use to close the report from report script itself. I have tried rprt_close(), but it does not work also it does not give any error message.<br />
<br />
Please guide.<br />

<br />
Normally, it should be closed from the session that printed the report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VishalMistry</div><div class="date">9th December 2010, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason is user should not be able to print the purchase requisition if certain item sub-entity data is missing. What I want is once all the data is thrown into the report, a message will be displayed and the report will be closed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">9th December 2010, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand right you have two options:<br />
1) Edit the report so that it doesn't show the classified data in the report. Do not exit, just print all other data.<br />
2) Don't &quot;throw&quot; all the data to the report, &quot;throw&quot; that parts that you need from with in the print session.</div></div><hr />

Do you want to prevent user from taking printout or you want stop Baan report from showing any data?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VishalMistry</div><div class="date">16th December 2010, 07:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Yes. I want to prevent the user from taking print-out (even if the report is fully thrown to the device user selected). Please advice. I have tried end(), stop() and exit() but no luck.<br />

You can use long brp.open( string rep_name(16), string device(14), long mode )instead of rprt_open()<br />
<br />
Check last argument (long mode) of this function. It works as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
mode<br />
0          User is not prompted to select a spooler device.<br />
<br />
1          A window is displayed in which the user can select a spooler device. <br />
            Cancel button enables the user to cancel the operation. <br />
<br />
2          A window is displayed in which the user can select a spooler device.<br />
            There is no option for canceling the operation.<br />
 <br />
<br />
What you can do in you code is:<br />
<br />
       ....<br />
       ....<br />
       ....<br />
choice.print.data:<br />
on.choice:<br />
       if some.condition() then<br />
               brpid = brp.open(&quot;rppmmm0000000&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, 0)<br />
       else<br />
               brpid = brp.open(&quot;rppmmm0000000&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, 1)<br />
       endif<br />
       ....<br />
       ....<br />
       ....<br />
<br />
<br />
So when some.condition is  TRUE, user will not be able to select device. Instead program will choose display device (&quot;D&quot; or any device defined at your end which can not be sent to printer) for report. User, hence, will not be able to take print-out. <br />
<br />
When some.condition is FALSE, user will be able to select the device and can take printout.<br />
<br />
This will <br />
1. eliminate the need of closing the report. <br />
2. allow the user to view and verify the report even if he can not print.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alternatively use pstat function to query sub-process list to bshell and then kill the processes like ttstpsplclose/ ttstpdisplay etc if existing and it's parent etc are matching .</div></div><hr />

<br />
i  have done the same thing  , that is i have killed a report  in <br />
after.report: ,   because the report was running in a job  and mailing an empty report with header printing. <br />
<br />
few question are in my mind.... can please clarify them. <br />
will there be any dangerous effect ?<br />
and  will it created any garbage files(required files) on Server.<br />
<br />
i  assume that when a report is opened there should be a format  file created in the server which is feed to device which in turn prints the report.(please correct me if i am wrong.)<br />
<br />
and yes  if there is any other please let me know<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Vamsi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">13th October 2012, 22:51</div></div><div class="posttext">No need to kill within the report script.  Check condition in before report, setting a local boolean variable.  Check the variable (or add to an existing) in the expression of every layout.  Nothing will print and the report will be closed properly by the caller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamsi_gujjula</div><div class="date">14th October 2012, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">:)  thxs, will try it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When u create report , temporary file is created in tmp folder and spool record is created in device queue . Barring this nothing is affected. <br />
<br />
But there are better ways to tackle the situations rather than this . So such method may be used as last resort if other legitimate methods are exhausted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamsi_gujjula</div><div class="date">24th October 2012, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys,<br />
<br />
Actually  i forgot to mention .. there already exists a report script .<br />
details layout already has a selection(suppressing some records).<br />
and other thing that this is a easySQL query running in a job.<br />
<br />
As BaanInOhio suggested , i tried setting a variable .... but what happens is  an empty nodepad (lets assume the device is notepad) is opened .<br />
<br />
i just want it to act as it does when no record is selected.  ie. &quot;no record with in selection&quot;<br />
<br />
Any more suggestion..please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">29th October 2012, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">No data within selection will come only if rprt_sends are not executed in program run and rprt_close is encountered . Data filtered in report through lattr.print = false , can not give no data within selection and empty notepad will come.</div></div><hr />
