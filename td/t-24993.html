<br />
After 7 years of programming in Baan IV, I'm now facing with programming some Triton applications. And I recognize a strange behaviour on *some* sessions that generate reports when I run the reports onto the screen (say: device D or DL). <br />
<br />
a) for some sessions, the report output automatically &quot;pops&quot; in the foreground - okay.<br />
<br />
b) for some other sessions, I have to press ESC B to get that &quot;Ba6.0 Menu&quot; popup; here I have to select &quot;switch to another screen&quot;  and select ttstpdisplay -- hmh.<br />
<br />
Is that quite normal? Is there something that has to be kept in mind?<br />
<br />
Btw. I think there is no code necessary, because it looks quite normal -- rprt_open() / rprt_send() / rprt_close().<br />

<br />
We too have generate/release outbound with this behaviour in BW .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, no idea for sure, but can you check the section that opens the report.  I remember back in Triton that either it was not allowed or it acted funny if you opened the report directly from the choice.cont.process: section, instead of calling the execute(print.data), and opening the report in the choice.print.data section...</div></div><hr />

My co-worker found the problem and it is rather simple and will make you feel rather stupid.  On form 1 of Maintain Sessions, change the start option.  It is most likely on 23 - print.data.  I changed mine to 7 - refresh and done deal it works fine. Just thought I would share this.<br />

Thanks,<br />
