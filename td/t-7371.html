<br />
When commands that interact with files and directories specify the host ! path variables such as below:<br />
<br />
mkdir( &quot;host1!/usr/mydir&quot; )<br />
<br />
how can you get this to work to check the client's PC for the directory?<br />
<br />
I want to check the client for a c:\temp directory.  If one does not exist, then I'd like to create one.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
I tried to use the dir.present() function in odllfilehand, but that only seems to work on the server.  I also tried mkdir.rem() and mkdir() but those again only put a directory named 'c:\temp' on our baan server...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

At one time I had a product call WinRCP(or something like that) and it would let me type commands on the unix box and create directories.  Also the 2 hosts had to be trusted hosts.  Since the unix group tighted down things about 2 years ago I can no longer do this. <br />
<br />
Not sure if this will work in your case, but can you always send it to the baan\tmp directory?  What you could do is create a domain that holds this directory, pull it into the programs, then download the file there. Then if they ever change were Baan is installed you could just change the domain.<br />
<br />
There was another thread about doing the remote mkdir, but I do not think that it was ever solved.<br />

Please refer to the following posting -<br />
<br />
create.local.directory()  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=26072#post26072)<br />
<br />
But I am not sure if it works in your BaaN version or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks NPRao!<br />
<br />
I have another question...<br />
<br />
I can create the local directory, copy my file to that directory, and even start the application associated with the file (.PDF for example) with no problem except...<br />
<br />
If, in my example, Adobe Acrobat is already open with another .PDF document I get an error.  Does anyone know if there is a way to avoid this?  I've been playing around with it for a while and can't find a way to detect if the application is already open.  I can if I originally opened it through Baan.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I could think to do was post a warning message to the user before opening it.</div></div><hr />

I never tried but checking at the Acrobat help I found this option.</div></div><hr />
