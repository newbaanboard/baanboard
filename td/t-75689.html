Using Baan IV becs client tool ...<br />
Does anyone have an idea how to use the Query menu command from Labels Tools in order to get all the labels with label description like '%Company%' ?<br />
For example, 'Company', 'Original company', etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th March 2023, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Use something like .*Company.*  - of course company will have to have the right case.  So this should find anything with Company in it, but will not find company.  At least that is how I recall it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tion1976</div><div class="date">7th March 2023, 10:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark. That works. I wonder now how to modify in order to get both company and Company (with respect to capital letters). Anyway the answer is useful.<br />
PS:  I thought the form takes the SQL special signs for LIKE operator (that is, % instead of *)</div></div><hr />

Back in the day depending on what I was doing I just might write an easy sql to query the tables that way - still using like .* in the like portion of the query.</div></div><hr />
