We are printing Item barcodes (Type : Code 39) using Zebra printer. While scanning these barcodes with scanner -Symbol LS2208, unable to scan the barcodes if barcode text length is greater than 11. If the length is less than or equal to 11 the scanning is done properly. The same scanner is being used to scan Code 128 barcodes printed from some other applications successfully. I have checked Item barcodes with type Code128 also but experiencing similar issue. Would any one help to resolve this issue? <br />
<br />
Code used to create barcode is<br />
  barcode = chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp; &quot;)#&quot; &amp; chr$(32 + item.length) &amp; strip$(shiftl$(tcibd001.item)) where item.length is the length of  field tcibd001.item.<br />

I know we had problems when items contained certain characters - like + or /.  I had to write a little routine to process the item.  And also make sure that barcode field is long enough for all the characters. Plus is item.length only the actual characters of the item? Or is it possible always 32(or your item size).<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I have not used escape sequences in forever so I am not familiar with what you laid out. Probably not much help but this is what popped into my mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, if you are using a zebra printer, you need to program the barcode and everything else in ZPL (Zebra Programming Languages).<br />
<br />
The approach I use is as follows:<br />
- Generate a report session as usual, with all the fields that are needed in the label - make sure to generate a type two or type one report<br />
- Repaint the report layout using the ZPL commands.<br />
Attached file gives an example of a zebra label that prints two or three fields and the barcodes for a couple of these fields. All the fields that are FFFFFFFFFFF... are the standard BAAN fields. Everything else is ZPL.<br />
<br />
You can download the ZPL Programmer's manual from the ZEBRA website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th May 2009, 22:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Here I was thinking about a normal printer and not a tag printer.  In that case I recommend using RMCis label software - it was cheap and pretty easy to setup and I did not have to do the ZPL coding needed to design a label.  Shah_bs is correct about the ZPL coding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use Zebra Z4M Plus(code 39) , as we print barcodes using bwprint - it works fine.<br />
i do not understand the necessity of the code below.<br />
<br />
Code used to create barcode is<br />
barcode = chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp; &quot;)#&quot; &amp; chr$(32 + item.length) &amp; strip$(shiftl$(tcibd001.item)) where item.length is the length of field tcibd001.item.<br />
<br />
just trim and print - it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vidya_giree</div><div class="date">16th May 2009, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for the quick responses....We are able to scan Code 128 barcodes with little bigger size without any ZPL programming...(in the code provided instead of the string &quot;)#&quot; use &quot;*$&quot;). But we need to print Code 39  barcodes which are not getting scanned if item.length &gt;11 . item.length can have values up to 38. Checked with different barcode height and aspect ratio but couldn't scan. Scanner has set up Code 39 to read full length. Any idea why it happens??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th May 2009, 01:48</div></div><div class="posttext">ZPL programming is used for printing the labels on a zebra printer.  Without that then anything that prints would be suspect. I know of no other way to generate bar codes on a zebra printer.<br />
<br />
So to test the scanners download a microsoft barcode 3 of 9 font.  Install into microsoft word.  Then generate some barcodes on a normal printer.  Then check these with the scanner.  They should scan.  If they do then that means the bar code you are generating has the issue.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
i'm missing the third parameter for the barcode ?<br />
<br />
This sequence is used while printing barcode with bwprint.<br />
(For Zebra use ZPL language)<br />
<br />
barcode = chr$(27)&amp;chr$(27)&amp;&quot;type - hight - number of characters in string&quot; &amp;barcodevariable<br />
<br />
Built the 3rd parameter in a library like:<br />
<br />
if len(shiftl$(shiftr$(tcibd001.item)) = 1 then<br />
bclenght = &quot;)#!&quot;<br />
endif<br />
if len(shiftl$(shiftr$(tcibd001.item)) = 2 then<br />
bclenght = &quot;)#&quot;&quot;<br />
endif<br />
if len(shiftl$(shiftr$(tcibd001.item)) = 3 then<br />
bclenght = &quot;)##&quot;<br />
endif<br />
a.s.o<br />
<br />
barcode = chr$(27)&amp;chr$(22)&amp;bclength&amp;(shiftl$(shiftr$(tcibd001.item))<br />
<br />
Refer to Infor QuickGuide 1310<br />
<br />
