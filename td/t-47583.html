  <br />
I am working with Baan IVc.  <br />
  <br />
I am making a interface of the Sales Orders (with AFS), but I have a problem when the sales order header was created but the sales order lines were not created (for the functional validations of BaaNEPR) then I should delete the sales order header but I suppose that have dependences for other tables.  <br />
  <br />
I have investigated and I found that I can do it by DAL with dal.destroy(), but I don't know how do use it?, in the topic   <br />
How does the table know what does the row to delete?  <br />
  <br />
Can somebody help me with an use example?  <br />
  <br />
Any ideas??</div></div><hr />

dal.destroy is used to delete a database record. Here is the documentation:<br />

I hope it helps,<br />

Hi George,<br />
  <br />
This link I have visited, but my principal question is How does the dal.destroy() know what should row to delete. I thinks that first I should look for the selected line.  <br />
<br />
is it correct?<br />
<br />
Thank's for your advice<br />
<br />
Greetings,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rberti</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi gget79, its correct. You must point the row to be destroyed. U can use a select or just fill the primary key fields.<br />
<br />

DAL is Tools feature from the Baan-5 version onwards and not available in Baan-4 or below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rajeshk</div><div class="date">2nd February 2008, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">NPRao is correct. No DAL below B5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dilipk.pandey</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, DAL is available BaanV owards(DAL) and enhanced in ERP LN with wider scope to server the needs (DAL2 or extended DAL)...but you want to understand the function flow, so that later if you want you can use it in later versions, here it is:<br />
<br />
Function flow<br />
<br />
When the DAL is used to manipulate the database, the main steps involved are as follows:<br />
<br />
1.The user issues a command through the user interface to access a record in the database.<br />
2.The 4GL engine loads the appropriate DAL (DAL DLL has the same name as the table name, and it gets invoked automatically ) and calls the hooks in the DAL to check the integrity rules for the object.<br />
3.If the particular database action is permitted, the 4GL engine issues the appropriate database call.<br />
4.Recorde set is identified and accordinglly action is taken.After the database has been updated, the DAL can perform further checks to determine whether or not data is passed back to the user interface.<br />
5.The 4GL engine passes data back to the user interface (provided that the integrity rules permit this).<br />
<br />
<br />
This is how it works...if you want to go into details, kindly refer the prgrammer's guide...<br />
<br />

You do not need to know the dependancies using AFS.</div></div><hr />
