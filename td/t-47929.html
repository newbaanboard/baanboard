<br />
We have a device that outputs the results of a report to a shared folder.<br />
When using this device, we can specify the filename. If I put in the filename as ${LOGNAME}.txt, the resulting file name will be machineName.txt.<br />
I am actually looking at putting, instead of the LOGNAME, a date-time stamp.<br />
<br />
Anyboby knows how to do that - I need to replace the ${LOGNAME} with another...tried a lot of stuff - ${DATE} - ${TIME} - nothing works out.<br />
<br />
Can't find anything in the docs or other threads<br />
<br />
Help! :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th February 2008, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">My first thought is to write your own device driver - instead of using ttstpconv, use your new device driver.  Then you can manipulate the filename anyway you want - you can see an example of replacing ttstpconv in the code and utilities forum.  <br />
<br />
My second thought is that after the session script prompts for device you can always close it down, reset the filename and re-open the report with the new spool.filename.<br />
<br />
As far as I now the ${variable} are pulling environment variables from the login shell - in my case a UNIX login.  That makes things like ${HOME} and ${LOGNAME} work with is set at the OS level.  I am not aware of anything on my system in the environment variables.<br />
<br />
Of course you might want to complete your profile to include the OS of the server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll take a look the sample code. I'll play around with it.<br />
Can I assume that this code does exactly as the standard ttstpconv?<br />
<br />
I updated my profile as well...:)<br />
<br />
Tks</div></div><hr />
