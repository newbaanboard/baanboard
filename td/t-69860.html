<br />
Can you please let us know if it is possible to trigger the standard LN sessions from the custom sessions created in LN extensions.<br />
We are looking for a functionality which is similar to using AFS in BAAN Vc for triggering the standard session.<br />
<br />
For example, we create a new custom session in LN Studio from which we need to call the standard Sales Quotes session (tdsls8310m000) to automatically create the quotations in LN.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

You can call the DLL from your custom session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you talking about the standard session DLL which is created using ttstpcreatdll ?<br />
<br />
Is this supported in LN 10.5 ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

some restrictions for AFS with MT-Sessions<br />
Multi Table Overview<br />
In order to support editing multiple tables, so called 'secondary tables' are introduced.<br />
Secondary tables have a 1:1 relation with the main table. It is not required that there<br />
is a database reference from the maintable to the secondary table.<br />
However it must be possible to fetch a secondary table record through a 4GL-Engine<br />
query extend. Such a fetch must result in zero or one secondary table record.<br />
Comparable to the functionality for the main table, the 4GL-Engine will handle<br />
transactions / reads etc. for secondary tables. A secondary table requires that a DAL2<br />
implementation is available for that table. It will not be possible to use<br />
unmodified 'old' sessions in a MT way. At least some parts of the UI script for the session must change.<br />
<br />
Specific Requirements<br />
<br />
The query.extend functionality must be handled very carefully. For secondary tables to work properly, it is<br />
necessary to add the complete secondary table record to the session query. Selecting only a part of<br />
the fields will result in data loss. (Fields that are not present in the query will be emptied on save).<br />
Furthermore, the query.extend REPLACE construction must be kept in mind. In the current design<br />
no measures are taken to protect the coupling with secondary tables. A query.extend REPLACE<br />
will destroy the coupling to a secondary table (if the developer doesn’t add the secondary tables as previous).<br />
Also care must be taken to use the “UNREF CLEAR” construction in the query.extend.where clause.<br />
The 4GL-Engine requires that when no reference to a secondary table record is found, the related record buffer is cleared.<br />
<br />
When in a DAL script of a secondary table, the corresponding record from the maintable is needed, special<br />
care must be taken to prevent that the DAL of the secondary table overwrites the maintable record which<br />
is already read (and perhaps modified) by the 4GL-Engine. When a new secondary table record is added<br />
within the same transaction with the addition of a new maintable record, the DAL script of the secondary<br />
table record cannot yet fetch this maintable record from the database. Both above mentioned issues will<br />
be handled using the existing function: dal.get.object(). In the DAL script of the secondary table, the<br />
function dal.get.object() must be called to get the required maintable record. The implementation of<br />
this function will make sure that when the keyfields match with the keyfields of the current maintable<br />
record in the 4GL-Engine, no read from the database is done. Instead the 4GL-Engine maintained record is made actual.<br />
<br />
The following standard program features are handled differently for secondary tables.<br />
<br />
The 4GL-Engine will not generate the queries for retrieving and updating the secondary table records.<br />
The UI script of the application is responsible for passing the correct queries to the 4GL-Engine through<br />
the query.extend functions.<br />
Maintain references and related reference buffers. The UI script of the application is responsible<br />
for filling reference fields referred to by secondary table fields (for instance descriptions).<br />
Secondary tables without DAL2 scripts are not supported.<br />
Auto complete in BW mode will not be available for secondary table fields.<br />
Filters cannot use secondary table fields.<br />
Secondary table fields cannot be shown above the grid as view fields.<br />
The sort order is always based upon the available main table indices and not on secondary table indices.<br />
Running MT sessions through application functionserver (AFS) is not supported.<br />
When a main table record is deleted related secondary table records are not automatically deleted by the 4GL-Engine.<br />
The DAL of the main table is responsible for cleanup of related secondary table records.<br />
<br />
AFS functionality is available on LN, but<br />
Use DAL or UE !<br />
