<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolslp</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Our Baab version : B40 C4 service pack 8.<br />
Oracle v 8.1.7.4<br />
Porting set 6.1.C.06.04<br />
Server: Sun SF 3800 Solaris 8 6 CPU 750 Mhz.<br />
Baan Driver level 2.<br />
<br />
After test migration we noticed heavy cpu load, which decreases total performace of a whole system.<br />
Oracle uses approx. 30% of CPU, the rest 70 goes for Baan. <br />
From Oracle point system works fine, and no waits for io was detected.<br />
Did anyone face such a performance problem. Could you recomend some performace hints and solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssellens</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
We have a SunFire V880 with 4x750 cpu's Oracle 8.1.7.2 so this might help.  Check your db_resource file:<br />
<br />
I have taken these ones out, it helped for some reason;<br />
<br />
#rds_full:<br />
#ora_init:<br />
#ora_max_array_fetch:<br />
#ora_max_array_insert:<br />
#retained_cursors:<br />
#max_free_cursors:<br />
<br />
Then there is the ora_storage file, make a ora_storage2 file and put the defaults in there only i.e.<br />
<br />
   *:*:T:group:0214:5:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE baandata INITRANS 3 <br />
   *:*:I:group:0214:5:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE baanindex INITRANS 3<br />
<br />
This will be read when Baan makes a call to the tables, rather than going through the whole of ora_storage with its individual table settings, which is used when extending the tables.<br />
<br />
Also check your optimizer setting in Oracle, our is set to 'choose' , then there is the SGA, how big is it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope some of this helps.<br />
<br />

<br />
When you say you are having performance problems are they across the board? <br />
<br />
There are a huge number of possibilities for this and some more background will help narrow this down.<br />
<br />
This also makes me think that the moderators could build an FAQ on Oracle tuning that will answer this question.<br />
<br />
As to sselens response, be careful with this suggestion on the db_resource file.  Certain activities will do well with the defaults, others may suffer.  Also, the ora_storage file is not used when extending tables, only when creating tables.  <br />
<br />
There are a number of good threads on Oracle Performance which I would suggest searching the board for these.  <br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />

<br />
James is right, there are a huge number of possibilities for this, however if Oracle performance is OK, but Baan is slow I would look at the interface first.  Also don't make the mistake of looking at to many things at once for the problem, this will only complicate the issue.<br />
<br />
Hope you are able to sort this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">29th November 2002, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that 70% of CPU power is used by Baan doesn't say anything about a good or bad performance. When using e.g. PCF a lot the CPU utilisation could be huge (especially when forgetting to run in object mode).<br />
<br />
Maybe a good opertunity to follow Jim's Performance class? ;) <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">30th November 2002, 01:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely agree that the interface point between Baan and oracle is often the cause of the problem.  But if toolslp's system was just migrated from BISAM to Oracle then, yes, performance could be worse for a given session and CPU utilization would look high.<br />
<br />
Overall Oracle perf issues can easily be caused by general settings like the optimizer_max_permutations not being set or statistics not being properly generated.  <br />
<br />
As soon as we hear more about the original problem, I am sure that BaanBoard will rally and help out this situation :) <br />
