<br />
I am trying to print lables for Inventory Transfer, the fields are<br />
Item, Desc, qty, warehouse order, selection code2, location and sorted asc on location.<br />
<br />
There is only one 'detail' in which Multi Columns property is set  as 'Horizontal order' and<br />
<br />
Top Margin           0<br />
Bottom Margin      0<br />
Left Margin           0<br />
Foot Margin         -1<br />
Nr. of Multi Col      4<br />
Page Length        -1<br />
Page Width       150<br />
<br />
But when I prints this report it automatically leaves some top margin on the labels A4 sheet and on each row the data automatically gets scrolled up side.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions.......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this once this before. This is a dot matrix printer.<br />
<br />
For example<br />
I have set the paper settings for the printer as say 5 X 6 CM i.e. each label size<br />
Then page length I have set as some value between 8-12. I arrived at a perfect value thro trial and error<br />
Rest are OK<br />
<br />
Now since page length is few lines it treats each label as a paper and doesn't roll the entire paper every time.<br />
<br />
You have to do lot of trials before u arrive at a perfect setting</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you have done that is for DMP for continuational stationary of lables size 8x12cms. I have also done this for DMP printing.<br />
<br />
But here, I have to print these lables on A4 stickers sheets.  I have set all the parameters of layouts as mentioned in the previous post. But still its leaving some margin.<br />
<br />
I have tried many different combinations of page lenght and page width but still :( ....<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me..<br />

Also try with some definite page length instead of giving as -1. May be somewhere between 62-72 might help. I guess A4 by default will keep some margin.</div></div><hr />
