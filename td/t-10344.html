If you need some changes, then better customize the session, provided it is a report!!<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

If you can post your exact requirement, someone or other might help you out with a work around.<br />
<br />
Most of the cases, even if scripts is available, it is not advisible to modify Baan standard script.<br />

<br />
Baans standard script does almost everything needed to read/write to the database and GUI.  You do not get the source for this.<br />
<br />
The user scripts has all the business logic for the sessions.  This includes field validations like selling price &gt; purchase price.  You need to purchase this source code.<br />
<br />
It is possible to over ride the functions in the user script if that is what you want to do.  <br />
<br />
Please provide an explaination of what you want to accomplish.</div></div><hr />

Is it possible you posted this last year?  I have not seen an instance where someone could post with another user name.<br />
<br />
Unless - when did you open your account?  Maybe someone else had the name last year and removed..?</div></div><hr />
