<br />
does anybody know, to which table &quot;attr.rotate&quot; actually is pointing? &quot;BaanHelp&quot; writes something about &quot;currency table&quot;! Is that tcmcs002? I don't think so, because I tried it with &quot;tfacp100.amth&quot; and get no &quot;out of range&quot; for the index. &quot;tfacp100.amth&quot; is an array of three fields. tcmcs002 has much more entries than 3? I can't imagine that there is a relation.<br />
IMO there could be a relation to the fields &quot;local currency&quot;, &quot;report currency1&quot; and &quot;report currency2&quot; in tcemm170!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madan.meegada</div><div class="date">19th July 2007, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan Help it is not mentioned that attr.rotate is directly linked with tcmcs002 table.  There is no relation between tcmcs002 and attr.rotate.  In fact, Baan Help says as follows: &quot;Use this function to create and fill the multicurrency table&quot;.  As per my knowledge, attr.rotate is linked with tcemm170 values.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In sessions where you have a multi currency field, you can switch on the standard command for rotating the currencies.<br />
Tools keeps track of an internal array, which you should fill yourself in preferably the before.program section. <br />
This internal array is filled with the function set.currencies(), see the programmer's manual for a good explanation.<br />
Note that most tcemm.dll5000 functions which determine the home currencies of a certain company (tcemm170) always internally call the tool's function set.currencies(), so that this array is filled and can be used in the UI script.<br />
<br />
The variable attr.rotate is filled with the current array number and the variable attr.currency$ is filled with the currency code on that position.<br />

<br />
thanks for your support. So I think the table which Baan uses for that ist tcemm170.<br />
<br />
But is there a standard command for rotating currencies? Are you sure, that is also on Baan 5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">25th July 2007, 09:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Also in Baan5 this works the same. On a form you can switch on the standard command for rotating currency. The form field itself needs to have the element set to -1. After this the rotate currency command is enabled.<br />
The tools function set.currencies() works also the same. Attr.currency$ gives the currency code on the current position in the array and attr.rotate gives the position in that array.<br />
Normally all tcemm functies will call the set.currencies function for you and the array is filled with the home currencies from tcemm170.<br />
<br />

<br />
I see, you mean the &quot;standard command: rotate.curr&quot; not one of the commands in ttadv3110s000 (standard commands for the form)! <br />
<br />
OK thanks a lot,<br />
