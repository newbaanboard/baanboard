The complie is the same. when you dump it using export session (ttiex1280m000) you can use the &quot;witout sourse&quot; option.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to export it. just delete the script (after yo back it up) and save but don't compile. Then the object will be there but the source won't. You can also remove the source file from under the application directory.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

That's all.</div></div><hr />

1. Who are the &quot;others&quot; you trying to hide the source from?<br />
<br />
2. If you like to do the BaaN style of delivering only objects, then you can export only the objects as George suggested. If you are using PMC Delivery Tools, then you use only &quot;script/library object&quot; in the component type to build your PMC solutions. <br />
<br />
3. If you have your own development VRC, you can edit and compile anytime you want. You can remove the VRC/Package/Module authorizations for other users if you don't want them to change/view your source code.<br />
<br />
You have to be clear on what you are trying to do.</div></div><hr />
