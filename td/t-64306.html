<br />
Do you think it is possible to import Bom and Routing information into BaaN from an external data source such as Microsoft Excel.<br />
<br />
Has anyone tested this and what complications or challenges have they faced?<br />
<br />
Just a request from my users and so not sure if it is possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, its possible to import BOM/Routing data from Excel. You can either use AFS (Function Server) to create API and import based on the CSV file or you can use Exchange Schemes, I am not sure if its Available with 4c4 but I guess its available. <br />
<br />
GO through the  Similar Threads on the Board for the same. <br />

<br />
Importing BOM and routing into the system from excel file in doable. I've been doing this quite some time for customers using exchange module.<br />
<br />
You need to setup new scheme, adjust asci file fields, map them into fields in a new batch, compile scheme, and execute.<br />
<br />
You need to be aware to set up the right data type for input fields, use the correct character encoding, separate char.</div></div><hr />

I will try and see if there is any documentation on it on the Infor website, but if this method works, it will make some people very happy campers.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to provide me with any further information you may have regarding this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">22nd July 2013, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You might try the office integration solution as well. With that you can export directly to excel and import as well. One of my customers is doing a routing update with this. However that in Baan5c.<br />
<br />
For the office intergration you need to have open world adapter (tmboaserver) installed and licensed. It's my experience that this solution is not very well capable of doing large number of uploads but for a small number it should be working fine.<br />
<br />
