<br />
I have created a query to view data between 2 companies through Oracle SQL Developer.<br />
<br />
select <br />
a.t$sorn&quot;320 S.O. #&quot;, a.t$orno&quot;320 P.O.&quot;, <br />
a.t$pono&quot;Line #&quot;, a.t$cprj&quot;320 P.O. Prj. #&quot;, <br />
c.t$refa&quot;320 P.O. Ref A&quot;, <br />
b.t$orno&quot;325 S.O. #&quot;, b.t$cprj&quot;325 Proj #&quot;, <br />
d.t$refa&quot;325 S.O. REF A&quot;<br />
from <br />
baandb.ttdpur041320 a, <br />
baandb.ttdsls041325 b, <br />
baandb.ttdpur040320 c,<br />
baandb.ttdsls040325 d <br />
where<br />
a.t$cprj = b.t$eseq and<br />
a.t$orno = c.t$orno and<br />
b.t$orno = d.t$orno and<br />
b.t$eseq &gt; '       '<br />
order by a.t$sorn;<br />
<br />
The query works for what the users want to see, now I have to try and get this into a print session in Baan.<br />
<br />
I have re-written queries from Oracle SQl Developer into Baan before but never multi company ones.<br />
<br />
Is this possible to do ?  I'm not sure how to proceed with the multi company references ....</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use the &quot;_compnr&quot; field to select the company you want. Read about it here:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_database_handling_company_numbers<br />
<br />
You can then use &quot;exists&quot; keyword to check if the record occured in both SQLs. There is an examlpe in the following link:<br />

<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks george7a, I'll try and work through the query and see what happens ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dilipk.pandey</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used compnr and it worked successfully...here is a bit more about what George has suggested, just thought to share with you.<br />
<br />
Company Numbers-The company number which is used during the execution of a BAAN 4GL query is the current value of the company number. The company number is:<br />
- the default company number ( defined in the session &quot;Maintain User Data&quot; ) <br />
- a company number specified by the compnr.check function.<br />
<br />
To be able to use different company numbers, a new field is<br />
introduced, called &lt;table&gt;._compnr. This field specifies the<br />
actual company number of the table. When this field is undefined,<br />
the current company number is taken. 'Undefined' is denoted by<br />
the value -1.<br />
<br />
When a record is selected with 'select &lt;table&gt;.*', the field<br />
&lt;table&gt;._compnr in the record contains the company number<br />
belonging to that table. Inserting a record in a table with a<br />
specific company number, the field &lt;table&gt;._compnr has to be<br />
filled with the corresponding company number. The function<br />
db.insert() will take care of this and writes the record in the<br />
correct (physical) table. There are no special file pointers (for<br />
example by using db.bind) necessary.<br />
                     <br />
      Example:<br />
      The record where the field ttadv100._compnr = 000 belongs to the<br />
      (physical) table ttadv100000<br />
      The record where the field ttadv100._compnr = 200 belongs to the<br />
      (physical) table ttadv100200<br />
                     <br />
Regards,<br />
Dilip</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the additional info.<br />
<br />
I was able to successfully build a select query off 5 tables across 2 different companies...  Yay ! ....<br />
<br />
Thanks again ......:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 21:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The Baan documentation for SQL states that a string of company numbers can be used in a '._compnr' where clause:<br />
<br />
Using &lt;table&gt;._compnr in the WHERE clause<br />
<br />
You can also use &lt;table&gt;._compnr in the WHERE clause of a Baan SQL statement. In this case it is used as a search condition. For example:<br />
You can use &lt;table&gt;._compnr in the following ways:<br />
<br />
<br />
** &lt;table&gt;._compnr = &lt;string&gt; where &lt;string&gt; specifies a list of company numbers, separated by commas [,]. This construction can be used to check a condition for a range of company numbers. The string can contain only digits and commas. (So, you specify company numbers 0 and 23 by &lt;table&gt;._compnr = &quot;000,023&quot;). For example:<br />
<br />
SELECT ttadv100.*<br />
<br />
WHERE ttadv100._compnr = &quot;200,300&quot; AND &lt;condition&gt;<br />
<br />
This query results in a list of the records from the table ttadv100 (with company numbers 200 and 300) that match &lt;condition&gt;. <br />
<br />
<br />
When using this in Baan IV, I found that it will work fine the first time it's used in a session, but the '._compnr' clause doesn't change if the selection is done again.  This would happen when running the session with different companies after a run using different companies, not leaving the session between runs.  For example, a select using companies &quot;200,300&quot; are collected properly during the first run, but changing the companies to &quot;500,600&quot; without leaving the session between select executions returns records for 200 &amp; 300, regardless of the ._compnr string.  This works fine for single numeric company numbers in a 'for' loop, but not for strings.</div></div><hr />
