Hello, I have a customer that, for a new print session, wants to enter adjustment orders from-to as selection input.  And wants to have a zoom-possibility on the input fields. The problem is that the process should handle adjustment orders and orders from adjustment order history the same way so he wants really to see both the orders in whinh520 and the orders in whinh570 when he zooms on the input field. <br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th January 2013, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope someone has a better solution for LN than I had for 4c4.  What my users wanted was to look at production order planning for open or closed or orders.  Glad I finally talked them out of it.  This required the production planning table tisfc010 and ticst030.  So what I did was create a combined session for tisfc001.  Top session was the main session and the bottom session was one of two sessions(tisfc010, and ticst030). As you scrolled through tisfc001 it would launch the lower session for tisfc010 when the order was not closed or it would launch a session for ticst030 records.  It was not pretty and I think there were still some small issues before I got them to abandon that thought.<br />
<br />
The two other solutions I had was to build a temp table from the two tables or to build a session with arrays - then in the session build all the queries to load the arrays for next record, first record etc.  I really did not like any of the solution and finally convinced them to use standard sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">28th January 2013, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I go with the stone-age solution to fill a new temp table whinh912 (for zooming) from the two standard tables for orders and history. Keyed with pid, order-number. Containing also timestamp of creation.  And create the whinh912-records only, as first activity, if the user tries to zoom (which the user rarely will do, is my guess). Then removes whinh912-records for the current pid at end() and abort(). A removal of &quot;very old&quot; records is put in also.</div></div><hr />
