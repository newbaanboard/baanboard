But in reality the guys from Baan development haven't done it. I know it is crazy but only Microsoft Outlook Server is supported.<br />
<br />
If anybody has an idea to mail direct out of Baan 5 into Lotus or other SMTP-Queue, please let me know.<br />

<br />
Have you configured SMTP with eMessage Connector? On our system I can see only outlook connector.<br />
<br />
Do u have more information on how to setup smtp with eMessage Connector?<br />
<br />
(Session ttcmfsmtp is available on system.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nandan</div><div class="date">17th July 2007, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi bergmann-mg,<br />
<br />
If smtp is not available in eMessage connector, you may call os provided email clients to send emails. I have used sockets programming to send email to SMTP server. Sample is provided in this thread. Its kind of proof of concept code, you may have to enhance it.<br />

Yes, I have configured SMTP with eMessage Connector, I can't find my documentation, you can ask Baan support to provide you that.<br />

According to the CMF documentation you should have an adapter for Lotus Notes too, you have to check with Baan Support.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tese112</div><div class="date">18th July 2007, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I ask Infor about eMessage Connector yesterday and today they send me an answer:<br />
<br />
Topic: Only MS Outlook is supported.<br />
Notes:  We're afraid that Infor only supports MS Outlook as email client, therefore, we cannot provide information on how to configure e-Message Connector in ERP 6 LN to work with Lotus Notes.<br />
There are no special connector object (like this for outlook ttcmfoutlook) for lotus notes.<br />
The only connector available at the moment for this eMessage Connector functionality is MS outlook.<br />
<br />
The alternative is to raise this as an enhancement request to find out if this is feasible and if feasible will be scheduled into an enhancement queue that might take fairly long time. The other option is if you know how run Lotus NOtes manually is pretty much easy to create a small driver to send any report in ASCII, Word, PDf etc to the application according with your intersting.<br />
