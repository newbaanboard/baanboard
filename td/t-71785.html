I am trying to get our line of business and the stage the order is in.<br />
<br />
The fields in ttdsls040600 where I am trying to get the descriptions from are:<br />
<br />
t_cbrn  (This is the code for our Line of Business)<br />
t_ssls  (This is the code for our stage)<br />
<br />
Any idea what tables have the descriptions of what these codes mean?</div></div><hr />

<br />
right of the &quot;T&quot; (text button), there is a buton with a black arrow and a blue question mark. This button is the field help button. If you press it, the mouse cursor changes to arrow and question mark; in that state, you can press on fields an get the online help for them.<br />
<br />
I did that for you:<br />
tdsls040.cbrn --&gt; tcmcs031.dsca <br />
<br />
You say tdsls040.ssls? Normally, it's tdsls045.ssls. Unfortunately, it's a bit more tricky and normally done by a standard function to get the description.<br />
