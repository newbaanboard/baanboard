<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">8th October 2001, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">: I created a session which uses the server2client() function to transfer a file from a unix server directory to a windows server directory. The session works perfectly. When I add the session to a job and activate it, it also works perfectly. However, when I start the job using rc.startjob, the session does <br />
: start but never finishes and the file is not transfered. <br />
<br />
: Any ideas why this is happening?<br />
: Has anyone been successful at doing this?<br />
<br />
You need an instance of BW running for anything in the ottdllbw to work. So when you are activating a job, there is an instance of BW running on your desktop. When doing a rc.startjob you will be using a job user and there is no BW client involved.<br />
<br />
Here are a few solutions:<br />
- Have a NT based machine kick off the job (similar to scheduling jobs on Baan in a NT server).<br />
- Mount the NT directory as an NFS drive on Unix server. Then the NT directory will be visible as a local directory on the Unix machine.<br />
- Install Samba on the unix box. NT server can then see the Unix box in its network neighborhood.<br />
- Run an FTP service on the NT box and 'put' the file on that server using a shell script which you can launch in your Baan script.<br />

Apart from having problems using ottdllbw functions, there is a problem of using Barcode printing with BWPrint in jobs. Anyone solve this one?</div></div><hr />
