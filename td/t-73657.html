<br />
I have one session in which I want to sort data in ascending format but that field is not of the main table and thus I am not able to sort it.<br />
<br />
Please provide me solution so that I can sort field of non-main table without adding that field in main table.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th January 2021, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">In LN you would probably have more options, but with our old 4c4 I typically I just created new sessions - not a way I know of with seeded baan sessions at least not without owning source code(which we did not).  So for example if the user wanted all Planned manufacturing order information(table tipgc510 information), but then they want it sorted by Project (which was tipgc511) I would generate the session off tipgc511.  Then just do a query in like the form sections to retrieve the information needed from tipgc510.<br />
<br />
The other thing I did was to create filter type sessions - the main session would get the filter fields.  Then the subsession it called would sort the records - in this type program I would actually write code to use exec sql and fetch sql to pull the records in based off the filters. Then if I wanted to I could sort the above example by project(511 table) and item(510 table).  It worked - but not something I recommend.</div></div><hr />
