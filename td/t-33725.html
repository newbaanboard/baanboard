<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bkkland</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">How many tables are related to a session tipcs2102m000? If I would like to mass update the status of the projects - tipcs020.psts? I'm planning to use the Exchange Scheme to do this, is it possible? There are many active projects with no sales orders and need to be canceled or deleted. What would be the impact by deleting them? When checking the history, some of them have production orders...will it be a problem? <br />
<br />
Please advise. THANK YOU SO MUCH...<br />

I would not use an exchange scheme - this way all the background stuff got processed also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bkkland</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">what do you mean by using the function server? What if we don't want to close the project because we don't want to create integration transaction. What would be the best option &quot;cancel&quot; or &quot;delete&quot;? <br />

MANY THANKS!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th April 2007, 04:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sorry I can answer the functional side of things.  What I was talking about was using an Application Function Server (see this forum (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=59)) to run the session tipcs2102m000 session in the back ground.  So for example you would read in a file with project, status - you would then launch tipcs2102m000, find the provided project, set status to the input status from the file.  Then whatever tipcs2102m000 does when changing the status happens - so like you mention if you set it to closed it would probably create those integration transactions.<br />
<br />
Again I can not answer the session functionality question since as far as I know we do not use that session.  Yes - it is populated in our system, but we are an A&amp;D site.  As far as I know our projects are maintained in tppdm sessions.  So I do not know what happens.  I just really do not like an exchange scheme in situations like this - mainly because I do not know everything a session can do.  This can lead to future problems.  We have had some exchange schemes cause some interesting problems when the user provide the data.</div></div><hr />

However if you have production orders and if any of them had done any issues or receipts, its a different ball game. You could write off these values at the time of closing but it would hit the ledger once you close the project. <br />
Deleting the project would be a bad idea as the references run deep and then you will have to consider some history tables. If you can map these projects to a seperate ledger then after closing you could reverse the entries made to that ledger in Finance module. <br />
