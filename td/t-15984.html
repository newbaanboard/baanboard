I have changed Journal Print With Finalization and Print Totals by Ledger Account to No, so that no hardcopy prints. <br />
<br />
The question I have is that some users are still prompted to select a device while others are not.  Does anyone have any idea what is causing this?<br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />

Or after the point where it reads these rules?Just wondering if they did not log out and back into baan.  <br />

I don't recall logging out when I tested it in our development company, but the way today has gone...<br />
<br />
I'll let you know if it works.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I logged it to BGS but they said you always have to have a report - it must have been a bug in 4c3 according to them.</div></div><hr />

They are still getting prompted after logging out and then back in.<br />

I find that odd since you have the option within the session to disable both printers.  But I've seen this type of oddity before.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />
