Can someone tell me how we can fix this? How do we find this object in the application. The session is calling this object.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me, you have to do with a custom. on a Baan-software object.<br />
Take a look with ttadv2500m000, if this session is present in your Custom. VRC or your Own develop. VRC.<br />
<br />

<br />
Can you please fill up your info about baan version, OS, Database etc in your profile ?<br />
<br />
This kind of error messages comes up when the object is missing or when you dont have permissions on the object (example, 700 or -rwx------ in Unix) and owned by other user. Typical permission should be 755 or -rwxr-xr-x.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertB</div><div class="date">7th December 2002, 12:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I've also got this error occasionally when, during development of a custom session, I have changed from the custom session PVRC to another (to do something in another part of Baan, for instance), then gone back to the custom session and tried to start it without changing back to the custom session PVRC. <br />
<br />
So, make sure you have gone back to your dev PVRC....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">7th December 2002, 21:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You can add the &quot;-- -set PACKAGE_COMB=&lt;name of package combination&gt;&quot; to the command line. In that way you can be sure that you use that package combination.<br />
<br />
I think when you do an &quot;explode6.1 otdpurc041.b&quot; you will see the similar error... in that case your package combination is not searching the C-layer. (if you have NT, use bic_explode instead, for ERP use explode6.2).<br />
<br />
If you get a path returned, then check the permissions on the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">27th February 2003, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Baan IV C4<br />
Oracle 8.0.5<br />
Windows NT 4.0<br />
SP 10<br />
<br />
     We get the above errors when we run a bar code transaction which has been designed by a third party vendor, &quot;Can't Read session or Object (tdilc4102b000, tdilc4201b000, ticstc101b00&quot;) <br />
Another error which appears on the VB client we use to run the bar code transactions is  &quot;bms.send error with tdilc4102b000&quot;. The vendor suggested that this is a BaaN error and possibly a permission error which can't call the function servers.<br />
     Appreciate if anyone has a solution/suggestions on how to solve this since we are stuck.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tools is not my field of expertise. But since you're having emergency situation, I'd probably make a simple suggestion that you try to compile again all those mentioned sessions/program scripts<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">28th February 2003, 04:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically this problem is experienced in 2 cases<br />
<br />
1. When the customized session is created, it may not be created using Generate Session and the developer copies one session to another and modifies the required information. When this session is ported to another VRC or another environment, while executing it gives problem.<br />
<br />
2. The session object is not present.<br />
<br />
What normal solution I follow for this solution is when I get this <br />
problem, edit the session record by Maintain Session (ttaad2100m000 I think for Baan IV) and then modify the session description (may be by just putting the &quot;.&quot; at the end, save the session record and recompile session. It works.<br />
<br />
May be try this option.. it may help..!<br />
