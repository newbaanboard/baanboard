Is there a way to suppress this?.<br />

<br />
As far as I know, there is no way to supress, it's part of the standard program that runs under every Baan Session with a main table.  <br />
It's usually not a good idea to forgo Baan standard validations -<br />
I.E., you cannot modify a sales order text after invoicing.  That is a good thing, because the invoice has already been sent with the old text.   <br />
<br />
That's why I would recommend not changing anything unless you find a specific issue you cannot get around.   If you are really stuck, perhaps you can write your own session that allows for only the text to be updated, and does not have the choice.update.db or other sections that are causing you problems.<br />
Functionally, I do not know what the ramifications of that would be for you, as I don't know what text you are trying to change.</div></div><hr />
