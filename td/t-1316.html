<br />
I have problem in modification report, hope you can help me. <br />
My problem is I want to add approval on existing Baan Report. The approval takes 8 - 10 line in the end of report ( some report just take 1 page/ or half page, some are need more). But when I print that report, the approval always print in the next page, although sometime there is enough space to print it in the same page.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me how can I fix it or setup something in report ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warans</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">just a suggestion:<br />
Try putting approval in after report layout just incase if you want approval to appear only once at the end of the report. Suppose if you're printing more than one page and if you want approval for each page...put it in footer.<br />
<br />
if it works fine...okay..if it doen't...there is nothing wrong having attempted to find a soln.<br />
<br />
have a good one! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I concur with Warans that it sounds like an after report.  If you are printing multiple documents in one report run, then I guess it would be an after.field layout.<br />
<br />
As far as getting it all on the page, check your margin and page length settings and the &quot;need&quot; value for the layout in which it prints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">h3nry_99</div><div class="date">12th March 2002, 03:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for reply,<br />

Actually I allready put the approval on after report. But the problem is that approval are printed on the next page (new page). I try to adjust some margin setting (trial &amp; error methode), but didn't work like I want (have approval on the same page not on the next page). <br />
<br />
So, is there somebody have the knowledge with margin setting ? <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

What is the bottom margin in your report?<br />
<br />
What is the page length? (better keep -1)<br />

Finally check whther the &quot;New Page&quot; option is selected or not.</div></div><hr />

If you select this option for any layout then that layout will be printed in a new page. Check whether this is accidentally ON for the after.report layout.<br />

I see that box  uncheck. I think that check  box is for print the layout in every page ( like if we choose footer). So now I know that check is for change to the new page too. <br />
<br />
How about the margin setting, because the new page is not checked ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th March 2002, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Was just glancing through this post.  I notice that you mentioned 3 after.report sections.  Which one has what you are trying to print?  Is there something in the output.expr that makes only one print?  I am wondering if maybe one of these is pushing the one you are trying to print onto the next page.<br />
<br />
Mark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">12th March 2002, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">One problem could be, even with minimum data the space on page is not enough to print all the after.layouts and hence one is getting pushed to another page.<br />
<br />
Henry - you try by having 80 in the Report Length field instead of default -1 value. Then check how it prints in the cases where the data is less. If every thing gets printed in one page then you have to check the page settings for the printer(Where u print the report).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">h3nry_99</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 04:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometime my report contain of 1 after.report, sometime more and I want to print all of those in my report. When I have more than 1 after.report, the last push to new page/next page while the first in the same page ( In this case both Srinivas &amp; Mark have the right opinions). <br />
<br />
One more, number in margin setting represent inch or lines ? Because I ussually use A4 paper, I think that paper are contain of 66 - 70 lines. So if I put 80, maybe is to much lines in one page. And so with top, bottom, or footer. Maybe someone can help me more detail about that setting. (No help text in Baan for this I think).<br />
<br />
Thanks for respons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 06:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The numbers represent lines. For A4 size paper the report length can be approximately close to 70 and so you can try by having report length as 70 and have a display of the report(using device D). If it is not coming in one page then it means that it is not fiiting in one page. If it comes in one page but when u actually print to a printer if it is going to the next page then you have to look at the paper settings in the printer.
