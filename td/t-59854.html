We don't include a path.  When we use this device a tmp file gets created in our client baan directory(c:\program files\baan\tmp) directory, excel gets launched(office directory is part of the path on our clients), excel pulls up the tmp file.<br />
<br />
Now on win 7 we had problems initially because users did not have permissions to this tmp directory, but that was fixed.  The desktop management group had to push out permissions to this directory for all our users.  I am also not sure if we received any type of error message - been too long.  I do know when trying to edit a script we would get a write error on the local directory.</div></div><hr />

Either keep the path blank and provide the filename when device is used or<br />
simply type in the filename(not full path) in &quot;path&quot;.<br />
<br />
Attached is the device data for Excel</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thank You all for Your suggestions.<br />
<br />
I tried to print report according to your suggestions.<br />
<br />
It is not creating any excel file in the local machine , in the directory:<br />
c:\programfiles\baan\tmp<br />
But it i creating a notepad (.txt file )file in the same directroy, in the local machine.<br />
<br />
and i am getting the excel file of report  in the server machine as previously.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th January 2011, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">That is what the baan excel device does - it creates a .txt file in the c:\program files\baan\tmp directory.  It should then launch excel with this text file.  So when excel opens you have a .txt file open - at no point does baan create a .xls file.  If you want that then look in the code and utilities forum - you will find some examples on how to create this device driver yourself.<br />
<br />
Note that excel must be in your directory path on the client or you must fully qualify the path to excel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
1. Are you using a standard Baan device or creating one of your own?<br />
2. If yes, then to create the file locally, are you moving the file from the server to the local machine through script (refer server2client)? No matter what path you give, I think the file gets created on the server.<br />
3. To open the report in preview (Excel), you would probably need to give it an extension .xls and use the function app_start.<br />
<br />
This can be achieved by having the above code in customized script of the session or a 3GL script attached to the device.<br />
<br />
