I would like to send a message to all users which pops up on there screen.<br />
I want it to be a message like one gets from  f.i. mess(&quot;tcmcs95075&quot;,1)  <br />
 <br />
They do not use the ascii otherwise I wold have used   $BSE/bin/bshcmd6.1<br />
I assume send.bucket() does not work because it will only show in the terminal.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For this question I would search the forum and here is just one thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=1605&amp;highlight=send+message+users) on the topic there are others.  I actually just searched on &quot;Send message to all users&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Than all the users should have a message<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Mark for moving the post to the better location.<br />
<br />
I have read the post you recommended but that post does not do it for me.<br />
This is not a message at startup and I do not have baan ERP<br />
I suggested/demonstated the BSE/bin/bshcmd6.1 method to my customer but he whats a popup more like mess(&quot;tcmcs95075&quot;,1) style.<br />
<br />
Can this be done using baan4c4 or should I better use an solution outsite the baanGUI?<br />
Thanks so far.<br />

If you own source you could modify the session to send an email to different users.  There is one session where the user wanted us to send email based of the first 2 characters in the project.  So we created a session for the user to maintain a distribution list based off the first two characters.  Now when some creates a project - email gets generated and sent to a distribution list.<br />
<br />
I am not even sure if someone posted a tool to do something like this.  I don't know enough about triggers to make a suggestion in that area.  But I do know there are some triggers in the background on our system to send out information to other systems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Infor has included a product called ION for the same. It can generate Alerts based on specific triggers like adding a record, approval of Sales / Purchase Order, and lots of other things.<br />
<br />
You can customize your own alerts as well. These alerts will then help you to send emails/sms's to he people you add in the ION distribution lists.<br />
<br />
You can post your queries about ION on this forum :- ION (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=83)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanconsultant</div><div class="date">26th April 2013, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You can create a new session that watches a message queue. Run it as startup session, it can remain in the background until something is put in the queue, and then pop up a message.<br />
<br />
The controlling session should put a message in the queue if a new item is added. To do this, you could watch the audit records. If a new record is added in the item table, push a message to the queue.<br />
<br />
I think it should work, at least in theory. I've played with some parts of what you need, message queues, reading audit records etc, but haven't used it in one solution.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a mass-mail, eventually generated by a Baan session (use shell(&quot;mail -s etc.) might be easier to implement.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanconsultant</div><div class="date">26th April 2013, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">You could, instead of using message queues, create a new table, have one central process monitor changes on itm001, write the changes in the new table with date/time, and have on each client a background session that checks the new table for modifications with date/time after it's last check date/time.<br />
You might store the last checkdate/time in a table per user, so that if the user logs off, the new items show up if he logs on again.</div></div><hr />

Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts, <br />
This is a good alternative.<br />
I sugested the email option but the customer rather would like a pop up message in baan.<br />
So I will go with that.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
