<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mojays</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
Following situation:<br />
I have a report with several before-, detail-, after- and footer-sections.<br />
One detail I have to print more than one time:<br />
<br />
In the before.layout section I determine the data (or set lattr.print = false, if no more exists) and in the after.layout section I call layout.again().<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
If a page break occurs within the loop, the before.field-sections are not printed...<br />
<br />
Some ideas?<br />
<br />
Kind regards...<br />
<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />

First you say it is concerning a detail-layout, then you mention the problem of before.field-layouts not being printed in case of a page break... <br />

Please clearify...<br />

<br />
The detail is printed several times by layout.again().<br />
After a page break the report continues printing the detail. So far as good.<br />
But it continues immediately!! That seems to be incorrect.<br />
After a page break, first the before.field-sections (and headers) must be printed before continuing with the details...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well... there is not much code:<br />
<br />
detail.10:<br />
before.layout:<br />
   domain tcbool more.data.present<br />
   |... determine data<br />
   lattr.print = more.data.present<br />
after.layout:<br />
   layout.again()<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally there is a before.tdsls041.pono.10 section with header informations which should be printed before each order line AND additionally on top of each page (&gt;&gt;&gt; NO lattr.break condition!).<br />
<br />
All detail.10 layouts are printed well, but the before.tdsls041.pono.10 does not appear on page breaks triggered by the layout.again().</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you mean with your first statement &quot;Do the before.tdsls041.pono.10 section have page checked for it&quot;?<br />
<br />
The output expression of the before.tdsls041.pono.10 is &quot;1&quot; and there is no section for it in report script, which could suppress the layout.<br />
<br />
BTW: The layout.again() isn't printed very often, but sometimes detail.10 starts nearby the bottom of the page, so it triggers a page break...</div></div><hr />

On form 1 of maintain layouts - is page checked?  I am not sure this has anything to do with it or not.  According to the help when a page break occurs the header and before layouts should print.  I thought something you might try is checking this box.<br />

<br />
The reason I asked this is that the one report I know of that uses layout again uses lattr.break as the print expression.  Again something you might try.  I am not sure if this will help or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well... I tried, what you said, but - as I expected - this checkbox FORCES a page break and has nothing to do with the condition, whether the layout section is printed or not.<br />
Checking this box leads to a page break EVERY time the before.tdsls041.pono.10 is printed, and that's not what I want! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason I asked this is that the one report I know of that uses layout again uses lattr.break as the print expression.  Again something you might try.  I am not sure if this will help or not.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned: No output expression is set...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Kind of what I expected on the first one.  On the second I was suggesting to set the output expression on the layout to lattr.break.  Just something to try - I am not sure that will help either.<br />
<br />
Something else to try - is put the report in debug mode.  See which routine prints the before.tdsls041.pono.10 layout.  Then in your routine put in something like:<br />
<br />
if lattr.break then<br />
     r.s.before.tdsls041.pono.10()  | Replace this with the actual routine name<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Of course this assumes that at the page break lattr.break is set to true in the detail layout.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no... I did not something like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I did not try it, I'm 150% sure, that this will not succeed, because the output expression is a BOOLEAN CONDITION, which it can not become &quot;more TRUE&quot; than &quot;1&quot;, when I set a condition (like &quot;lattr.break&quot;).<br />
<br />
 Something else to try - is put the report in debug mode.  See which routine prints the before.tdsls041.pono.10 layout.  Then in your routine put in something like:<br />
<br />

endif<br />
<br />
Of course this assumes that at the page break lattr.break is set to true in the detail layout.<br />
<br />
This sounds interesting... I will try it...<br />
But instead trust in the lattr.break variable, I will cause &quot;r.s.before.tdsls041.pono.10()&quot; when the last page line is reached (lattr.lineno = spool.pg.length - &lt;bottom margin&gt;)...<br />
<br />
I will let you take part of my experiences...<br />
<br />
Thanks...<br />
<br />
BTW: Are there predefined variables (or functions) to access the top, bottom and footer margin of the report (as set on the 2nd mask of &quot;Maintain Reports&quot;)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree - the hope was that with an output expression of lattr.break, it might force it to re-evaluate the layout for printing.  But you might want to try looking at lattr.autobefores - make sure it is true.  It says the default is true, but never hurts to check.<br />

<br />
The more I read on lattr.break the more I think it will not work in the detail layout either. Lattr.break according to the help is only true when there is a sort field change.  So it will not be true during the detail.  To me it is looking like you might have to track the lines and issue a page command. Something along those lines.<br />
<br />
Does this layout have to be a detail layout?  Could it be an after.field layout?<br />

I did not see any in my help files, but that does not mean that there is not something I do not know about.</div></div><hr />
