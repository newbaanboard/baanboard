<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I developed a customised report, its getting compiled but when i run it i get the following error:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Error in reading sort file record, 6 fields scanned, 10 expected.&quot;<br />
<br />
All 10 input fields are getting values.<br />
<br />
The following areas iam doubtful about:<br />
<br />
1. I have used in print expression fields like (tdpur046.amtb*tdpur046.qana).How can we use thigns like this.<br />
<br />
2.Can we get total in after.fields , if in report script, i write expression like<br />
<br />
tot.perc =  total of (tdpur046.amtb)/total of (tdpur046.qana)<br />
<br />
will baan take the total of fields in after field or just the value these fields have at the time the layout is printed, Iam using aggregate expression to find totals for the above field.<br />
<br />
Please Help!! VERY URGENT<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) Yes you can use tdpur046.amtb*tdpur046.qana as a print expression. But both fields must be input fields to the report.<br />
<br />
(2) Several ways to handle after fields in scripts.<br />
   (a) Find the total..# field that is used to total a field. Then use this in the script. Ex:<br />
   perc = total..1 / total..2<br />
I do not recommend this since every time you modify the report it may break this code.<br />
<br />
   (b) In the detail section sum the qty's yourself.<br />
     sometotal = sometotal + reportfield<br />
     sometotal1 = sometotal1 + anotherreportfield<br />
<br />
Then in the after field section you could do the percentage.  <br />
<br />
(3) Also field defined in the script do not need to be added to the reports input fields.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The errors you are getting don't seem to be related to these 2 issues.  <br />
<br />
Make sure that the 2 fields you are using in the print expression are both input fields for the report.  <br />
<br />
The method you are using for gathering tot.perc is correct as well.  Are you declaring tot.perc in the report script though?  You can declare it as an input field for the report instead.  They share declaration.  (as I see Mark responded - don't declare in both).  Maybe that's the problem.</div></div><hr />
