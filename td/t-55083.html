<br />
I have a report for Invoice which is based on the standard report for invoice (CISLI220011000). In that report is a field I also use in my costunised one called &quot;document.type&quot; and that returns the description out of cisli205 for the Doc Type e.g. Sales Invoice, Credit Note etc...<br />
<br />
I would like to rename the description for this document type 1 (ENUM Field) from Sales Invoice to Tax Invoice, but I am unable to track down, where that description comes from.<br />
<br />
I have tried 2 things already:<br />
<br />
Gone to TTADV140 and changed ALL Label descriptions from Sales Invoice to Tax Invoice (even the ones out of TF module etc), compiled them but it doesn&quot;t change the description in cisli205 (Table Manager, at least not for existing records).<br />
<br />
I also went to ttadv4120m100 to find out the Label Code, but again, I can't manage to get it changed.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how I can change that (without programming it by myself in the report script)? I juts want to change that label description.<br />
<br />
Do I have to do another step e.g. Convert to runtime or compile sessions to get this updated?<br />
<br />
Any help welcome.<br />

<br />
as far as I remember that descriptions are coming from the enum descriptions of domain cisli.doct.<br />

<br />
You can goto maintain domains, look for cisli.doct, and in the enum/set constants change the description accordingly. This will change the description of this constant everywhere.<br />
<br />
But if the requirement is only for your report, then you may try the function :<br />
function string  enum.descr$  (string domain_code(12), string enum_expr [, string language_code])</div></div><hr />

ttadv4100m000 will let u modify the enum description but it will change the same everywhere the domain is used .<br />
<br />
Else u can change print expression in the report where it's printed  . For that matter, tell us what the current expression is .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">_Ralph_</div><div class="date">18th February 2009, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">And dont forget to compile the labels. ttadv1243m000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judgement</div><div class="date">19th February 2009, 03:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help, but something is still missing. went into Domains and to the Enum fields and found Constant 1 Constant name = Invoice, Constant description = Sales Invoice, Label = sli.doct001. I changed the Label Name in ttadv140 to Tax Invoice, do refresh and the system does show the name Tax Invoice. I compile the Label, and go to Domains and say convert to runtime (comes back with no data processed). (attached the changes)<br />
<br />
So the label description in the Session shows now Tax Invoice, BUT if I go in General Table Manager to cisli205 in still shows &quot;Sales Invoice for records with constant 1. And on my report it also still prints &quot;Sales Invoice&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does that change only apply for future records and not for existing one? I seem to be missing a step. <br />
<br />
Any help appreciated. BTW it is fine if it changes everywhere where the domain is used, then I don&quot;t have to change every report where it is used.<br />
<br />
BTW, the report variable document.type uses the domain tcmcs.st35.<br />
<br />
I don't have the Print Session script so I can't look up how the session fills it.<br />

<br />
1. move/rename or take backup of the domain file on the server<br />
2. Then run session Create RunTime Data Dictionary ttadv5210m000<br />
3. Check if new domain file has been created for this particular domain</div></div><hr />

thanks everybody. Managed finally to get the change through. Not a 100% sure why it didn't work the first time, something didn&quot;t work with Conversion to Runtime, I changed to Installation user and changed Current Package VRC, don&quot;t know if that was it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, another call I can close of my long list after Going Live this month. :)<br />
