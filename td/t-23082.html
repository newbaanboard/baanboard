<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">4th February 2005, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a report that is using the table tfgld410. I am trying to get this report to print tfgld410.dim2, but I noticed that the records that are credits contain this data but the records that are debits dont. How can I hold the value from dim2(credits) and use them for dim2(debits) in my report?<br />
<br />
Similarities :<br />
Item, docn, quantity, trans type ...<br />
There are many fields where debit = credit so I want to look up the value for dim2 in credits, and use that on my report for dim2 in debits.<br />
<br />
I was trying something with hold.dim2... but not sure how to write this report script.<br />
<br />
example of report<br />
leac......dim2........item...........docn................deb/cred<br />
12345...ASDFFD...1212121.....10022333............credit<br />
12211................1212121.....10022333............debit<br />
<br />
if I have the similarities of item/docn      how can I carry the dim2 from credit line to dim2 debit line??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure that all the records are in tfgld410? If there is supposed to be a value in &quot;dim2&quot; or any other &quot;dimN&quot; or &quot;leac&quot; and the records have been integrated then they will be there.<br />
<br />
I think you need to look at table tfgld417 also. This table contains credit account details. (Contra would probably be a better name because if the tdgld410 posting is a credit then this table will have the debit account). Table tfgld418 may also be useful in that it contains the key fields. (tfgld417/8 were introduced with baanIVc (I think) to reduce the disk space useage.<br />

<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
     if isspace(tfgld410.dim2) then<br />
        print.dim2 = hold.dim2<br />
     else<br />
        print.dim2 = tfgld410.dim2<br />
     endif<br />
<br />
after.layout:<br />
     if not isspace(tfgld410.dim2) then<br />
        hold.dim2 = tfgld410.dim2<br />
     endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course you need to print &quot;print.dim2&quot; in the report.  Not done too much finance stuff and I am not sure I have the domain correct.  Of course this also depends on the credits and debits being in the correct order.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">5th February 2005, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Terry's right in that one will have to use the table tfgld417 for credit records (with exception of sales invoice records ) and tfgld418 for integration status.<br />
<br />
Further give some  code to be able to give more concrete suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">7th February 2005, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark suggestion worked. I just needed to resort my report so the credit printed before the debit lines.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help and suggestions.</div></div><hr />
