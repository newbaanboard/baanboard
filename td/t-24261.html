<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lwallace</div><div class="date">10th June 2005, 03:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to learn all I can about checking for 'customer' imposed wildcards' (X) on a G/L account and Dimension 1 (Department) string field in a Baan Program Script. However, after reviewing the Baan 'help' I can't seem to come up with the correct search syntax to nail this down.<br />
<br />
I have the 'infamous' opportunity to create a new financial reporting system on our Baan V.c that emulates the prior HP UNIX reporting system we were on. Sucks to be me. <br />
<br />
I need a way to examine a field and determine if there are any wildcard's present and how many are present. From there I need make additional choices about the position of those wildcards. This will be used for the G/L account and the Dimension 1 field.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">10th June 2005, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the pos command to search a given field for a string.  Click here (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_string_operations_pos_rpos) for a link to the manual page for this command. You can use this to find the existence and position of an occurrence of one string within another.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps get you started...</div></div><hr />

Baan's wild card charater .  and * combined with like operator search is excellent . However u need to use dynamic SQL in order to use this. In embedded SQL it dows not work.<br />
<br />
Why dont u use query by form . If main table has GL and dim fields , u can use the wild card for searching using like operator.</div></div><hr />
