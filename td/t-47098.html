<br />
I would like to make a session, that works like tdpur4102s000 (Mantain order lines) - so there is a &quot;preview&quot; part with lines on top, and a &quot;mantain&quot; part for editing current line on bottom of the form. I have found out that these are actually two different forms that are somehow combined. And this &quot;somehow&quot; is bugging me - any ideas/solutions?<br />
<br />
thanx,<br />

Check out switch.to.process and sattr.combined.  This is not exactly easy, but is possible.  You just need to work out everything you want to happen.  The big question is what are you really trying to accomplish - what data and a why.  That might help someone make more suggestions.</div></div><hr />
