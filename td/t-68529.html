If just a query in the report script you could build your code for lots the look like what was input.  If it was me I would just report all lots for an item - trying to find a lot &quot;like&quot; what was entered could require a lot of coding.</div></div><hr />

In the query you can find the variables used as user input (on form) for the user by the query engine. These variables are declared external an can be used in your report linked to the query too.
