<br />
I have a problem with BaaNXL.<br />
There's a report with item data, but the item codes of the customer I'm working are numbers, some of them starting with 0.<br />
There's where my problems begin. When the user prints the report with BaaNXL, excel does not shows the 0 to the left. Even if I configure in BaaNXL-ADMIN to recognize that column as text, excel shows the column as general, and the 0 goes away.<br />
I tried to use an text qualifier character, and it also didn't work, and even if it did, it would ruin the report for other devices, such as display or HTML, that would actually print the character. The user wants to use BaaNXL because it's completelly automatized, but I can't make it work in this case.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Lucas</div></div><hr />
