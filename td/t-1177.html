<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 23:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to keep lines together at a report breakpoint.  I can use the 'need' field, and fill it in with say &quot;10&quot;.  Most of my layout lines aren't more than 10, but some are.<br />
<br />
This also leaves me with some unsightly blank lines at the bottom of my pages (customers hate these!).<br />
<br />
Thoughts? and Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you trying to keep things together that are in multiple layouts?  You can always use need(x) in the report script if you know how many lines are needed.  I guess I would need more detailed information to give any clearer suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm already using need(10) - and this catches most of the lines.  <br />
<br />
I thought perhaps there was another obscure command that would keep ALL lines of a layout on the same page, regardless of how many lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to assume that there is a text field in the layout.  Otherwise, I think the size of the layout would be known.  So...<br />
<br />
You could try two layouts.  The first you would use to determine the size of the text field without actually printing it.  The second layout would actually print the text while doing the correct &quot;need&quot;.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	num.text.lines = 0<br />
	print.text = false<br />
<br />
detail.2:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	need(num.text.lines)<br />
	print.text = true<br />
<br />
field.text.field:<br />
before.print:<br />
	if not print.text then<br />
		num.text.lines = num.text.lines + 1<br />
		lattr.print = false<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
I haven't tried this and it may not be the most elegant solution, but I think it should work.  You probably will get a blank line for detail.1.  I thought about using lattr.print = false there, but that may invalidate the rest of the script.  Any way, it might be enough to get you started.:p</div></div><hr />
