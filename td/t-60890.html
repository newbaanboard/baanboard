The problems are that some characters like the trademark &amp; Copyright, but also the default grahical lines Baan uses in most of the reports to draw borders/lines, are somehow converted into some other character. For example into a questionmark.<br />
<br />
Now I read something about developing your own ttstpconv but don't know how to start. Anyhow, is this the way we should find the solution for above described problems? And if yes, how do I start with this? If not, what other solutions do we have for this, besides buying some 3rd party software.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

We usually create an excel version of the report - removing all graphics from the file.  There is an example you can follow in the Code and Utilities for which shows how to create a ttstpconv clone.  Basically all it does is create an ASCII version of the report file, then you can manipulate this before launching excel.</div></div><hr />
