How can i print the detail part of a report on the second page instead of the starting page? The first page will be printing out the header and footer part onto a pre-designed template and i want the detail part to be printed on the second page, which happens to be a blank one...<br />
The report in question is a Cheque report and the details i want to be printed on the second page are the transactions that are processed against that cheque number. <br />
 <br />
Is it possible? If yes, then how?<br />
 <br />

I don't now your report in detail, but you can use something like this in the report script:<br />
<br />
<br />
header.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
     | Print Layout on the first page only<br />
     lattr.print = (pagne.no = 1)<br />
<br />
detail.10:<br />
before layout:<br />
     | Print Layout on the first page only<br />
     lattr.print = (pagne.no = 1)<br />
<br />
after.layout:<br />
     | new page required<br />
      page()<br />
<br />
detail.20:<br />
before layout:<br />
     | Print Layout on the second page<br />
     lattr.print = (pagne.no = 2)<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you will need an additional brp.ready(brp.id)  (or the equal function depending on how you started your report) to send the data again to the report.<br />
<br />
It also can be usefull to put the header and/or footer sections in details and then print them depending form the line. Or use groupheaders instead of the regular footer/header sections if the data don't fit your template. <br />
There are many ways to control the report layout and where which lines ar printed :D .<br />

Thank you for your reply. I am not that 3gl or 4gl savvy and so with the limited knowledge at my disposal i had tried what you have suggested but it didnt work. B.t.w Isnt lattr.print a boolean variable? <br />
So I had created a new detail section and within the script i had used page() in the after.layout of the section preceeding this new detail section. On running the report, the contents of this new detail section printed on the first page itself and there wasnt any new page created. Did i miss out on something?<br />
 <br />
 <br />
A little about the report:<br />
The report in question here is the Cheque report that gets printed when you process supplier payments. Its with some effort i managed to get the header and footer part to fit into the template and so i was looking at ways of doing this without having to change the header and footer structure. Atleast not the header which forms the cheque leaf. The remaining part of the template is being filled up by &quot;after.field&quot; and &quot;footer&quot; section. The detail section fields are currently disabled(print condition =0). The client doesnt want to see the detail part(various invoices selected against the cheque num) appearing on the first page but on the second page.<br />
<br />

<br />
my fault. The name of page number var is lattr.pageno. You are rigth that lattr.print is a boolean. (lattr.pageno = 1) is an expression and the result is also boolean.<br />
<br />
I think you have to send the data twice to the report: One time for the first page and one time for the second page. The data will be printed only one time per page because of the print condition (first layout 1 and then layout 2).<br />
Sendig the data twice is sometimes a problem. You have to take care that  your calculations in the reportscript  don't become wrong. Keep in mind that the reportscript is an independent program. So you don't loose a record pointer in your main script if you send data twice. All calculations there are also unattended form sending data to the report.<br />
<br />
It is a little tricky to print complicate reports with such conditions. The last time I've needed it, it took a few trys to get it work.<br />

   Isnt there a way to force a particular section to another page? In the meantime i will try your approach of sending data twice...<br />

I've found this in the help file. So page() should (and does for my experience) create a new page.<br />
<br />
<br />
The statements programmed in a report script section consist of a combination of 3GL languagestatements and the following 4GL report functions:<br />
<br />
layout.again()<br />
 Evaluate and print layout again.<br />
 <br />
need( expr )<br />
 Force a page break if the number of free lines is less than expr.<br />
 <br />
page()<br />
 Start a new page.<br />
 <br />
reset.suppress()<br />
 It is possible to suppress printing a value when it is the same as the previous value. You can use this function to suppress the value once (that is, for one value). <br />
 <br />
skip( expr )<br />
 Skip expr number of lines before printing the next layout.<br />
 <br />
skip.to( expr )<br />
 Skip to the line number indicated by expr. Intervening lines are left blank. If the specified line number is less than the current page number, a new page is started.<br />
 <br />
to.page( expr )<br />
 Start a new page with number expr.<br />
 <br />
<br />
You cannot use need(), page(), skip(), skip.to(), or to.page() in header and footer layouts<br />
<br />
<br />
Normaly I have more then one record. Maybe thats the difference.<br />
<br />
