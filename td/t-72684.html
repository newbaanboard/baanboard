<br />
We have created a customized parameter session to maintain server paths.<br />
These paths would be used by other sessions for file extractions.<br />
Now, is there any function in Baan IV (like path.exists()) to check whether the inputted path is actually present and there is some space. (whether the space is sufficient for the file is not required)<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Arlina</div></div><hr />

Pretty basic I would just check error from the server2client and say something check directory path and confirm you have access.  Really nothing fancy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arlina</div><div class="date">14th February 2020, 06:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark.<br />
But we need to check the file path existence before actually using it.<br />
dir.open() can be helpful.<br />
Checking space availability is still a question though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">14th February 2020, 07:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an idea for checking space availability, not even a good idea though but I think it might get the job done.<br />
<br />
Try creating a dummy file containing dummy data with the size same as the actual data or specifying maximum space requirement.<br />
If the file is created and the content is not missing that means the required space is available; otherwise, it is not.<br />
After that, you can just delete the dummy file and do your thing.<br />
<br />
Looks like a bad idea though. Just trying to contribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th February 2020, 14:11</div></div><div class="posttext">You can always execute .bat files and write the output to another file.  Then read that file into baan.  Sample of how you can check freespace - something like this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42471135/free-disk-space-via-cmd-batch-file.  Google for finding a directory.  Put those in .bat file (or even build the .bat file in the code) download to the client, execute it, upload the file to the server, read it and check freespace and directory exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">15th February 2020, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">As Mark mentioned, you can write the code to get the free space to your .bat file and execute that bat file using run.prog() <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or just try the following (Assuming you are on Windows Server) - <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ret = run.prog(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;,&quot;/k dir E:\&quot;,RP_WAIT,&quot;&quot;,&quot;E:\Temp\filesize.txt&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
The above code will give you an output file named filesize.txt in the specified location which will contain the last line as the Free Space available in the drive mentioned. Now, you can just read this last line of this output file and know the space availability.</div></div><hr />

If negative, it is a no-go zone. Also when no permissions are given on the share.<br />
<br />
If you want you can pre-write a file of a specific required size as outlined before with the seq.open() and seq.write() functions (read the return value of the written bytes) and remove the file prior to using the real thing (but this may be ineffective due to the way the filesystem is handling file history...</div></div><hr />
