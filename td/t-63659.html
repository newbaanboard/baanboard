            I'm New to this forum. I'm just a end user of BaaN IV.<br />
I just want to know, can we configure Auto email generation in BaaN. We are facing aproble in Material transaction. When we are receiving any new material it is get entered in Baan at gate. then it enter in stores. But as a end user of this material I have to depend on Store persons to teel me about recepcion of material. I want -when material is entered in Baan System. It should generate auto mail to the person who has indented the material. pl. Let me know if this is possible in BaaN IV</div></div><hr />

I am assuming you own baan source code and you know exactly when in the process you want notification and exactly who should get the notification.  What we do is we have a step in the process where you do receipt barcode tags.  At that point it checks our stopper list of material.  If it is on the list then it prints a note on the tag and the stores people notify the material planners - at least it is something like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">30th January 2013, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We used to use HPUX sendmail but when we migrated from a Unix/Oracle platform to a Windows/SQL Server platform we employeed a program called IndigoMail from a company called IndigoStar.  <br />
<br />
A query (session script) or report script is used to build a file which is then 'sent' using the application mentioned above by making a command line call with switches to include the file which was built. <br />
<br />
We also use SQL Server's Job Agent to execute stored procedures which employs SQL Server's msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail functionality.  This method requires less overhead to develop because you simply write the code and schedule it.  <br />
<br />
Using Baan requires the creation of a session, form, script, report, etc.  Most of our e-mails which use IndigoMail were ported from the Unix environment.</div></div><hr />
