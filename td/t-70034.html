<br />
I'm working on the ACH file report (Direct Payments) in Infor 10.4 and I would need to add on the header of the report / file a sequence number that increases for every file that is printed out. Now, I already have the format of the code, the only problem is that I don't really know where I could save the last sequence number in order to retrieve it and then add a + 1 for that variable in the script. Do you have any advice (or better way) to do it in Infor?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much,<br />

Hello Mark,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the reply! That was a perfect idea!!!<br />
<br />
I did what you suggested so:<br />
<br />
1- I'm using the table tcmcs050 (First Free Numbers) --&gt; I created a number group and then I'm using the field First Free Numbers that is long type so perfect in this case<br />
2- I'm reading the value from the table, adding +1, and then updating the table with the lock procedure that you told me and is working good!!!<br />
<br />
Only problem that may seem trivial: The procedure requested by the bank says that the first number on production needs to be 1, but the value of 0 is not allowed on the field table First Free Numbers, meaning that I can't put 0 on that field to then make the sum +1 and have as a result 1. Any advice??<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th May 2017, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you could just start it at 1.  So basically lock table, read table, get the number to be used for transaction, update the table only with number+1, release table.  Then when you look at the table the number you see should be the number you use in the next transaction.  It other words the &quot;first free number&quot; for next transaction.  One thing to keep in mind is to make sure the number is big enough you never run out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">18th May 2017, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Or, use a combination of Series and Sequence to make it infinitely available in future. Check if you can get it approved by the bank.<br />
<br />
Rest whatever Mark suggested, sounds good enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much for your advices @bhushanchanda &amp; @Mark!!! What Mark says is very good! Essentially my logic was the problem, because I was increasing the number before on the selectdo while reading the table, so when displayed on the report would be 2 the first time, and then when saved on the table the number will be 2. I wanted to use that logic because I wanted to put 0 as a first free number but then I realized that the value of 0 was not allowed on the field &quot;First Free Numbers&quot;...<br />
<br />
Instead is far more easy and logic what Mark says: to read directly the first number, display it on the report and then increase the number while saving into the table, so the first number read and displayed will be 1 and then once saved 2.<br />
<br />
Regarding the limit of the number, there is a limit established by the Bank: after 9999 the counter has to go back to 0001 (the first free number to be used in production). That I think I will manage it with a condition!</div></div><hr />
