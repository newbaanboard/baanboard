 Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Yes, it can be accessed in UE on its execution. You can retrieve the value using the field name itself. I guess you need to declare it extern.<br />
<br />
2. No, UE is too late for disabling the fields. If its a standard session, you can use session wrappers or table data authorization.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bombram</div><div class="date">26th August 2014, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Bhushan one more question, I am sure you know the answer  :-)     the field disabling was changed, now it is necessary only not to save record into table. I tried to use abort.transaction () in USER EXIT, but on the forum I found info that such functions can not be used in User Exits. What method it is better to use to cancel the updating  of the table?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can do like this:-<br />
<br />
if error_condition_met then<br />
err.msg = &quot;Error_message&quot; <br />
dal.set.error.message (&quot;tigenstring&quot;,err.msg)<br />
return(DALHOOKERROR)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
You need to include #include&lt;bic_dam&gt; in your script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">26th August 2014, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">You can disable fields through the UI as well.  Go to the session with a user that doesn't have session personalization already defined.  Personalize the field(s) in UI, including making fields read-only.   Go to session personalization in LN.  Find session and user, select lines, copy to a different level.  You can copy the personalizations to a role or a company level.  Once copies, all users with role or company will have the field blocked without any LN changes.  You can also hide fields and change position on the form or list.</div></div><hr />

One thing about return(DALHOOKERROR) - in some sessions (and in my case)   using  return(DALHOOKERROR) caused session blocking, to avoid it I used  return(0).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">27th August 2014, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">they are total opposites: 0 = success, DALHOOKERROR = failure. i suggest you look at your validation carefully. in case of failure you can have the following:<br />
<br />
				abort.transaction()<br />
				return(DALHOOKERROR)<br />
				show.dal.messages(MSG.ERROR)<br />
