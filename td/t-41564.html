<br />
I am creating a report that prints a customized version of the Purchasing Contract.  I need a page break to occur at the last layout for the report so that if multiple Contracts are printing then each Contract will be on its own page.  <br />
<br />
However, I find that using the page() function in my last layout, which is not a footer layout, does not yield the desired page break.  The documentation on page() says that it won't print if it is in a header/footer layout.  So I am a little confused as to why the the function won't generate a break for me.<br />
<br />
Here is the code that I am trying to use.<br />
<br />
after.field.tdpur300.cono.10:<br />
	after.layout:<br />
		page()<br />
<br />
Are there any pointers you might give me to resolve this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
          i think you want to print each new contract to satrt from a new page. That will require a coding to be done as report function itself willl not handle this for e.g see below<br />
<br />
if your report layout print or fits say 50 lines to be printed in single page, then you have to handle this with code. i.e if a contract is big and goes to another page say upto 30th line than there is possiblilty of starting the new contract from 31st line. so to avoid this u have to do certain logics. that is by using some predefined functions in report you can know that which line ahs reached than since you want the next contract to start from new page the simple coding will be to rprt.send some blank data till the line 50th is reached and the next contract starts from next page as your page fits in only 50 lines</div></div><hr />

Thanks for replying.  You are correct I do want to start each new contract on a new page.  However, I am unable to access the session program script to send blank rprt_send() as you suggested.  The session script is one the standards and the script is unavailable.<br />
<br />
As a work around I added a new after.field layout section in which it generates a new page.  Each contract now prints on a new page.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
