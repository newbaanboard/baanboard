<br />
Can anybody tell me how to set up crystal report 8.5 so that I can pick up data from multi companies and produce a consolidated report ?<br />
<br />

I have the required crytal report drivers to access BAAN data source.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">23rd November 2005, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently using Crystal 10 with the Baan driver for 10. We have used versions all the way back to 7.5 and the first Baan driver. If you are using version 2.5 then you will not be able to use the psuedo field called _compnr. The only way to do multi-company reporting is through the use of sub-reports. If you were using the Baan driver version 2.0 or less, then you could use the _compnr field in your database selection to get multi-company data. If you upgrade to version 10 like we have, then you can do multi-company reports by listing the companies you want data from in the logon to Baan for Crystal. It will only let you access company data that your userid is authorized for in Baan. They have been trying to close loop-holes in data security by linking the driver more closely with Baan security authorizations.<br />
<br />
Your other option would be to go around the Baan driver and connect directly to your native database through ODBC. We have Oracle as our Baan DB and we do this quite a bit. But, this is not without some differences in dealing with the data in it's raw format.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
