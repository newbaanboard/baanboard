The printing would slowly work its way down the form. We finally stumbled into the solution of our problem. We found that if we changed the Graphic Print Quality to its lowest setting in the properties of the printer it corrected the problem. It also caused the printing to speed up as a side benefit. The quality of the printing is fine. Perhaps this will help someone else with a similar problem.</div></div><hr />
