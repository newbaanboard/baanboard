<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ken bohnenkamp</div><div class="date">31st August 2014, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using a utility called nail to create an email with an attachment. The unix command I am using in a baan script is as follows:<br />
<br />
shell(&quot;nail -s Fin -a /home/kgb1test/filea.pdf ken_bohnenkamp@andersonsinc.com &lt;/dev/null&quot;, 1)<br />
<br />
The email does have the email attachment, but everytime I open the pdf in the attachment, it shows as being blank. If I open the pdf from the unix server, it shows the report data without issue. Why does it show as blank in the attachment ? Any help would be appreciated. :confused:</div></div><hr />

How are you opening , writing and closing the file? Check if you are closing the file before sending it.</div></div><hr />

My question is have you tried the command from the unix prompt itself?  Maybe shell out and run it yourself manually - make sure the file is there and readable by the user-id running the nail command.  See if maybe you get any errors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue is that you are redirecting the /dev/null as input into the email so its blank.<br />
I looked up the nail usage and here is more info -<br />
nail - This is a newer MUA recently brought to my attention. You can define outgoing MIME types beyond text/plain and application/octet-stream by using extensions and defining those in ~/.mime.types or a system-wide file.<br />
nail -s &quot;$SUBJECT&quot; -a $ATTFILE $MAILTO &lt; $TXTFILE</div></div><hr />
