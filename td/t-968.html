<br />
I've created a label in tdB40O_c4_liv0 called tdsls040.eono<br />
<br />
I am trying to put this label onto the tdsls440301000 report  which is in the same VRC. But when I try to enter the label on to my report it keeps on resorting to using tdsls050.eono.<br />
<br />
I am entering the correct label length and in the &quot;Maintain Report Label Fields&quot; ttadv3143s000 even when I zoom to my label it keeps on trying to use tdsls050.eono.<br />
<br />
Whats going wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">7th February 2002, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the label in &quot;td&quot; package? I am quoting something that I wrote in a different forum a long while back.<br />
Labels in Baan cannot be used across packages. You may see a label like tccom001.emno that seems to work in all packages. But look closer ... the label is<br />
<br />
package      label<br />
tc           tccom001.emno<br />
td           tccom001.emno<br />
ti           tccom001.emno<br />
<br />
<br />
Infact there is a session (ttadv1240m000) to copy labels from one package to another. And this is what Baan does during development. And changes to the definition of such a label in one package does not propagate to other packages.</div></div><hr />

From yours and ~Vamsi post it reminded me of a problem I once had.  When entering the label in ttadv3143s000 are you entering tdsls040.eono or are you entering td tdsls040.eono?  The second is usually correct.  I created labels for one of my tables once and it took me a while to figure out that when I created the lables I did tu tuddc905.site.<br />

I tried your suggestion and yes it didn't change to tdsls050.eono. The only thing is it didn't bring the label text up. Where the text normally appears the box remains blank and it doesn't allow me to type my own description in?????<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">7th February 2002, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I can think of two possible problems:<br />
1) the label you supplied doesn't exist (try zooming to make sure the label is exact), or <br />
2) the size of the label you are trying to use is too big for the place you are trying to put it (try increasing the size of the place you are putting it.  Again, you can zoom to see the size(s) defined in hte database).<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Ed- The label does exist and yes I can zoom to it. I have also verified the size of the label and there is room on the layout where I'm trying to place it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th February 2002, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at your screen prints. And &quot;YES&quot; you should be able to type in &quot;tdsls040.eono&quot; in the label field and have it return the label. OR you could zoom to the label and select it.  Either way it should be working.  I wonder if there could be something wrong with the table and its indexes?  Maybe that is why it returns tdsls050.eono when you type in tdsls040.eono.<br />
<br />
We saw something like this with our indexes for BOM records not too long ago.  When you tried to delete a BOM component, it would tell you that it could not delete it - it had problems with the component warehouse table.  I can not remember the exact error.  We had to rebuild all of the indexes on the BOM tables before we could delete records.  I may be totally off base with this, but I do not see where you are doing anything wrong.  Do other labels with tdsls040 work?  What about the tdsls050 labels - do they work if you select them?<br />
<br />
Sorry about the guessing, but maybe it will help someone actually solve the problem.<br />

I can put other tdsls040 labels and also tdsls050 labels on to my report.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">8th February 2002, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw something a while back that rang a bell, so I tried something out.<br />
<br />
In your table definition for tdsls040, do you use your tdsls040.eono label, the tdsls050.eono label, or did you type something in?  It looks the default label is tdsls050.eono.  This seems to cause the label to &quot;switch&quot; from tdsls040.eono to tdsls050.eono when you enter it on a form/report.  I'm then guessing that your second effort was typing &quot;tdtdsls040.eono&quot; in the label field in ttadv3143s000 (Maintain Report Label Fields).  This didn't switch because it was, in fact, using tdtdtdsls040.eono, which doesn't exist -- hence the blank field.<br />
<br />
I did a test.  I changed the related label on the tdsls040 table to tdsls040.eono (from tdsls050.eono).  When I went back to add my label on the report (after DD conversion) and typed in tdsls040.eono, it worked.  Somehow the label relation on the table must overshadow the fact that you have created a label whose name happens to correspond with the default Baan label name for that table field.<br />
<br />
So, it looks like you can either change the table definition of tdsls040 or change you label name to something like tdsls040.eono.1.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

I changed the label to tdsls040.eono.1 and this worked.<br />

Thanks for all your efforts guys.<br />

<br />
I guess I was too cryptic...<br />
<br />
well I checked the tools documentation and found that function.<br />
<br />
I guess if 2 labels are of the similar description/content, then the label with longer length is returned by that function.<br />
<br />
Also, with the new BaaN releases a new field is added to the index called the &quot;label context&quot;.</div></div><hr />
