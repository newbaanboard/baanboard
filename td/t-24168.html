<br />
In LN6 at Session (ttadv2500m000), I can add a report by clicking Specific&gt;Reports (ttadv3530m000),Then click Specfic&gt;Link Report to Session.<br />
There I specific the Group and No. to which I want to place the report. (something equivalent to BaanIV).<br />
I do not seems to have problem with other reports in LN6.<br />
<br />
Except for (so far) tdpur4401m000 (print purchase order) &amp; tdsls4401m000 (print order acknowledgement). <br />
By debugging &amp; reading script, I discovered that both the above reports doesn't really use/utilize whatever existing &quot;standard&quot; report or &quot;to be customized report&quot; that you have place in the Group and No. in ttadv3530m000 mentioned above.  In fact, both reports utilized the function script tdpurdll4401 and tdsls.dll4401 respectively which inside its script referred &quot;hard coded&quot; its existing &quot;standard&quot; report. Thus, I can say that it is &quot;controlled&quot; by script and not by the &quot;Group and No.&quot; in ttadv3530m000.  <br />
<br />
Anybody out there who can please help solve this problem.<br />
Or teach how to made the above mentioned function scripts to utilize the &quot;Group and No.&quot; in the ttadv3530m000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As u mentioned u r able to read &amp; debug ...means u hv the source code so y not carry out source code customization to suite yr requirement.<br />
:-)<br />
<br />

The reason I did not want to customize it because I just want to copy &amp; MINOR editing to layout to suit different users. So there is no point to customize it.  I can read source but fair in simple programming only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brad997</div><div class="date">31st May 2005, 04:51</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry,should be &quot;no point to use source, just use layout in ttadv3530m000&quot;.<br />
I just use ttadv3530m000 (not program source) to create many report layouts to suit many users in LN6 with no problem except in the tdpur4401m000 &amp; tdsls4401m00 (so far, I discovered these two in LN6 after upgrading from BaanIV).</div></div><hr />

In LN users have the possibility to automate steps that are present in the order type. When an order is approved automatic processing starts. If the order step for printing the order is automated the order will be printed automatically. A dll was needed to make printing the order available for automatic processing from all kinds of applications. So, reports are not strictly linked to a session anymore, but are related to print DLL's. <br />
<br />
Defect<br />
However, users want to customize the reports linked to the print session. I did not realize myself that during development of the automatic processing functionality. Just this week a defect was coming in. We are now making a solution for it in sessions tdpur4401m000 and tdsls4401m000, so that users can customize in the way as they are used to in previous versions:<br />
- The print reports are linked to the print sessions again.<br />
- If a user wants to customize, the options are:<br />
1. Copy the report to the customization vrc and simply change the report<br />
2. Copy the report to a new one in the customization vrc, link the new report also to the print session (in the same report group). When pressing the print button, a menu pops up which report must be printed: the new customized report or the standard report.<br />
<br />
You can expect the solution within a few weeks.<br />
When you have more hints, please post them!</div></div><hr />

It is indeed a welcoming answer from the guru himself.<br />
If the solution can come out within a few weeks, it can really make all the LN users jumping up in joy.<br />
<br />
Can please you let me know once the solution is out?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brad997</div><div class="date">4th June 2005, 10:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that SSA will need few weeks for the defects.<br />
However  I am really in urgent need to customize layout for few of my users.<br />
For the print sales order (order acknowledgment) and purchase order mentioned previously, I have only the function script (tdslsdllsls4401 and tdpurdllpur4401) respectively. Is there any way I can temporarily utilize the function script so that I can customize in such a way users can pick their choice of reports ? I have a few idea:_<br />
<br />
1. I try but not workable. In the DFE, i inserted a new field to the existing Form so that my user can select it. Then I write a few statements in the function script to get the new field that user selected. However its fail because as you know the new field will appeared as error message due not recognised and therefore the new field is not &quot;passed&quot; to the function script.<br />
If I have the program script , I can add the new field to the before.layout but problem is I do not have program script (only function script). Am I correct? Is there any way for the new field to be 'recognized/passed&quot; to the function script.<br />
<br />
2. Is there any where in the function script whereby the statement before the &quot;standard&quot; report, I can make a subroutine to pop-up selection &quot;window&quot;  prompting user to chose reports?<br />
<br />
Example (see may remark statement brad997 below):<br />
(in the function script)<br />
function long print.report(...)<br />
             .......<br />
<br />
	for nr.copy = 0	to (i.preview ? 0 : g.copies)<br />
		orco = strip$(tdsls400.ofbp) &amp;<br />
			strip$(tdsls400.orno) &amp;<br />
			str$(nr.copy)<br />
|| brad997-if i can make a pop-up here for user to select it.<br />
|| then I can write something i like this<br />
                         if report select = 1 then|say for &quot;standard&quot; report<br />
RETIFNOK(tdsls.dll4206.print.report(&quot;rtdsls440101000&quot;,device,tccom110.clan,o.process.stopped))<br />
                         if report select = 2 then|say for &quot;user A&quot; report &quot;99&quot;<br />
RETIFNOK(tdsls.dll4206.print.report(&quot;rtdsls440101099&quot;,device,tccom110.clan,o.process.stopped))<br />
                         if report select = 2 then|say for &quot;user B&quot; report &quot;98&quot;<br />
RETIFNOK(tdsls.dll4206.print.report(&quot;rtdsls440101000&quot;,device,tccom110.clan,o.process.stopped))<br />
| and so on....<br />
		o.order.printed = true<br />
	endfor<br />
<br />
	return(0)<br />
}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">6th June 2005, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to change following components to get a workable solution:<br />
<br />
1. Session tdsls/pur4401m000 <br />
- enable choice print.data in the std. commands and remove the choice cont.process in the form commands<br />
- link the standard and the customized report to the session<br />
2. UI script tdsls/pur4401 <br />
move logic from choice cont.process to choice print.data. As a result tools variable spool.report will be filled when user presses the print button.<br />
3. DLL tdpur/slsdll4401.<br />
Pick up the tools variable spool.report in the dll and sent that one to dll 4206.RETIFNOK(tdpur.dll4206.print.report(<br />
	spool.report,<br />
	device,<br />
	tdpur.dll0402.get.buy.from.language(<br />
		tdpur400.otbp),<br />
	o.process.stopped))<br />
This is the way the official solution will be made (more or less).</div></div><hr />
