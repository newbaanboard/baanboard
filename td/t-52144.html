<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marwest98</div><div class="date">20th May 2008, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a user that runs a script called timjrc174m000 to produce a file and copy that file into another directory.  For some reason the file is going into the second directory with 0 records.  They have to then FTP the file across now.<br />
<br />
Here are the lines from the script:<br />
<br />
This is what is was when the users say it worked:<br />
											|#10076.so<br />
|	i = server2client(&quot;/u01/matrix/matrix_new\OPRDOV01.TXT&quot;,&quot;I:\Systems\matrix.files\OPRDOV01.TXT&quot;,true,false,false)<br />
											|#10076.so<br />
<br />
They wanted to change the file path, so it was changed to:<br />
											|#10076.sn<br />
	i = server2client(&quot;/u01/baan/prism/matrix/matrix_new\OPRDOV01.TXT&quot;,&quot;I:\Systems\matrix.files\OPRDOV01.TXT&quot;,true,false,false)<br />
	|file.mv(&quot;/u01/baan/prism/matrix/matrix_new&quot;, &quot;/u01/baan/prism/matrix/matrix_new/archive&quot;)<br />
											|#10076.en<br />
<br />
Now they say it copies with 0 records.  Both look very similar to me, why would this be happening?  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

I do not know what would have changed to cause this, new server or new PC maybe?  The permissions look OK to me.  How would I get them changed.  I am not really a windows person and it looks like I don't have any authority to change them.  Besides when I mentioned it to the windows people, they basically said I was crazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can notice that you have a wrong slash in both paths:<br />
&quot;/u01/baan/prism/matrix/matrix_new\OPRDOV01.TXT&quot;<br />
<br />
Since I see it is a UNIX server:<br />
&quot;/u01/baan/prism/matrix/matrix_new/OPRDOV01.TXT&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />

Can you tell me what is the value of &quot;i&quot; after the server2client run? It should contain the return value.<br />

There is actually an old post that says the same thing.  What we can't do is get the file on to the I drive portion to go automatically, the user is having to manually FTP it to the I drive.  I think it has to do with windows permissions, but, I do not know how to prove it and the windows people think I'm crazy.  I don't have permission to reset the permissions, so, how do I prove it?  I saw the permissions thing mentioned in old posts also.</div></div><hr />

For some reason, the system puts the file into /u01/baan/prism/matrix/matrix_new\OPRDOV01.TXT, but When the FTP across happens it put the file there with 0 bytes.  The user has to manually FTP the file to get the file out with the data.</div></div><hr />

Can you debug and inform us?</div></div><hr />

However, I am new here, and, to Baan itself.  I may not have the correct permissions for me to run it and the FTP portion.  The users just ran it in production, but, it was too late for me to compile with debugger and stop them from running.  They are behind and in a hurry.</div></div><hr />
