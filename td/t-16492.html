<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 08:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All , I use GVIM on winxp .<br />
 <br />
I set developer settings &quot;C:\Program Files\Vim\vim63\gvim.exe&quot; for editor on BAAN tools. But it couldn't start gvim program. Only I can start it manually from windows. On baan, I couldn't start it. Additionally  I work it on windows by using this path that is &quot;C:\Program Files\Vim\vim63\gvim.exe&quot; -y  <br />
-y provides not to use vi editor properties.In this way you can use it like notepad. That 's all.<br />
 How can I start it from BAAN with &quot;-y&quot; option.<br />
<br />
Thanks ...</div></div><hr />

What happens if you just enter &quot;notepad.exe&quot; (or even &quot;notepad&quot;)? Does it work? If yes, locate where notepad.exe really is on your pc.<br />
<br />
Second, I think you could also enter a file with extension .BAT or .CMD, so what I would do:<br />
<br />
create a file gvim.bat (or gvim.cmd) that contains the complete path and additional command line options, such as<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\Vim\vim63\gvim.exe -y %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9<br />
<br />
place that file e.g. into the directory where notepad.exe was found<br />
<br />
and replace the entry &quot;notepad.exe&quot; by &quot;gvim.bat&quot; (or &quot;gvim.cmd&quot;).<br />
<br />
But: I'm on UNIX, so it's just an idea!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
I define global parameter GVIM on winxp<br />
On baaan , I define developer path that is GVIM<br />
When I edit my coding it gets me my baan code but when I update my coding <br />
and save it , my baan couldn't update my code. When I close editor and look <br />
at my code, I see old version of code. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that you said you took off the VI commands - so...<br />
<br />
what command are you using to save?  I don't have the VI commands off, and when I choose 'Save' it says it's issuing the :w VI command.  I think most people run this with the VI commands in there, if not, why don't you just use notepad?<br />
<br />
I would try turning the VI options back on just to see if the save works then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,<br />
it opened my coding on gvim , I used SAVE option or :w option it saved it. BUt When I <br />
re-open my source code , I saw that there was nothing change . I mean that &#305;t couldn't save my changings.<br />
What is problem ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you still using the -y option?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I used -y  it didn't work namely didn't update my code.<br />
also I used -E  option , didn't work ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what -E is for.  I have no options (-R on the read only), and mine works ok, I did not have to make any changes after install and calling it from Baan.<br />
<br />
Can you attach a screen print of your current Development Parameters screen(s)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">On my computer set gvim is a global enviroment and gave value <br />
&quot;C:\Program Files\Vim\vim63\gvim.exe&quot; -y<br />
look at attached file</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to test, try and remove the -y, I think it may be trying to issue the :w command, and since the VI commands are off it can't.  Not sure - I don't use the setup on the PC like you did, I was able to directly put the path in Baan:<br />
<br />
c:\Vim\vim62\gvim.exe<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, maybe the problem with your path was the spaces.  Try removing the spaces (using the DOS shortened names) or moving gvim to an easier place to access.  Also, as you can see, I have version gvim62, maybe there is a problem in gvim63, but I would not think so...</div></div><hr />
