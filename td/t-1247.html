<br />
We have a session that was created by a consultant.  It allows us to keep extra attributes about items.  So we have for example 25 extra attibutes for each item that must be completed when creatin a new item.  I have now needed to add another attrribute to the list of attributes.  I can do this in the Test company.  However in the Live company I get the error: &quot;Transaction is on, can't continue&quot;<br />
<br />
I have looked through the script and cannot see where this error comes from.  Is this a standard Baan error message or one the consultant would have created himself?<br />
<br />
Has anyone got any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Jason</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a standard error message. There is a programming error in the script because of the incorrect handling of instructions like<br />
<br />
 db.retry.point()<br />
<br />
 select.....<br />
<br />
 commit.transaction()<br />
<br />
 A good programmer should be able to fix the script. The error message suggests that a transaction is already started, so the next one does not come at the right moment. <br />
<br />
 Maybe a commit is missing, or.... there may be many causes for this error message. So, check the script again.</div></div><hr />

It could be due to the missing of a commit statement ( I got this message because of this reason ) or there may be some other reasons also. You have to look at the script part more closely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys I checked the script for the db.retry and commit.transaction statements.  The thing that is baffling me is that the scripts are identical between Test and Live yet it runs perfectly in Test but gives me that error in Live?<br />
<br />
This could not have anything to do with tables?  I know I had an error on one of the Live tables a while ago?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Please do a COMPILE of the script. I think you have an old object on the disk.... If the new script is good, the session should work fine on both servers after the compilation.</div></div><hr />
