full error message;<br />
<br />
adres_stack overflow entries &gt; 99<br />
Can not continue in tpcin0102s000 in DLL: ottstpstandard ()<br />
<br />
This error has occurred in our test environment.  I have tested the software which I developed in the development environment.  My software involves auto shipment &amp; generating outbound via STPAPI function server calls.<br />
<br />
It is at the stage that the shipment lines session is being called that there is an error.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">7th March 2002, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you are using function server calls, I do not know if this will be very applicable, but at least I hope it gives you a starting point.<br />

This happened very long ago and only once, so it is a bit vague. In my case, the address stack overflow was related to the display(&quot;field&quot;) instruction. Let us say, there is already a before.display event declared for &quot;field&quot;. Then, in the program logic, it becomes necessary to (re)display the field. This causes the before.display to trigger. This caused the before.display to 'recurse' and over-flow the stack. [The resolution (though not very clean) was to comment out the before.display event and enforce the initial display by hand elsewhere].<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can place the program in debug and let it fail, it should probably stop with a 'cannot continue' message near about where the problem is. Alternative, you could step through to see where it repeated goes back to the same point a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">popeye</div><div class="date">7th March 2002, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Like Shah mentioned, it because the logic is going into a recursive loop. It can handle that for 99 iterations.<br />
<br />
Try the following program script. You'll know what I mean.<br />
Note : All variables in func1() should be global.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
long i<br />
function main()<br />
{<br />
	func1()<br />
}		<br />
<br />
function func1()<br />
{<br />
	i = i + 1<br />
	func1()<br />
}</div></div><hr />

you made my day, the explanation which you had given helped me to resolve one of my problem.<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
