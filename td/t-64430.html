I find strange issue with my system. PLease check attached screenshot which comes when I try to get output in notepad. It seems some setting in baan is incorrect to be able to create temp files in local system.<br />
<br />
I checked access rights ad they are no issues infact I am able to get reports in notepad in other test servers but not in dev server.<br />
<br />
Please let me know where could I possibly correct/check this in Baan.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess its probably the access related issue at client side. I give full rights to C:\program files\infor for the servers.<br />
<br />
That might solve the issue.</div></div><hr />

I know when we first went to windows 7 we had an issue since we did not have rights to the program files installs - it was originally going under the c:\users directory somewhere.  I can't remember where, but like bhushan mentioned they had to give us rights to C:\Program Files\Baan\tmp.</div></div><hr />
