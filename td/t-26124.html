<br />
Good luck !!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
first thing to try is to log off and login into Baan. The runtime dd is loaded into memory when you start the bshell, so even after a successfull 'create RDD'  one may have this error.<br />
2nd thing to check: Does the company you want to build the table in have the same package combination than that you defined the table in?<br />
3rd thing: You have checkboxes in 'Create runtime data dictionary' specifiying whether the DD for tables/domains shall or shan't be be created.<br />
<br />
To make absolutely sure what happened: Lets assume that you defined the domain tcnewdom in package tc in package VRC tcB50C_xx_yyy and used this new domain in a new table tccom888 in the same VRC.<br />
Then you should find in the directory $BSE/dict/ddB50Cxxyyy/dtc.pd a file called dtc.pd. In this file you should find the definitions you made for the new domain tcnewdom. In directory $BSE/dict/ddB50Cxxyyy/dtccom you will find a file dtccom888 which contains the description for the table tccom888.<br />
