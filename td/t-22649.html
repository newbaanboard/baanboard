<br />
Now while developing AFS sessions with more complex functionality it becomes very hard to deug to know why a particular thing is not working.<br />
<br />
I understand that there is an interactive mode in AFS available. In this interactive mode one can actually see the execution of the session. Hence it become easy to look at the sequence in which the AFS is executing the session and its fields.<br />
<br />
Could I know how to invoke this interactive mode functionality ??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
However, if an interactive mode exists, it would be very usefull.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">17th December 2004, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">The best interactive mode I know is to compile the controlled session (not the session with the AFS calls) in debug. So you can see every execution and check all vars. You only have to be carefull witc the c command in the debugger. If you press it once, the session will run and don't stop at the next var. Breakpoints work as expected, but the sequence of the sections is different from the Flow of a Standard program (it is not really different, but it seems so at the execution because all vars are filled first and after this check.input is executed).<br />

<br />
I think 90% of Baan users are using the AFS logic as they do not have the source code of standard baan sessions but would like to automate the transactions with some additional functionality.<br />
<br />
If we do not have the source code then how to debug the original session ? Could you elaborate ?<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but I realy didn't think very much about it. During the last years I've changed nearly every standard-sessions we are using... and created some new functionality from the scratch. So maybe I've lost a little the contact to the &quot;normal world&quot;. I will keep it in mind for the future.<br />
