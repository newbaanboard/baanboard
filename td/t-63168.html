<br />
While Running a Query which has a Report Attached to it, I am getting an Error. &quot;Report not Present&quot;. It is because the Current Package VRC is not the same as the VRC of the Report. When i make the Current Package VRC as the same there is no problem.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to avoid changing the Current Package VRC not to get the Error?<br />

This is SP16 Baan IVc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th November 2012, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this for only one query or only queries in a certain vrc? Or does it happen for every query when the VRC's don't match? To me it sounds like a bug. I can't think of any permissions or setups that need to take place.  I get different errors if I am trying to generate an existing report when the vrc's don't match or if there is a directory structure permission error.<br />

We are on SP28(I think) and we have never had that problem.  No matter which VRC I am in I can run a query which has a report in another VRC. We never were very careful where we created the reports - so you see queries like tisfc001 which has a report in td.  I just tested a query like this with me in tf.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th November 2012, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point Gary.  I tried testing in our DEV company - but it worked no matter what I did - except for changing to company 000.  I created the query in our DEV VRC, then changed my package VRC to prd(DEV is derived from PRD) - it still worked.  I even went and deleted at the file system level anything with the query in PRD.  It still worked.  Now the company I was testing in was in the DEV layer, so I don't know if that makes a different.  Tried with several different DEV packages and PRD.  What I could not do is log into a PRD level company and try it.  We don't have a setup with two companies at 2 different package combinations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">4th December 2012, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The Problem is there with Other VRC as well and with Other User as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
And My Package Combination is the same one of which the Report Belongs. But my peculiar Observation is that the Running of the Report is dependent on the Current Package VRC.<br />
<br />
I have Observed on an Other Instance where the Queries run good that if the Report is present in the Package Combination it runs irrespective of the Current package VRC.</div></div><hr />
