I’m sending SOAP request for creating a PurchaseInvoice via BDE with VS; Added  WSDL file in  Web Reference, I’m able to use PurchaseInvoice classes.<br />
Attached you will find cs file and the log file of C4WS server. Can be noticed, numeric type attributes has not been reported in the SOAP request nor any enumerated type (like, fperiod.periodType = periodTypeDT.Fiscal), only String are in the SOAP Request.<br />
It seems to be related to VS itself or an incorrect setting by my side (?), because sending the message via SoapUI, works.<br />
<br />
PS: the error “Company 200 is not a financial company” is due to the fact I have to override the Activation section in the header and it’s not possibile because Company is an Integer and it is not able to handle numeric type.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Going through the log says BDE return value:'-12'<br />
Generally it is ENOMEM, have you checked if the error is intermittent or other webservices on that host are working fine without any memory issue?<br />
<br />
Aside, there is no namespace in the xml file... which is strange.<br />
<br />
