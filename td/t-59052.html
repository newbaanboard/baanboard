I have getting messag &quot;Unkonwn option&quot; when trying to zoomn from a field. If in the form data I check the field &quot;Automatic zoom&quot; then thezoom session does get called and I don't get an error message, while if the field is unchecked I get this error mesage and the zoomed session is not called. What could be the reason?<br />

Thanks<br />

Did you include a return field for the zoom? And is autoaccept checked? Not sure what else it could be.</div></div><hr />

This is my customized session. The auto accept is checked and the return field is alos present. If I check the auto zoom, then it works fine. <br />
<br />
This is the first time I am seeing the message. My session is type 4 session.<br />

Have you checked to see if anything is in any of the log files?  Have your tried creating a new test form with only this field on it? See if it has the same error. Just wondering if something is corrupt in the current form.</div></div><hr />

I did deleted and added the field, but it has no effect. Also, when I press Cntrl-Z, the zoomes session is called. It is when I try to use mouse, then I have an issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th August 2010, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">The mouse only?  Very interesting, but what I was suggesting was to in effect create a completely new form with that field only.  Do not use the old form - something could be corrupt in one of the tables on that form.  Do not even copy the old form. I have seen some forms get corrupted to the point that the only choice is to build a new one from scratch.  Try that.  I assume that form and field is the only one with this type issue.</div></div><hr />
