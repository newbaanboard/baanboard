<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 00:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a table (lflfa360) that is shared between two companies, 102 and 109 with the physical company being 102.  This table has three text fields.  Users in 102 can create new text records, but when users in 109 try to create new text records they get the message &quot;Record Text not found in table Language Independent Text Data&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I believe the problem is that the tttxt tables for 102 and 109 are not shared between each other.  Since the table is physically in 102, when 109 users try to create text, the session is trying to check against the 109 text tables when the record is actually in the 102 text tables.  One strange thing is that 109 users can edit existing text records with no problems.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone run across this before and does anyone have any ideas on how to get around this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure that the users are modifying the same text? It may happen that the same text no. might be present in tttxt010 tables for both 102 &amp; 109 companies.<br />
<br />
The only way (as far as i know) is to share the texts table (in tt package &amp; txt module)<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is not when they try to modify text.  For some reason there is no problem with that.  It's when they try to create a new text record.  The new text record is loaded in the 102 tttxt tables and not the 109 tables.  Baan appears to be doing something before the record is rewritten to the lflfa360 table where it checks for the text record on the Language Independent text table in 109.  I guess I don't understand why it is going back to the 109 tttxt tables before the save when a new text record is created.  Maybe that would help me find a way around it.<br />

did you try to share tttxt tables (if applicable)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">We did try sharing the tttxt tables on a test server when we were looking for the cause of the problem.  This does correct the problem.  However, we have nearly 10 years worth of text records on the 109 table that we would have to somehow map over to the physical table if we now shared them.  I guess what I need to do is find a way to make the script switch back over to company 102 when it does the check on the text tables.</div></div><hr />

We too have a table (tcibd001) that is shared between two companies, 945and 902 with the physical company being 945. Users in 945 can create new text records, but when users in 902 try to create new text records they get the message  &quot;Text not found in table Language Independent Text Data&quot;.<br />
