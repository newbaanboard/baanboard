<br />
The right side of the page is cut off and the fonts appear different.  Almost like bw thinks this client is printin landscape or when it should be portrait?<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions or experience a smilair situation?</div></div><hr />

   I would suggest checking the font spacing in the registry. Maybe the spacing is bigger than that of a machine with no printing problem ..<br />
Another solution would be is to replace the bwprint application on this machine with that of another client that prints properly..<br />

It appeared there was a missing font on this client.  It also appears that the missing font can be corrected by simply installing MS Office on the client.  I guess most would already have MS Office installed prior to Baan install.</div></div><hr />
