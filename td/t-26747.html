<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some programs that were responding in a reasonable time frame but suddenly they are hogging all the CPU resources.  No recent changes to the code have been made.  The reports are custom, so I doubt that BaaN will help me.<br />
<br />
The problems surfaced yesterday morning following some table structure changes over the weekend.  While I doubt that the structure changes are at the root of the problem, I did reverse them last night.  My effort was fruitless, so I am still wondering what is causing my problems.<br />
<br />
We are running on HPUX box using informix as DB.  We recently upgraded informix to level 2 drivers and BaaN from IVc3 to IVc4.  The upgrade occurred early in January and up till now things were running smoothly.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to further diagnose this problem will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Were there any custom indexes(or Baan indexes) that may have been lost? We ran into something like this once when we made a change to a table.  Did the convert to runtime - baan dropped and recreated the table with the baan indexes.  We lost the indexes the DBA's had created outside of Baan.  This caused several sessions to go from running in seconds to running in hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for responding Mark.  All of our indexes were created with BaaN tools.  When I convert to runtime, I just assume that all indexes are rebuilt.  However, this structure change that I put in place last weekend was the first time I modified a table structure in IVc4.<br />
<br />
What do you think about doing a reorg?  My problems are central to the tdsls tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not positive it would solve your problem, but it would not hurt.  In our case it was found by looking at the code.  They used table fields and not specific indexes so we changed the code.  Have you tried tracing a couple of the sessions?  There might just be a common table(s) that is causing the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not done tracing before.  Usually, I develop in my test VRC, and when I am satisfied, I copy into production.  My test VRC is a replication of my production environment and was rebuilt just this month.<br />
<br />
When I execute this program in my test VRC, I do get a good response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 21:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Check this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=95&amp;highlight=bshell+options) out for tracing options.  I usually use this in my bwc file &quot;-- -keeplog -logfile somefile.log -set TT_SQL_TRACE=0200&quot;.  I also usually keep a telnet session open so I can watch the logfile being created.  The logging will show the fetch time(and number of rows) on each of the queries.<br />
<br />
Also how hard is it to pull your customizations out of the way?  We have done this before when we place a call to Baan.  This way we can show that the standard session has the same problem.</div></div><hr />

Hi Joy,<br />
<br />
What change did you make to the table structure?<br />
<br />
Your profile says you are informix - is that correct?<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">29th March 2006, 00:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave, thank you for responding.  We have a custom index7 on the tdsls040 table.  The fields in the index are bkyn, orno, cuno.  This past weekend, I changed the order to bkyn, cuno, orno.<br />
<br />
Yes, we are still on Informix with level 2 driver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">29th March 2006, 01:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Joy,<br />
<br />
Did you update statistics on that table after you made the change?<br />
<br />
Informix has strange, complicated statistics that it uses but I think if you do<br />
update medium for the table and update full for the index you will probably<br />
be ok.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">29th March 2006, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday evening, I ran session ttaad4225m000 - Reorganize tables - with parameter set for data and indexes and using a table range of tdsls000 thru tdsls999.<br />
<br />
When it completed, I executed 2 programs that were problematic.  The programs run with no problems.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />
