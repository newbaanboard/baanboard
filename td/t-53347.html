It's been so long time not to write something on board. I wonder something abour run program. For some session I would like to use abbreviation <br />
For example : Session name : tccom0199m000 <br />
User can call this session from run program.<br />
I would like to call this session like &quot;ftp&quot; from run program. I tried to copy object of the session like &quot;ftp&quot; but calling was failed. <br />
May be someone knows something about it ???<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Best Regards</div></div><hr />

But the first thing that went thru my mind was to write your own version of run program.  Inside this program you could convert SALES to some baan session.  The other thing I thought of was a unix shell script to launch the session - the only format I know is ba6.1 tccom0199m000 and I do not think the ascii interface is what you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are on the old style BW, you can explore with the Desktop Management where you can set icons and titles for the sessions. <br />
<br />
I am not sure if these options are available on your Baan version thought.</div></div><hr />
