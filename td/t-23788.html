<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You were right; just under the maintain menus sessions. You have menus and under each menu you can define fields (sessions or labels) or submenus. These are menus which are also seperately defined as menus. <br />
<br />
If you are insecure about it, I would recommend to play around with it on a test server. It's not complicated at all; once you get the point, it'll be easy...<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />

<br />
In this program you have to search for a menu similar to that one you want to create. Then copy (with the copy button) it to your own VRC. Please make sure to &quot;Change Current Package VRC&quot; before copying. You should better give the new menu a different name. After that you can &quot;edit&quot; the new menu. You can delete unwanted fields or create new form fields. In the new form fields you can add submenus, like the warehouse submenu. After the editing you have to dump the menu, now you have your new menu, the old one is still valid(because of the different name). After that you have to assign the new menu to the users!<br />
<br />
ok?<br />

<br />
Once you have your menu, you need to either attach it somewhere onto another standard Menu (modify the existing menu by copying to your VRC withOUT changing the name or number), OR, you can directly attach your new menu to the User Data (Session ttaad2100m000, Form 1) then run convert for the user, and that will be the only menu they see.</div></div><hr />
