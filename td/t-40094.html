<br />
We are working on a global engineering process where all engineering takes place here in the U.S. and is then copied out to our plants in other countries.  Some of the records that need to be copied contain text.  Copying non-text fields between the server is not a problem, but getting the text to another server is.  It would need to also be copied into a new text number.  Is there a way to do this?  We would need to do it one record at a time and also groups of records at a time (i.e. mirroring tables).  Any help would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

As ur export and import environment both are Baan , there should be no problems whatsoever .</div></div><hr />
