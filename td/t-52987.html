I have group the buyer field in before field and then did add the buyer field in ascending order. But i could not get the group data correctly. Is any wrong with my input fields and layout? :rolleyes:<br />

Do you own source to where you can find the data before hand?  There are options without source that does work for 4c4, but I do not recommend them.<br />
<br />
What I see with your post is that you are not getting buyer code until the k.of.data layout - well past the sorting. So it will return the buyer code for the first detail record.</div></div><hr />

May i know how to make the item detail group by buyer? Besides, what do you mean by find it in the session script if i wan to sort by buyer? May i know the script or any way to solve this problem. <br />

So in the session script place a find there to get the buyer data to send to the report.  Then when the report does the sorting the buyer code will be part of it.  Then you can add a new layout to be displayed when you break by buyer code.</div></div><hr />
