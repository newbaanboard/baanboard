<br />
so having f1_field having 3 repeating fields I want to be able to code<br />
something like this<br />
<br />
if (not isspace(f1_field.cvnz(1))) then<br />
           | something<br />
endif<br />
if (not isspace(f1_field.cvnz(2))) then<br />
           | something<br />
endif<br />
if (not isspace(f1_field.cvnz(3))) then<br />
           | something<br />
endif<br />
<br />
When i compile this i get these errors:<br />
ptiitt24320( 148): Error: Illegal number of array subscripts for 'f1_field.cvnz'.<br />
ptiitt24320( 156): Error: Illegal number of array subscripts for 'f1_field.cvnz'.<br />

<br />
Can you post all of your code? How did you define your &quot;f1_field.cvnz&quot; variable?<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
Serkan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">17th January 2023, 14:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Isspace() is working with strings. And if you refer a part of a string like s_field(2) this will access position 2 of a string (the second character).<br />
<br />
If you are using a string array, try using s_field(2,1). This will access the index 2 starting with position 1 of the string in the array.</div></div><hr />

And, in order to check if it is empty i use the following script excerpt:<br />
if (not isspace(tiitt232.cvnz(1,1))) then ...<br />
if (not isspace(tiitt232.cvnz(1,2))) then ...<br />
...<br />
if (not isspace(tiitt232.cvnz(1,3))) then ...<br />
Does anyone else have other idea ?</div></div><hr />

you are wrong about the s_field(2,1) that you mention to be the second string in the array.<br />
In the &quot;infor es programmers guide&quot; at Strings and arrays topic they mention this example:<br />
STRING string_array( 7, 8 )		| The array contains 8 strings of length 7<br />
string_array( 1, 3 ) = &quot;abcdefg&quot;	| The third string now contains string value &quot;abcdefg&quot;</div></div><hr />

You got me on that. I'm always mixing it up, always ending in the debugger...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arrays<br />
You use arrays to store multiple variables of the same type within one data item. Each variable can be referred to with the construction array_name(index). For example, the first element in a one-dimensional array is array_name(1). <br />
<br />
An array can have up to four dimensions. The dimension (and, in case of a string, also the length) of an array must be stated in the declaration. <br />
<br />
There are three types of arrays: long, double, and string. <br />
<br />
Long arrays<br />
You declare one-dimensional long arrays as follows:<br />
<br />
LONG lng_array(5)        | 1-dimensional array for 5 longs<br />
The number in parentheses after the array name specifies the number of longs that can be stored in the array. You declare two-dimensional long arrays as follows: LONG lng_array(2,4)<br />
<br />
The first number after the array name indicates the number of dimensions in the array. The second number indicates the number of longs that can be stored in each dimension. The following diagram illustrates a two-dimensional array as a matrix: <br />
<br />
3 100 <br />
4 98 <br />
56 55 <br />
78 77 <br />
 <br />
lng_array(1,1) = 3      lng_array(2,1) = 100<br />
lng_array(1,2) = 4      lng_array(2,2) = 98<br />
lng_array(1,3) = 56     lng_array(2,3) = 55<br />
lng_array(1,4) = 78     lng_array(2,4) = 77<br />
Double arrays<br />
A double array differs from a long array only in that it is prefixed by the keyword DOUBLE and the array elements must be filled with double values. You declare a double array as follows: <br />
<br />
DOUBLE dbl_array(5)<br />
String arrays<br />
The declaration of string arrays differs from that for other array type in that the first dimension contains the length of the strings to be stored in the array. For example: <br />
<br />
STRING str_arr(10,5)        | 5 strings of length 10<br />
STRING str_arr(10,5,5,5)    | A 5 x 5 x 5 matrix of strings of length 10<br />
When referencing a string array, the first dimension indicates the start position in the string. The particular string to be accessed is indicated by the other dimensions. It is possible to specify a length for the string to be retrieved by using a semicolon [;] followed by the required length. If you omit the length, the total length of the string is taken. <br />
<br />
Example two-dimensional string array<br />
STRING str_arr(6,2) Space reserved for 2 strings of 6 characters each. For example, the first string contains &quot;abcdef&quot; and the second &quot;ABCDEF&quot;.  <br />
str_arr(1,1) = &quot;abcdef&quot; This references the first string starting at position 1.  <br />
str_arr(2,1;1) = &quot;b&quot; This references the first string starting at position 2 with length 1.  <br />
str_arr(3,2) = &quot;CDEF&quot; This references the second string beginning at position 3.  <br />
 <br />
Example filling string variables<br />
Consider a string declared as STRING strg(26). The statements listed below will have the indicated results: <br />
<br />
strg = &quot;good morning&quot; The words &quot;good morning&quot; are stored from the first position of strg: <br />
<br />
&quot;good morning&quot;<br />
 <br />
strg(1) = &quot;good morning&quot; The same result but filled with spaces:<br />
<br />
&quot;good morning               &quot;<br />
 <br />
strg(9) = &quot;good morning&quot; The string is stored from position 9 onwards and filled with spaces: <br />
<br />
&quot;         good morning      &quot;<br />
 <br />
strg(2;3) = &quot;Hello&quot; The letters &quot;Hel&quot; (3 characters) are stored from position 2 onwards: <br />
<br />
&quot; Hel    good morning      &quot;<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Example accessing string variables<br />
Suppose the string declared in the previous example has the value &quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;. The results of the statements below will be as indicated: <br />
<br />
print strg          &quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;<br />
print strg(13)      &quot;MNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;<br />
print strg(2;3)     &quot;BCD&quot;<br />
In these examples, strg( n) refers to the entire array from position n onwards and strg( n;x) refers to x positions starting at position n. <br />
<br />
Example two-dimensional string array<br />
Consider a 2-dimensional string array declared as: STRING twice(6,2). The statements below will have the indicated results. <br />
<br />
twice(1,1) = &quot;ABCDEF&quot; The first string is filled from position 1 onwards.  <br />
twice(1,2) = &quot;123456&quot; The second string is filled from position 1 onwards.  <br />
print twice(3,1) &quot;CDEF&quot; is printed. <br />
print twice(4,1;2) Two characters are printed starting at position 4 in string 1 - that is, &quot;DE&quot; is printed.  <br />
 <br />
String lengths<br />
There are two lengths associated with a string: the maximum and the current length. The maximum length is defined at declaration of the string and the current length can vary, depending on the contents of the string. <br />
<br />
If a string is declared as STRING strg(100), the maximum length of strg is 100. If strg is filled as strg = &quot;hello&quot;, the current length is 5. If strg is filled as strg(1) = &quot;hello&quot;, the current length is also is 100, as the remaining positions are filled with spaces. When you specify a start position, the string is always filled out with spaces. <br />
<br />
If a string is declared as FIXED, the current length is always equal to the maximum length, because the string is always filled up with spaces. Also, in the case of multi-dimensional strings, the current length is always equal to the maximum length. <br />
