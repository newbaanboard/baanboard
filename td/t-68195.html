<br />
There is one standard session which we copied in custom VRC. I had added some customized fields on that session form earlier. But now I don't want all custom fields on that session screen. Is there any possibility to hide that fields directly from DFE, because there is no script for the same. I know delete option is available for that. But is there any around way to do this like hide fields using DFE?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Anand</div></div><hr />

Go to the fields that you don't want and either hide them or change them to read-only.  Go into the personalizations session (ttaad9100m000), find personalizations by user and session, mark (select) all records in the view for the user/session, use specific/&quot;copy personalizations to other level&quot; to copy the selected lines to a DEM role or company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you can do that. Not sure about DFE, but you can do that using Session Personalization's(ttadv9100m000).<br />
<br />
e.g. If I have to disable a form field from tcmcs0123m000 session, I can simply create a new record in the above mentioned session with the field I want to disable and uncheck the &quot;Visible&quot; field for that record. <br />
<br />
In this case, you need to do that at company level though.</div></div><hr />

              You can hide fields from DFE, just go to field property-&gt; position tab -&gt; checked &quot;initial hidden detail &amp; overview&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I just went through the question again, just wondering, how did you added customized fields on the standard form without access to standard script?</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your quick response. Given solution works.<br />
<br />
Bhushan, I copied standard session in live VRC and added directly main table fields in DFE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
customization has been removed and it is working fine in Worktop but when I view the same session in webtop, it is still showing that customized tab. Is there any difference between worktop and webtop configuration? Please let me know solution for the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Customer Defined Field (CDF) will always show automatically in Webtop on a seperate Form TAB 'Configurable Fields' as soon as you add them to table.<br />
