<br />
In Infor LN, I have a requirement where I need to populate some data in  display multi occ session. <br />
<br />
Data is coming from multiple tables based on the condition hence I have to take  form variables in session. <br />
<br />
If my query has 3 records then only last record is displaying where I want to display all three records.<br />
<br />
Currently I am storing it in an array, but how should I display on the form <br />
<br />
Awaiting for your advise.</div></div><hr />

when ever the session is opened  , delete existing data  and update the table with your required data ... that way ... displaying  would be like any other session.<br />
<br />
2) or have  constant occurrence 10 - 15 and have to code ( for previous and next button to refresh  or something of that sort)  <br />
<br />
3) or the other thought would be 3gl creating the whole list kind of session</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
I would like to do it without using temp table. Can you brief me on 2nd point? how should I go about it? But I want to keep my  form variable will be only one. <br />
