I have created a report with a layout width of 143 characters. When i print the report to the device 'D' , the entire report is not shown unless I click on maximise. But the moment I click on maximise the first line of the header layout disappears from the report.<br />
The report width in the 'Maintain reports' has been set to 145, so that isn't the problem. What i have also noticed is that when we select the device 'D' , when printing the report, the page width value on that form is displayed as 80, instead of say 132 or 145 etc.<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">First I would say delete any defaults stored for ttstpsplopen.  Then I would say goto maintain reports, make sure form 2 has 145.  Then recompile the report.  You may even want to log out and back in to make sure nothing is hung in the back ground. Try again.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the quick response...but could yuo tell me how to go about deleting the defaults in ttstpsplopen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">In baan IV it is ttstpdeldeflt under user management.  In some cases I found where users did save defaults in ttstpsplopen and eventually they became corrupt.  So I first delete defaults for the user for ttstpsplopen - in some cases it acted like you mentioned, not changing the page width. The user was always told the report was too big for the printer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g√ºnther</div><div class="date">4th April 2007, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Such effects happen if you change the report width inside the report layouts only. But the report itself has some information that is normally changed on form 1 of maintain reports, field report size. I'm not sure if its enough to modify the field page width on form 2 (and maybe to recompile the report).</div></div><hr />
