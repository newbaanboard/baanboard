I want to know modelwise inventory report for that i am using tibom010. but i am facing one problem, Item is getting reapeted which are needed for two assemblies. Logically it is correct. But what can i do if i need it appeares only one time.<br />
<br />
For Ex -     Item A - X<br />
                 Item B - X<br />
<br />
And A &amp; B are needed to manufacture Item C. So when I want the inventory for Item C then this Item X is appearing twice however I want this only one time. <br />
<br />
I have taken tibom010 as base table.<br />
<br />
suggest me !<br />

Actually what you need is BOM explosin logic and keep on accumlating untill u reach the end of the item. It can be quite exhaustive. But I can suggest a simple way if you are open to csome customization. It is not the most efficient way, but defineltly most simple way w/o complicated logic. You have two options<br />
1. Keep all the calculation in an array and once you are done print the report from array. <br />
2. Create a new table that will may have following field<br />
  Sequence no.<br />
 Parent Item<br />
  Low Level Coce<br />
  Child Item<br />
  Inventory on Hand<br />
  Requirement.<br />
 The sequence number is a runing number to handle multi user environment. Once you finish the report delete all the records corresponding to that sequence number.<br />
<br />
So with this logice keep on adding record to the table. When you are done priint you report from this table. As I told you this in not the very best way, but it surely a qucikest way.<br />

That way you don't have to total it individually.</div></div><hr />
