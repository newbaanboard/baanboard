   I have a problem in sending a baan report as an attachment file using baan device. let me explain in detail.<br />
<br />
i have a device email which does not  work in my system(PC) for my user id . But the same device works for my user id in some other system(PC). then i checked for other users. and i noticed the same problem it wasn't working in my PC but in their PC it was working.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel it is the problem with Outlook setting...  if anyone has faced this problem or anyone knows the solution please let me know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />

   No its not sending any messages. and now i found that when i generate reports with this device. a file gets stored in baan temp folder of client system. i do not understand why its not picking up from there. <br />
