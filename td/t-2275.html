	Is there a limitation on the size of a string field that can be passed thru a BOI?<br />
	I have a string (length = 250) that's being passed thru the BOI. <br />
	The field is a part of the structure thatÂ’s being passed.<br />
	It gives me a fatal error whenever the length is on the higher side.<br />
	Works fine if the field has just 20-30 chars.<br />
<br />
	The BOI works fine (even if the length = 250 chars) when it's being called from the Program script.<br />
	But it throws a fatal error whenever I try to receive a &quot;big&quot; string thru the Java Client. <br />
                Check the attachment for the error mesg.<br />
	So I am assuming that there is a problem with the Java Client.<br />
	<br />
	I am confused (as usual).<br />
Cheers,<br />
Popeye!</div></div><hr />

   i was just playing with the script.<br />
   here is what i found ...<br />
   the java client starts throwing fatal errors whenever the # of chars in the field exceed 127 (Binary = 1111 111).<br />
   so does java have this restriction? so ..... is there something like<br />
   bigstring or something ?<br />
cheers,<br />

cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeyaseelan</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, there is a limitation on the size of the string field to be passed to the BOI's which are built using BOIBuilder session. When u build a BOI using BOIBuilder it sets the maximum size of the string field to be passed. But if u are good in 4GL u can always make changes in the 4GL DLL which is located in the application directory of the bshell.<br />
Normally this problem wont occur if u are using BOI's based on the OpenWorld Adapter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">popeye</div><div class="date">16th May 2002, 03:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jeeyasilan,<br />
     I did NOT use BOI Builder to create this BOI. I created it on my own. This BOI is different from the &quot;Standard&quot; BOI methods.  In the BOI I have the String as 240 characters. It works fine when I called it thru a 3 GL. But messes up when I call thru a java Client. <br />
<br />
I think the IDL can't handle strings &gt; 127 characters.  Is this true?<br />
If yes, how do I go about doing it?<br />
<br />
For the time being I am splitting the 240 string into 2 strings (120 x 2).<br />
<br />
I don't like it though.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
Cheers,<br />
P!</div></div><hr />
