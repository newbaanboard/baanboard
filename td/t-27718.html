Performance-wise however, it is often recommended to break the query into two this case, more like Bigjack's example..<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi... i was reading the 'Is there &quot;Join&quot; concept in BaaN Query' thread and now i'm asking myself why is better to execute 2 selects statements rather than one with a join (or a &quot;refers to&quot; clause in BAAN SQL)<br />
<br />
i am using Baan IV B40c.66<br />

Number of joins<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Problem<br />
Joining a large number of tables in a query will create many overheads.<br />
<br />
Solution<br />
Reduce the number of joins as far as possible.<br />
<br />
If the chance is high, the joined data for each record is the same, or is almost constant; it is advisable to separately read this data, in which the previous values are taken into account.<br />
<br />
Note: <br />
Take care of select * on joined tables. See help page 'select *'.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
To view all books in a dictionary (sorted by author), the next query was made:<br />
Bad situation<br />
<br />
select	books.*, publisher.* <br />
from	books, publisher<br />
where	publisher.publisher = books.publisher<br />
order by books.author<br />
selectdo<br />
Improved situation<br />
<br />
select	books.booknumber, books.author, books.publisher,<br />
	books.isbn<br />
from	books<br />
order by books.author<br />
selectdo<br />
	if books.publisher &lt;&gt; publisher.publisher then<br />
		select	publisher.publisher, publisher.name<br />
		from	publisher<br />
		where	publisher.publisher = books.publisher<br />
		as set with 1 rows<br />
		selectdo<br />
		endselect<br />
	endif<br />
Because an author usually selects the same publisher, the publisher will be the same for blocks of consecutively records.<br />
<br />
One cannot always foresee whether joined data will repeat in a main loop. The improvement in the above example must be implemented only where the chance is high.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nested queries<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Problem<br />
Nesting queries can reduce performance dramatically.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
Nested query:<br />
<br />
select	orders.ordernumber, orders.fld1, ...<br />
from	orders<br />
where	orders.ordernumber inrange :order.f and :order.t<br />
and	orders.status = released<br />
selectdo<br />
	select orderlines.fld1, orderlines.fld2, ...<br />
	from orderlines<br />
	where orderlines.ordernumber = :orders.ordernumber<br />
	selectdo<br />
<br />
Solution: Join nested queries into one -more complex- query.<br />
<br />
select	orderlines.fld1, orderlines.fld2, ...,<br />
	orders.ordernumber, orders.fld1, ...<br />
from	orderlines, orders <br />
where	orderlines.ordernumber inrange :order.f and :order.t<br />
and	orders.ordernumber = orderlines.ordernumber<br />
and	orders.status = released<br />
selectdo<br />
Note: <br />
There are some attention points. <br />
<br />
The higher the number of records at a high level in relation to the number of records at lower level, the better is the joined way of implementation. <br />
The higher the number of selected fields (and its length is related) at a high level in relation to the number at lower level, the better the nested way of implementation. <br />
Using the above example:<br />
<br />
Number of orders is X, number of fields in orders is A.<br />
Number of order lines is Y, number of fields in order lines is B.<br />
<br />
If A is much higher than B, it is preferable to implement the nested way.<br />
If B is much higher than A, it is preferable to implement the joined way.<br />
<br />
If X is much higher than Y, it is preferable to implement the joined way.<br />
If Y is much higher than X, the joined as well the nested way can be implemented.<br />
<br />
As can be concluded, one cannot always say for sure which construction is the best.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot, i found the document at:<br />

i will start reading it now</div></div><hr />
