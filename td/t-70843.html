Thanks a lot for your information...<br />
But the variable &quot; lattr.pageno&quot;  gives the current page number of the report.... But I want to count the number of pages are available in the report... For example, a report contains 5 pages then I want to display the page number as Page 1 of 5, Page 2 of 5. etc. <br />
<br />
I have searched multiple post in baanboard regarding this doubt... but I am not getting the proper idea about to display the page number as mentioned above... Hence can you please suggest some idea in order to display the page number as Page 1 of 5, Page 2 of 5 etc....<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advice...<br />
Regards,<br />

I know we only have one report that does this but it is a bear to maintain.  We are on unix and it basically counts all the lines can calculates the pages - not something I recommend.  I would look to see if there are any packages that does this - maybe NAZDAQ has something.</div></div><hr />
