I have the requirement to add the filter controls on a field that i added to the form but it is not part of the main table.<br />
I see there are no fields to filter. See the screenshot.<br />
I want to do this either programmatically or by form editor or another way.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Obviously this only applies if the retrieval of the field value can be expressed in a query.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
If you do this with extension, you should use nested query type or you can add referenced table but you must nsure that the record<br />
in the other table exists, otherwise the record of the main table is not displayed .<br />
<br />

But it seems to be a custom table. If &quot;Nr. foaie parcurs&quot; is just a field from a foreign table, it can be added to the query in the session script and filtering will be available.</div></div><hr />
