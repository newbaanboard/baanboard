<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theierm</div><div class="date">2nd December 2010, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I have main 3gl session with some graphical parts. By dubble click on some object the new subsession is activated (with wait.and.activate function). This subsession is 3gl with graphical parts, too (it is subsession for selecting a new color for object). Everything works OK with one exception - when i close subsession (by pressing cross sing in upper right corner of subsession window) then main session is closed, too. When i call from main session any standard 4gl subsession, then clossing this subsession does not effect on main session. Why this is not working for my 3gl subsession? Any ideas? Thanks</div></div><hr />

I found some workaround - do not allowed to close subsession with standard cross sign (create special button for clossing) - i am not very lucky with it.<br />
I attached two scripts - main session sdanpplan00011 and subsession sdanpplans0011 - i would be very grateful if you can check it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, search in the forum for how to select a color, there is a Baanish way to do so.</div></div><hr />

the subsession closing OK - the main session stay alived. But after return to main session, the event handler does not work - if i double pressed again the object, the subsession is not activated. Should i change anything in main session too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">3rd December 2010, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably, yes. As you can see, I used this function:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_process_groups_set_pgrp<br />
<br />
But since I saw that you are trying to choose colors, I suggested you search in the forum for how to do it. Let me know if you couldn't find any..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">3rd December 2010, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Check this link, if you want to know how to select a color :<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theierm</div><div class="date">3rd December 2010, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">This color selection is only example. The main idea is to have main session and from there activate some special subsession, where i can change all properties which selected object has (the color is only one of them).<br />
<br />
I see, that you used set.prgp(pid, pid). I think, that this way, the subsession losts connection to main session. I am looking for the solution which works the same way as for example zoom.to$ function for 4gl session.<br />
<br />
By the way, thanks for you effort again.</div></div><hr />
