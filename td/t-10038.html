<br />
I hv made two maintain sessions from a single table,<br />
the table consists  7 fields,<br />
item, unit, warh, pric, stock, purchase date, purchase qty<br />
<br />
i hv taken item,warh,purchase qty,purchase date (Ist session) in one maintain session and rest 3 and item (2nd session) in another maintain session<br />
<br />
Now the problem is this,after entering data thru Ist session,  and at the time of saving the data it is giving an error &quot;item price not allowed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Where   could b the error????????????<br />
<br />
Note--- I hv attached 2nd session with the first one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">16th May 2003, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite obvious... if you enter data with one session only able to fill half of the table, then you will find that all mandatory fields not filled are giving error. On the price field there is a restriction like &lt;&gt; 0 or so. If you want to do this, both sessions should also evaluate all tablefields, if there appear invalid data in either one field, you can take the option to zoom to the second session to get that field filled as well.<br />
<br />
From the functional point of view this is happening with tdpur4120m000 wich can receive a purchase receipt, but when ILC is involved (AND if a storage unit, a storage date (LIFO/FIFO) or a lot code is involved) you will zoom to tdilc4113s000 to add on the other tablefields that may not be empty under that condition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">17th May 2003, 14:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess you need to understand the first response correctly.<br />
<br />
you started out saying you are getting the error when saving.<br />
After the first response from OmeLuuk, you seem to be saying<br />
that it is during the zoom to the next session, you get this error.<br />
<br />
Try to debug step by step.<br />
<br />
you may want to intialize all fields to some valid defaults right after the Item is entered.<br />
<br />
Also look for possible errors in the domain selection.<br />
<br />
Look for possible other issues like form type, saving record<br />
or experiment with a different set of data (ex:0.0 instead 0).</div></div><hr />
