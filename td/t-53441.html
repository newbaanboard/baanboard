I am doing CRRT for a table in which i changed index fields. It is giving me error &quot;Error -13 during seq.open file &quot;/baan/dict/x/x/dtablename.old&quot;. What can be the reason behind it? What is the solution for this? Reply ASAP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
have a closer look at the file &quot;/baan/dict/x/x/dtablename.old&quot;<br />
a) if it exists, change it's permissions so that the user running the CRTDD (usually bsp) has write permission<br />
b) if it doesn't exist, you'll have to report closer details.<br />
What basically happens when you change a table and make these changes active, the old description is used to create a seq. dump, which will be read into the new table using the new description.<br />

I saw permissions dlptfl003.old. Its -rw-r----. And all the files for other tables have this permissions -rw-rw---. How does it affect? Because, in my case, if CRRT is done by bsp login then error doesnt come. But when user gets login then error is shown. So, should i change permission of this file?</div></div><hr />

It worked by changing permissions . But what made change in permission of this file? Since, all other files have same permissions except this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">26th August 2008, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Who's the owner of the .old file? Perhaps that can give you an idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vaishali_sftdev</div><div class="date">27th August 2008, 07:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, u are right. Initially it was created by my login. But due to some error it was recreated through bsp login keeping backup of file under different name. And therefore, bsp became the owner and i had only read access on this file. Thanks a lot for all inputs.</div></div><hr />
