<br />
I´m facing some problems with a report where is required to work with two different footers and I would like to ask if someone alread met this problem before.<br />
<br />
My report has two footers because the invoice form has a blank space reserved for fiscal comments - and this reserved area uses all footer.1 remaing spaces.<br />
<br />
The report heigth and the windows paper (customized paper ) height was set to fit with my report size, but when I run the session, the second footer is always printed at a new page.<br />
<br />
I tried to modify the windows paper size and the paper size at LN to be sure this problem wasn´t happening because of wrong paper sizes, but even when I visualize the report at bwprint viewer,  I got a huge printed paper ( with lots of free space after my first footer ) and a second paper with my second footer.<br />
<br />
I talked about this with some friends from Infor Brazil and one of them said it wouldn´t be possible to work with two footers at LN, but I´m sure I already have done reports like this at  baan IV:confused:.<br />
<br />
Some one has an ideia how can I solve this issue?<br />
<br />
tks<br />

<br />
Unfortunally, I´m working with two footers a little morecomplex than your example. When I have few lines at first footer, there´s any problem, but when I use max lines possible at first footer, the second footer always is printed at a brand new page.<br />
<br />
here is my report:<br />

<br />
I increase the number of lines to maximum on footer 1 and 2. And still working<br />
<br />
Send the report so we can be more specifics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pgushi</div><div class="date">29th December 2008, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I´m uploading my files now.<br />
<br />
I tried to change the 'page length' at reports - specials at report maintanance and at 'fonts by paper', increasing values to 66 at a first test, 68 at second test and 70 at my last try.<br />
<br />
I did create a new form at windows ( you can check at bwprint file at zip file ) and even I did increase the form length, the report ignores the avaible space at first page and print the second footer at new page.<br />
<br />
tks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">_Ralph_</div><div class="date">30th December 2008, 13:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats too strange.<br />
<br />
When you said that the footer was printed on a new page, I thought that it appears on the footer space.<br />
<br />
But it is where the new header should be. Thats weird.<br />
<br />
As I said before I could not simulate this on my environment. I'll try with text fields, but i still thinking that the problem have something with the device. The number of lines to be more specific<br />
<br />
What i purpose its to copy the footer 1 as an after field( you can use a boolean flag to enable it) in this case i think thats more appropriate and use the footer 2 as unic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gave up from use two footers and created a second detail who always is printed when all invoice lines are done( changing my first footer to detail.2 and my second footer to footer.1) , using layout.again() to print my second detail after set a variable control to print it.<br />
<br />
Tks for your help ^^<br />
<br />
