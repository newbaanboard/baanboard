I have a sample zpl code created in report layout in LN and tried to print in ZEBRA printer. the problem it is not able to print and when i checked the tmp files in $BSE/tmp i found out there are some special characters supposed to be not included in the layout, may be those character was the culfrit.<br />
<br />
Could you please advise what is wrong and how to remove those stuff.<br />
<br />

Hello,<br />
as shown at the attachement, it's not a proper ZPL sequence.<br />
Where does ^[^T!&quot; come from ?<br />
<br />
Do you use a proper printerdriver. Must be a RAW ASCII driver.<br />
As shown in your other thread, check the lc_asc driver you use.<br />
Must be at : $BSE/lib/printinf/l<br />
<br />
I guess the problem is there. Some years ago, i've written such a driver for our BIV systems.<br />
<br />
lc_asc ther was a synonym for :<br />
<br />
LTi character ascii<br />
<br />
Maybe your LN takes an other driver.<br />
The ZPL II solution yorks, if all ZPL sequences are streamed as raw ascii to the ZEBRA printer.<br />
<br />

<br />
thank you for your patience to help me.<br />
<br />
the screenshot that i was posted before has taken in $BSE/tmp directory, since the zebra printer was not printing i curiously checked the temporary files on the said dir. in found out that format with the special character.<br />
<br />
about the driver, in directory $BSE/lib/printinf i created a sub folder &quot;z&quot; and created a file with empty and named it lc_asc then put into said directory.<br />
<br />
could you help me to know on how to get the correct driver? maybe and hope that this could be the problem.<br />
<br />
thanks a lot<br />

<br />
It is now working, thanks for your big help. what i did is to create a new folder folder &quot;l&quot; in $BSE/lib/printinf and put the driver in the said folder.<br />
<br />
thanks a lot and regards,<br />

what you descripe can't work.<br />
<br />
The drivers are located in $BSE/lib/printinf/...<br />
<br />
There are subdirs like e = epson , i = ibm h = hp a.s.o<br />
<br />
In LN device the 1st character defines where the driver is located.<br />
<br />
So i propose to use a generic epson driver like epson_fx.<br />
This driver should be on your system by default.<br />
<br />
I attach the lc_asc driver.<br />
For upload the file is named lc_asc.txt.<br />
<br />
To use them, it must be located at $BSE/lib/printinf/l directory as lc_asc.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Sorry, i saw you last post too late (After answering).</div></div><hr />
