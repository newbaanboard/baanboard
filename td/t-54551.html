This is a very rookie question but I have gone brain dead.  I want to select the max record from a table that contains an item number and a sequence number.  What clause can I use in the select statement?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

as set with 1 rows</div></div><hr />

Look at the post times....in this case the answers were minutes apart.  So he might looked at the post for a few more minutes before providing his reply.  Sometimes I bring up a post, get interupted, then respond - which provides an opportunity for someone else to have posted the same answer.  And sometimes the wording between the two answers are different and one has a better explanation than the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">18th December 2008, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">My comment was also referred to this other link:<br />

But if this isn't a problem for the forum isn't a problem also for me...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcropp</div><div class="date">19th December 2008, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you for your help.. all. It really helped refresh my memory as I have been out of the BaaN camp for a while working on other systems.  It really doesn't matter if the answer is duplicated, so long as it is answered.  I appreciate knowing that I am not alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also you can try with this one:<br />
<br />
select	max(field):host_variable(optional)<br />
from	table<br />
where	&lt;condition&gt;<br />
order by &lt;clause&gt;<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Greetings :D</div></div><hr />
