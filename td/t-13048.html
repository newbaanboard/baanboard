<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I encounter the following issue and wonder if anyone has an explanation and / or solution/workaround:<br />
<br />
I zoom from a parent display-session to its child display-session, passing on certain values of the current selection in the parent to the child, and displaying the data in the child for that selection.<br />
<br />
In the before.program of the child I execute a query using 'group by', for I must select the orders on the index, but have them ordered by a different field. I know that 'group by' and 'order by' take long time [by the way does anyone know what takes longer: group by or order by, or that they are about the same - logically I would say that group by takes even slightly longer, but I'm not sure]; however I noticed that the first time entering the child session with a certain selection, the select in the before.program takes very long. If then I EXIT the child, and then from the parent zoom again to the child with the SAME SELECTION, the the select in the child takes maybe a tenth of the time!!!<br />
<br />
For instance:<br />
Let's say the selection is on about 30k records SEARCHED ON INDEX, grouped by one field, which is producing 15 records. Without using group by this selection takes a split second, and the first time with group by it takes around 20 seconds or more(!!!!). Second time zommed without having changed the selection in the parent session, - ALTHOUGHT THE CHILD SESSION HAS BEEN CLOSED COMPLETELY AFTER THE FIRST TIME -  it takes maximum 2 seconds!! <br />
 <br />
<br />
-   How is this happening (i.e. I had closed the child completely and then re-opened it for the same selection)? <br />
-   Is the first time where it takes long 'unusual' and from the second time on the 'usual' or is the first time the normal time it takes, and for some reason afterwards goes faster?<br />
-   I need to solve this. I.e. I MUST get this running as fast as the second time, (also) when zooming to the child the first time for the given selection!! How?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance! Any clues would be highly appreciated!!<br />

<br />
Initialization of the first session maybe slow when you use an older portingset. This has to do with file-I/O even though the system logs files as being read from shared memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ome Luuk,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response. I think however you misunderstand me. This has nothing to do with first session start-up. The case is as follows:<br />
<br />
On the active bshell, after running already the specific sessions 10 times - that doesn't matter - I start session A, which is a display session. <br />
- The session starts immediately, and gives me my records; no problem. <br />
- In session A I define a selection for display, and get the records immediately - no problem. <br />
- The I zoom - via specific - to session B, the child of session A. This session receives the selection criteria from session A, and display data accordingly. <br />
<br />
In the before.program of session B, I run a select based on the selection criteria which were imported from the parent session A, using 'group by'. Here the symptoms happen as descibed in my first post. I.e. first time selecting with specific selection - even if the session has been closed, AND EVEN IF THE PARENT SESSION HAS BEEN CLOSED MEANWHILE (!!) and then open the parent again, select in the parent the same selection as the last time. Now zoom to the child, and the selection will go fast. If the selection criteria were changed in the parent, even while the session is still open, the select in the child will be again very slow the first time, etc.<br />
<br />
Hope the symptoms are clear... <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Yet, although symptoms are clear.<br />
<br />
I think logging would help you understand what it taking so long either way with using group by etc.<br />
<br />
Ok, what you say: srdd usage is not the problem, it is query handling. So you will need to see the logfile with TT_SQL_TRACE=20240 and in that case a dbgtime option (added in newer portingset) and dbgfdev (to see creation of sort / query file IO).<br />
<br />
Then you may be able to pinpoint the cause of your delay.<br />
<br />
What is your portingset version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 13:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, since the second time is much faster, it points to the query being cached by Oracle.  The first time, Oracle probably has some difficulty building a query plan, but, once it is cached, the query runs reasonably fast.  If you can, you could verify this by executing the sessions, then flush the Oracle cache, and execute again.  The second time should now talking as long as the first time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the replies. <br />
<br />
I ran a trace with -dbgfdev, and these are the results:<br />
<br />
First time:<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
Nr Rows Fetched                 :    24<br />
Fetch Time for 1st Row          : 31.281 sec<br />
Max Fetch Time                  : 31.281 sec<br />
Average Fetch Time              :  1.304 sec<br />
Average Fetch Time (except Max) :  0.000 sec<br />
Total Time                      : 31.297 sec<br />
<br />
<br />
Second time:<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
Nr Rows Fetched                 :    24<br />
Fetch Time for 1st Row          :  1.734 sec<br />

Average Fetch Time (except Max) :  0.000 sec<br />
Total Time                      :  1.750 sec<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
When trying with -dbgtime, I received bw-errors, and the bshell didn't connect, so I assume that this is not available for my porting set...?<br />
<br />
As you can see the first time takes over 30 seconds in this case, and the second time lesst than 2 seconds! This is also after closing both the parent and the child, and then opening them again with the same selection criteria as before.<br />
<br />
Nico, where do I find the Oracle cach? How do I flush the cache?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">En,<br />
<br />
I would not advise you to manually flush the Oracle cache. <br />
<br />
From my observation from few sessions in our development group was due to many disable/enable-fields commands used in the sessions, which were executed for all the fields, used in single &amp; multi-occ sessions. I changed the code to use certain enable/disable in single occ mode and the rest in multi-occ mode.<br />
This helped to improve the startup of the session.<br />
<br />
More info refer to the link -  <br />
refresh  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1676&amp;highlight=disable.fields) <br />
<br />
If you post your code it will certainly help others to look at the programming problems.</div></div><hr />

Np, I am aware of the performance problem when using too many display() and refresh(). However, this is not the case in my session at all.<br />

I think we have a level 2 db driver. But am not sure how/where to check that...  :o <br />

I think my queries are optimized. I played around with it, and tried a few variations. I will post the relevant parts of the code; maybe anyone sees anything...?<br />

I also tested this now, and I receive compilation errors. The group by is 'not expected' etc.<br />
<br />
But anyway, I still do not understand how that shall improve my selection. The way I see it: I select a bunch of records - depending on user's selection upto 100k records - based on index fields. Without using group by this is no problem; it flies. When using group by it takes forever - upto 70 seconds for a big selection THE FIRST TIME per selection. When changing the selection criteria the performance is slow. When re-selecting a selection which was already selected, even if meanwhile the sessions have been closed, the performance is great. <br />
<br />
I would like to know if it is normal that the group by multiplies the fetch time by about 12-14 (i.e. it takes about 10 to 12 times more than without the group by). <br />
<br />
I will try to add an index with the cpcl.c as first index field, but seriously do not understand how this should enhance my performance... will let you know...</div></div><hr />

it has to be resorted to be able to &quot;group by&quot;<br />
