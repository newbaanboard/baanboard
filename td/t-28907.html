mark.occ()<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Syntax<br />
void mark.occ( long occurrence )<br />
<br />
Description<br />
This marks the specified occurrence with a reverse bar, makes the marked record the current record in the database, and sets the predefined variable actual.occ to the marked occurrence. <br />
<br />
The following predefined variables are relevant to this function:<br />
<br />
marked<br />
 Use this to check whether an occurrence is marked or not. This can also be tested in the on.exit subsection of a zoom process.<br />
 <br />
mark.status<br />
 This is available in the subsections before.choice and after.choice of choice.mark.occur. It indicates the type of marking that the 4GL engine is executing. It can have the following values:<br />
<br />
DUPL.OCCUR     during marking for copying<br />
TEXT.MANAGER during marking for edit text<br />
0                            in all other cases and when not marking<br />
 <br />
<br />
Note<br />
Use remove.mark() to unmark the occurrence. <br />
<br />
Context<br />
4GL library function. <br />
<br />
You can use this function only in 4GL scripts, and only in choice and form sections of those scripts. You cannot use it in programs of type 4.<br />

Well without knowing what is in the &quot;(....)&quot; in is really hard to help.  This should work.  Check it in debug mode and see what is happening.  And maybe provide enough of the script so we can see what might need to be changed.  Since you are inserting records the current records fields should be available, but only if they have been entered for this record.  Are you trying to check something from a previous input record?  More info is needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the your condition &quot;(....)&quot; is always true and that is why you are getting all fields disabled. I tried to do a simple test with maintain Areas and I managed to disable the description field when ever the Area code didn't include &quot;0&quot;. All I did was:<br />
<br />
field.tcmcs045.dsca:<br />
before.input:<br />
<br />
   if pos(tcmcs045.creg, &quot;0&quot;)&gt;0 then <br />
      attr.input = false<br />
   endif<br />
<br />
So, yes, you can disable some of the fields and not all of them. You can debug your code to see the result of your condition.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<br />
Did you debug your code? Does it reach the &quot;attr.input = false&quot;?<br />
<br />

<br />
Try checking attr.element - I think this relates to the depth on the field.  I can only assume that element 1 is January.  Your check would look like this:<br />
<br />
if attr.element =3 or attr.element = 6 ..... then<br />
      attr.input = false<br />
endif<br />
<br />
If this does not work post the actual code.</div></div><hr />
