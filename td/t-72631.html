<br />
My goal is to eliminate a million MS Access files and Excel sheets that are used to get data dumps out of BaaN because each person that created them over the last 20 years put their own little spin on them and none of them match.<br />
<br />
I was hoping to find a forum or a site that has a bunch of Crystal Reports or just some SQL queries that give some straight forward reports like Backlog, AR Trial Balance, Bookings, etc. Are there any forums or sites that have some queries or reports for download?</div></div><hr />

I am not sure any tool you pick will not end up the same way - seems like the customers always wants something quick and easy in excel - then they take it and run with it.</div></div><hr />

It is knowing the tables in BaaN and how they link up to get the data.  Once I know the queries or have a canned report I can modify I can create the reports and dashboards I need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th January 2020, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have access to the tools sessions?  You can run reports on the tables and see the relationships on the tables.  If help works - you can run a session and do help on fields to see table and field names.  Even go into forms and reports to see table fields.  Pretty easy at times to link some tables together.</div></div><hr />
