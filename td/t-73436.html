<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomasm</div><div class="date">14th September 2020, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I am geting a strange error when I want to zoom to the session tipcs3140m000 (General Project Cost). I get the error if I zoom from the menu and if I zoom from the code (zoom.to$())<br />
<br />
The error is:<br />
Error 506 (Table does not exist) on tfgld008000 in db_eq<br />
Can not continue in tipcs3140m000 (&lt;89&gt;)[db.eq]<br />
<br />
Obviously that table should not exist in company 0. But why is it trying to select on company 0?<br />
<br />
The code in the script that generates the error (in session tipcs3140m000) is: <br />
function fill.unit.code()<br />
	|In this function the unit code 1 of the imported ledger account<br />
	|is read and put in variable 'ftrs.cuni'.<br />
{<br />
	table	ttfgld008<br />
	tfgld008.leac = import.leac<br />
	ftrs.cuni = db.eq(ttfgld008) ? &quot;&quot; : tfgld008.uni1<br />
}<br />
<br />
I don't have access to change standard but I can export values from the zooming session.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated :)<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

Is there other code in tipcs3140m000 that sets the company based off something else in the zoom?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it is a  a custom session and you are right that there is code under the 'before.zoom:' section. But there is nothing there to set the company number. And also (verified with debugger) when calling 'zoom.to$()' from a user action this section is completely bypassed.<br />
<br />
I have then noticed that there is also a sub-session (tipcs3410s000) and when I call that instead it is the same behaviour.<br />
<br />
The code in the session we are zooming to is defined under the section 'form.1'. To try to avoid that part of the code I created a custom session just as a copy but then put the only available form as form number 2. Did not make any changes.<br />
<br />
So I ended up creating my own session as a copy of the session I want to zoom to and made it with own script name. Now I could copy the standard script into that and compile. So when I do that and it crashes the debugger will show me the part of code that is wrong. This way I could figure out what variable was not correctly initialised.<br />
<br />
Turns out in the end that if I add the below code to the 'before.zoom' section in the session I am zooming from then it works. It does not end up on the correct record but as I need to do an insert anyway this is good enough for now.<br />
<br />
<br />
	| for tipcs3140s000<br />
	tfgld102.tcom = get.compnr()<br />
	select<br />
		*<br />
	from<br />
		tfgld008<br />
	where<br />
		iprj = tfgld.intr.pcs<br />
	as set with 1 rows<br />
	selectdo<br />
		tfgld102.leac = tfgld008.leac<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for taking your time Mark!!<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />
Thomas</div></div><hr />
