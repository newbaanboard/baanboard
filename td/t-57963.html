Check difference between standard and customization.<br />

<br />
In std report it's printing all the items only problem with customize report.<br />
If the Item is repeated continuously then only it's skipping while printing but if item is repeated odd sequence then it's printing all lines.<br />
Also i have done the program script debug ,in this its sending all lines to RptSend().<br />
<br />
<br />
In Report Layout also i have given print condition as 1 .<br />
<br />
Please find the attachment of my layout print condition.<br />
<br />

Assuming that option is still available on LN - been wrong before on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manish_patel</div><div class="date">8th March 2010, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">It displays only one record for Order and Item combination; as you have not used detail layout (from attachment!!!).<br />
<br />
<br />
In Report Layout also i have given print condition as 1 .<br />
<br />

<br />
I am printing the order lines in the before field of tdpur401.item.<br />
Also i have also verified the suppress identical values is not selected.<br />
<br />
But My report is printing the correct result if Items is repeated in odd sequence.<br />
<br />
e.g:  1   ABC   10   10000<br />
        2   XYZ  20    12000<br />
        3   ABC   30    5000<br />
<br />
In this situation i am getting all three lines in the report<br />
But if Items repeated in following manner in any position then it's printing only first position of that item.<br />
<br />
e.g:   1   ABC   10   10000<br />
        2   ABC   20    12000<br />
        3   XYZ   30    5000<br />
OTPUT<br />
          1   ABC   10   10000<br />
          3   XYZ   30    5000<br />
<br />
