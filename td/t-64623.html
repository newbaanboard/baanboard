Use brp.open() function to do that.<br />
<br />
long brp.open( string rep_name(16), string<br />
  device(14), long mode )<br />
<br />
Check this Link (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_reports_choice_report)<br />
<br />
You can use :-<br />
<br />
e.g. <br />
if enum_field = tcyesno,yes then <br />
brp_id1 = brp.open( &quot;rtccom040101000&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, 0 )| Spooler is opened aumatically<br />
endif<br />
<br />
if enum_field = tcyesno.no then<br />
|open some other report<br />
endif<br />
 brp.ready( brp_id1 )<br />
 brp.close( brp_id1 )</div></div><hr />

Well, you can go for seq.* functions too. What you can do is, create a tmp file on server with seq.* functions with some field separator. Then, you can use  server.to.client() to get the file on local machine.<br />
<br />
Now, based on your condition you can design whole file. See, there are various ways, you need to chose the best for you.<br />
<br />
I would have used brp.* functions if it was a report containing less columns but if my report has more than 15-20 columns I would go with seq.* functions. Well, again, it depends on the users requirement as well.<br />
<br />
So in short:-<br />
<br />
1. Create two functions which will print your two reports using seq.* functions.<br />
2. Based on the enum value, call any 1 function.<br />
3. Now, when the file is created on server, transfer it to client.<br />
<br />
Done!</div></div><hr />
