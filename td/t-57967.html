<br />
I'am also facing a similar Issue.<br />
I have developed a customisaed display session and an associted DAL2 with it.<br />
I want to run this session and DAL in debug mode, but they would never open in this mode. I have compiled both object in Debug, checked for any bshell configuration setting during login or user default settings, even deleted old objects and compiled freshly in debug mode, But none of them is helping. The session still opens up in compile mode only. <br />
Any change I'am doing in both scripts in reflecting at runtime, but again in compiled mode only.<br />
<br />
Please suggest what could be the reason for this problem. I'am not able to restart the shared memory due to restrictions, so what else could be done to run the debug session.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

I am not positive since we do not use it.  If that is the case then they may have to wait until a future outage window.</div></div><hr />
