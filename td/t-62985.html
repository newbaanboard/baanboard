I have a problem in our system. We have defined some roles in the system restricting the access to some data from users based on the item number. What my problem is now is that when having one of these roles and trying to open session whwmd2570m000 (Rejected inventory) the startup just hangs. I get a window up saying &quot;starting session&quot; but then nothing happens. If I try opening any of the menus in the menu browser while this is going on it just says &quot;loading...&quot; there as well and doesn't open the menu. If I give myself full session and table access I can get in without problems.<br />
<br />
But any violated role restrictions should just give an error message, no? It's strange that it just hangs. :confused: I've tried checking the sql of the session by using ctrl + shift + 8, and checked the restrictions on the tables, and the main table whwmd270 has no restrictions. It uses tcibd001 and whwmd400 in the join and there we have restrictions on item numbers however. But I've tried opening the session with a different role which also has restrictions on the item number, and it is able to get in. (But that one has no matching entries in the table) It is a bit slow though. If I have full db access it starts right away. Any idea what could make it hang like this? I have the problem both in the desktop and the webtop. The table has only 15 rows, so it shouldn't be caused by a big query either. But could it be rewriting the script behind it to some big monster because of these restrictions? Both tcibd001 and whwmd400 already has indexes on the item, so there's nothing we can optimize there I guess. Is there something I can do without just deleting these restrictions?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

I just hope that the constraint on tcibd001 will be enough to filter the unwanted items away in all the sessions we are using.</div></div><hr />
