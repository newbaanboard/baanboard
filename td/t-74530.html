<br />
is there a possibility to find out the Monday from a week by using a date? Alternatively, to determine the Monday of a week based on the calendar week and the year? Is there already a corresponding function for here?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

I wrote my own functions to read the company calendar in 4c4.  So if you gave me like a year and a week, I could query the company calendar and get the first actual date of the year/week.  Since our company calendar started on Saturday I could just add 2 to it to get the Monday.  Or if you gave me a date I could see what day of the week it was and then add or subtract - not sure I ever did that.</div></div><hr />
