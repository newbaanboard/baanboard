Yes, This is the problem, seems this only considers one field to index, But I need index on both fields first date Then time, one way is first select data by indexing on date then select (by sub query) data by indexing on time, Then only you can find last record (i.e. last date &amp; last time)<br />
<br />
I'm looking single statement to serve both perpose mean statement to find reord of last date &amp; last time.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
U can use <br />
<br />
order by tdinv700.trdt desc , tdin'v700.trtm desc'<br />
<br />
Also for ur  purpose u may also use <br />
<br />
'order by tdinv700._index1 desc'<br />
<br />
because u have selected all fields and ur purpose is better served this way unless have many containers for the same item in same warehouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'll try with this syntax, using desc twice.<br />
<br />
But can not use ._index1 because I need last transaction irrespective  warehouse.<br />

Thanx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Are you extracting the &quot;Inventory as on date&quot; from field tdinv700.stoc?<br />
I think I find a problem with it.<br />
In case you perform a backdated transaction, then the records which are of later date are not changed for field value tdinv700.stoc.<br />
Thus, getting &quot;Inventory as on Date&quot; from tdinv700.stoc could get you errorneous results.<br />
<br />
Moreover, I have seen that the session tdinv6230m000 (Perform Inventory Valuation by Item) does not &quot;purely&quot; get the data from field tdinv700.stoc. Probably it calculates from all the transactions.<br />
<br />
What do you think so?<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />
Manu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 07:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I also have found that the above approach doesn't give correct stock when there is a backdated transaction or a correction through cycle counting etc.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I had to face the embarrassment when user points out to negative stock for few items in my customized stoack statement report which was following this logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
As pointed out searlier, tdinv6230m000 does the calculation correctly.<br />
Probably that means it does not take the stock from the single field tdinv700.stoc, but calculates from all the transactions.<br />
But if it does that, would'nt it get very slow once the data gets built up in tdinv700 table?<br />
Can anyone share the modus operandi of session tdinv6230m000?<br />
<br />
Moreover, I tried to &quot;Rebuild&quot; the inventory using some inventory correction sessions (sessions in menu Baan Common -&gt;Error Recovery), but it did not make any effect in tdinv700.<br />
I don't know where does these sessions effect.<br />
<br />

And yes, the performance WILL be bad when there are lots of transactions in the tdinv700 table. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">There have been a lot of bugs in ilc, so there is a large possibility tdinv700 is corrupt. So, if nothing  has been archived and you have the source code, you can change the behaviour of the function determine.item.stock.level(): in stead of having it start from scratch upto the date wanted for evaluation, take all stock history records from actual date (using actual stock) back to the date wanted. This will improve reliability and performance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 12:26</div></div><div class="posttext">But, if the field tdinv700.stoc was correctly updated under all circumstances, the query would be back to this simple form:<br />
select  tdinv700.stoc<br />

where   tdinv700._index1 = {:tdinv001.item, :tiitm001.cntr, :tdinv001.cwar}<br />

Isn't it maybe better to write a correction program to fix the tdinv700.stoc field?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">How could the value be determined? Since tdinv700 is corrupted (due to bugs) and stoc values are not recalculated in case of backdated transactions, stoc field is not reliable nor are the records inserted prior to patching the bugs. The method starting from current stock in tdinv001 and calculate backwards using tdinv700 gives, in our case, a much reliable item.stoc value.<br />
<br />

Klaas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The correct value is calculated now as well, isn't it?  So, instead of just starting with the current stock and reading all prior transactions, the correction program could, for each transaction it finds, fix/update the stock value of the record in the tdinv700!  Would have to run this once (in a while?), and thereafter the stock field is reliable, and the other programs would run much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Our evaluation is only correct because we use actual stock and calculate backwards until the (mostly a recent) date has been reached. With a corrupted tdinv700 (missing data and duplicates) for records from 2000/2001 and 4 years history, this is the only available option to do a stock evaluation. <br />
<br />
If there is no corruption, you still will have the problem that some transactions are not booked at the actual time (purchase receipt) so stock might not be calculated correctly.<br />
<br />
If you succeed in writing some kind of correction program I would be happy to have a look at it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear NvanBeest,<br />
As per your code given earlier<br />
<br />
	where	tdinv700._index1 = {:tdinv001.item, :tdinv001.cntr,<br />
				    :tdinv001.cwar}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does that mean that tdinv700 has the first index 1 (pk) as &quot;item, cntr and cwar&quot;??<br />
<br />
What are the indexes of tdinv700 at your installation.<br />
We have BaaN IV c4 with IN5 and till SP9 here.<br />
Here the first index in our DD is not &quot;item, cntr and cwar&quot; but &quot;cmba, cwar, trdt, trtm, sern&quot;.<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />
Manu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Manu<br />
<br />
Have a look at the child fields of cmba (combined field! :)).  It  consists of the fields item and cntr.  If you ever wonder what are the exact fields in an index, the easiest is to use ttaad4500.  The underlined fields are part of the index, and, by switching to programmers mode (using a *) it also shows the order of the fields in the index.  Also, when writing a query, you cannot construct a combined field in the where clause, therefore the query ended up looking like it does.<br />
<br />
Hope this explains it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
That is ok what you say.<br />
BUt what about trdt, trtm.. etc... I find them missing in your index1??<br />
Isn't it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 08:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Not needed!  Anyway, not for selection!  But you're right in another aspect.  The code as posted won't work! :( Change the select tdinv700.stoc to select tdinv700.stoc,tdinv700._index1.  Otherwise the bshell won't be able to sort!</div></div><hr />
