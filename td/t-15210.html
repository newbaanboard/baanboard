       I try to extend field tdpur041.pric to have 11 digits after decimal sign on form field, but I cann't. Our item's price is 0.01652247056 and I need to appear in document. Has anybody and idea to do this job?<br />
      We use version IVc4 and I also changed format in form field to<br />
zzz9vd99999999999, but it didn't work. The form show only six digits after decimal.<br />
<br />
Thank in advance.<br />

You may also have to check the script to see if it does any rounding.  I know from the maintain units session it looks like things only go out 6 decimal places.  I know the pegging routines use the units to determine the number of decimal places, but I am not sure about the tdpur041.pric field.<br />

<br />
number entered:1.12345678999<br />
number is rounded to : 1.123457<br />
<br />
If you have a 3rd party product such as Qkey or Rush (available on this board), you can get around this problem with the following). This would also be in additon to the form field change.<br />
<br />
tdpur041.pric:<br />
before.checks:<br />
   tdpur041.pric = round (tdpur041.pric,11)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no script ,so I think 6 digits is the best choice.<br />
