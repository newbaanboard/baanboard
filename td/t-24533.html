<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">12th July 2005, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a solution that increases the size of the Sales Order, Purchase Order, Work Order, etc, field size from 6 to 7 digits. However, that solution does not include projects.  Therefore we cannot use the functionality of equating a sales order to a project.  Baan recommendation is to increase the project # as a customization.  However, there is no solution to increase the field as there was for the sales order issue.  Has anyone increased the size of the project field (pcs) and are there any drawback (apart from support) to increasing the project field.</div></div><hr />

You need only to change the domain tccprj and run CRDD (if nobody is working in baan). We havenÂ´t done this up to now, but I heard from an consultant, that they have done it for a customer without problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you will customize project domain  It will create problem at the time of installation of service pack 15 or any other solution related to project domain. Best practice is that register case to enhance in new service pack.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">14th July 2005, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback. Can you say what type of problems?  I've also asked the question to Baan but they did not mention that risk.  Can you elaborate more on the type of problem. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th July 2005, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did not see anyone mention is that when you change the domain from 6 to 7 you also have to make sure all reports and forms work which display this field.  A lot of work.  We increased the part number to 32, but some of our sessions still only display 16.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rita Kotecha</div><div class="date">18th July 2005, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">The trouble I can see from Mr Kathuria's post is: if (baan) SSA gives a service pack later where the domain is used &amp; some new forms and reports also in the service pack which uses the same domain. How do you plan to go about it, modify each of them with every new SP ?</div></div><hr />
