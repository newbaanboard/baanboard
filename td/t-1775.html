<br />
We are working on a project which has reached the completion stage. But a new requirement has come up. My manager needs one enhancement where an user should be sent an email automatically by baan server through email server.<br />
<br />
We have deployed two different servers, one for BaaN which runs on IBM AIX 4.3 and second Red Hat Linux 6.1 for emailing.<br />
<br />
To elaborate the situation, example, suppose, an employee submits an online leave application in HR Leave Management Module, then his immediate manager should come to know of the same by way of some message. Automatically generated email would be a good solution, but I have no idea as to how to achieve this. The Boss Subordinate relationship is defined in one table with their email addresses. So we want an email sent automatically  through our email server. Our BaaN server is not a web server too.<br />
<br />
Please provide me with appropriate solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks in anticipation and warm regards,</div></div><hr />

I am not sure about linux - does it support the mailx command like Unix?<br />
<br />
Usually, the email solutions are for sending reports to email.  To send an automated email whenever an employee takes an action, you will have to write the code.  If the Session in question does not have a report already, you will have to modify the source code to be able to do this.  Do you have the source code?  There are other source code workarounds - checkout this link in this forum:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=559<br />
There are also pre-packaged, supported ($$) products out there that allow you to modify the source if you cannot get the version on the boards working.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are using Baan V, there is automated email setups you can use, but they are kicked off manually.  Example:  the user is entering hours, they can use the pull down / send-to option to send a link to their session / line to their manager for them to review.</div></div><hr />
