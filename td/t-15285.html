<br />
Does anyone knows if there is a way to disable all messages of the program script or dll ?<br />

Not really sure what you mean.  And if you mean during execution if a question comes up &quot;Are you sure?&quot;, disabling it may cause the session to fail.  I guess more info is needed in order to better answer your question.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xikkos</div><div class="date">10th May 2004, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to disable these messages/questions during the execution, because I need to execute some sessions through the job process/background process. <br />
<br />
Do you know if there is a predefine variable or parameter to disable messages and quetions ?<br />

I have never really worked with batch jobs, so I am not sure what happens with messages and questions.  I thought the messages displayed in the job history log.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th May 2004, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">The Baan Job Process will already disable messages, instead writing them to the Job History table (ttaad512 I think).  Unfortunately I'm pretty sure this hangs on questions. <br />
<br />
If you use API programming to program the code you are running (or use Baan BOI's), then the messages are stored instead of displayed and the default answer for questions is take, or you can program your own answer.   So, for example, you could make a custom session that runs a standard Baan session using API methodology and call that session from a Job.  I have not tried but I think that would accomplish this if questions are a problem in the session you are trying to automate.   API's are a big topic, search the boards for 'stpapi' for more info on that coding methodology.</div></div><hr />
