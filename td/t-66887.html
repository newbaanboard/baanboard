<br />
 One is sum up the database values upfront using a select statement this is ok but this not dynamic if the user does an inline filter.<br />
<br />
The other one is to iterate the occurrences in screen.   I would prefer this because it can adopt when a user does a filter and updates the session to the proper values.  <br />
<br />
But what I need as well is for it to show the total of the session even the records or showing or not on the page without using select statement.   Is this possible to iterate on all the records of a session showing or not to come up with the proper values but be dynamic enough so when the user does a filter it will total the results also even they don't fit on the screen's current page?<br />
<br />
<br />
for i = 1 to filled.occ<br />
      do.occ.without.update(i,get.grid.totals)<br />
endfor</div></div><hr />

Seems to me someone posted something along these lines in the last couple of years.  So far my searchs have not found anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th September 2014, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">FOund the thread I was thinking about - http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=64628 , but this had to do with records selected and scrolled off the screen.  Not sure something like that would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eric.dizon</div><div class="date">17th September 2014, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes ,  I have been looking as well but I cannot find out if this even possible or not or there out be an attribute out there like filled.occ, fattr.occurnr to satisfy the requirement.  <br />
Another possible idea is retrieving what the user is using for filter and try to concatenate that in your select statement.</div></div><hr />

It is available as of FP7 tools. Check https://www.inforxtreme.com/espublic/EN/AnswerLinkDotNet/SoHo/Solutions/SoHoViewSolution.aspx?SolutionID=1370753 or a recent programmers manual.</div></div><hr />
