I have a question to all regarding the use of date and time as index.<br />
Is there a possibility that date and time cannot be unique in any situation?<br />
I have a situation where multiple users try to update a table which has date and time as the index. so if multiple users are trying to update the table at the same time, how does this index work?<br />
<br />
thanks and have fun<br />

I would use a sequence number within the date/time  just to be sure.  Baan stores the time as a number of seconds since midnight (Baan IV, that you are on, right?).  A little different in Baan V &amp; LN, but still only stores to the second.  This means that if your users HAPPEN to enter something and it hits at the same second, you will have a duplicate error.  While it may not seem likely, we have found that it surely is possible (but then, we run a heavily used Data collection system..).</div></div><hr />

Agree entirely. Baan also uses this technique in a number of tables. See tdilc301 as an example.<br />

When I have such things, I use a date field, login code, and milliseconds (or alternatively sequence numbers) to ensure a unique index. Of course, you can always work with a check on the index if a record exists, and if so enter one with higher sequence/milliseconds value...</div></div><hr />
