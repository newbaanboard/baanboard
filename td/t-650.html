   I am wanting to insert Sales Order Data into Baan. This data is extracted from other system in text delimiter format. Can any one help/guide me on how to go about inserting data into Baan for Sales Order. I have very little know of BAAN<br />
<br />
Your reply will be highly appreciated<br />

Basically, you have to understand the database, then map the ASCII file to the appropriate Baan table(s) in tools exchange.<br />
You can choose delimiters etc.<br />
Once you've done this once it becomes easier.<br />
Unless there's a finance user out there who already does this, try posting this in a more technical forum to see if anyone's got some good documentation on how to use Baan exchange.<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">19th December 2001, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Exchange is fairly straight-forward in its use.  You can typically get comfortable with using it in a few days for the type of activity you are describing.  The far greater issue (from my technical bent) is making sure that the Baan application is well enough understood to make sure that all of the appropriate tables are being populated.  Sales Orders are one part of the system that drive many transactions and completeness is mandatory.  One of my customers did what you are wanting to do and it took them about 1-2 months to get the whole process worked out so that when SOs are generated from their mainframe, it is sent to Baan and processed for order release to manufacturing.  Since I was not directly involved in that project I do not know the specifics -- just the water cooler conversations.  <br />
<br />
I would repost this in the Tools Admin or Tools Development for more details. <br />

<br />
Baan Exchange can read flat files and update Baan database.<br />
<br />
The problem with Baan Exchange is the business logic is not handled so u need to know what tables to update. <br />
(If ur in 5c then Baan Exchange uses DAL for logic)<br />
<br />
<br />
Baan 4GL Code using AFS<br />
<br />
I feel this will be the best way to do it. Using Application Function<br />
Server.Read flat file and update Baan using AFS logic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">19th December 2001, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We had this same problem of inserting sales orders (in our case credits) into baan.<br />
<br />
We programmed our other application export the data in the flat file format that Baan wanted, and then place the files in the correct location, and your done.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- No customization of Baan<br />
- Short Time Frame<br />
- Full validation of inbound data <br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Not great for flexibility<br />
- Lots of Master Data to set up.<br />
- Hard to configure if you are new to Baan EDI<br />
- Can have performance problems due to database validations <br />
   (you must volume test or you could find a surprize !! )<br />
