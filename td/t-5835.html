<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 02:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Here is a silly problem that am facing. ;)<br />
<br />
I've got no program scripts to start with.... (Baan IVc2).<br />
<br />
On the Purchase Order line the user is supposed to enter a Ledger Account (based on the Item type).<br />
<br />
Since there is no program code available, I created a session which is not a Main session &amp; with a zoom type : Modal child dialog.  (Start option 21).<br />
The session does nothing more than imports the values of the PO line, does the validation and pops a error message, if required.<br />
<br />
This session is attached as a zoom session on the form of the Purchase Order line with 'automatic zoom'. It's attached to the fields &quot;Order Qty&quot; &amp; &quot;Amount&quot; (since the user has to enter either of them). So everytime the user enters the field this session does the checks and pops the message (atleast supposed to).   ;) <br />
<br />
Now the funny part is... The message pops up AFTER you exit the field and ONLY if the value is zero. <br />
The import code in the pop-up session is for <br />
Zoom.from.all:<br />
on.entry:<br />
<br />
Nothing happens if you enter the right value and exit the field.<br />
<br />
Could it be possible that there is a standard check on this particular field?... or am I missing something ?<br />
(My session works fine if i put in on any other customized session).<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help me with this.<br />
Thanks<br />
Regards<br />

There would be a standard validation in the PO Script, and a mandatory reference to the ledger account table.  Both of those would validate the field already.  Are you saying you have a special validation you want to include?   <br />
<br />
If you autozoom from a field, try putting your subsession code in debugger and make sure it's hitting it.   It should be, but probably your form controls are not quite right..?  Do you have a form for your subsession?  And, does the user have to hit continue to validate, or are you pulling it all in and validating right there?  If so, what section...<br />
<br />
Need more info :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a special validation that am doing...<br />
<br />
I put it in debugger and like i said.. it works fine with other form fields of other sessions....<br />
Yes.. I have a form for the subsession.. and everything is coded in<br />
<br />
zoom.from.all:<br />
on.entry:<br />
<br />
So.. the user need not hit continue to validate. The subsession is popping up ONLY when the user exits that field....<br />
but If I put this subsession to any other form field on any other session... if works fine... it pops-up on entry to that field.<br />
<br />
strange.. but true :)</div></div><hr />

Look under Code &amp; Utilities for extending components without source code. Your problem is solved easily with that solution. Sites that do not have source code should consider adding that tool their possible solutions.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the very good suggestion &amp; your help.<br />
<br />
With the help of the tccomdllrush and the 3 GL script, I was able to generate the 'source code' for the Purchase Order Lines session. As suggested, I was able to add my own conditions to the events in the script. &amp; compile the script with no problems whatsoever.. and yeah.. works like a charm :)<br />
<br />
I could not find any help/procedure documentation on how to go about this...  Well.... I'll create a procedural doc on how to use this tool. This is the least I can do for such a good tool :)<br />
<br />
I must say that the program you have developed is cool. Kudos !!<br />
