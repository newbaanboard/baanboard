<br />
I wanted to extend the ERP LN report page width from the limited 255 chars to around 500. I know that we can do that by using spooling. But i am not where we should insert that code?<br />
I wrote a query with aroung 25 fields of 500 chars in total and generated a report for that query using &quot;Genearte QUery Report&quot;<br />
<br />
Now i wanted to make sure all the 25 fields are exported to excel or csv.<br />
<br />
Where should i insert  the spooling code? in the report script? if so where exactly in report script?<br />
<br />
Please help me out...</div></div><hr />

(Check B2Win (http://www.nazdaq-it.com/utilities.php?prod=bwinse-pro))<br />
<br />
You might also want to look at the Baan Query Tool (http://www.nazdaq-it.com/utilities.php?prod=querytool)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply. I want to write a manual script for expanding the page width of report.  Also Excel device is already installed on ERP LN. I only want to expand the report page width.<br />
<br />
Is baan query tool an open source software or do i have to pay for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">10th February 2011, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;spool&quot; solution also has some kind of a limitation (512 if I remember correctly). The other option you have is to write it manually to a text file using the seq.* functions (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_directory_file_operations_synopsis).<br />
<br />
Baan Query Tool (http://www.nazdaq-it.com/utilities.php?prod=querytool) is not free, but is cost effective. It supports &quot;Wide&quot; reports, so there is no limitation for number of characters in report. You can download a free (fully functional) demo to try it out.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot for your reply. You mean you need to use seq.* function in the report script and in the detail section (report.detail) redirect the report fields to a file? Also if we write to a file, will the file had to be in server box? or we can also create file in client box?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">10th February 2011, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">You can choose to create the file on the server or the client, depending on which function you chose to work with (seq.*.local make the file on the client). I would advice you to create it on the server, then you can copy it to the client, email it, archive it somewhere else or anything you want.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot for your replies. We can use seq.* functions to write to a file. Could you please let me know how to access report fields(input fields for the report that came from query data) in the report script. As i am beginner, i donno how to access them. Also there are 3 sections in the report namely, program section, report section, textfield section. Could you please let me know where to place seq.* functions. It might be a silly question but means a lot to me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..</div></div><hr />
