<br />
We have a session that prints a long report, one page per customer. We want to start emailing each customer their report. We have a device that does it but what I need to know is what functions can we use to open and close the same report after each customers' data has been selected.<br />
<br />
I have looked at the Baan help and although it appears that I have several options I still don't know which is the best to use and how I populate the filename which is where the customers email address has to be.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done anything similar?<br />
<br />

<br />
We also had a similar requirement.<br />
The solution that we opted for is....<br />
Used the AFS of the Print Session.<br />
In the Customized Session we accepted the Customer Range &amp; then internally passed one by one customer to the Print Session via AFS which took care of opening , closing of rprt &amp; creating temporary files.<br />
These temporary files were then sent as emails to the respective customers.</div></div><hr />
