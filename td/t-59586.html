<br />
We are trying to print barcode labels from Ln to Citizen printer. But unable to do so. We have installed the drivers and able to take a test print page. But when the printing is tried through command prompt, it does not print, though we get the message as &quot;Copied successfully&quot;.<br />
We are using windows 10 system.<br />
<br />
We are trying below command-<br />
<br />
copy c:\temp\barcoding.xml /b lpt1<br />
<br />
Here barcoding.xml contains the data to be printed and lpt1 is port.</div></div><hr />
