<br />
Hope u are giving the complete path of the file.<br />
You can get the error code by fetching the value of predefined variable &quot;e&quot;.<br />
This will help u in getting more closer to the error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use move.file() (in filehand dll)to cut the file and put it in the $BSE/tmp/tmp.tmp. every file you want to delete a file, move it to the $BSE/tmp under the same name &quot;tmp.tmp&quot;<br />
<br />
Read about move.file here http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=1597&amp;highlight=move.file<br />
check the attached txt file in post #7<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

Could be &quot;not owner&quot;. Did you check your permissions for this file?</div></div><hr />

1 EPERM - Not owner<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Description:  This error indicates an attempt to modify a file that cannot be modified, except by its owner or a super user. This error also appears when ordinary users attempt actions allowed only to the super user.  <br />
Solution:  <br />
Possible solutions are: <br />
If this is a program errror, contact Baan Company. If you do so, have the session name in which the error occurred, available. Also, make a screen dump of the error messages and the relevant part of the log file. <br />
If you are using a UNIX operating system, change the permissions, owner or group of a file or directory. <br />
If you are using a Windows NT operating system, ...............................  <br />
<br />
Yes, I am giving the full path as the argument. This program works in UNIX i.e. it deletes the file, however it does not delete the file on Windows platforms? <br />
Your profile says your OS is both UNIX and Windows. We have upload programs where the input files are on the local Windows system, the file is transferred to Unix directory. I hope you are not trying to delete the client  file using file.rm(), you have to use remove.local.file().</div></div><hr />

<br />
Following is our observation:<br />
<br />
When working on Windows platform we need to first close the file before deleting the file using the file.rm command.<br />
<br />
However one need not close the file before deleting the file using the file.rm command when working on Unix platforms.</div></div><hr />
