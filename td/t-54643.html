The program is:<br />
select  tdinv001.item, tdinv001.stoc<br />
from    tdinv001<br />
where   tdinv001._index2 inrange {:input.item.f} and {:input.item.t}<br />
and     tdinv001.stoc &gt; 0.0000<br />
...<br />
selectdo<br />
...<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
The domain of tdinv001.stoc is tcqiv1, double.<br />
But I still would get the records which tdinv001.stoc = 0. So unimaginable was, I changed tdinv001.stoc &gt; 0.0000 to tdinv001.stoc &gt; 1.0000. The zero records had appeared as before. It made me mad!! What is going on:eek:!<br />
<br />
This problem would exit in all like *.stoc, for example, tdinv700.stoc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this the full SQL code or is there still any other code in the where clause? I have just tried your code and it worked with me.<br />

<br />
Yes, as followed is all.<br />
<br />
select  tdinv001.item, tdinv001.cwar, tdinv001.stoc<br />
from    tdinv001<br />
where   tdinv001._index2 inrange {:input.item.f} and {:input.item.t}<br />
and     tdinv001.stoc &gt; 0.0000<br />
and     tdinv001.cwar &gt; :old.cwar<br />
selectdo<br />
    old.cwar = tdinv001.cwar<br />
selectempty<br />
    old.cwar = &quot;&quot;<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
I found it would work in some records, the others would not(I just say for one same item).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">2nd January 2009, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me see if I got you right. This code does not work just for one item? All other items with tdinv001.stoc =0 are not being shown, right?<br />
<br />
How are you checking the result of the SQL? Are you making a report?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We faced this problem here with record on tfgld106. <br />
<br />
On the reports sometimes a -0 appears.<br />
<br />
Doing a query on the database we found numbers like -0.000000000001254.<br />
<br />
We solve that using double.cmp on the selectdo statment. but i do not know if in your case it will do what u need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th January 2009, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We also ran into the same issue.  As a matter of fact it worked on our test server, but not on production.  We also used double.cmp in the select statement.</div></div><hr />

George7a, you had some misunderstand cause by my indefinite description. I means was it had many situations liked that but I tested one item. Thank you.<br />
Thanks for Ralph. I used tdinv001.stoc &gt; 0.000000000001254 would effectively. But while I tested to the zero records, it should must like tdinv001.stoc &gt; 0.0. Not for the 0.000000000001254 . So strange!<br />
Thanks for mark_h's reply. I didnot know why, but it is the true that use &gt; 0.0 sometimes would effective, and sometimes not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
0.000000000001254 is just an example. Can be any number(with any digits).<br />
As me and Mark said. double.cmp can solve your problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">6th January 2009, 03:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your remind. The function double.cmp() can solve it. But it can be used in  SELECT clause. <br />
If the compare value not in the SELECT clause, I also can use the followed script to achieve.<br />
if tdinv001.stoc &gt; 0.0000 then<br />
...<br />
endif</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was a bad typing on my part - I have not used it in the select clause, but inside the selectdo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, ues IF clause in selectdo is one way. How bad it is. <br />
If it can't not be used in SELECT clause, SQL Performance has a bad efficiency.</div></div><hr />
