If i dont use order by in baan query and also not in report, how is the sorting determined.<br />
<br />
When i run the query(which has no order by defined and also no sorting in report) it gives me different sorting in different databases.<br />
<br />
In one it gives me the sorted o/p on report , on the other one it is random.<br />
<br />
Any idea what could cause this?<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
afaik the sort order is the start index (Main) of the table.<br />

<br />
thanks for the update.<br />
Yes , if no sort order is defined then it should be sorted on the primary index.<br />
<br />
But in my case, for one database the o/p is sorted on primary index on the baan report.<br />
however on other database , the same report is not sorted at all.<br />
<br />
the primary index is same in both databases.<br />
<br />
is there any internal setting in baan which controls sorting ,when no sorting is defined in the proram script or the report?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Did you also check that the index is completely the same for both companies? Just somethings to verify.  I remember having this exact same problem before - I probably posted about it somewhere.  I cannot remember what we traced it to.  I do know that there are some Oracle optimizer or settings that could impact the sorts or how the query is parsed.  I do know that we almost always set the report to have some sort.<br />
<br />
You can searching on it, but for the life of me I can't remember what caused it.  I do know it had to do with production order and operations.  I know there is something causing this, just not sure what any more - best fix is to always either use order by, or a sort on the report.  Another thing I recommend is to use _index1 in sql queries this prevents the oracle driver and optimizer from picking the wrong index.</div></div><hr />

What I have observed while working with Informix is, when we do not specify any sort order data will appear in order, which it was inserted to table. I had checked the same with Print Session<br />
<br />
However, if u r using session Maintian SQL Queries (ttadv3180m000) for same, it will sort data on first index.<br />
<br />
This could be dependant on porting set too. (but I m not very sure abt porting set).</div></div><hr />
