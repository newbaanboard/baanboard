This message drives me crazy. It pops aber after I changed the layout of a form. But only with the first start of the session after login.<br />
<br />
I thougt I read something about this message here in the forum, but I cant find it again.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have a glue, what the problem is??</div></div><hr />

<br />
tried to use &quot;ttstpdeldeflt&quot;. That seems not to help!<br />
<br />
I tried another thing which seems (hopefully) to help:<br />
<br />
- the form is a multi occ form<br />
- there is a line with labels and underneath the labels are the fields, normaly          separated by an empty line.<br />
- I found out, that the prob seems to be related to the only field, which has a &quot;2Lines-Label&quot;. So that there is no space between label and field.<br />
- For now I changed the label, so that it needs only one line.<br />
- Now there is for every column: one line for the label, one empty line and than the field. I think important is the empty line between label and field.<br />
<br />
Hope that is not too confusing :D <br />
<br />
But at the moment ist seems to work :)</div></div><hr />
