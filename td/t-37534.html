<br />
I'm working on LN 6.1 also. The problem is that I don't get the session description in the title bar (which is on top of the session window) only for sessions that I developed.<br />
<br />
I only get the session code with the company without the session description !!</div></div><hr />

It's working in house devloped sessions. I think you have to check labels which are attached with your sessions.<br />

I am getting session decription on Title bar. <br />
<br />
In LN, to have session description you have to creata a label of type &quot;Indices&quot; and has to link it in the Index. <br />
<br />
My problem is i am not getting session code (like 'tssoc2100m000') in status bar. By Status bar I mean, the bar at the bottom in which company and session code gets displayed in LN 6.1.<br />

Rajeev this is a wrong statement. Session description labels have are created with the context type &quot;Session, Table, Report Description&quot;.<br />

I'm working on LN 6.1 also. The problem is that I don't get the session description in the title bar (which is on top of the session window) only for sessions that I developed.<br />
Hiba_t, this seems to be a different issue than Rajiv's, check for the BAAN_WIN_TITLE command in  your BW configuration or $BSE/lib/bse_vars.<br />

Rajeev, it is easier to take some jpg screen shots and attach to the posting for others to see your issue. I check in our LN system and I don't have any issues.</div></div><hr />

I am sorry for &quot;Indices&quot;, I wanted to mean context type &quot;Session, Table, Report Description&quot; only but ....<br />
<br />
Please find attached, the snapshot of my issue <br />

I checked in our LN environment, tssoc2100m000 - is Service Orders and not &quot;Equipment Sales Quote Lines History&quot;. <br />
<br />
Please be explicit with your session info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The given session ID &quot;tssoc2100m000&quot; was jut an example (i had mentioned like 'tssoc2100m000'). Also, in my first thread, i have mentioned that this session is developed by us(one of newly developed sessions is not displaying session Code on status bar). The other developed sessions are disaplying session code correctly.<br />
<br />
I hope these explanation will make things more apparant and will help you to address this issue.<br />
