Till now we had all our users setup as Normal users and we had restricted access to do any transaction in and out of a particular warehouse for all users except a couple of users.<br />
<br />
Now its been made a company standard to make all users Super Users (Dont ask me why  :mad: ). Now is there any way we can have the same field level restrictions for the users from doing any transaction on a particular warehouse ? Obviously customization of scripts is not possible as we will have to change a lot of scripts and that is not an option.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />

Customization seems to be your only option. <br />
<br />
The other option is to convince the decision makers that making every body a super user is a bad idea. Data is like money - it should be protected like money. Maybe the problem that is being solved by converting everybody to super users can be solved in a different way.</div></div><hr />

I am sure making all users &quot;Super Users&quot; IS NOT acceptable  as per Sarbanes Oxley. Another reason for you to talk to your decision makers.<br />
