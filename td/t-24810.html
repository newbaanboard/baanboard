<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">10th August 2005, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to create a session which prints certain order forms for a certain customer. The list of items required are listed in list-items (tcibd300). I need to fetch the correct sales price based on given customer, item and price date. <br />
<br />
I first wanted to do this using AFS running the price simulator (tdpcg0200m300/100), for that seems most simple, and mot importand: most correct, because standard Baan is being used. However, I ran into an AFS problem [look here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=24734) for more info], which I doubt will be solved by Baan soon, although I created a case for it...<br />
<br />
So I decided to just do it without AFS. Only problem is that I still wanna use standard Baan functions/dll's to fetch the price, rather than inventing on my own, since those pricing matrices etc. are pretty complicated. I assume there must be a simple standard Baan dll, with input of bp/item/date/currency/company etc and output of the correct price.... Can anyone help me with that? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />
