seq.unlink file &quot;e:\baan4\tmp\tmp0600450722&quot; while compiling<br />
a report. I now I've confronted the same problem sometime ago<br />
but I just can't remember how right now. Anybody ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually there is another tmp file that has the compile messages in it. I do not know exactly what error -2 is, but I have seen something like this when an event gets mis-spelled in the script. Does it have a script? I usually go look at the other tmp file that has the compile messages in it. I just can not seem to remember where the message was on the compile, it has been a while since I have seen an error like this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Youp2001</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 21:58</div></div><div class="posttext">-2 is  the error  code from the  operation system. Normally an error  2 means 'No such file or directory'.<br />
<br />
Apperently the  file is already deleted somehow??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 22:21</div></div><div class="posttext">This error comes when there is a mismatch between the declaration of a field in the Maintain Input Fields and how the report layout is painted.<br />
<br />
Just recompile the report in DEBUG mode and read the compiler output carefully. Usually, it points exactly to the field causing the error.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if the compiler output does not help, you probably have a long day ahead! Inspect each field in the layout editor and see if there is (usually) the domain missing.</div></div><hr />

easy to spot the troublesome field after debugging.<br />
Anyway it's curious compiling didn't help this time.<br />
The same messages could have been shown both<br />
ways. Or not ?<br />
<br />
Read you soon.<br />
