Hi,<br />
<br />
I am not sure but maybe its related pdf properties for LN UI. It is setting file, which consists a lot variables like cache, jvm_options etc.<br />
<br />
Best regards,</div></div><hr />

If I remember correctly in java it is corrected by increasing the maximum heap size using the options of the JVM. The problem is that I have no idea how to do it on LN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can go $BSE\java\jvm_options file, set the heap size, as far as I remember<br />

<br />
Sorry but I'm new to these systems... I checked the $BSE\java\jvm_options folder and the file doesn't exist. Can I enter it? is a reboot required?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please share your solution for others after you solved it.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keitaro84</div><div class="date">1st February 2023, 11:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I fixed it by using an older version of PDF Converter without uninstalling the Tools solution.<br />
<br />
You need to navigate on LN Server to &quot;$bse\java\application&quot;, locate your package combination (e.g. 107_oper.pacc) file and see the actual path folder value for &quot;ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp&quot; inside like:<br />
<br />
ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp|7.6_a/ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp/1620300487 -&gt; ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp|7.6_a/ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp<br />
<br />
The next step is to enter that location - $bse\java\application\7.6_a\ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp - sort the folder by Name, highest numbers on top (=latest Java components), where the highest number (=folder name) should be equal to the value in our package combination file. Now take the one older folder name (=1617883999) in clipboard and replace it package combination file like:<br />
<br />
ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp|7.6_a/ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp/1620300487 <br />
<br />
change to<br />
<br />
ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp|7.6_a/ttstpbml2pdf.javaapp/1617883999<br />
<br />
Save, and login again into LN and check if the issue is still present. This technique can isolate the issue to PDF Converter component only and there is no need to uninstall Tools solution where it was part of it. With the next Tools solution installation and if there is fix available, the re-deployment of Java component will put back all changes we made and will point to the correct (=latest) folder.</div></div><hr />
