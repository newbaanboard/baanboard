<br />
I am probably trying to bypass important procedures here but I thought I'd try anyway.<br />
<br />
We're using NT and Baan 4c4 and we wrote a new version of the picking list on our test server. We would now like to copy it across to our live server and I would like to know the easiest way. I have tried copying the file rtdsls44020xxxx from the test server and pasting into the same directory on live, I'v done the same for the osls44020xxxx and usls44020xxxx. I reckon we might see the report if we reboot but obviously we don't get many opportunities to reboot. Does anyone have any advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
You can only copy the objects if the BaaN part is already existing on both servers.<br />
It's anyway better and adviced to use ttiex1280/ttiex185 for this purpose. (BaaN IV).<br />
