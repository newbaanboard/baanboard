<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">5th November 2019, 07:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a requirement to display an image in a session that has no main table.<br />
The image is item image from tcibd001 where it can be attached to individual image by session tcibd0501m000 without using ODM.<br />
I can duplicate the session to edit the Dynamic Form but I do not have access to standard program script so bind.image function will not work because it has to be used in after.form.read: (I tried). However, I can write some codes using Extensibility.<br />
What I have tried is to create an image field in to Dynamic Form of the session and assign a field to it. The field is declared in Session Extension.<br />
I tried giving it the value of<br />
 - tcibd001.imag<br />
 - uuid.format$(tcibd001.imag)<br />
in When Field Changes of Item field but none of them work. The field just does not display any image.<br />
I am using LNUI. The images are PNG. (Yes, I saw the GIF utility but haven't tried since it specifically points out that the image has to be GIF)<br />
Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">11th November 2019, 06:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Since that very tight requirements make it almost impossible to achieve the desired goal, it is now changed to a fully customized session where I can write my own script to make it work.<br />
So the way it works now is just as the following:<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
	table   ttcibd001<br />
	extern domain	ttdyf.picture	item.image<br />
<br />
after.form.read:<br />
	bind.image(&quot;item.image&quot;, &quot;tcibd001.imag&quot;)<br />
<br />
plus, of course, the image field in the DFE. I am amazed it's that simple.</div></div><hr />
