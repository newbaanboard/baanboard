<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I have created 1 Main session , inside that i wrote the following code<br />
<br />
<br />
choice.cont.process:<br />
after.choice:<br />
	activate(&quot;tdcus0116s000&quot;)<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now when i execute this session , and click on CONTINUE button, it opens up this session tdcus0116s000 as expected.<br />
<br />
So now 2 sessions r there on my screen , and when i try to close the session tdcus0116s000, it first closes the tdcus0117m000 i.e. the Main session and then again i have to click on tdcus0116s000 to close it.<br />
<br />
why on closing tdcus0116s000, it closes tdcus0117m000 first ??<br />
<br />
how do i achieve closing first the sub session &amp; then the main session.<br />
<br />
Is code what i have written is right ??<br />
<br />
And another question is Can't i create 3 buttons on my form , let's say <br />
<br />
1) Post Lines<br />
2) Feed Delivery Address<br />
3) Feed Postal Address<br />
<br />
I saw that i can create 10 diff. user choices, but these choices comes under Special Menu rather than as Buttons with the labels that i would like to have on the form.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the &quot;activate&quot;, you could also use &quot;zoom.to$&quot;, which will open the session as well.  If the sub-session is defined as a &quot;modal child&quot;, you will HAVE to close it before closing the main session.  And it works in the correct order.<br />
<br />
Buttons are created from the special options by specifying the user option numbers in the subsession &quot;Buttons&quot; when modifying forms.  They will then appear as buttons (with the short description from the second form) and in the special menu (with the long description specified on the first form).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
As u suggested i tried using zoom.to$ function, but i am not clear about the arguments that i have to supply even after reading the help for the function.<br />
<br />
I have few doubts :<br />
<br />
1) First i would like to know that whether this zoom.to$ function can be called with the button click , i hope there is no limitation that there should be called on the zoom of a field, since that's what tools help said.<br />
<br />
2) I wrote the following code in button click<br />
<br />
<br />
zoom.to$(tdcus0116m000,z.session) <br />
<br />
now when i compile it , it gives compilation error reporting about arguments, since i am not clear about the 3rd arguement that i have to supply, even after reading the help. Could u please provide me the code so that it calls the session using zoom.to$ function.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's an example:<br />
<br />
<br />
choice.user.5: | Thus, executed from a button...<br />
before.choice:<br />
  if form.curr = 1 then | ... on a multioccurence form<br />
    if not marked then<br />
      mess(&quot;tcswa100cmark&quot;, 1) | &quot;No record marked!&quot;<br />
      choice.again()<br />
    endif<br />
  endif<br />
on.choice:<br />
  zoom.to$(&quot;tcswa0100s110&quot;, Z.SESSION, &quot;mymain&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
The parameters for the zoom.to$ are:<br />
[list=1]<br />
 Session or menu code<br />
 Type: Z.SESSION or Z.MENU<br />
 Label recognized in the zoomed session in the zoom.from.&lt;label&gt;<br />
 Field to return value to (blank for this example, since we are not zooming from a field!)<br />
 Form position (Haven't set this in the example, but should be used to position the new form relative to the main session's form)<br />
[/list=1]Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go on your main form, in special option.., create an instance, name it like you want. <br />
<br />
Give it a free number &lt;<br />
<br />
Then go in your main script and use the same code as described before for your new option order. (49)  <br />
<br />
choice.user.49: <br />
on.choice: <br />
     zoom.to$(...)</div></div><hr />
