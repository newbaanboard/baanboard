Thats what i am telling on selecting &quot;Field&quot; as command type and then  enum and then zooming for selecting Field number it gives me fatal error which i had attached in previous thread, did u got me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">18th January 2007, 08:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...I got your problem.<br />
Do one thing, start the DFE(Dynamic Form Editor) for this session.<br />
Right click the field(the one where you want to place the button besides) and select properties. I hope you are selecing one the view fields and not grid fields.<br />
Note down the &quot;field sequence number&quot;, which is located at the bottom of the display.<br />
<br />
In the form commands, select command type as &quot;field&quot; ,instead of zooming and selecting the field, type the &quot;field sequence number&quot; found in DFE.<br />
<br />
Let us know whether this works.It always works for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've created buttons like you described in the attachment for multi-occurence session. In fact there are more than 5-6 sessions that i can remember. This is precisely the reason why i proposed the above method. I really dont know why this is not working in your case. There is some problem in installation at your end, this might be the reason why the session threw an error whenever you tried to zoom and select the field.<br />
As a final attempt, can you attempt to create a button on a completely different session. This is just a guesswork but who knows it might work on  other session.<br />

Bye</div></div><hr />

<br />
NP Rao is correct, the &quot;rich view&quot; option should be turned on, else the buttons are not displayed.<br />
<br />
The help for &quot;rich view&quot; has following documentation,<br />
<br />
Rich View: If this check box is selected, the form's view has more features.<br />
A rich view can contain group boxes, filed buttons and group boxes beside <br />
each other. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just try to enable it, and let us know if the button is displayed.<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dstegink</div><div class="date">22nd January 2007, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">To get the option to have the icon in the secondary toolbar, look up secondary toolbars in the programmers manual. You will also have to create an additional file for the icon to be saved to the server. The secondary toolbar can execute any form command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbdave</div><div class="date">23rd January 2007, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">hi dstegink <br />
<br />
boss i had worked on secondary toolbar its not an issue but i want the Button to be displayed on form as form command as not as icon in toolbar. I can view the form command in specific option but can i have them as normal buttons and not as filed commnad u can see the jpg i had attached of baan5 session. The buttons shoiwn there is a form command i want same way in LN too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">23rd January 2007, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mahesh,<br />
<br />
Im curious to know your objection in using field command. I mean, the field command looks and functions exactly the same as the buton in your baan5 session. What are you precisely looking for when you say you want a button like  in your baan5 session and how is it different from a field command in LN<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbdave</div><div class="date">23rd January 2007, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks<br />
<br />
The field commands button will next field, and i had in some session more than 1 Button which i want on righthand side as the field length varies the position for Field command button will vary, which i dont want.<br />
       Also i am curious to know WHY CAN'T WE HAVE BUTTONS AS IN BAAN5 AS THE FORM COMMAND TO APPEAR ON THE LN FORM??<br />
I KNOW U AGREE THAT THERE EXIST A BUTTON ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FORM IN BAAN5 WHICH WE HAD DESCRIBED AS FORM COMMAND (NOT AS FIELD COMMAND) SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE BUTTON ON RIGHTSWIDE OF THE FORM. SOCAN WE THAT IN lLN TOO .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">23rd January 2007, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mahesh,<br />
<br />
&quot;Why we dont have buttons in LN as in baan5? ...this can be answered only by GOD or Infor Guys&quot;<br />
Our job is to find a decent workaround. The problem in your case is the non alignment of buttons for which I suggest following workaround. Declare a dummy string variable. Place this dummy variable on your form. Now add a field command for this dummy variable. Please note that this dummy variable is required whenever you need to shift your button to the right hand side. The exact length of this dummy variable will depend on your form layout and will have to be discovered by trial &amp; error. Try this out and let us know your findings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbdave</div><div class="date">23rd January 2007, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi bigjack<br />
<br />
thanks for ur interest. i got it know.<br />
But i was not COMPLAINING that why its in 5 and not in LN, but i was just curious to know that whether this functionality exist in LN or not as it use to be in baan5. Because i didnt know for sure that the thing which we use to get in baan 5 by form command will not be available in LN, i though that it must be there but i may be missing some trick as in Field command type i missed <br />
&quot;THE CLICKING OF RICH VIEW IN HIGHEST LEAF FOR A MULTI OCC SESSION&quot;<br />
BUT THAN U GUYS TOLD ME THAT rOCH VIEW HAS TO BE CLICKED FOR MULTI OCC SESSION TO THE BUTTONS TO GET VISIBLE ON FORM.<br />
<br />
So thats ok if ur sure that this kind of buttons are not possible in LN.<br />
we can definately have workaround by working as u told bu a dummy form field of type string, or can do with field command or we can even do with secondary toolbar or just use specific option. <br />
<br />
because if that functionality is not in LN not even god can asnswer why certain things are not thaere ok?<br />
<br />
Thanks for ur interest.<br />
i hope when any body or even SSA find solution for form command please inform me ob<br />
bye u guys.<br />
thanks for ur interest.</div></div><hr />
