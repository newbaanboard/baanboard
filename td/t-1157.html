<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">25th February 2002, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
 I wonder if anybody can help me with this:<br />
I am trying to write a script which generates the name of the tables that are Valid for a certain Package Combination. This would be useful for me to get a file that contains the list of the tables - for bdbpre6.1. In this script I have added an option if I want to include the logical tables, etc.<br />
<br />
 The ideea is quite nice and useful. The script works fine. I get the list of the tables. There is a problem regarding TOOLS tables. If I use session &quot;Create seq dump of table&quot;  - ttaad4226m000, only the following tables are dumped, if I dump a company &lt;&gt; 000.<br />
<br />
ttaad500<br />
ttaad501<br />
ttaad503<br />
ttaad505<br />
ttaad506<br />
ttaad507<br />
ttaad510<br />
ttaad511<br />
ttaad512<br />
tttxt001<br />
tttxt002<br />
tttxt003<br />
tttxt004<br />
tttxt005<br />
tttxt006<br />
tttxt007<br />
tttxt008<br />
tttxt010<br />
tttxt012<br />
tttxt016<br />
tttxt030<br />
<br />
  If we dump company 000, all TOOLS tables are dumped. So, only few &quot;tt&quot; tables can be created in a company &lt;&gt; 000. Do you have any idea how does Baan know the list of this tables? I did not find anything useful in table ttadv420.... There must be a field YES/NO which tells that a table, for example tttxt020 or ttdsk* can be created only in company 000. <br />
<br />
 Does anybody have any idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a function that returns you if a table is present in a certain company.(BaaN IV c4)<br />
<br />
If I understood you well, this I propose is an indirect method but, maybe...<br />
<br />
#pragma used dll ottadvtablecomp<br />
<br />
long yeno<br />
yeno=table.in.compnr(string table(8),long cmp )<br />
<br />
Hope this help...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, this solves only a part of the problem. What I really need to do is to generate a list of tables for a specific package combination.  This is necessary because we have several companies, in a multi-company scenario.  So, I need to make a dump of all these companies at the same time. If I dump 4 companies that reside on the same package combination, I should use only one list of tables, and not four, depending on the output of table.in.compnr(...).  I will keep hins functon in mind, though. Thanks.<br />
<br />
 I managed to find this function in ttstpsearchvrc:<br />
<br />
 function extern long vrc_search_table<br />
(domain ttadv.cpac cpac, <br />
domain ttadv.cmod cmod, <br />
domain ttadv.flno flno, <br />
long tdep<br />
ref domain ttadv.vers tver,<br />
ref domain ttadv.rele trel,<br />
ref domain ttadv.cust tcus,<br />
)<br />
<br />
  I thought I may use this function, since this is what I need to get the right list of tables. But I do not understand what the parameter tdep does... Any clue?<br />
<br />
 Anyway, I still have the question about how does this function know that some Tools tables should not exist in any company diferent than 000....<br />
<br />
 Any idea?<br />
 Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Well,<br />
<br />
Session ttaad4222m000 makes a report counting rows in a table.<br />
If you entry:<br />
<br />
- Company: The first company number in a package combination<br />
- Package : From tt<br />
                   To     tt<br />
- Table      : From [empty]<br />
                   To     zzz999<br />
<br />
Then in the report you have the list of tables defined in that package combination, for that package.<br />
<br />
You can put the output to a file and read it.<br />
Notice that the first table is always in the same row of the file, and you have to read after line read (without trailing spaces begin with Total)<br />
<br />
You can define a Job.<br />
As you can see this tables are in the standard package tt, and tt do not belong to any package combination than standard (ttaad1121m000) So tools tables are those you listed in any package combination. ( I guess you forgot in that list table ttaad502).<br />
<br />
I have no other idea hopefull for you.<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you try to use the session to get the documentation <br />
<br />
ttstpbaandoc (in HTML form)<br />
<br />
ttstpobjinfo (show object info - gives output on the display browser) instead of using the command line options...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
  I think it is daylight in USA, right? In fact, I work in Italy now, for a while, as you can see from the e-mail address. Here I have one extra hour, comparing with Bucharest.<br />
<br />
  A real Baan &quot;addict&quot; can not sleep until he finds out the answer to his questions... I am at home, connected to the IBM Shared Network, in fact...<br />
<br />
  I did not understand what you ment with: <br />
ttstpbaandoc (in HTML form). How can I get this? Please guide me, if possible.<br />
<br />
 The baan session I think it is ttstpsessinfo. It gives quite the same output, right? Or... can I get extra information if I use the Baan session?<br />
<br />
 Ciao,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 21:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes its day light here.<br />
<br />
the session ttstpbaandoc - is &quot;Generate Library Documentation&quot; you can get the library function prototypes etc in a HTML pages, can be viewed with Internet Explorer. If you cant find it in the tools menus, use the start, run option to check up if its delivered to you or not.<br />
<br />
I dont know which BaaN version are you working on. But this is available in the New ERP series.<br />
<br />
the session, ttstpobjinfo (show object info - gives output on the display browser) instead of using the command line options...<br />
$ &gt;bic_info6.1 -e ottdllvrcsearch<br />
I feel that all the command line options of the bic_info are built into tihs sesion, ttstpobjinfo.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you out.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately I do not have any Baan ERP accesible here....  :(<br />
I work on Baan IV c4. Now I do understand why I could not find the sessions <br />
<br />
 ttstpobjinfo<br />
 ttstpbaandoc   <br />
<br />
 Thank you anyway. I hope that one day I will be able to understand all secrets of the tools sessions, which seem very interesting to me, because of the skills a programmer should have to write such sessions.  I will keep learning... But the documentation that Baan offers is quite poor, I may say.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">12th March 2002, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed something strange in what &quot;alejandro&quot; said. He told me that I have forgotten table ttaad502. I had taken a look in my system few days ago and I did NOT have this table.  I knew some tables were delivered by baan at a certain moment.  I managed to find on Baan support the solution 104950:<br />
<br />
 After this action you should create 3 new tables for company 000. The easiest way is to start general table maintanance and select this table. On the question  &quot;File does not exist, allocate&quot; you should answer &quot;Yes&quot; and the table will be created. Do this action for the tables ttaad321 ttaad502 and ttaad330. Table ttaad502 should be created for all companies. <br />
<br />
  I found out that there are some other tools tables delivered wi SP9 for BaanIVc4: ttaad322, ttaad331, ttaad508.<br />
<br />
  I did some new researches and.... I have table ttaad502 now. Surprise!!! Patches were installed last night ! <br />
<br />
 Anyway, be careful with the patches.<br />
<br />
 The strange thing that I noticed is that I was able to allocate the table ttadv200 (Sessions !!!) in company 110, using General Table Maintainance , which seems quite strange to me.  <br />
<br />
 All Tools tables, except the ones written above in previous posts + ttaad502,  can NEVER be created using the session &quot;Create tables&quot;, but can be created using GTM.<br />
<br />
 The session &quot;Create tables&quot; is smart enough not to create tables ttaad321, ttaad330 in company 110.  It only creates table ttaad502, as described in the solution I quoted here.<br />
<br />
 Here I come again: <br />
How does session &quot;Create tables&quot; know to do this? Why GTM and &quot;Create tables&quot; do not use the same algorithm / function for checking the validity of a table for a certain company (diferent than 000) ? It seems that they are not both using  &quot;ttdllvrcsearch&quot;...<br />
<br />
 I am quite confused, now. The table ttadv200 can NOT be deleted using session &quot;Delete tables&quot;. So, I think this is a bug, since this table can be created using GTM but can never be deleted. What do you think?<br />
<br />
 Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 02:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Your explanation seems to be very clear. It is inconsistent. I think you should report this like a BaaN to support.<br />
<br />
Be luck. Sorry, because I have no other thikg to suggest you.</div></div><hr />
