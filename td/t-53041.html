<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I defined a new table in our customization VRC. Then i modified an existing session to write some records in the new table. What I forgot, was that this session using &quot;switch.to.company&quot; to switch to company 000. But anyway it worked and my records where written in company 000. Because these records are about user rights, it is ok for me. But now I have to add one more field to the table and this is where the problem begins. I cannot reconfigure the table in company 000, and also deleting it is not allowed. Does anyone have a hint for me<br />

Thanks<br />

Someone should be able to set &quot;-set BSE_COMPNR=0&quot; in the .bwc login file and  then try the delete table. You might want to export it and import it to the correct company.  Have you actually tried it?<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention I can not use change company to 0 because of different start days of the week, but I can log in directly to company 000.</div></div><hr />

That's was it what I tried first. I set my user to B40Ustnd and Company 000. Then logged in again. Also in this case the message when selecting company 0 in &quot;delete tables&quot;: &quot;company not allowed&quot; appears. It seems to be a security feature that it is not allowed to delete company 0 tables.<br />
Also the users bsp and root are not able to delete.</div></div><hr />

I deleted the table for company 000 directly in Oracle and then I could create it in Baan for company 000 with the new structure.<br />
Thanks anyway for your help.</div></div><hr />
