<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dogman</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to make component requirement calculaion script which looks at sales quotation lines and looks then into BOM-s where this component is included. <br />
It works for me with articles where there is only 1 level deep BOM but if article structure is more than one level deep i get stuck.<br />
<br />
How could I create script which does following:<br />
<br />
- Look at articles(components) between 111111 - 222222<br />
- Look at sales quotation lines for component itsself.<br />
- Look at BOM-s where article is present<br />
- Look for those articles quotation lines.<br />
- and continue with last 2 actions for lets say 4 times and look for each subassembly sales quotation lines <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically I need a list of issues for sales quotations for components and it should take into account all possible quotations for different bom levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">You should use recursion for it. Try to write function for your select query and  call your function in your main select statement. According to your BOM level you should use more than same functions. I hope that you understand what I mean .<br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />

Search recursion on board.</div></div><hr />
