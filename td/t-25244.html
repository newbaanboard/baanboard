<br />
The post is related with QBF. My main requirement is instead of using standard View ---&gt; Filter option, my user would like to <br />
<br />
specify certain filters which are :<br />
<br />
1) Those are form fields.<br />
2) Some of the fields are not FORM fields, and refers to some co-related table, like my session is based on sales order header, but he would like to filter based on Sales Order Lines table also ... which means I have a relationship already for the table.<br />
<br />
another example is My session shows all Sales Order, but my user is interested to know all Sales Order for which PDSO is done, which means even a single line is having status as PDSO my Sales Order no. should appear on Session.... now that leads to introduction of customized field on my filter form where he can choose the stage at which Sales Order is lying.<br />
<br />
How should i Proceed, i cant use the standard qbf form, since i would like to provide additional filters which are based on <br />
<br />
some related table... an moreover my session is not showing data Sales Line wise, rather it is based on Sales Order wise.<br />
<br />
Can somebody provide me hint, i went through almost all post related to QBF on bb, but couldnt get the exact solution which <br />
I am searching .....<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on my observations :<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Should i Create a new sub-session which takes all input and then pass on to query to the main session and use it in <br />
<br />
query.extend.where()<br />
<br />
2) or can i use qbf ??? if it can be done via qbf, can somebody tell me how can i use it , may be some post which has been discussed in past .... how can i introduce additional fields in qbf form ???<br />
<br />

<br />
I once thought of trying to force the QBF, and I think I did well by not even trying... I solved such issues already several times using subsessions, with query.extend.where or in some cases with temp tables... <br />
<br />
I would love to hear it if you find a way to do it using QBF..!! <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">3rd October 2005, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some thoughts, I have not messed with QBF much.  Maybe you can put the additional fields on the form then you can filter on them?   This may require some coding, in the case of your flags or if the references are not coming in.  <br />
<br />
I have put up some filter buttons on sessions.  The button would update the query, such as toggle on / of the ones with your status, or zoom as you said to a session to gather the input and then update that query when you return.  That's as you discussed.  Is that not feasible or do you need the code for that?  It's fairly straight forward, just make sure to issue the 'rebuild.query' call and execute(find.data) if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">4th October 2005, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Yaah I agree with you, so currently what i have done is I have provided additonal sub-sessuion in specific menu where he is providing the filters, and then i am passing that entire Query string to the main session in query.extend, now the problem whih i am facing is my Main session is Purchase Order , and my user has entered filter as Item Code 'A001', he would like to see all the PO which are having Item code as 'A001', now with the join of PO header ( tdpur400 ) and Purchase Order Line ( tdpur401 ) , I get same PO more than once since item 'A001' might be again coming in diff. pos. within the same PO.<br />
<br />
So that is why my on main session same PO appearing multiple times, which i would like to avoid. how do i do the 'AS SET WITH 1 ROWS or GROUP BY' in query.extend ??<br />
<br />
so basic req. was that main session has PO ( PO appearing once initially ) , and he would like to see which are those PO which are having Item Code as 'A001' and avoiding same PO coming more than once.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any sugesstions ? How do i do 'AS SET WITH 1 ROWS' ?<br />
<br />
With respect to AFS for QBF, how do i generate the AFS for qbf , ttstpcreatdll doesnt generate one ? since i guess u cant generate dll for tt package ...... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">4th October 2005, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Your main table for this session is PO Header, right?  And what you added to the query made it bring in the PO Headers more than once?  So, maybe if you post how you extended that query it would help us see.  <br />
<br />
It MAY be easier to do this using the old fashion skip.io stuff.  It's not that slow, or at least you can see if it's too slow for you.  Using that method you still need to zoom out &amp; get your filters, but instead of adding them to the query, you can do some programming in the after.read section that can check the related PO Lines and if they do not have that item, issue the command 'skip.io(&quot;&quot;)' and that line will not show up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">5th October 2005, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I was able to produce the desired output using EXISTS Keyword within query.extend.where()<br />
<br />
now i would like to provide a undo search facility on my cust. session, so that it reverst back to the original query.extend.where() written in before.program, and DAL.<br />
<br />
Normally when we open any baan display session like tdsls4500m000 , if we press shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + 4, we are able to see the query which must have been executed by stnd. baan, can we somehow get this query which we see in msgbox via some pre-defined variable or baan function () ?<br />

I know the functions themselves are void functions, not returning any value. query.extension also does not get filled... <br />

What is this Ctrl+Alt+4 you are talking about???? Never heard of? Does this work on Windows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree in Baan V they are clearly function calls instead of just adding to a string.  I don't know where it would be stored.  BUT, if it IS, you should be able to find it in the debugger.  Start up the session, get to the point where your Query is updated in the debugger, then type in 'L' in the debugger.  This will give you a list of all open variables, including system ones.  If it's in there, you should be able to capture and use it.</div></div><hr />

Anything about this??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nandan</div><div class="date">10th October 2005, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">It works with tools version 7.XX or above<br />
<br />
Some of the useful options.....<br />
<br />
Open any session and press the following keys sequence<br />
<br />
CTR-SHIFT-$    (query used by 4GL engine)<br />
CTR-SHIFT-^   (XML tree detailing the form details)<br />
CTR-SHIFT-_   (4GL version release - This seem to work even on Baan5.0b version)</div></div><hr />
