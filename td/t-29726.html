This software analyses the print-stream comming out of baan and selects the needed data.<br />
My problem now ist to give a signal for the software when a page break is. I tried this by creating a footer layout in which a special word is printed. But then I have a strange behavior. Sometimes the word is printed at the right place (at the end of each page), sometimes it is only printed on the report end and sometimes it is not printed.<br />
<br />
I don't know whats going wrong here.<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
As it is written in the Reports sections (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_report_scripts_report_sections)<br />
footer Â– printed at the bottom of each page <br />
<br />
Can you explain what is the difference between the three runs that you tried? When does it print at the bottom of each page? When it does not?<br />
<br />
Also can you share you layouts (print screen)? Is the&quot;page&quot; checkbox checked for the footer?<br />

<br />
instead of changing reports why don't you insert the 'signal word' with awk?<br />
As Baan should fill up pages with empty lines, it is very easy to count them and do a modulo division to find the n-th line.<br />
Feel free to send me an example.<br />
What I am suggesting is to change processing from<br />
Baanproggy -&gt; catch report data (tmp-file) -&gt; another software to<br />
Baanproggy -&gt; catch report data (tmp-file) -&gt; awk -&gt; another software<br />
(But to be honest, I rather have in mind:<br />
Baanproggy -&gt; catch report data (tmp-file) -&gt; awk -&gt; result <br />
... sorry, once again couldn't resist that one  :-)<br />

I tried it with two different customers.<br />
<br />
First Customer:<br />
- on display --&gt; only at the end of the report<br />
- on printer --&gt; signalword not printed <br />
<br />
Second Customer:<br />
<br />
- on display --&gt; printed correct at each page<br />
- on printer --&gt; only at the end of page 1<br />
<br />
And yes the checkbox for page is checked.<br />

Sounds good. I'll make a try.<br />
