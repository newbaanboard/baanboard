If I run it again it gave me 0, as it was able to create it the first time...<br />

It's a shell command for UNIX OS !<br />
<br />
Description<br />
This creates a specified directory (local or remote). You must have write permission in the parent directory to do this. Access permissions for the new directory are set to read, write, and execute for all users. The path_name$ argument must include the full path to the directory, including the host name, where appropriate. For example: <br />
<br />
mkdir( &quot;host1!/usr/mydir&quot; )<br />
<br />
Return values<br />
1  Success.<br />
 <br />
0 Operating system error code.<br />
 <br />
-1 Error; Probably no permission.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Context<br />
Bshell function.<br />

1- creating a file .cmd with command inside, moving it on client and running it with app_start<br />
2- app_start(&quot;cmd /c mkdir &quot; &amp; &quot;\\xxx\yyy\zzz&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;)<br />

There's no working baan function to create remote folders?!?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANYWAY I'd like to know why the hell mkdir() gave me those return values: 1 (success) for the first time and 0 (folder already exists) the following times...<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks bdittmar</div></div><hr />

The first time the directory is probably created as a sub-directory in your home directory on the local server. The second time it is already there. I don't know exactly what the home directory will be if Baan runs on a Windows machine. If you search for &quot;xxx&quot;, you will find it somewhere.</div></div><hr />

I did this check yet, but I didn't find it, both on my pc and on baan server!  :eek:</div></div><hr />
