<br />
I'm trying to create an interface and I do not want to change the standard Baan sessions. In the interface I have to create a file with all released production orders. These orders are needed by the other system. <br />
<br />
For new and changed orders everything works ok, but how can I trap deleted orders?? They are not in the system anymore, do has anybody an idea for how I can trap deleted orders so I can notify the other system that an order has been deleted.<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you,<br />
<br />
Youp</div></div><hr />

I don't think there is any history table in SFC module. Correct me if I am wrong!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Leena, for the info.<br />
But, two more doubts I have -<br />
This table gets updated only after backflushing/release outbound data, step is done!!? Right...<br />
And is it possible to delete the production order if the status has been changed to &quot;Released&quot; or anything after &quot;Released&quot;!!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deleted orders don't appear in the production order history. Production order history only contain production orders that went or are going through production operations. Youp, you might wanna try turning on audit trail on the production order table if it's important for you to see which orders were deleted (with this, you even get info on who did it, at what time, etc.) :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">24th January 2003, 08:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Paul is right. Deleted Production Orders do not appear in the Production Order history.<br />
Also, Youp, putting audit on, on the &quot;tisfc001&quot; table, will effect the performance of the system to some extent. So, think before you put it on.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">24th January 2003, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You can put a wrapper style program around the sessions that delete the records (QKEY, RMCgen, freeware version 'rush' on these boards).  You can write to your file everytime the records are deleted, and it does not require or modify the source code.  This would trap user deleted records.  You may have less luck for deletions done by mass processes...</div></div><hr />
