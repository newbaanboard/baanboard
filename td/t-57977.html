<br />
BOIs and BDE are based on different concepts<br />
BOIs simulate a session behaviour on the contrary BDE are not based on sessions anymore<br />
the other major dirrerences is that there is not any repository regarding BOI differently by BDE that you can find under Business Object session<br />
<br />
basically BDE are based on action like create record, update, delete etc, BOI are based on sessions<br />
<br />
talking about openwordl as far as i know BOIs use tmboaserver that is adapter server while BDE use JCA connector that means you don't need to run tmboaserver anymore but it is trasparent<br />
<br />
if you need more info let me know<br />
<br />

<br />
Could you be a little bit more detailed in your reponse. Any relevant documentation too would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Also I do not think that BOIs use sessions, they rather use the dlls which as far as I understand are used by BDEs too.<br />
<br />

BOIs are 4GL scripts (DLL) that call function server to simulate the session behaviour<br />
of course calling session behaviour if session script call DLL BOIS call dll as well<br />
first of all there is not any list of standard BOIs in opposite of list of standard BDE<br />
you can create new BDE using Business Studio and of course you can call DLL as well<br />
keep in mind also that DLL called by DBE could call DALs but they are not related to the session as before. i want to do an example<br />
<br />
if you want to create a BOI for area session tcmcs0145m000<br />
you need to create  the function server of that session using ttstpcreatdll<br />
than you need to use the tiger compiler to create the proxy java in order to call the BOIs<br />
if you look at function server there are a lot of function using stpapi command for setting and getting value and also for calling session function (choice option)<br />
this functions as i already told , simulate the behaviour of the session<br />
on the contrary if you want to create  a BDE for the same session of area you can search in the business object the standard one and if you need to customuze that you can import the definition of the BDE in business studio and change it and than republish it<br />
<br />
so you can understand from this littke example the differences between BOIs and BDE<br />
anyway if u need more info<br />
let me know<br />
<br />
thank you<br />
