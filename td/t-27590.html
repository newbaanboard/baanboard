  We have customized a few reports and linked them to a session. Is there a way to print all the reports from that session with one click instead of printing them one by one? (I assume program scripts is the place where we can mention this but we do not have development license).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Hello,<br />
without development (access to sourcecode), i think there is no chance to do this.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, replace rprt_send with brp - functions in sessionscript.<br />

I cannot think of any other idea. With a program script it would be the easiest ever of course. You would assign the different reports as different groups, and call the corresponding report(-group) each time. Also, you could just write an easy AFS-session. But without a development locense, you won't get far..</div></div><hr />

You can define 5 Jobs then activate all of them from a batch file.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<br />
Thanks for all your feedback. I have told the user that it is not possible. <br />
The reports are additional shipment documents when materials are supplied to overseas customers which are needed just once a day.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">15th August 2006, 21:29</div></div><div class="posttext">We have done something similar in other areas.  For instance at the point that Print Sales Invoices is run, we print order acknowledgements, bills of lading, custom bills of material.  The invoice is printed to hardcopy and a pdf for input into our document management system.  The other documents are created as pdfs for inport inot our DMS as well.  This way we get a complete snapshot of all the documents associated with a particular order or project at the time the invoice is printed.  <br />
<br />
We embed a dll in the report script.  The dll is an AFS call to all of the appropriate print sessions.  This way we can feed the field data to the appropriate sessions and let Baan handle the back end.</div></div><hr />
