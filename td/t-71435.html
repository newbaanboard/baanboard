<br />
<br />
Can any one help me to print page number as Page 1 of 5, 2 of 5 like this in the report. <br />
<br />
Currently I’m using lattr.pageno to print the page number, but need to know the “total number of pages” count.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Rajesh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th October 2018, 03:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Like I said I recommend using a tool.  But another way to get the total pages is to either do something like print the report to a file (has to be same layout as printer) and read it to get the pages.  Then print the report to the print with the new total number of pages.  The way we do it is to calculate the number of pages based off all the layouts in the report and how many lines are expected - I would never recommend this method, but it works 99% of the time for us.  We do this on print purchase orders and it contains text so it is very complicated.  Then every time you change the report you have to change the report script to make sure the calculation stays the same.  I never could get ours perfect and somewhere about 10 years ago I told them I would not support any more changes to it and they could live with the few PO's who might be off by 1 page.</div></div><hr />
