<br />
I have a report with a barcode, I am trying to convert it to postscript using the postscript device (ottstpconv as 4GL taking poststcipt as an argument). However, the barcode is not appearing in the generated PS file.<br />
<br />
When I tried to print my report to another virtual postscript printer it did convert everything to PS.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug in baan? or am I miss using the Postscript Baan device. I need it to work from Baan.<br />

<br />
Not sure I understand - why can't you just setup a postscript printer in baan and send it directly there?  Or is that what you are doing with ottstpconv? The only difference I recall on our printers is that the PS printer driver was essentially empty.  But with ottstpconv you are picking up the file and running it through the conversion process which maybe stripping out the barcodes. So our printer looks like this<br />
<br />
Printer name: something_ps<br />
Device type: direct<br />
<br />
Driver: ps<br />
device queue: lp -dsomething_ps -c -s -n%d %s<br />
paper type: ps<br />
<br />
I know we use unix printing so I am not sure how this translates on the windows platform.</div></div><hr />

My goal is to have a good PS file. Then I need to run a small baan script on this PS file.<br />
<br />
The output of our POSTSCRIPT Device (ottstpconv as 4GL) is not good. It shows the text in the PS file but not the barcode.<br />
<br />
My question is am I using the POSTSCRIPT Device in a wrong way? I am attaching a screenshot of our device.<br />
<br />
Another question is: Is there anyother way (other than ottstpconv) to generate a PS file and then run a script on it from baan?<br />

Maybe what you can do is send the report to a dummy post script printer - something like /dev/null as the printer using what I showed for the definition of a postscript printer.  This might leave the temporary report in the $BSE/tmp directory - you might then be able to access that report. You would just need to make sure that the delete delay on the user ID is set correctly.  In this case you would have to modify the script to the session you are working with - basically sent the PS file to dummy printer, then manipulate the tmp file, then send to the real printer.</div></div><hr />
