<br />
Many Platforms has been used to develop this like HPUX,<br />
But the major portion is of VC++ ( As I Know)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st August 2005, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree that many platforms have influenced Baan over the years, they support most operating systems, hopefully Linux even by now.<br />
<br />
But I have always viewed Baan as 'growing up' on UNIX, and with the original programming language most similar to C.   Many things it could make use of in Unix have been only 1/2 duplicated in a windows environment (such as User directories, in windows everything is dumped into TMP), and you will even see that the slashes (backslash or forward) are mixed up in a few places still.</div></div><hr />
