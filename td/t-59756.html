<br />
i hav a requirement to capture the date on which Maintain Approval is used &amp; user ID who has accessed it.<br />
<br />
i created a customized session to capture the date &amp; user ID. the user after approving the Qty in Maintain Approval has to give the receipt number as input, the customized session will capture the current date &amp; user ID for the records.<br />
<br />
This has some loopholes &amp; many users forget to run the session.<br />
<br />
1. Can i automize the same thru job mngmt &amp; crontab?<br />
2. what are the sessions i need to consider to create a job?<br />
<br />
Any ideas are welcome.<br />
thanking you in advance.</div></div><hr />

If you don't, then a wrapper program like QKEY, or the RMCis product will allow you to add additional code to the maintain approvals session.  Or you could - force them to use your session to launch maintain approvals.  You could try unchecking maintain approvals, then in your session launch it for them - but they would have to go thru your session.  Something like that might work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd January 2011, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">What you can do is remove the session from the menu and put your session in its place. What it will not prevent is them running your session, entering data and launching maintain approvals and then doing multiple approvals. You would need source code for maintain approvals.<br />
<br />
What we was create a receiving session for them.  The run this session, enter the data and we run maintain approvals in the back ground using AFS.  To keep them from running maintain approvals (we could, but didn't since they still needed some manual approvals) - we could have removed it from the dem flows and put our session on it. We automated the approval process - good received notes, receipt tag, approvals, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan.kmurali</div><div class="date">4th January 2011, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try this in the test server<br />
<br />
Copy the maintain approval session to live VRC and put your session(you can check that once enter the date, it will be allowed) as zoom field in any field in Maintain approval session.  <br />
but it's not advisable to do like this<br />
