<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaapzwaan</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">A dynamic form is a form created by the dfe (dynamic form editor). A dynamic form (as opposed to static forms) does not position the fields in an absolute sense, but in a relative way: Fields have relations with other fields.<br />
In the DFE you position a field as either<br />
- behind another field or<br />
-below another field<br />
Besides this, fields can be grouped in a group box.<br />
At definition time, there are no forms. Only at runtime, the fields (groups) are spread of the forms.<br />
Advantages of dynamic forms are:<br />
<br />
 When a field is removed from the form (either development time or runtime), the other fields are shifted.<br />
 Labels are related to fields, so when a field is made invisible, the label is made invisible too.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Dynamic Forms also opened up the way for combined forms: one definition for multiple appearances: it can be displayed as details session (single-occ), overview session (multi-occ) or combination of these (type 3).<br />
<br />
I hope this is clear to you. A dynamic form can still be displayed as a multi-occ session. So I think you should rephrase your question, because dynamic is not the opposite of multi-occ.<br />
