I'm facing a &quot;big&quot;  problem.. and need ur help..<br />
 <br />
1) Purchasing side confirmed that for this item ( AAA), they have received this quantity:<br />
    - on 21-07-2002  --&gt; 22<br />
    - on 10-09-2002  --&gt; 30<br />
 <br />
2) I print out the Inventory transaction for this item, the total in and out are:<br />
    -  (- 57) (negative 57)<br />
 <br />
3) SO, the balance should be (- 5). But, when i check the stock balance, it shows 15..<br />
 <br />
4) I checked table tdpur045 and tdpur051, they receive 22 and 30. But, when i check table tdpur041, delivered quantity is 42 and 30.. (How could this happen???)<br />
 <br />
5) The stock in hand in table tiitm001 and tdilc101 is 15..( which means the received quantity is 72 (42 + 30) )<br />
 <br />
6) At first table tdilc301 is not updated cause i never set the parameters to save the history.. So, i cannot check table tdilc301. There is no records for this item..<br />
 <br />
7) I've checked table tdinv700, they do receving twice only with quantity 22 and 30..<br />
<br />
8) And i checked table tfgld410, the receiving quantity is 22 and 30..<br />
 <br />
SO, what should i do now???  What is the best thing that i can do... Please do guide me..<br />
 <br />
Thanks a lot..<br />
 <br />
Best Regards,<br />

I have seen problems like this before, BUT by the time my group receives the problem the receipts are so old the users do not recall what they did or why it may have happened - all they know is they want it fixed.  We have never been able to track it down to exactly what caused it.  We have identified a problem with back orders and returning parts to vendors. What we typically do is work through the tables one at a time to make them balance. This takes some time since we are using pegging on the A&amp;D extension.<br />
<br />
I can not really tell you what to do with the tables since I am not familiar with your system and how things are setup.<br />

<br />
Also the tdinv700 table will show the &quot;Inventory after Transaction&quot; - try and go back several transactions before the 2 receipts and for each transaction make sure the &quot;Inventory after Transaction&quot; is correct.<br />
<br />
If after all that, an easy way to update all the tables such as tiitm001/tdinv001 etc is to use the tdinv0252m000 session it will take the ilc101 qty and update all tables. Providing you agree with the tdilc101 qty.4 <br />
<br />
Not sure whst version you are on but any version before BaanIVc4 has many bugs concerning the inventory on hand/hold/allocated not being set properly via various sessions.</div></div><hr />
