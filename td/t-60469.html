<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NirajKakodkar</div><div class="date">4th May 2011, 07:38</div></div><div class="posttext">BIRT is definitely a very good BI tool, was happy to see Infor's contribution towards the opensource community, providing its proprietory drivers.<br />
<br />
But since the last release, I have not seen any further development, bug fixing or any improvement towards the drivers. Why do we need the Infor drivers ? Is it really making the DB connectivity easier and being bottleneck in connectivity ?<br />
<br />
Apart from package wise biforcation and BaaN User freindly table descriptions while creating the datasets and the integration of BIRT rtpdesigns with webtop, there is nothing in here, we can't even use the reports in non-web UI. Is this making our life easier . No, a big no.<br />
<br />
Instead if I use the normal jdbc drivers for connectivity and host the reports outside the webtop in another Apache server instance, gives me a lot more flexibility, I can use all standard SQL syntaxes, I can call my reports in webtop as well as non webtop sessions in BW client. I can use the latest versions of Eclipse BIRT, the Infor drivers available are not yet build for Helios.<br />
<br />
Using Infor drivers I have lots and lots of limitation and I hate limitations.<br />
<br />
So freinds is there any reason for us to use the proprietory drivers ?</div></div><hr />

U may try that . May be that may make ur life quite easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have any documentation on Infor ION, which will explain about the installation, implentation, etc. stuff?  If yes, please share the documentation.<br />

Hello Hitesh,<br />
<br />
Yes I have heard about the ion and the workspace which Infor is bringing in with their next realease, but again a new tool here, though its a good step they are taking, but moving towards Microsoft BI (SSIS, SSAS, SSRS) now.<br />
<br />
This brings a little confusion and doubt in my mind, what if we are using databases other than SQL-SERVER will it be of same ease and comfort for non Microsoft users. Is some layer build above DBs to take care of this in reporting studio? Will Microsoft encourage the use of non SQL-SERVER databases ? This is where I still get a smell of some limitations. Well can't really comment anything before I try it. But being BIRT user for quiet some time (for non Infor integration also), somwhere I have some soft corner for BIRT.<br />
<br />
Have anyone already tried it yet with non SQL-SERVER databases.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Niraj Kakodkar</div></div><hr />

So someone with first hand experience is right to guide on this . But from what i hear / read , it's  not tied to sql . It's  available for all db through it's open architecture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NirajKakodkar</div><div class="date">6th May 2011, 07:10</div></div><div class="posttext">If thats so, its a good thing, lets wait for its release. AFAIK ION is integration technology or platform I would rather say, to keep all their product line together, a tight integration between all their products. but here I was talking about BIRT Reporting and the infor drivers for BIRT, I think the topic is taking a turn.<br />
<br />
So should we conclude , that existing BIRT users should not expect any further improvements or Infor's contribution towards BIRT and go along with BIRT alone without using Infor's drivers ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th May 2011, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We have never required and hence used birt drivers . So I unable to comment on Infor drivers for BIRT . Only  experienced ones on this matter like  you can tell more .</div></div><hr />
