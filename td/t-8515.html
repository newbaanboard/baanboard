I am curious, why would you want to do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guilmor</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 21:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm developing some extremely simple sessions to read a barcode, in order to make an outbound, and other things. In those sessions, there is an input field (barcode) and some show fields (extra information for the user) and just &quot;Continue&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons. I don't want the user to miss the button, so the least buttons on screen, the better for the user. I can avoid mistakes, that's all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 21:22</div></div><div class="posttext">If you mean a big help button along right side, by a continue button, you can remove that through Form / Form Commands.   You should be able to find a button labeled help and delete.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can disable the help button on the menu bar (the arrow with a question mark), but you do have some options based on the Window Type to remove the menu all together.  Try playing with the Window Type field on Maintain Sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 22:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I thought you were trying to remove the help button at the top but this should be easy.  Go to session Maintain Forms  (ttadv3100m000), then Maintain Buttons (ctrl + F6), remove the Help button (which is presumably in the Other Buttons section).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guilmor</div><div class="date">28th January 2003, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">28th January 2003, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan ERP it's the Form Commands session, off of the 'special' drop down menu in Maintain Forms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guilmor</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">In &quot;Standard commands&quot; there is no &quot;help&quot; check...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see that now, the type of session you have there puts those buttons along the right side by default, and there is no changing it.  The continue button is listed in the Form Commands, but not the help or the others.<br />
<br />
I think  the only solution is to change the Session Type (Maintain Sessions, 'Session Type' field)  to a different type.  That's what is causing those buttons.   However, when you do that, you will probably get the task bar menu up on top instead, and you may have to go back and add your continue button yourself.</div></div><hr />
