<br />
Is somebody familier with Business Objects Integration Kit for Baan?<br />
<br />
I'd like to know can the end user direct send a report to the Crystral Report server, then can export to Excel or something else?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<br />
You can 'push' reports to the enterprise server but not all reports, I am not completely sure but it looks like you have to compile them. Depends if you report can be exported to xml format?<br />
<br />
You configure a special printer device and use that one. Printing to CE is NOT fast! Furthermore if you compile the report again you need to make the changes in your report again. This is due to the fact that the report uses a timestamp to identify it. There is a possibility to change the report to undo this effect but that doesn't seems to work all the time.<br />
<br />
We use the combination for reports that:<br />
1. needs to look pretty (external documents);<br />
2. need more characters on a line (&gt; 255 chars)<br />
<br />
