<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">30th August 2006, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I assign the following string to a report-variable in order to have an image printed on the report (using device with html and ttstpconv settings):<br />
<br />
gif(1, j) = chr$(60) &amp; &quot;img src=&quot; &amp; chr$(34) &amp; file.name &amp; chr$(34) &amp; chr$(62)<br />
<br />
When the report gets printed (in iexplore), the text string is shown, for example for item picture 000041_1.gif: &lt;img src=&quot;e:\baan\gif\000041_1.gif&quot;&gt; , yet the image is not printed. When I look at the source, I see: &#60;img src=&quot;e:\baan\gif\000041_1.gif&quot;&#62; , i.e. the &lt; and &gt; tags are replaced with ascii codes. <br />
<br />
The same result when I replace the input string with:<br />
gif(1, j) = &quot;&lt;img src=&quot; &amp; chr$(34) &amp; file.name &amp; chr$(34) &amp; &quot;&gt;&quot;<br />

Can anyone help me with this please?</div></div><hr />

I guess Baan is trying to &quot;help&quot; you by showing you exactly the text you &quot;wanted&quot; to see in the HTML file.<br />
My first suggestion is to try to add this line manually to HTML file when it is ready. I will look into it more tomorrow.<br />

I hope it helps,<br />

It is enough if I replace the wrong text with the html-text. But I'd rather have Baan leave things the way I send them...<br />

Good to know that this works for Baan IV, I will log a case by Infor (...) Support..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">31st August 2006, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw the same case here (http://baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=24017&amp;highlight=HTML) and the solution posted didn't help me!<br />
<br />
There should be a hidden switch for ttstpconv in baan 5...<br />
<br />
Edit: What I meant by manually it to write a script that will activate ttstpconv (HTML), wait until it finishes and then add the image line to ttstpconv's output.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">31st August 2006, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way: so I set up a device HTML for general html printing, opened automatically in Internet Explorer. I want to always include a company-logo, so in the field 'Argument' in the device settings, I wrote: HTML -\\es7000F\gif\comp_logo.gif :iexplore<br />
<br />
the folder gif is a shared folder in $BSE. When I print a report using this device nothing is printed, Internet explorer does not get activated. When I write the local path, i.e. e:/baan/gif/comp_logo.gif, the report gets printed, but the file is not found. <br />
<br />
Seems like I cannot give a network path by using \\??? Anyone knows something about this??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan IVc has the same problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)   For printing the logo via device setting, it seems that instead of backslash, regular slash should be passed in the path name. <br />
<br />
When I changed HTML -\\es7000F\gif\comp_logo.gif :iexplore to HTML -//es7000F/gif/comp_logo.gif :iexplore it worked fine.<br />
<br />
2)   You mentioned that when you tested in Baan IV (C4?) for passing the html string to the report, it worked fine, and the tags were correctly converted to html, and the pictures displayed. I logged a case by Support, and when they tested on their Baan IVC4 system they had the same result as me on Baan V! Could you be so kind to send me an example from Baan IV (maybe even a zip-file with an export of the session objects) so that I can pass it on to Support as &quot;evidence&quot;..? Because I do not have a Baan IV system...</div></div><hr />

1) Yep, I have tried that and it works.<br />
<br />
2) I tried the standard &quot;Print Areas&quot; report. My Baan IVc is on UNIX. I have attached the result.<br />

I hope it helps,<br />

    yes we do use a windows server <br />
    Earlier when i used simply &lt;img src &gt; w/o &lt;/pre&gt;<br />
    it was showing the ascii codes for &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;<br />
    i.e #&amp;60; and #&amp;62;<br />
<br />
    the object we used was the same ottstpconv for html device<br />

<br />
As I already mentioned earlier today, and thanks to George's testing on both Unix and Windows machines, this is clearly a Windows issue. On Unix it works fine, on Windows the tags are converted to the text-strings of the ascii values instead of the ascii values themselves. <br />

Thanx en@frrom ,<br />
<br />
I created a new 3GL script, in which I call ttstpconv manually, after ttstpconv has finished his job, I open the tmp-file, and I re-edit the html tags correctly and write it all to a new tmp-file. The new file is copied to the users local drive, and opened with Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />

Can you please post me ur script , so that i can try it .</div></div><hr />

Can you please tell me how can i use that script , i mean how do use it as ttstpconv file , i tcud not compile it in tt package , please would you explian me in detailed steps .<br />

<br />
You should not create the script under Tools, for you do not have Tools authorization. So take the following steps:<br />
1) Create a new 3GL script in a package, for instance tc (Common)<br />
2) Create a device, and in the 'program' you name your 3GL program with 'o' before it, so if your 3GL program is named f.i. tccomconvhtm, then you enter 'otccomconvhtm'<br />
3) Select the desired device in your report session</div></div><hr />

 I compiled the script in td package,  and created the device  but then when i actually tried to use the device it gave me an error &quot;No Session Form Available &quot;<br />
I have not created the sesion , i have just created a script and compiled , coz it ask me for a maintable if i go to create a session<br />
<br />
 Then i renamed the my omsl333 file to ostpconv and replaced the original one , and tried to print the report , it executed but with the same old output , i think it was still readin the old object <br />

can you please explain ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">28th September 2006, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess you have given a wrong filename in your output path on the device. You should only give a filename, no complete path. The local file is always placed at the local ${BSE}/tmp directory, and given the filename you choose. So you can set a filename in the device settings (i.e. htmlout), and then this file will always be overwritten. This will only be the default path in  the ttstpsplopen, so the user can always change it to a different filename.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you prefer that the user should give a full path to the local file, then this is no problem. You then should change line 71 in the script from 	local.path = &quot;${BSE}/tmp/&quot; &amp; TR(spool.fileout)<br />
to<br />
	local.path = TR(spool.fileout)<br />

Let me know if this solves your problem</div></div><hr />

<br />
 One more query , I tried to print the logo onto the report , it prints it fine , but the problem is it reads the logo only if it is on the client machine <br />
<br />
i.e <br />
<br />
 if i give the local path like in my case<br />
  <br />
   p = &quot;&lt;img src=c:\d.jpg&quot;&gt; wer c:\d.jpg is the jpeg file on local machine <br />
<br />
I tried doin it the other way to read it from the server , i pasted the d.jpg file on the server tmp folder and tried<br />
<br />
  i.e<br />
      p = &quot;&lt;img src=&quot;  &amp;bse.tmp.dir$() &amp;&quot;/d.jpg&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
here in this case it is not reading the file from the server but searching on the local machine itself ,<br />
<br />
This i think because ie reads it from local machine as iexplorer gets the path only<br />
Please suggest me something<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Niraj</div></div><hr />

I shared the folder which contains the images. Since ttstpconv  doesn't allow backslashes (\), you have to use forward slashes (/), so just type your network path, but instead of backslash, use forward slash. For instance, for shared folder 'gif' on server BaanERPLive, you should type<br />
p = &quot;&lt;img src= &quot;//BaanERPLive/gif/gifname.gif&quot;&gt;&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I created the device data as per the screen shot provided (I am guessing 'Bestand herscrijven' means 'Rewrite file'). The output file is created in the system, but iexplore does not fire up.<br />
<br />
If I manually transfer the file using FTP, and open it up in IE, it looks just fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th September 2006, 23:50</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) I have this in the argument for ttstpconv - html:iexplore.  And yes it is a rewrite file.<br />
(2) Check to make sure the file is making it from the server into the baan tmp directory.  This is on the client - on our clients it is C:\Program Files\Baan\tmp.<br />
(3) You may also need to make sure that html file extension is associated to IE.<br />
Those are all that I can think of so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Try puting the full path in your argument field in maintain device data <br />
<br />
 i.e<br />
  <br />
  html:c:\Progra~1\Intern~1\Iexplore.exe %s<br />
<br />
I guess it will fire ur IE after this <br />

Marc's point nr. 3 and Niraj's check/test should bring you to the solution I think. Please let us know if you managed.<br />

I tried the setup according to both your suggestions, but IE does not fire up automatically. I will research some more to see what I am missing. If I transfer the output file manually, I can open up the file in IE and the result is just as I expect. Be nice not to have to program around this by forcing the files to the client side and then firing up IE programmatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">23rd October 2006, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">It seemed initially that I would get away with installing a new version of ottstpconv (patch file 79017std.dmp) but I get as error messages:<br />
<br />
<br />
Error: Can't read session or object (ottdllintegra)<br />
Fatal error: Dynamic Link failure function 'integration.on.runtime'<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like a more involved deal so I am going to let this rest till the BAAN Admin (the real experts) upgrade the entire porting set. [We are currently at 6.1c.06.04].</div></div><hr />
