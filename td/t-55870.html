  I connected to the baan remotely from a deskptop using Intermec CK31 RF scanner. I use the scanner to scan Barcode of a item. My requirement is to transfer the control to next field automatically after scanning the item. i tried to program in Baan, not succeeded. I should not use TAB to move to the next field. TAB should be executed automatically once after scanning. Do i need to make any setting in CK31 to execute TAB immediately after scanning, or it can be programmed in Baan, if so how? please, help me if anyone have idea on this. Its urgent:(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">13th July 2010, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same issue to resolve. As one of them suggested, i programmed my scanner (I have Symbol LSI400i scanner) to sent TAD at the end of the scan. <br />
I tried this in notepad and its reading the value and send the Tab as well<br />
But in Baan, it still doesnt move the cursor to the next field. I suspect ASCII 9 which stands for TAb has some other meanign in Baan. ASCII 9 is also tranlates to Ctrl I.<br />
Sames issue if i scan into word as well. Since Ctrl I is Italics in word it does italics, instead of TAB.<br />
I would think there must be some way to deal with it</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
i can't find your scanner (LSI400i) on Symbol/Motorola Homepage.<br />
I use different Scanner (Symbol, Metrologic, Teklynx a.s.o) and all model worked as expected.<br />
You have to change CR (Factory default) to TAG with scanner-model-programming-sheet.<br />
I test it with Excel, if cursor goes down after scanning, CR is enabled, if cursor went to right cell, TAB is enabled.<br />
For that i can't comprehend your problem.<br />

Thanks for the prompt reply. Sorry it was LS 4000i model.<br />
Now the issue is fixed. I had code 1009 programmed for TAB, this one translate to Ctrl I and if the application has some mapping for that key combination (like in Ms Word Crtl I is to make Italics) it doesnt work<br />
But now i found, after googling, we have to use function mapping keys for TAB, which sends a TAB which works fine. For Symbol LS4000i this code is 7009.<br />
It might be that for other scanners this code might be different</div></div><hr />
