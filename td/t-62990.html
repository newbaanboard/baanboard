<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th October 2012, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought I would try this forum first to see if anyone has seen anything like this for this session or others.  We have a case where tibom1213m000(Detect Low Level Code) has been increasing in run for months.  You can see the chart below.  We moved to new equipment in November of 2011 and expected a slight increase.  Now it kept increasing until April 6th - we cannot figure out what happened on April 6th 2012 to drop the run time back down to about 40 minutes.  The run times continue to grow for this session is now over 6 hours.  Any clues?  Of course nobody claims to have made any changes that weekend for the run.<br />
<br />
We logged a ticket with infor and they basically said I/O was the issue - but we have been on the same hardware and storage up until about two weeks ago.  At that time we moved from tier 2 storage to tier 1 storage(I don't have the types of drives or any information around this).  As it was a lot of other things perform great now, but this job continues to grow.  Anything anyone can think of to look at? <br />
<br />
We have two sessions showing this trend tibom1213m000 and calculate cost prices - don't have the session number handy.  We are going to try exporting and importing the main tables for the session this weekend.  See what happens after that.  We did just clone our production company a couple of weeks ago - this session runs under 1 hour all test environments and in 30 minutes in the recently cloned copy(export/import basically).  OH - database is Oracle 10g.  Any clues or thoughts appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">17th October 2012, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any output from running the session? ie do you actually have a loop in one of your boms?<br />
Maybe someone messed up a bom a couple of weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th October 2012, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response. That was one of the things we looked for - we could not find any loops any place.  Tibom1213m000 generates an error report, and I was told that if a part has a loop then the regen run would also generate an error for the part.  So we looked, but could not find anything wrong with the data itself.  As a matter of fact everything else in this batch job(except calculate cost price) runs pretty consistently.  Those two sessions seems to keep creeping up in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd October 2012, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we re-org'ed the three main tables and rebooted the whole environment.  Session still runs slow in production. Not sure what else to look at for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">22nd October 2012, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you running the job with update low level codes set to yes?<br />
What is the performance like if you run it manually?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd October 2012, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - runs slow.  I have also just learned the 3 main tables are being audited in production, but not in all the test companies.  I am leaning towards that - plus the audit flat files are on tier 2 storage making it even slow.  I am going to try to get those admins to look at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">2nd November 2012, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">This was too long ago (1999), but at the time tibom1213m10b used to go into an infinite loop if the session hits a retry point. The suspect was the volume of data because it used to work without failure in the pilot company - in the production company it failed - we had to stop running it for a while till it was fixed.<br />
<br />
See if the log files throw up anything - though I do not think there was errors logged since the session was in a loop.<br />
<br />
If you have the source code, you could place debug messages to dig out where the issue is - which is what I had to do. Otherwise you may have to get a fix from BAAN - in fact they may require to actually debug with the real data - like I said - it works just fine in a test environment with low volume data.<br />
<br />
The main modification I had to do was to apply suitable retry points and  change the way the Item Master is updated.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I cannot post the code for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th November 2012, 12:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Appreciate the thought - but since we do not own source code I could not use it anyway. No includes, etc.  In our case it does not appear to loop and I am still waiting for an admin to try something around the auditing.  They are also talking about moving the application to tier1 storage, but no word on when.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd December 2012, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I would let everyone know it was the Auditing on the tables that caused the issue.  The audit log for tibom010 went back to .001 this past weekend and the runtime dropped to 36 minutes.</div></div><hr />
