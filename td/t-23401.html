<br />
Refer to  - sql.set.rds.full() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_dynamic_sql_queries_sql_set_rds_full)<br />
<br />
Syntax<br />
long sql.set.rds.full( long sql.id, long size )<br />
<br />
Description<br />
This sets the size of the RDBMS buffer. The buffer is used to send the result <br />
rows of a query from the database back to the client (that is, the bshell). <br />
For example, if a query fetches 20 rows and you have set the size of the buffer to 5, then the database sends the rows back to the client five at a time.<br />
<br />
You call the function immediately after calling sql.parse().<br />
<br />
Arguments<br />
sql_id	 The query ID, as returned by sql.parse().<br />
 <br />
size	 The size of the buffer, in rows.<br />
<br />
Return values<br />
0 	Success. <br />
&lt;&gt;0 	Error.<br />
Context		Bshell function.</div></div><hr />

Probably the : is missing in your select statement, which will give compile errors.<br />

<br />
Good point!  The answer lies in what was intended with the original post.  Just wondering - before your layout.again wouldn't you need a row.count = row.count +1 to keep getting the next row and a check to make sure when you did hit the last row it skipped the layout.again?<br />
<br />
Never really used the layout.again feature, but I will have to keep this in mind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">10th March 2005, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course logic has to be build around the set count and of course a conditional layout.again() should be used. The example was meant to show it is possible and usefull to use a variable set of records, without pretending to be a fully working script.<br />
<br />
To get back to the original post, the compile error is caused by the fact that the variable has to be external to the sql query, like the variables in the where clause. So use :row.count in stead of row.count.<br />

If you need to use a variable in the query, I think that it is not a normal select the solution, you should think about the use of a dynamic sql<br />

good luck!<br />
