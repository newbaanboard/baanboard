Refer to the ttstpconv documentation for more info about the parameters for HTML.<br />
<br />
12) html<br />
The output of Baan is created as a html file on the server. The file can be loaded in a web browser to see it.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
argument: html<br />
path: /tmp/baan.out<br />
<br />
The html file /tmp/baan.out is created and left on the server.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
argument: html\/tmp/test %s<br />
path: /tmp/baan.out<br />
<br />
The html file /tmp/baan.out is created on the server and processed by the script /tmp/test as the first argument. <br />
<br />
Together with the html conversion you can also define one of the following or all:<br />
-g&lt;picturefile&gt;<br />
-c&lt;name&gt;<br />
-f&lt;fontsize of HTML&gt;<br />
<br />
The picturefile will be included at the top of the HTML output. The name is a word that will be displayed additionaly on top of the report and fontsize is the size you define in the &lt;font size=&gt; tag of html. All these parameters are optional and can be used in combinations.<br />
<br />
13) html: (please remind the colon after the html!!!!!)<br />
The output is generated in html format and then transferred to the client and processed by the program called in the argument line.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
argument: html:c:\Progra~1\IEXPLORE.exe %s<br />
path: c:\temp\file.html<br />
<br />
The html file is transferred to the file c:\temp\file.html on the client and then the internet explorer is opened with the file.<br />
<br />
Also the additional parameters of html can be used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want a report with html-tags to be opened in Microsoft Internet Explorer as a HTML-file without Baan placing extra tags in such a way that my tags are just shown as text. When I use html in the argument of ttstpconv, the program places html-tags around &quot;my&quot; html-tags in the report.<br />
<br />
For instance the line in the report output &quot;The next word is printed &lt;B&gt; bold &lt;/B&gt;&quot; is also printed as &quot;The next word is printed &lt;B&gt; bold &lt;/B&gt;&quot;, instead of &quot;&quot;The next word is printed bold&quot; (bold is printed bold).<br />
<br />
I also tested with argument &quot;ascii:iexplore.exe&quot;, but in this way the explorer opens the file as an txt file, example &quot;tmp008895536.txt&quot;. The setting in the field &quot;Path&quot; seems to have no influence on the local file-name.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your reply.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Bert</div></div><hr />

I do generate lot of HTML report that are open in browser or gets emailed to users via Baan directly. The concept is very straightforward- Generate the report in Baan with HTML tags, open the generated HTML report in web browser via app.start().<br />
I recently developed a HTML BOM, where each component is hyperlinked and points to the spec of component. With little bit of enhancement, we are sending the same to our suppliers and they can also click on the componet to get the spec. <br />
