<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to add a section to the reminder letters report (tfacr3420m000) but the session doesn´t  print it.<br />
I took a look in script code of the report but i didn´t find  anything that is disabling the new section. <br />
I even tried unsuccessfully to debug the report.<br />
Does anyone knows anything about this behavior.:confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Some questions come to mind - What section are you trying to add?  What is the out put expression you used? When in debug mode do you even see your section?  I have not worked on this report and hopefully these questions may help someone to resolve the problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">The report is language depedant.<br />
I´m trying to add a section after all the data of a given customer have been processed (after.field.sort.cuno.rep) or a footer section. <br />
The output expression used is 1.<br />
There are a lot of strange things happening with this report.<br />
I can´t run it in debug mode.<br />
I added some code to the layout (section)  i'm trying to print creating a file and it works fine. At the top of this code i issued a command like (message(&quot;Hello&quot;)) and it does not work.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Not being able to run it in debug mode is the first problem.  Make sure it is running from the correct VRC as Hitesh mentioned.  And that you are running the correct lanquage report. Also check to see if this report is in shared memory.  If it is , then I think you need to restart shared memory.  I would say from your last post it is not running the report you think it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">7th April 2004, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem was with the compilation of the report.<br />
Although there were no errors during the compilation process the report was not compiling.<br />
I saw that when checking the files in VRCs in Baan\application directory.<br />
Somehow the report stoped compiling after a customization.<br />
Thank you for your help<br />
Regards <br />
