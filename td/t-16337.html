<br />
I am trying to print a table field defined with depth 25 and the tcmcs.str11, a domain with sting of length 11.<br />
<br />
The print expressions and the errors which I got<br />
<br />
tdadd301.trac - argument mismatch for strip$ function<br />
tdadd301.trac(1) - illegal number of arguments<br />
tdadd301.trac(1,1) - no integration with package, and does not allow me to put in a domain either.<br />
<br />
Right now I am doing it the worst was of declaring 25 variables and printing them. <br />
<br />
I have been thru a lot of threads on the board which relate to the issue, but none has been helpfull in solving the issue. Let me know if you gurus have been able to find a solution for it.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th August 2004, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">In the report it would be tdadd301.trac(1,1) ,tdadd301.trac(1,2) to get the individual elements.  For a substring it would be tdadd301.trac(1,2;X)  this would mean element 2 starting at one for x characters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maximus</div><div class="date">21st August 2004, 02:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The suggested solution does not work for me as the moment I put in tdadd301.trac(1,1) the domain listed in the field below vanishes. It further does not let me specify the domain as input in that field is not allowed. Further, If I just try to save the record and come out, it says no integration with package and does not let me save and exit.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions ?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't seem to find the depth field on the field in Maintain Layouts, but if you go out to Maintain Input Fields, you will see the depth, which in an array indicates the array numbering.  Pretty sure.  Try inserting your field here and giving it the right depth.  Then, when you enter the field on the layout, choose the zoom on the print expression and pick the one you defined with the right depth.<br />
<br />
Did not reproduce that in Baan V - let us know if it helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maximus</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have attached an excel sheet with the table definition, the report input field definition and the three cases in which I get the error along with the error messages.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">And what does the input field screen look like - the depth field is the concern.<br />
<br />
I see the QKEY references when you compile the report.  If this is not a standard compile maybe there are other reasons for the error.   We have a product RMCgen that is very similar to QKEY, and we had a heck of a time getting arrays to work right.  Not saying that's the problem here, just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maximus</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">...is the second sheet the workbook, please revert if any other screen shot is required. The Qkey may be the casue, I will try to simulate it on a non qkey machine and find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 20:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Either that or upgrade the qkey version - we are currently running 3.7.  I did a quick test on ttadv421.part and the report worked.<br />
