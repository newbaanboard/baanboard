<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">15th September 2008, 22:16</div></div><div class="posttext">On Form 4 of the Maintain Sales Orders session, there is a &quot;Allow Consolidation&quot; YES/NO option.<br />
<br />
I have added a text field after that to allow the user to add in which sales orders can be consolidated.<br />
<br />
Problem is that users are forgetting to add the text in  :) ...<br />
<br />
I don't want to make my new field manditory becuase they will always have to enter in something. I'd rather base it on the Allow Consolidation field being set to YES.<br />
<br />
I don't see any way to warn the user to enter in text if blank based on a condition ...<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ? Thanks in advance !</div></div><hr />

Then you could either issue a warning message or do a check on the text field to make sure it is not blank.  Those are the first two options that popped into my mind.</div></div><hr />
