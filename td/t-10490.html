<br />
Was somebody doing this task? I have a report and only on the first page I have to print a footer (leng 11 for example).<br />
<br />
I am not able to make the report forget about this footer lenght for the following pages.<br />
<br />
In the last page of the report I have to print on the bottom of the page another layout. Naturally, the layout is printed at the line :page lenght - 10 lines (the biggest footer).<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility to make the report forget about this footer?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In your report layout change the output expression from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;lattr.pageno=1&quot;<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
Thank.s a lot for your fast answer.<br />
<br />
The ideea you gave me is able to handle the printing of the footer.<br />
<br />
The problem that still remains is that the lenght of this footer is remembered by the report even if the footer is not printed.<br />
<br />
In the last page of my report I have to print an after.field layout exactly at the bottom of the page. I cannot do this. This layout is always printed at the page.length - footer.lenght. <br />
<br />
Do you have an ideea hoe to handle this?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

 (ie: a variable that you define and set or there may be a Baan variable that is available at the time)<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your ideea. Meanwhile I managed to created a solution for this. A little bit forced but is functioning :-).<br />
<br />
Your ideea came to me also but the wrong part is that Baan decides at runtime the length of the footer and will consider always the longest footer as default. In my case I had to print on the first page a footer of 11 lines and on the last page at the bottom of the page some informations that could change depending on lattr.break. This has 21 lines.  This means that also for the first footer the reserved lines were 21.<br />
<br />
What I have done is:<br />
- print the footer of 11 lines only on first page (print condition : lattr.pageno = 1)<br />
- on all following pages the footer was not printed but the reserved ยง11 lines for the footer were empty (this didn't bother me).<br />
- on the last page I print an after report (this can forget about the footer). To send the pointer to the line I need I couldn't use the skip.to() because the footer would be checked. I inserted instead empty lines until the line I needed.<br />
<br />
It's ok for what I needed.<br />
<br />
Thanks one more time.</div></div><hr />
