<br />
I have a doubt regarding Importing a dump on live server....????<br />
<br />
Actually, I have Developed a session on test server and while creating dump I have only selected objects and not sources...<br />
So I can run the session successfully on live but can not view the script and forms in application development...<br />
<br />
Now the problem is My Test server Harddisk crashes and we overwrite all live dumps and data on test server...<br />
So now I am having dumps only with objects....<br />
So What can I do now??????? Is it possible to get the sources from objects?????<br />
Please help me.......</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your developers were using external editor (scite , notepad) then you may find temporary scripts(with extension .cln)  in your &quot;tmp&quot; folder of baan client installed on your local machine. However this method is not at all reliable as you may not get the correct version of script. But as they say something is better than nothing.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />

You should be able to restore the scripts from a backup - I hope you were doing a backup of test.</div></div><hr />
