I want to change the labels of session &quot;Maintain Sales Orders&quot; tdsls4101m000.<br />
<br />
This session did not exist for my customer derivation.<br />
So, I've copied Session and Forms and entered as customer the customer of my user. (see attachment)<br />
Then, I've changed for testing the colour of the &quot;Sales Order&quot; Form field.<br />
Then, I've done &quot;Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary (Forms and Mensu).<br />
<br />
However, I could not see my changes to the form field.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually don't want to change the colour. I've tried this only to test if something changes.<br />
I want to change the label of the standard field &quot;Order Date&quot;.<br />
Is this not possible without programming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th February 2020, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you want to change a label then you can go to maintain labels.      Or if you want to do it on this form - just delete the label and type in your new one.  If my change did not show up I might try a crdd on the session and form.  Then if the quick change I just did still did not show up I would start checking out on the server to make sure the files were being updated and everything was in the right VRC path.  I say this because for some reason every now and then our files out on the unix side would get owned by a specific developer and I would have to get permissions updated.</div></div><hr />
