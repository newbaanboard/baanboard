<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ken bohnenkamp</div><div class="date">4th August 2013, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We are planning to move from our existing HP-UX 11.23 on a PA-RISC processor to HP-UX 11.31 with an Itanium processor for Baan 4c4. Has anyone out there made this type of move? Also does anyone know if we will require a Baan porting set upgrade. We are currently Baan 4c4 with porting set of 6.1c.12?  We presently are not planning to upgrade our Informix database from 11.50.FC7 (level 2 drivers). I assume we can stay with this version of Informix but not sure. Any information would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some thoughts/remarks for your project:<br />
<br />
As you are going to switch hardware, you will very likely have to license the environment again.  While the 6.1c.xx release path of the porting set still has the license daemon, the newer releases also support the SLM licensing.  SLM can be installed on another server and allows for more flexibility.<br />
<br />
About the porting set upgrade, Infor is going to retire the 6.1c.xx release path of the porting set by the end of December 2014 and no fixes will be provided afterwards anymore.  Customers are being asked to upgrade to the 8.x release path.  As changing hardware and switching to a different release path are both more time consuming tasks, you might want to consider doing this together.<br />
<br />
About Informix, I recall hearing that Infor is not bundling the Informix drivers with the newer porting set releases anymore.  It is still supported, but you need to ask Infor support for it.<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
Stephan</div></div><hr />

 <br />
some time ago we moved from HP-UX 11.11 to 11.31. I think that we also changed to Informix database for some reasons. We had no problems.<br />
Please note that you have programs that were compiled for PA-RISC (e.g. written in C) they should run on your new hardware, but if you are able to compile them there, the program ill be faster.<br />
