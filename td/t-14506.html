  Does anybody know how to change the character set for Locale ISO-8859-1? I know that there are files like tss-bw,<br />
tss6.1,tss_c6.1 and tss_locale6.1 under $BSE/lib directory. I can find mapping for 00 to 7F but I also want to map from 7F to FF<br />
to avoid some TSS character conversion errors. I would really appreciate if somebody can throw some light on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

But when BaaN tries to read it and print/display, it complaints that it cannot convert the character. As far as my understanding goes, whenever BaaN reads in or displays , it checks the character mapping defined in one of the tss6.1 files under $BSE/lib to find out the equivalent TSS character. I am not sure about how to edit these files.</div></div><hr />

I remember having done something similar, I changed settings with something called like nlsedit. It doesn't seems to be available on nt (actually that was done on a hp machine).<br />
<br />
It't not much but perhaps it does help a bit.<br />
