<br />
I am in the learning process of customisation.<br />
Want to create a new table(not existing say for e.g in td sls package) in Baan IVc4, and assign it to some session .It will be a input session where users will enter data into the table.Then I want to assign that session to a menu is Sales Control in Distribution module.<br />
<br />
Can someone let me know how to go about stepwise ?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g√ºnther</div><div class="date">31st August 2005, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">okay, here is my brief description.<br />
<br />
1. Run ttadv4120m000 Maintain table definitions to give your new table a name (but be careful when using official baan modules such as td, ti, ...) within the correct VRC.<br />
<br />
2. Use the Fields and Indices buttons to add these definitions as well.<br />
<br />
3. Use the option &quot;Convert to runtime dictionary&quot;!<br />
<br />
4. Log out.<br />
<br />
5. Once logged in, run GTM (ttaad4100) and open your new table. When you are asked about non existing tables, you can create it here.<br />
<br />
-- okay. Now you have a new table and its up to you to use it in baan session, reports and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ouch, you're asking for very long explanation on the basics of BaanIV Tools. I don't mean to be cruel here, but I think your employer (be it consulting firm or a business using BaanIV) should provide a mean for you to at least understand the basics. If they don't have the budget to give you training right now, how about asking them for the old training manual that was used to train the existing/ex-employees? Once you have covered the basics that way, probably your question will become more time-effective to answer. Sorry to be frank, but I think many other board members here in BaanBoard are willing to answer short questions, but they aren't really willing to write down long lecture to help with the basics. They're busy people as you've probably guessed. Gunther has been very kind answering a small part of your question. But I can just imagine that you're going to ask series of question following his answer. All the best for your BaanIV Tools study<br />

<br />
Once you create the table as mentioned above you can Generate a Maintain session (for Input) using Standard session ttadv2290m000.<br />
<br />
The session can be linked to a menu using Standard session ttadv3160m000.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Use the wiki programmers manual on the board - yes it is Baan 5, but still most applies to Baan 4.  Also use the help inside Baan.  May not solve all of the issues but are two places you can do some reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anuraag</div><div class="date">2nd September 2005, 07:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Skamat,<br />
