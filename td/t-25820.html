<br />
First copy that standard report layout to your current VRC, then add a new layout above your original layout it could be before.report, or any other layout that you need. Print this layout with some condition and once it is printed make the condition false, so that it doesn't effect the original report printing.<br />
<br />
Hope you have understood it and this would help you<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards</div></div><hr />

If then you still need the second report to start straight after the first one, this can still be achieved with some programming trick. If you need this latter indeed, then let us know, and provide us some details, so we can give you further advice...<br />

<br />
You have to use functions rprt_oen,rprt_close,rprt_send and use temporary flag to count lines. Through rprt function you can open more than one report at a time.<br />
