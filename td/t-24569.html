I want to create field in table that is longer than 999 char. In &quot;Maintain domain&quot; the maximum lenght allowed is 999. So in order to over coem this limtation I changed the lenght through GTM to 2000 and then run time on Domain. Then I created my own custom table and attached this field and field is able to hold 2000 char. I tested out and everything seems to be working fine. DOes anyone sees any issue with my approach?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
My suggestion is use text field instead of string field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">15th July 2005, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I am aware of report layout. I don't want to use text field and that is the reason I want this way. I want know if there is any downfall (technically) on this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">18th July 2005, 07:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Technically nothing  wrong . (String variables can be upto 4000  characters and table fields upto 3072 characters). Possible reason to use it  may be powerful wild card search  engine  of Baan.<br />
<br />
Possible downside.<br />
1. U can not consider this in an index (index limits 120 bytes)<br />
2. If u use order by on this field with large selection criteria , database driver may not be able to handle the load. U can try this in query by form before putting to production.<br />
3. If  the average text keyed in the string is say 300 bytes , then there is waste of 1700 (2000-300)  bytes per records . However with decreasing hard disk costs , it may not be valid consideration.<br />
<br />
We have never tried  such a large string in the database.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In one of my customized program which is related to EDI Input (850S IN), I have used a string as follows:<br />
<br />
string  edi.record(4096)	|* Buffer to store the record of input file<br />
<br />
It works fine, when the lines in the EDI Input file are 25 or less. Nowadays we receive input files having more than 50 lines. What will be proper solution to this problem: <br />
<br />
1) Will increasing length of string to 10000 be a proper solution...?<br />
2) Please suggest any other solution best alternative if the above solution is not proper..?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
I am not clear about the issue, you have declared a string variable (single dimesion array) and you want to store multiple lines from a file in that, this is not logical. You should use a 2 dimensional array. Suppose if there 50 lines in the file of length 100 (approx) each, then declare a string like this <br />
<br />
string edi.record(100, 50) |* Buffer to store the record of input file<br />
<br />
and then use it. If this is not the issue then please give more details.<br />
<br />
