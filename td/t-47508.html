<br />
I want  to print  *.PLT files from Baan script. I have all the part numbers located in a particular folder and each plot file for the item is names partnumber.plt<br />
<br />
We are on windows server 2003. I am wondering if we can write a script and send the files to the windows printer or print queue through the script, without opening the file.  <br />
Please advise, if this can be done at all from Baan.<br />
Any pointers or same code would help.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

I could imagine that PLT files are simply files for a plotter and that they contain HPGL commands.<br />
<br />
In that case you could &quot;print&quot; these files directly on a plotter that implements that language.<br />
<br />
Printers such as HP Laserjets have a builtin emulation that can be activated by the so called PJL (printer hob language) commands -- as far as I remember but never tested this.<br />
<br />
There might also be software emulators that allow you convert PLT files to a format needed by your printers.<br />

<br />
I have one question about your PTL files. if you select the file and right click it, is there a &quot;print&quot; option in the menu? If yes I can guide you with a VB script that prints it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiddo1234</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 06:21</div></div><div class="posttext">These files are Engg CAD drawings. My question is if the plotter or a printer which supports PLT files is on the network , can we script thru baan to print the file.<br />
<br />
Say if the part number is ABC and the path were the files are located is say <br />
\\hqfs1\drawings, if I want to print the part ABC , I want to look at the path \\hqfs1\drawings\ABC.plt and print the file to the plotter or a printer  without opening the ABC.plt file. This process could be used for printing the drawings while printing the work orders instructions. <br />
<br />
George7a: I looked at the properties for the file(by right clicking it) and could<br />
              not find a print option. Thanks for trying and the welcome.<br />
<br />
Gunther: Thanks for the website wotsit.org, i didn't know about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any other ideas ?.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g端nther</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 08:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a running application that prints additional documents (postscript, coloured, lots of pages) right after a report from baan (and in such a way that the print jobs cannot be mixed with other documents). Maybe parts of that could be used for your problem. So I'll try to explain.<br />
<br />
1. You need to add something like the following code to your report:<br />
<br />
after.report:<br />
  additional.files.to.spooler()<br />
<br />
functions:<br />
<br />
function add.files.to.spooler()<br />
{<br />
  string buf(100)<br />
<br />
  buf = bc$(40, 10, &quot;\\hqfs1\drawings\ABC.plt&quot;)<br />
  spool.buf(buf, len(buf))<br />
}<br />
<br />
2. Create a shell script $BSE/lib/barcode/type40 -- 40 because of bc$(40, ...).<br />
<br />
#!/bin/sh<br />
echo &quot;`date`$0: $*&quot; &gt;&gt;$BSE/log/type40<br />
# You should see $1=File $2=Len<br />
# The rest is yours ...<br />
lp -d&lt;your printer&gt; $1<br />
<br />
exit 0<br />
3. Don't forget chmod 775 and chown bsp:bsp for this shell script.<br />

I would prompt for the report printer, prompt for the plotter to use(would just need to be defined in baan), then execute the lp -d command for the plot file.  I could do this in the report or in the session script.<br />
<br />
In the windows environment if you can type a command in the command window to print the drawing, then you should be able to execute that from baan.  Is there something you can run from the command prompt?  I am not really a windows cmd type person.  Even if you have to build a bat file to execute each time, it should be possible.</div></div><hr />
