I have tried in the past on Windows 7 and works without any issues. Please check your file permissions on the client machine for all the Baan folders. Provide full rights to Everyone and try again.</div></div><hr />

Please help me to resolve</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you can try, uninstall the fonts. Create new user profile on Windows 7, reinstall the fonts and try again. May be there is corruption in Registry.<br />
<br />
Also, as I said, check the file permissions on the baan folders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you preview a report, check if &quot;Use user specific settings&quot; option is unchecked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alerts</div><div class="date">6th August 2014, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I have re-installed fonts in registry. But still not linking with registry fonts. Once i have removed the font which is logo and mapped with arial font with italics at our location its working (ie mapped labels has arial with italics) but through their its not responding. Registry fonts are exported from our end to user because there is no fonts available in registry BwPrint so i exported from my pc. Is any other way to create Bwprint in their registry. when we install baan client then it should come automatically but at user it didn't, thats why exported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">6th August 2014, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had some strange effects some days ago when setting up a windows server printer. I changed one userfont to a large Arial font.<br />
I followed KB 954187 by the word but it didn't work. The changed font was still printed without any change (default fount and default size).<br />
<br />
So I searched inforxtrem.com again and found KB 1042513:<br />
<br />
---------------------------------<br />
Description: Custom fonts for BWPRINT.exe no longer appear when printing to a Windows Server Printer device type. <br />
<br />
VERSION(S): ERP LN<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: BWPRINT.EXE<br />
WINDOWS SERVER 2003<br />
WINDOWS SERVER 2008<br />
<br />
Resolution:<br />
Bwprint uses registry key “HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Baan\BwPrint\Fonts” instead of “ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Baan\BwPrint\Fonts”. <br />
To add a custom font for BWPRINT.EXE the font needs to be added to:<br />
HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Baan\BwPrint\Fonts&gt; on the machine where your windows server printer device is installed.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
The described workaround should not be necessary (compare KB 954187).<br />
---------------------------------<br />
<br />
I copied the font-settings manually with regedit from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT which did the trick for me. Printing now used the changed font settings.<br />
<br />
There's also KB 1130270 which may be involved, too. But I didn't look into that one.</div></div><hr />
