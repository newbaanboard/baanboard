      In Baan we have the option of &quot;Filter&quot; in &quot;View&quot; menu. When we apply some filter we get the icon of filter on the session (Please see the attached image for more clarification).<br />
      I want to have my customized icon after executing some function at the same place.<br />
<br />
      Is there any function by which I can achieve it.<br />
<br />
     Thanks in advance.<br />

Why do you have to change the standard tools icons? In LN, the icons are delivered as Additional Files unlike previous tools versions where they were all in $BSE/gif folder which can be replaced easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">15th October 2009, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no possibility to trigger an icon at that position. This is a pure tools feature related to filtering. <br />
You could use icons in the secondary tool bar. Or add a button in the view of your session. Those can be dis- and en-abled whenever you want.<br />

              Thanks a lot for your reply.<br />
<br />
I am not intrested in changing the standard tools icon. <br />
<br />
We have the form command on the multi occ session, which opens a new session. This session is just used to maintain the filter constraints, when I close it, those constraints are applied on the records and we get some selected records in the multi occ session.<br />
<br />
Now when this customized filter is been applied, I cant visually see and know whether the filter is been currentlly active or not. For this purpose I wanted the filter icon, as shown when the filter of tools is been applied.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for achieving some similar visual effects will be appreciated.<br />
<br />

So within the menu the user can see whether it is active. In the status bar the user can see as well that there is a filter active.<br />
<br />
This could be a solution for your situation as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th October 2009, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Couldn't you just put a field on the form that says Filter Set or Filter not set.  Something simple the user can see. <br />
<br />
There are other posts on the forum for doing things like drawing around a box, etc. that might help you - but I believe in the keep it simple method.</div></div><hr />

I think one example in our custom application code which does that you are trying to do. From the multi-occ session the single-occ session for filter is started and that uses put.var() commands to send back the selection criteria to be applied to the record set and there is a display field which shows the selections.</div></div><hr />

       Thanks a lot to all for your suggestions.<br />
<br />
I would prefer to display some message in the status bar which will display some message in case the filter is active.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Then you can use the tools function - status.mess() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_message_handling_status_mess)</div></div><hr />
