<br />
What I want to do is :<br />
1) Send the barcode of an order number to customer in pdf or label (from baan)<br />
2) customer prints barcode and sends back item with either the paper document or label we sent them<br />
3) Scan the barcode that has the Baan order number into a session, have the tab key automated so that the session brings up the order details (emulating the key strokes of entering the order number and tab key)<br />
<br />
This is what I am thinking<br />
Use barcode format 39 as it can be printed by Baan and windows on almost any modern printer, and supported by almost all hard wired scanners.<br />
Apply the tab code after the scanning by using the programming of a suffix with the gun.  Sound right ??<br />
<br />
Also I am thinking this will only work if a BW client is being used and not Citrix to start the BW ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd June 2015, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure about citrix - we never tried our scan guns with citrix.  But I do know it will work.  What we did was sent requirements to suppliers saying - when you ship us parts include these fields with barcodes.  I know it was more formal than that, but that is what I remember.  Anyway the part comes it we can item, quantity they enter a location - we then do the receipt, maintain approvals, and inbound for the customer. <br />
<br />
I know we have a client on citrix, but I do not think any of our shop personnel use it.  The process works, but I can't answer about citrix.<br />
<br />
You may also want to play with your scanner - it might read and work with other barcode types also.  Just gives you more options for your suppliers.  Plus you might want to give your baan version - others might have better solutions.</div></div><hr />
