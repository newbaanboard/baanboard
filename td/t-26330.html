Please make sure that the used include files belong to your portingset.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maggrietjie</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what gets to me, this report does not utilize any includes. And the library it does use, does not seem to be the cause of this problem. This is definitely not a variable that is used anywhere in the report.<br />
<br />
I am not sure how to proceed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you compile any reports or is this the only report with the problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maggrietjie</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 6 reports linked to this session and I am not able to compile any of them. But I am able to compile reports linked to sessions tfacp1436m000 and tfacp1435m000 without any errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Have any tools patches or porting set updates been applied?  On our system I can put a report in debug mode and see r.today$, but no r.todayl$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally variables/tables fields ending in l is a localized one (like BGL0). Just<br />
From the error it looks like a valid error, may be you got a script with bug in it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maggrietjie</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">No tools updates or updates to the porting set has been made. Yes, we do use Global Localization (BGLO). The problem is that I am not able to find this variable anywhere in the script for the report or any of the report fields. Thus I am not sure how to solve this problems. Any ideas of where to start will be appreciated. I have thought to redo the report field by field and line by line and then see if I still get the error. Perhaps if you can debug the report, and you can see the variable, then you can let me know what the domain should be and I can start working from there. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">One scenario to look for is, field is used in the layout, but nt defind in the report script nor in the input fields<br />
In this case you may end up with the error</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maggrietjie</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">This was my thought also at first, but I physically went through every field that is used in the layout of this report and this variable is nowhere to be found. It is nowhere in the layout, not any of the input fields and not anywhere in the report script. There are no include files used by the report script where this field could possibly show up. The report uses 1 library, but even after removing this library and all traces of it, I still get the error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I am still pretty sure that it has to do with the include files since the error sound so familiar with me. Perpaps you should log an inquiry with ssa and see what they turn up with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Try copying a standard report and compiling that.   This will show if it is your problem or standard Baan.  If the standard report will not compile, Baan Support should help.  If the standard one works, start from there to see what is wrong with yours.<br />
<br />
Edited:  I see that you can compile the standards.  Can you use a standard report that compiles, just to get your headings, then replace the layouts with your own...?  If you do that one by one you can see which layout has an issue (if any).</div></div><hr />
