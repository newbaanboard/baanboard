<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kogelman</div><div class="date">2nd June 2006, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a very simple report with only two details (10 and 20)<br />
<br />
On the layout we have set that both details will have to start on a new page.<br />
<br />
When we print a range the page-break fails on the first page. All the other pages are OK. Even when we put the page() function in the report-script we have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Does anybode now how to solve this ?<br />
<br />
So this is what we want :<br />
page 1 :<br />
   detail.10<br />
new page<br />
   detail.20<br />
new page<br />
detail.10 <br />
etc.<br />
<br />
This is how it goes :<br />
page 1 :<br />
   detail.10<br />
   detail.20<br />
new page<br />
   detail.10<br />
new.page<br />
   detail.20<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">2nd June 2006, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this on report side. Use double details for each one. For example:<br />
for detail 10 use detail10 and detail 11.<br />
for detial 20 use detial20 and detail 21.<br />
Do print operations on detail 10 and detail 20. Detail 11 and 21 will be null layout.It means that they don't write anything on report ( detail 11,21)<br />
for detail11 and detial21, needed line should be '0' .Otherwise it prints blanks for detail 11 and detail 21.<br />
<br />
In your report script:<br />
detail.10:<br />
after.layout:<br />
   PAGE() <br />
<br />
detail.20:<br />
after.layout:<br />
   PAGE() <br />
<br />
This is quick way  otherwise check your printing structure. Where do you use Page command. Try my suggestion.<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have just tested the same on my system (Baan 5.0B), and it works perfectly. My test scenario:<br />
- Created a session printing areas (tcmcs045.creg)<br />
- Report has no headers, no footers, etc. Just two detail layouts, detail.1 and detail.2. Detail.1 prints the area code, detail.2 prints the area code description. Both have the 'page' field selected. No report script. Output is correct...<br />
<br />
So maybe you give us some more details about the data in the report, and maybe your code (program/report script) and a dump of the report setup, so we can maybe help finding the problem...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kogelman</div><div class="date">6th June 2006, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot to say that the problem occurs in Baan IV and not in Ln.<br />
<br />
Indeed it's a simple report with only 2 details. Only the first record fails. The 2 details are printed on the same page. For all other records every detail is printed on a separate page as it should be.</div></div><hr />

As mentioned, I tested this on Baan 5.0B (Grieg), not on LN.. Since I do not have a Baan IV environment, I cannot test there... Maybe someone else will do a small test for you, to see if this is a problem by Baan IV standard, or that it has to do with your report...</div></div><hr />

Tested on my system on a report I am working.  It does exactly what Kogelman stated.  I tried a couple of the suggestions and it did not solve the problem.   It appears in debug mode for the first record the r.page.cmd() does not do anything.  What I did was duplicate my layout two more times.  I tried with and without a header layout, a before.report layout, etc.  all with page checked off.  It does not start working until one pass through all of the layouts.  Have to finish the real report now, but will play with it a little later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th June 2006, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">One question is page number part of your layouts?  If not try this - (1) Create a before.report.1 layout.  Leave it empty.  Then create a report script and insert this code:<br />
<br />
before.report.1:<br />
after.layout:<br />
	if lattr.pageno &lt;= 1 then<br />
		lattr.pageno = lattr.pageno + 1<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
What should happen is if you system works like mine is you get a blank page - then all the layouts print correctly.  It throws off the page numbers and leaves you with a blank page.  I tried several variations - checking page, setting lattr.  Also setting lattr.pageno to 2 works in this code, but if you set it to 1 it has the same problem.<br />
<br />
I do recommend that you report this to Baan - there might be a tools patch for the problem.  At the same time I think our admin just recently told me we were current.</div></div><hr />
