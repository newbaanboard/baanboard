thus far I have sent:<br />

on the expect send command and nothing gets me to the secondary window where I can select batches for Finialization.<br />

I am running out of ideas so if someone can point me towards a possible solution I would be grateful.<br />

I can't offer any help there, but have you looked at using AFS (there is a discussion group about it here on BAANBOARD).  With AFS, you can code a new session in such a way that it 'controls' existing sessions (eg: fills fields, presses contine, saves records...)<br />
<br />
Just a thought.<br />

I am not a baan programmer :)  and we do not have one on staff. I am using Unix scripting since this is something I know and understand (or did at one time in my life).<br />
<br />
I am not sure if AFS requires access to the Baan source code. If yes, then it is not a solution since we do not have source code.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 23:28</div></div><div class="posttext">That is the beauty of AFS, it can 'run' any BAAN session without the source code.   You just supply the values to fill in the fields and let it go.  I was amazed the first time I tried it.<br />
<br />
Now if you are not a programmer at all, that is a problem as it will first require basic BAAN programming skills.  Now, there are SO many BAAN programmers out there begging for work that you should have no problem finding someone who will do this as a one or two day project.<br />

<br />
I have been sucessful in controlling PCF by tcl/tk and expect, and I can understand that you don't want to check AFS. It won't be that easy as it sounds ...<br />
<br />
Just a thought: Control-Z might be the character that lets you put a running process in background; try &quot;$ stty -a&quot;, if you see &quot;susp = ^Z&quot; you should change that character.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
