Here's a fun one.  I am working on an integration that creates change data capture based on Baan IV history records.  The question of timezone has come up.  So the client system wants to see any net changes since a watermark it sends me.  That watermark is based on the latest date I last sent them.  Because Baan IV stores date and time separately, I'm wondering what happens when the system time converts back from daylight savings to regular (EDT to EST)?  At 2:01 does it go back an hour and start storing times earlier than 5 minutes ago?  We want to be sure not to miss changes that occur during that hour window.  For example, the last watermark I am supplied is:<br />
2021-11-10T01:59:59<br />
records were created and stored in history after that, but they will show that the time was actually 01:01:00 (for example)<br />
Doesn't the history get out of order?  Or does that get accounted for somehow?  Are the date / time conversion functions available for Baan IV actually applying the offset from GMT and these date/times are stored without the offset in GMT?</div></div><hr />

But on our 4c4 I never really had to mess with times like what you described.  Hopefully someone can confirm this for you.</div></div><hr />

Yes from everything I can see this is a danger.  I think that maybe the best we can hope for is to recognize that the shift back from daylight savings has occurred and possibly send some records a second time over that hour.  We always go to the &quot;live&quot; record to get current values, so hopefully not going to run into anything bad.</div></div><hr />
