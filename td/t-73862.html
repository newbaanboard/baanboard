<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">28th May 2021, 02:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Got a question on 'cloud-ready' method of development. That is ... developing in such a way so the development can seemlessly ported to cloud hosted environment without reqork. I was told that if a new session is developed, calling standard dll libraries in LN is not ok. And that if I must, I can duplicate the dll to a custom VRC and then there are many dlls that will call more dlls. This sounded primitive for me. So, thought I will post this question here. What really constitutes cloud-ready way of development and constraints. Environment: LN 10.7 On premise for now. <br />
<br />
I was also told AFS wont work in cloud<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">31st May 2021, 08:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to the Infor LN Extensions Development Guide which explains it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">1st June 2021, 17:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks... The guide does not say that I cannot make a function to a standard dll. <br />
Moreover, I could be developing a session in a customization package and may want to call standard dll functions. will they work when the move to cloud happens? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">1st June 2021, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">A new session is also seen as an extension. In cloud-ready extensions you cannot call the standard DLL functions, only Public Interfaces. Quote from the guide: Functions in LN Application DLLs, even if declared as extern, are untrusted by default. A new specific trusted layer is available with functions that can be used by extensions. The trusted LN Application functions are called “Public Interfaces”. See also KB 2003722 in the Infor Support Portal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">2nd June 2021, 23:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot. Maybe I got trumped by terminology.  Now I get the picture. Such functions are available in Infor M3. Usually such functions there are available by key sessions - Sessionname - API name - Functions - Input Parameters - Output parameters; If they can do it for LN, it would be nice but then it can take a long time. Even then, for example, if I want to convert an amount, i can now simply call tcemm.dll5010.translate.amount( but this is not session specific but generic. I hope they provide APIs for such dlls as well. Many thanks for the information!<br />
<br />
Long back, in BaanIVc4, I used to generate AFS DLLs using ttstpcreatdll ; I see the session is still there. It nicely creates functions. If we can get Baan sessions with information, like they have in M3, on such 'Public Libraries' It will be easy to understand and use. Moreover if there can be a test tool for such libraries where you can input and see expected output, supreb! I can post some photos from M3 just to give an idea in couple of days when I will get access!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Public Interface Common.ConvertAmount() is available. See the guide that is linked to KB 2003722.</div></div><hr />
