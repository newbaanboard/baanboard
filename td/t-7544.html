Word &amp; Excel can be launched from BaaN.<br />
But, I would like to open a particular document from BaaN IV, either from DEM, or using hyper link, or anything.<br />
Any ideas...</div></div><hr />

You could create a simple session that when started it runs app_start for the specified document.  <br />

Thanks for the post. I got what I wanted to.<br />
But, is there a possibility of passing the arguments from the form (by the user), to the script. Like, the user passes the path of the application (word, excel, etc.), and also the path of that specific file, to be opened!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th November 2002, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really sure I understand what you are asking. I usually use domains or tables to hold where applications are.  For example I have an Excel device driver that when the user selects the device requires them to enter a filename.  Based on the filename I know what macro to launch and which version of excel to launch. We have two sites with Excel installed in different places and different servers.  So I think you can do what you are asking, but I am not positive if I understand what you are trying to do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">11th November 2002, 07:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
This is what I am looking for -<br />
I'll be creating a session. The users, when execute that session, will be asked about the application to be launched, with the complete path. Then they will be asked about the file to be opened in that application, that again with the complete path. These two arguments, I plan to pass to app_start().<br />
Here I am not concerned with the device.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th November 2002, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">The device was just an example.  The one thing I do on sessions is to ask for the complete path with the files.  So for example M:\somefile would work.  So in your session you could either ask them for the complete path and application.  OR you could create an enumerated domain that would list each application that could be launched.  As for the file I would always ask for the complete path and the filename.<br />
<br />
So I think from what you are looking for the answer is yes you can use parameters.  If you check the code and utilities forum you will see some samples of the app_start command.  Just remember that they are just samples and not the only use of them.<br />
<br />
Hope I helped.<br />
