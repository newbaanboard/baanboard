             I have to link a form which is currently in English language to Italian. I have given language 6 in the option &quot;LINK TO LANG&quot; in the form but am getting an error showing &quot;Form not present in language 6&quot;. Kindly resolve this query.<br />

You will probably need to wait for some who actually works with different languages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">9th December 2010, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understood:<br />
<br />
Form design is in language 2.<br />
<br />
You just want to show italian language data (e.g. label).<br />
<br />
2&lt;-6 : Form in language 6 needs entry in field &quot;link to language&quot;: 2<br />
<br />
(1) Please use the &quot;Translation&quot; module of BaaN IV:<br />
<br />
Here you can use &quot;Copy language dependent Software components&quot;, source language is &quot;2&quot; (english), target language is &quot;6&quot; (italian), select option &quot;Forms&quot;, on form 2 you have to specify the correct form number (from/to), please be carefull otherwise you copy the whole stuff to language 6.<br />
<br />
Option &quot;..link to source language ...&quot; shoud be selected. (don't remember the exact label ... it is the first or second option.<br />
<br />
The Tranlsation module is a complete Infrastructure to maintain your software in an multilanguage environment. Interesting to see which components are languagedependent.<br />
<br />
There is very good documentation (at least for this feature) for the Translation topic with about 100 pages from infor.<br />
<br />
(2) Easier and safer way:<br />
<br />
Just create the form with the formnumber from language 2 in language 6, save it and then enter &quot;2&quot; in the field &quot;link to language&quot;, dump it -&gt; finished. (similar to what mark wrote)<br />
<br />

                        I tried to copy the form from English to Italian using the option Copy to language, so the form got copied to Italian, then I linked the form to language 2. At last I changed the user language from user set up and converted to runtime. After that I can able to run the sessions in Italian. <br />
<br />
The problem in using Option &quot;Copy language dependent Software components&quot; is it will copy all the components in the current PVRC, so it is not feasible for me at this instance, since I need to copy some 5 forms only.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your valuable inputs Mark &amp; Kozure. It was really helpful in solving the query.:o<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
