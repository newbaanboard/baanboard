Hello Mathew,<br />
i've done something like this for managment reports in BIV.<br />
<br />
E.g.:<br />
<br />
<br />
if spool.report=&quot;r........&quot; and logname$ = &quot;user1&quot; or logname$ = &quot;user2&quot; ..... then<br />
    rprt_send()<br />
else<br />
    message(&quot;No rights for report !&quot;)<br />
    rprt_close()<br />
    abort()<br />
endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Clone just the session and then delete off the new session the reports you do not want the user to have.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand what are you told pa.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th June 2012, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is an example - not real, but I think it will illustrate my point.  Lets say I have a capacity reporting session that provides 5 reports.  The first 3 only provide remaining hours on a work order range, the last two reports not only include remaining hours, but also remaining budget hours.  Now lets say a requirement was - shopfloor employees can only see hours not budget dollars.  Now I could do what you all mentioned and only let shopfloor employee's run the first 3 reports using logname$ - but we have 300 shopfloor employee's.  It would not be practical to do that using logname$. So what I would do is go into ttadv2100m000(Maintain Sessions).  I would copy the original session(lets call it ticst9401m000) to a new session(lets call it ticst9402m000).  I would not copy the script, the form or the reports.  Then on ticst9402m000 I would click on the reports button - delete from the session the last two reports.  Now the new session ticst9402m000 is ready for the users - uses the same script, same reports and same form.  After this I go and grant the shopfloor employees access to the new session.  <br />
<br />
This would be easier than maintaining a lot of logname$ - a few users is okay. But in this case you can have shopfloor employees coming and going all the time.  Easier just to grant the session to the specific users - or if using DEMs(like us) just grant it to a shopfloor role or to an all users reporting role. The session does look kind of weird with a script of ticst9401 and with reports that start with ticst9401, but you get use to it.</div></div><hr />
