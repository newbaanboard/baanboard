&quot;Maintain Sales Order Lines&quot; I can not refresh the data.<br />
<br />
When I cancel a transportationorder, which is connected to a salesorder, it would be handy if I can just refresh, so I do not have to exit the session first before I can delete the orderline.<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me how I can make the refresh-option active again?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance!<br />

PS<br />
I do not have the script to the session itself so I would need to do it without prgramming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the Refresh Option 'Greyed Out', or is it selectable but nothing happens...<br />
<br />
If it' greyed out, then the option on the form changes this (unless it is then deactivated in the script, but this is very unlikely).  If you have the Refresh standard option checked in Maintain Forms, as you say, maybe you need to dump the form?  You may be holding a current version of the form open already, so maybe try exit Baan and come back?  You may not be viewing the VRC that you changed..?<br />
<br />
Let us know if it progresses.<br />
<br />
Also, you would not have to exit the session without the refresh to refresh the screen - try Next then Previous records.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dleijdekkers</div><div class="date">5th March 2004, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Is is indeed 'Greyed Out'.<br />
The form consists of 2 parts, the orderlines &quot;tdsls4503s000&quot; and tdsls4102s000<br />
But even turning all the standard options on in &quot;maintain Forms&quot; on both form doesn't make it useable.<br />
<br />
So if I do understand you correctly it most be turned of in the script.<br />
That is too bad.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the info.<br />

<br />
I think maybe something else...our tdsls4102s000 has refresh available.   We have several versions of Baan IV, I checked to be sure, and I don't see why the refresh would be disabled, that would be pretty unusual.<br />
<br />
At one point, you said 'how do we get the refresh active again'....was it active at one point?<br />
<br />
I am assuming since you have played with the options that you have a custom form.  You can try a couple things.<br />
<br />
1.  Make a visible change to your custom form.  Dump the form.  Do you see your change?  This will tell if you are converting / seeing the changes you make.  If not, the issue is there, not in your change.  Check the VRC and shared memory possibilities.<br />
<br />
2. If you do see your change, but still not the refresh, try removing that form (copy to a different name), exit Baan and return.  You should be seeing the standard form, yes?   No longer your changes?  Is the refresh active?  That will tell us if it is active in your base version.</div></div><hr />

I haven't been at work, but now I did try your remarks.<br />
Strangely enough deleting all the forms on the different layers except for the standard c4 layer, did not make any change.<br />
Neither when I copied the c4 layer to our own-layer.<br />
<br />
Though after repositioning a field on the form the refresh-option became active.<br />
I am not sure why, but your approach def. worked.<br />
So thank you very much!<br />
<br />
THANKS!!<br />
