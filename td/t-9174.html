<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jholdrid</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been asked to create a session which zeroes out un-matched Supplier Receipts older than 3 months.  We, due to the nature of our materials, receive more than we are invoiced for. <br />
<br />
Management would alike this new session to perform as if it was APM transaction which was done manually.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done something Similar ? - Is it possible to do this with API functionality ? <br />
<br />
Please advise<br />
Thanks for any help here.<br />

If that is the case, then yes you probably could use the API type function servers to clean them up.  I use the word probably because some sessions do not always function properly when using API calls.  In some cases having the source code would be helpful. <br />
