<br />
A user has created a seagate report, which also displays baan text.<br />
<br />
Most of the text displays as it should with a line length of 70 characters.  There is the odd record, which has its text displayed strangely.  If it is reported via baan, there is no problem and everything lines up as it should with all lines displayed.<br />
<br />
When checking the text record in tttxt010, only two very long lines are stored.  Would the solution be to write a function which would read the text after creation and check if there is anything but spaces after character 70 and then re-organise the text to be stored in separate 70 character lines ?<br />
<br />
Or is there something more simple that I am missing?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

A driver configuration file called &quot;p2sbaan.cfg&quot; is located under C:\WINNT\crystal\baan\config&quot; (WINNT if you have NT or 2000). In this file are TEXT settings you can modify:<br />
<br />
[STANDARD_SETTINGS]<br />
.....<br />
.....<br />
.....<br />
.....<br />
.....<br />
TRIM_TEXT_FIELD_LEFT=NO<br />
TRIM_TEXT_FIELD_RIGHT=NO<br />
<br />
You can try setting them to YES and see if that helps, or try what you preposed. The only thing with setting these is that it applies this to all reports.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
tttxt010 is a table that contains compressed text and includes control characters of different type (related to text positioning). In the baan report automatic conversion takes place and the user does not have to bother about the table tttxt010. <br />
<br />
If you are using an external reporting tool, you would have to make the conversion yourself. The Baan programming language gives you the functions &quot;text.read&quot; or &quot;text.to.buf&quot; to help you with that. <br />
<br />
I would not try to change tttxt010, you most probably will observe undesired side-effects in your Baan reports.<br />
