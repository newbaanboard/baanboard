<br />
What´s the main difference between Windows and Unix?.<br />
<br />
What i have to do?, I just changed the device for the report but no barcode is printed at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">11th January 2008, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
these info are coming from the baan quick guide qg1307. I updated it with some result<br />
First Baan has done this for HP printer with barcode cardridge but this is no more required as many printers have barcode printing capabilities<br />
<br />
&quot;	$BSE/lib/barcode/hp_barcode/type01  a Bourne shell Unix script that contains the specific escape codes to enable the correct printing of barcode data.  This is executed by Baans print routines.<br />
	$BSE/lib/printinf/h/hp_lj4  the Baan print driver for the HP Laserjet 4 printer.<br />
<br />
Setup:<br />
Before doing the customizations, the following setup needs to be done:<br />
<br />
Ensure the print cartridge is installed in the printer as per the manufacturers instructions.&quot;<br />
OR that you printer has barcode printing capabilities (via some specific escape sequence or equivalent)<br />
<br />
&quot;	Ensure that the file $BSE/lib/printinf/h/hp_lj4 is modified to reference the hp_barcode directory appropriately.  For example, change the reference barcode_dir=hp, to barcode_dir=hp_barcode,.<br />
<br />
	Ensure that the permissions on $BSE/lib/barcode/hp_barcode and its files are sufficient.  For most installs, the permissions need to be opened up on the directory and/or its files.  If, once the customization is done, the output is not being processed by the printer, check the file $BSE/log/log.filterx.x (where x.x is your tools versioni.e. filter6.1). &quot; <br />
The file typexx where xx = 01 to 99 needs to be executable by the baan users<br />
<br />
.  Once in the report layout, find the desired field, and use control-f to maintain it.  When maintaining it, you will need to change the form so that the barcode field now has a valid barcode selection (i.e. 1).  This number maps to the file in $BSE/lib/barcode/hp_barcode/type01.  If you had used 2, the mapping would be $BSE/lib/barcode/hp_barcode/type02.  In our example, we will stick to 1, since type01 is the only file delivered with the Baan product<br />
<br />
<br />
Look in the $BSE/lib/barcode  library fo an example : <br />
You need to known the escape sequence needed to activate the barcode in your printer. these escape sequence are commonly a start sequence and a end sequence . Look in the type01 on your baan system for more details.<br />
<br />
I attach another example (type09) for kyocera printer (attached as type09.txt ). Typexx is a shell script and the variable $1 is the field that needs to be printed as barcode<br />

Look at www.stethos.com. Works fine for us.<br />

<br />
   I know this is a very old thread but I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me out here. I used the type09 file provided by Philippe (pconde) to print type 39 barcodes (BARC 19 in Prescribe) on a unix printer. It works fine except when I have to print a field that already has a '$' sign in it.<br />
<br />
   If the field is '$123456', the barcode comes out as '23456' i.e. it seems to be treating the $ sign as a variable ($1 in this case). According to the Prescribe language manual, BARC 19 allows a $ sign to be printed in barcode.<br />
<br />
   The same report prints fine if I send the report to a windows printer (Kyocera). <br />
<br />
   What do I need to change in the type09 file to allow a $ sign to be printed?<br />
<br />
   I have attached my modified type09.<br />
<br />
   Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

If I remember correctly this is due to the fact that it's printed by a unix shell script. Change the content of the field that contains the barcode so that a backslash is added in front of the $ sign.<br />

<br />
  Thanks for the reply. Will it be possible to change the type09 file itself to add the \ or should it be done at the driver (hp_lj4, hp_lj4_lndsc etc.) ?<br />
<br />
  Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I'm not a shell guru but in unix standard substitute of string 1 by string2 is done via <br />
echo $1 | sed 's/string1/string2/'<br />
but echo $1<br />
echo '$1'<br />
echo &quot;$1&quot;  give everytime &quot;2345&quot; if you start from &quot;$12345&quot; :mad:<br />
<br />
I think that the best solution is substituting in the baan script.<br />

<br />
   Yes, after unsuccessfully struggling to change the driver file or the font file, I resorted to changing it in the report script. Only issue with this is that every report has to be modified. Oh well...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
