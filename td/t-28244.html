<br />
we are using Reports to write html files (which we send in an e-mail later).<br />
What happens is that the files created by the report are open a long time (up to some hours or days, which can be seen by the difference between creation and modification date), and it seems that the data is overwritten.<br />
So, we found equal contents in two files, of which the fist one was 5 minutes elder than the second one. The first file held the same content as the second file. From my opinion, the first file was overwritten by the second (despite the second file was created, too.)<br />
Did anyone experience problems like that?<br />

Can you be a bit more specific. Please also post your code and 1 or 2 examples, so we will be able to understand you better...</div></div><hr />
