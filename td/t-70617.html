<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pralash</div><div class="date">24th November 2017, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
I'm new for LN Programming... I have created a before.field layout as shown in the attachment(1.png)... And my programming script is as follows...<br />
<br />
select  distinct tctls903.user<br />
			from tctls903<br />
			where tctls903._index1 <br />
                        inrange {:logg.first} and {:logg.t.change}<br />
			selectdo<br />
				message(tctls903.user) <br />
                               |Here I got the user name but it's not sending to the report<br />
				rprt_send()	<br />
			endselect<br />
<br />
My before.field layout is attached as shown(3.png)....<br />
<br />
My report script is as follows...<br />
before.check.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
if tot.log.detail = tcyesno.yes then<br />
lattr.print = true<br />
else<br />
lattr.print = false<br />
endif<br />
<br />
While execute the script, I can displayed the distinct users with in the given range, but I got the last user name in the report instead of getting all user names... So how can I get the all user names in the report....<br />
Please let me know that how to fix this issue...<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Regards,<br />

Thanks so much for your reply...<br />
As you suggested, I already add the tctls903.user as a report input filed. But I can get the last row only in the report. At the same time, I can get print all records those are not send to the report....<br />
Can you please give my any ideas to fix this issue...<br />

<br />
think the problem is layout before.check.1<br />
<br />
The field tctls903.user is part of that layout, but the before field layout will only be printed when the value of the field check changes.<br />
So if field check always has the same value the layout is only printed once.<br />
<br />
