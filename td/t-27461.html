If a table has a field amount which can hold both negative and postive amount and if i want to select the absolute amount, how i can achieve the same.<br />
<br />
For example, a table containing two records and amount for 1st record is -100 and for the second record is 300  <br />
<br />
If i use the select sum(amount) from table, i will get the output as 200 and if i want to get an output of 400, what comamnd will work? (ie) sum of absolute values (100 and 300)<br />
<br />
One way is to have a temporary table and hold the absolute values.  If any one has tried with a query in Baan, it will really help.  Any help is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
At the oracle level sum(abs(amount)) gives the output, but Baan gives the compilation error for the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You can try :<br />
<br />
The firsth step : abs(amount)<br />
The second step: in selectdo selection put sum(amount) (in this moment only considered amount like the value absolute  )<br />
<br />
the operation sum and abs considered in 2 steps<br />

You can also have two different select queries, the first query will sum only the positive values and the second one will sum the negative values(put the necessary condition in where clause).<br />
Then take the abs() value of negative total and add it to the positive value.<br />
<br />
The reason i'm advocating the use of two selects is, rather than summing the amounts in selectdo, I would prefer the database do the sum itself which will be much faster.<br />
<br />
However my solution hold true if you are selecting the records with a index fully mapped. If you cannot use the index then its better to total in selectdo as suggested by &quot;gruizc&quot; since we cant afford to sleect the same records again.<br />

reply back with your comments.<br />
