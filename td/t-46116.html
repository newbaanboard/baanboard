I have a report with different sections.<br />
I need to send specific data to different sections.<br />
But if i just call the rprt_send(), it puts blank rows on all sections.<br />
<br />
Anybody have dealed with this before?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th December 2007, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">First you need to use rprt_send or brp.ready to send the record to the report.  If your report has different layouts then you can use a variable and the print expression to determine which layout gets printed.  One example is to have different layouts based off the data - in this case each record is sent with a variable that is used in the print expression.  I typically use k.of.data as the variable.  So I can have two layouts one for tisfc001 and one for tipgc510(planned GRP orders). So when I print tisfc records I set k.of.data to 1 and when I print  tipgc records I set k.of.data to 2.  I then use print expression k.of.data = 1 on the tisfc layout and k.of.data = 2 on the tipgc layout. <br />
<br />
Another method to print different records or data types is to create a report string field, then use sprintf to fill the report buffer.  Then that is all you send to the report and you only have 1 layout.<br />
<br />
So I do not know if this answers your question or not.  Of course more details on what you are asking might make a difference on the answer.</div></div><hr />

Sounds interesting your answer. Perhaps it works for me.<br />
Let me explain what I want to do in detail:<br />
I have a session that search the payment for a range of invoices:<br />
Payment          Invoice            Total Amount        Total Tax<br />
400-1000012    201-10000123        1000                 100<br />
400-1000013    201-10000122        2000                 150<br />
400-1000014    200-10000125        2500                 175<br />
<br />
then I have another table that contains payments in transit.<br />
Payment         Invoice            Pay date<br />
400-1000013   201-10000122        0<br />
<br />
So in my report I want to separate what payments in transit. So I need something like this:<br />
Section 1<br />
Payment          Invoice            Total Amount        Total Tax<br />
400-1000012    201-10000123      1000                  100<br />
400-1000014    200-10000125      2500                  175<br />
<br />
Section 2<br />
In transit Payments   <br />
400-1000013    201-10000122        2000                 150<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st December 2007, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">It should work, just keep in mind if you do sorting on the report that you need to be able to get the records in the correct order.  <br />
<br />
Something else I do is to use report fields for different layouts for totaling a field.  So for example if the in transit payments come from a different table I use something like rpt.amnt and rpt.tax. Then before each rprt_send() I set the rpt.amnt and rpt.tax to the table fields.  This way in the report in a after.field section I can just use total for rpt.amnt and rpt.tax.</div></div><hr />

A final question.<br />
when you say that use a variable to print on different sections, I assume that I have to put it on the report layout?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st December 2007, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">For totaling yes I always put the variable on both layouts, but in all honesty I do not know if it is required.  I do not think it is required to be printed, but I do not recall trying that.<br />
<br />
As for the k.of.data that does not need to be printed - it will only be used on the output expression of the layout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">22nd December 2007, 06:04</div></div><div class="posttext">All input variables in the report will be available in all sections of detail layout  with value in corresponding rprt_send() .<br />
<br />
In after field normally sort fields  and accumulator fields only makes sense and are available accurately .Other input fields will still be available in after.field section but it will correspond to the last rprt_send corrseponding to the sort fields in the sort order. So it may or may not be  correct depending on reporting logic.<br />
<br />
Variables declared in report script  are not changed for each rprt_send() . U can import the values from program script with import function .</div></div><hr />
