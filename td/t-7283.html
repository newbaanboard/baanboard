<br />
          I am giving below one of my users requirement. <br />
<br />
   Our BaaN set up is BaaN 4c4, OS is Unix and windows client.<br />
<br />
   We have one customised update session inwhich there are<br />
  around 20 fields. If any of the field contains the value &quot;1&quot; then<br />
  no updation is allowed. I did this also (attr.input = false ).<br />
<br />
   What the user wants is, if the field value is &quot;1&quot; ( can not be <br />
  updated )  then the color of the field should be different from<br />
  other fields.<br />
<br />
  In short, I need to change the color of the field at runtime.<br />
<br />
  Any possibilities ?<br />
<br />
<br />
 Best Regards<br />
<br />
 Saravanan</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not possible to change the color of a label or form field via Baan programming language when the BW Client is being used in Baan IV &amp; BaanERP 5.0b/c.  The next version of Baan (code named &quot;Gemini&quot;) will have this functionality.<br />
<br />
Your alternatives at this point include:<br />
*  Use BA (Baan ASCII) interface.<br />
*  Display a graphic (such as a red checkmark or similar) next to the form field when your condition is met.<br />
*  Diplay another form-field message (such as &quot;NOTICE!!!!&quot;) next to the indicated field when the condition is met.<br />

<br />
I have been searching various threads/posts to find a solution for my requirement, but have not found any specific answer...<br />
<br />
my requirement:<br />
<br />
On a multiocurrance form (with view field), if the available stock is less, I need to highlight that particular occurence. i.e. say make the whole row red, or make the available stock field red...etc.<br />
<br />
Baan has a predefined variable attr.color<br />
<br />
attr.color            R/W  color of current field<br />
                            The following colors are available:<br />
                                 0 -  CW.BLACK<br />
                                 1 -  CW.RED<br />
                                 2 -  CW.GREEN<br />
                                 3 -  CW.YELLOW<br />
                                 4 -  CW.BLUE<br />
                                 5 -  CW.MAGENTA<br />
                                 6 -  CW.CYAN<br />
                                 7 -  CW.WHITE<br />
                                 8 -  CW.GRAY<br />
<br />
how and where is this used. Can this be used to fulfill my requirement ?<br />
<br />
Also want to know how to use create.object() on a multiocc form, to answer my requirement ? (codes would be helpful)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any suggestions ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th February 2007, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I could never get the colors to work and I did not want to do all the work or coding required with create.object(would have actually had to figure it all out).  What I did for my user was to put another field on the multioccurence form.  When a condition was met it would put an &quot;*&quot; next to the field.  This way they knew which records they needed to address.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vineetu1</div><div class="date">13th February 2007, 09:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Actually I have already incorporated the concept of printing &quot;*&quot; to highlight any particular row.<br />
<br />
It's just that colour would be more colourful ??? ;) <br />
What do u say ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th February 2007, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The only other thing I can think of is to use create.object like NPR suggests. Or you can try this (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=16616&amp;highlight=color+form).  Maybe just draw a red or blue square on the session where you want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vineetu1</div><div class="date">14th February 2007, 08:01</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case, how can I achieve,<br />
<br />
1) Print multiple objects for various occurance. For this how do i get the appropriate co-ordinates.<br />
<br />
2) How to print the box-object which is transperent or translucent so that if it overlaps any existing field the underlying field is visible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th February 2007, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for #1 you would have to map them out so as the user scrolled the boxes or such would move with the record.  As for #2 I really do not know - the only thing I can recommend is reading on create.object and all of its options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">14th February 2007, 22:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Vineet,<br />
<br />
Refer to the link - change.sub.object (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_user_interface_objects_change_sub_object)<br />
<br />
Also note - <br />
Deprecated. This function is only supported for Baan Windows and its usage is therefore deprecated.<br />
<br />
You have to make a cost-benefit analysis if this requirement is critical for you or just a fancy desired feature.<br />
<br />
All these functions will not be compatible in WebTop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">15th February 2007, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the next best thing to color: <br />
<br />
<br />
field.field:<br />
before.display:<br />
        if  field = 1<br />
        then<br />
            attr.cf = ATTR.CF.NORMAL<br />
        else<br />
            attr.cf = ATTR.CF.REVERSE<br />
        endif<br />
<br />
<br />
You can replace the &quot;if field = 1&quot; with whatever applies to your situation.<br />
<br />
It should have the visual impact you are trying to achieve, but, unfortunately, no colors.</div></div><hr />

attr.cf = ATTR.CF.NORMAL &amp; attr.cf = ATTR.CF.REVERSE<br />

valid and applicable in Baan IV C4. I Ttried it but it does not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st February 2007, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Please add the following defines at suitable place in the code:<br />

Pourquoi pas dessiner devant les champs Ã  remplir un object qui change de couleur suivant la valeur.</div></div><hr />

My suggestion is to draw a object before each field and update the color of the field following the value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">23rd March 2007, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I am trying to also show fields in a specific way conditionally (based on their value). Preferebly I would like to change the color, if colour cannot be changed (without programming the whole form with 25 fields in 3GL using create.object(), which is crazy work), at least I would like some other way of marking, a bit less old fashioned than adding '*' or so next to the fields.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, my form has approx. 25 fields, and all fields should change conditionally, so I do not want to start programming x,Y positions of color objects next to each field....<br />
<br />
I tried using attr.color and attr.cf, however, unfortunately it does not seem to have any effect...<br />
<br />
Any input would be highly appreciated!<br />

I remember having used successfully  attr.cf = 4 (for reverse font) . Have u tried that.</div></div><hr />

Making fonts bold does not work (attr.cf = 1 and others ) . <br />
<br />
Attr.color and attr.cf works completely only in BA interface (which of course very few would have it ) .</div></div><hr />
