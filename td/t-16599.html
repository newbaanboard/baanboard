<br />
I am facing a problem. I made some changes in the default values of the user for text groups and then try to convert to run time DD. The process &quot;convert to RDD&quot; run for many hours without giving any error, it seems that the process get stucked some how. What could be the reason and resolution?<br />
<br />
One more thing, I installed tools patches for &quot;tools 7.1&quot; on another machine, and when try to create the tables, process ran for many hours without giving any error and seems stucked, doing nothing. Any idea, what could be the resolution? Is there any installion log file that written by Baan during the installation process to see what installed and what not with problem description?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />

We ran into something like that just recently and I am not sure how they re-solved the issue.  Our app admin handled the problem.<br />

During the process of runtime, the system creates files in the &quot;tmp&quot; directory. Please do check these files. It may contain some information.<br />
