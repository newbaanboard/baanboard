<br />
We donot want the users to change the company so we took out the session autorizations from ttdsk0203m000( Change COmpany Session). But we want them to be able to execute any display and print sessions ( Standard Baan Sessions also we do not have the source code).<br />
<br />
With all this complications how do I achieve this.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th March 2002, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Right off hand I can not think of a way to do this the way you have discussed.  One thing we did was to give them all the sessions they needed in the production company and then only print and display sessions in our simulation company.  We left them with the change company option, and then used session authorizations to control what the could run. This option is reserved for only a select group of users.<br />
<br />
Another thing we thought about was making them log into which company they wanted.  But the users scrapped this idea.  <br />

<br />
I found the workaround, as follows.<br />
<br />
1.A create dummy user that has autorization in company A.<br />
2. using bw configurations a profile for user dummy is created as dummy.bwc. <br />
3. create a session for all the users in Comp B, that invokes bw.exe using app_start function with the dummy.bwc as the parameter. also pass the name of the session that needs to be executed in company A.<br />
<br />
without even the users realising the bw is executed and gets straight into the perticular baan session. and every one is happy.<br />
<br />
the only drawback I see could be the licences, everyhtime they run this session they use a licence, but we even have the control of terminating the session if its idle for more than certain period using session_timeout parameter.<br />
<br />
this really worked for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for sharing the ideas, if anyone has any ideas or questions please do not hesitate to post.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I think you can solve your problem doing this:<br />
<br />
1.- Create a customized session called &quot;Execute session in company B&quot;<br />
2.- This session has only one entry field: session to execute<br />
3.- The session has a choice cont.process that execute code I write in step 5<br />
4.- This step is to test that session introduced is a display or print session. If not do not let user to execute step 5. You can put a zoom to this field to session display sessions (for example)<br />
5.- This two lines to execute session in company B from company A:<br />
<br />
   switch.to.company(B)<br />
   wait.and.activate(session)<br />
<br />
And that's all. Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

-- -set PACKAGE_COMB=xxx -set BSE_COMPNR=yyy<br />
<br />
where xxx = pkg combination<br />
yyy = company number</div></div><hr />

     using -- -set PACKAGE_COMB=xxx -set BSE_COMPNR=yyy <br />
 is worng when you want to dynamically switch to another company during runtime and then return back to the original company after doing some processing.<br />
<br />
--set PACKAGE and CPMPNR allows you to set the default package and company number during logging into Baan and not during runtime so that the user need not keep setting the company number and package combination in the user data everytime he wants to work in a different package combination and company.<br />
<br />
The best way is to use the functions during runtime:<br />
<br />
switch.to.company(target_compnr)<br />
....Do the processing....<br />
switch.to.company(original_compnr)<br />
<br />
You can also use compnr.check(), the major difference being switch.to.company(..) demands for more system resources and performs more checks, but compnr.check() just switches to teh company if the user is authorised to that company...<br />
