<br />
I have a problem with migrating self-made sessions with forms/reports from BaanIV to ERP/LN. This is what i did:<br />
<br />
In BaanIV:<br />
- Copy sessions/forms/scripts/reports to language 2<br />
- Export ttiex1280m000<br />
In ERPLN:<br />
- Import ttiex1285m000. When i view the sessions i see 'Dynamic session' and 'Integrated' checkboxes not checked<br />
- After setting BSE_STD_PROGRAM=ottstpdyncnvstp i run ttadv2900m000 - Convert session to dynamic. I get warnings in the logfile: 'form ... in language 2 is not linked, so it has to be converted manually' But when i select 'Forms...' in the sessions menu I can see the form is connected with the session.<br />
- I also tried ttadv2910m000 - Integrate dynamic session and form. This result in a warning 'ttadv29017 - ????????????????????'<br />
<br />
I totally agree with that last message. For me this is a long row of ?????????? :) I hope someone can point me in the right direction. I want to make the (reporting) sessions i made in BaanIV to be available in ERP/LN.<br />
<br />
With kindly regards,<br />
<br />
Douwe.</div></div><hr />

Sure you want to do it like this? Since a lot has changed between these releases I am wondering if it's not more efficient to build your reports again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mroset</div><div class="date">27th August 2018, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">After some carefull investigation and evaluation, I found the process to convert a 'static' form (E.g. Baan IV) to LN dynamic session/form to be perfectly useable. It saves an enormous amount of work over recreating the form fieds and layouts  <br />
There's quite a number of caveats and prerequisites to consider though, but then it does the job fine. <br />
I'll share my experiences below:<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT PREREQUISITES / PREPARATIONS:<br />
<br />
-	Form must be present in LANGUAGE 2 (English) as the MAIN report on which the other language reports are based (“Link to language 2”).  <br />
NOTE: If you happen to have language 2 linked to another language (like I had in some cases where customers are Dutch with a progressive need to enhance this to also create English/German/French reports, which were based on/linked to the Dutch report), first unlink and ensure that the form is present in language 2 first !  =&gt; See “Baan IV process to make the ENGLISH (language 2) form the one to which ALL others are linked” below.<br />
<br />
-	Current Package VRC must be the same as the package VRC of the session/form you’re trying to convert to Dynamic<br />
-	Session and Form must be in the same VRC.<br />
-	You WILL need to do rework using the DFE (Dynamic Form Editor) after converting !  (in my case, I had to add the form command / button in order to execute the type 4 session)<br />
-	Ttadv2910m000 merely sets the flags to YES for ttadv200.zd_dynf  (Dynamic) and ttadv200.zg_sf1   (Integrated), and does not seem to do anything more !<br />
-	If you want to retry , then set the ttadv200 fields back to ‘No’ and retry the procedure.<br />
<br />
Baan IV process to make the ENGLISH (language 2) form the one to which ALL others are linked:<br />
(NOTE: this ONLY necessary if e.g. Language 2 is linked to Language 1 !)<br />
<br />
1.	UNLINK all forms  (Language 1-4)<br />
2.	Copy language 1 component from Language 1 to language 2  (Using ttadv6200m000)<br />
3.	Link ALL languages to language 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
PROCEDURE:<br />
1.	Export DD in Baan IV (ttiex1280m000)<br />
2.	Import DD into ErpLN (ttiex1285m000)<br />
3.	Use procedure below to convert Session/Form to Dynamic Form (See also Infor KB 721584)<br />
<br />
3.1 Ensure to invoke BW while having set the following in the BECS command field “-set BSE_STD_PROGRAM=ottstpdyncnvstp”<br />
3.2 Run ttadv2900m000 (Convert session to dynamic)<br />
3.3 Run ttadv2910m000 (Integrate dynamic session and form)<br />
(IMPORTANT NOTE: this step is ONLY necessary if the ‘Dynamic’ and ‘Integrated’ fields in ttadv200 (Sessions) are not set to ‘Yes’ by ttadv2900m000 already)<br />
3.4 Compile the dynamic session / finetune the form’s layout using DFE</div></div><hr />
