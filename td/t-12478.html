In Baan IVc is it possible to create a dynamic index (sort) in the before program section on a form type 3. I am not able to create a new index for this sort and wish to know if it can be done this way.<br />
<br />
Table being read is tdsls040, there are no indexes related to order date. New sort order would be customer, order date and SO number. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Many Thanks<br />

Why are you not able to add a new index to the table?  It is really not a big deal to do so.</div></div><hr />

Until Baan comes out with a patch to the table and the patch includes a new index.</div></div><hr />

==============================================<br />
Not sure I am following Foster.  Customize the table by adding a new index by customer, date and sales order.    The index would be unique since sales order is contained in the index.  This takes about 2 minutes to do.  Do a reconfig and then make the index available in Maintain Sales Order headers or whatever customized reports you write.<br />
<br />
Really, a very trivial customization.</div></div><hr />

Sorry the answer is YES to this one. In your maintain session click on tools/query use the expressions tab to define filters and the sequence tab to define sorts by ANY table field on the main table.<br />
<br />
(it's not the very fastest though - speed depends a lot on the number of records)<br />
<br />
I've done some investigation: when you send the query and return to your main session it takes a while to sort the data. Then things are fairly quick when you scroll through the records with either next or previous. Changing direction ie. from next to previous takes some time again but if you continue scrolling in the same direction it is quick - you'll have to see if it's acceptable for your requirements - our users use it a-lot (those that understand how it works!)<br />
<br />

Looks like a hit on performance though.<br />
