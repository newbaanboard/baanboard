What was the response message(response node), in your debug screen?<br />
Return code 60 seems to be Unsupported Protocol.<br />
<br />

 <br />
Thanks for replying <br />
in respondNode there is no message.please find screen shot<br />
only on status variable error code 60 coming.if it is unsupported protocol issue how can we solve it. <br />
<br />
I am thinking it may be because of authentication problem. because when i use WSDL in browser it asked for user name and password. but in LN coding we are not sending any user name password. <br />
also i have seen in SoapUI tool i can not find user &amp; password tags or provision in soap request XML in SoapUI tool.<br />
<br />
so can can we pass user and password through LN in soap XML request as i dont know where to define it.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

If you believe authentication is the issue, then you will be able to use <br />
soap.addheader(msgNode, &lt;authenticationNode&gt;)<br />
where the structure of &lt;authenticationNode&gt; depends on the service where the Soap service is loaded.<br />
<br />

I have  seen this function but problem is , How would we know authentication Node. I have below information <br />

Can any body help me on this?<br />
I am thinking this issue with Authentication of HTTP post  and not aware of how can we send authentication in soap request Invoke . in header section i have added Authentication node as well but it is not working.<br />
also i got to know it may be certification issue but not sure or not aware.<br />
 while researching got some function like <br />
<br />
Is any body know about below function if yes please share syntex and description of it or any sample code <br />
<br />
id_service = SoapService.New( WEBSERVICE_METHOD, URI_SOAP11, WEBSERVICE_URL )<br />
               id_request = SoapElement.New( WEBSERVICE_METHOD, &quot;kon&quot;, WEBSERVICE_NAMESP )<br />
SoapService.SetCredentials(id_service, l.user, l.password )<br />
               |â€¦ set body<br />
               retval = SoapService.Invoke( id_service, id_request, id_response )<br />
<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
               l.username.node = SoapService.CreateSoapHeader(id_service, &quot;Username&quot;, &quot;wsse&quot;, WEBSERVICE_NAMESP)<br />
               ret.l = XmlNewNode(&quot;&quot;, XML_DATA, l.username.node)<br />
               SoapElement.SetStringValue(l.username.node, &quot;myUserName&quot; )<br />
               SoapService.SetSoapHeaderField(id_service, &quot;wsse_Username&quot;, l.username.node)<br />
               SoapService.UseSoapHeader(id_service, &quot;wsse_Username&quot;, SOAP_HEADER_IN)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have got the details about those function using session &quot;ttstpbaandoc&quot; session you can generate the library of ttstpsoapdll and can get the detials about that functions.<br />
<br />
regarding soap error it will be certification issue so we have to import the certificate and then import it in to LN server. once it is done then i will update if it is working<br />
thanks for your support <br />
