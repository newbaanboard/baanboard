I'm newbie and I start to create a CC-Library to get out a field (cprpd100.plid) I need to have in &lt;userarea&gt; of a BOD . So I have get out customization library part by &quot;boibdbl505sb00&quot; and put in a new General library &quot;boibdbl505cc00&quot;, addFieldTable as described in the comments. Compiling the new library in debuging mode and test saving by session for planner attributes, I'm expecting a debugger windows come up but nothing happens. How can I say to jump in the CC-Library and / or #ifdef CUSTOMIZATION_LIBRARY is defined ?<br />
Thanks.R.Marco.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the things you can check<br />
1) The Package VRC corresponding to the Package Combination attached to your user Data, and the Package VRC of the dll Library,which you have put in Debug, are  they same? They need to be at the same level.<br />
2) Try putting the program script which calls the dll also in Debug.<br />
<br />
These couple of things should help.</div></div><hr />
