The script runs very fast on the screen and exports to the printer very quickly.  I use the spool.pr.copies variable to identify the required number of labels.<br />

The problem: the label printer pauses for almost 1 second between each label.  For everything else (including same application written in a package outside Baan), the printer streams the output at top speed (lookup is VERY slow outside Baan - can't use index).<br />

I also tried a &quot;for&quot; loop instead of the spool.pr.copies variable - to no avail.<br />

\0002Qxxx where xxx is the number of labels required<br />

<br />
At first I thought it was easy too, but I can't find the code to send for the printer in question (the manual has no command codes at all!!).<br />
<br />
We are using a Citizen CLP-7002.  I actually thought the spool.pr.copies would do what you are talking about with the printer driver through windows; but as you can see it doesn't seem to be doing the trick.  We are using the Seagull driver (as it seems to be the only one available) which has little (actually zero) documentation regarding command codes as well.<br />
<br />
Do you happen to know a generic command code for number of copies?  I will try the datamax code (it is thermal bar code printer as well isn't it?) to see if that gets me closer.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">18th October 2002, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I've attached the programmers manual for the datamax I-4208, from what I've read on the net the CLP-7002 supports the datamax command set, we might be on the right path. Are you using BWprint? We don't - we format and spool the label direct to the print queue. If the datamax command set doesn't work you can use your other label printing software spool the output to a file and octal dump it then you'll be able to extract character by character the commands sent to the printer.<br />

<br />
   I did get the email, thank you.  I have been trying out the codes, but I think I am doing something wrong.  I set it up as a report for the label designs and am passing the codes into the detail line (which is just a tcmcs.str50 field).  It is printing the actual text of the code instead of taking it as a printer code.  I used the standard 'C' formatting using '\002' as STX etc..., but I think I should be using the ascii character set instead of \002.<br />
<br />
i.e. chr(002) for STX.<br />
<br />
I will give this a try and let you know how it works out.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually found a command reference guide for our printer :).  I have created a label-printing session that outputs to a thermal label-printer (citizen). I have put in all the control codes for label design, but the Baan spooler seems to be stripping out the main control identifiers STX (ascii 02) and SOH (ascii 01) from every string that I send.  All the data goes through except the STX and SOH, so I just get the data strings being printed (but not formated).<br />
<br />
I have included code snippets of a very simplified type of code to break down exactly what I am trying to accomplish. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
The function &quot;fire.it.out.new&quot; is as follows:<br />
<br />
function fire.it.out.new(domain tcmcs.str300m value.to.print)<br />
{<br />
spool.id = spooler.detail<br />
spool.pr.line = value.to.print<br />
spool.line()<br />
}<br />
<br />
STX has been set to CHR$(02) and SOH is CHR$(01).  The main label code snippet is as follows:<br />
<br />

<br />
Are you using the seagull driver or some other form of driver? I don't know exactly how they work but I assume they've been written in such a way that they convert the baan report into the necessary control strings. Are you sure they don't include the option of repeating labels and field increment/decrement functions?<br />
<br />
Amyway this driver could be causing your problem.  Let's look at your printer setup on NT, which driver are you using for your barcode printers?. If you want to spool control characters from baan to the printer you need a 'pass-through' mechanism (driver) defined on NT. NT should not manipulate your print strings in any way. Attached I've included a copy of our device data and a copy of the 'barcode' driver. The report (not included) does the actual label formatting.<br />
<br />
Try defining the printer on NT as a generic/text only printer and then spool your new report.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdbailey</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Rupertb,<br />
<br />
    We are using the Seagull driver as you have suspected.  This works marvelously when I use the same type of utility written in VB or VC (but the SQL requests are super-slow - which is why I re-designed it in Baan tools).  I will try re-installing the printer as generic as you have suggested.<br />
<br />
    While looking at your barcode setup document, I noticed you have a device type called &quot;Direct&quot;.  We do not have this option.  Our available options are &quot;Append to File&quot;, &quot;Rewrite File&quot;, &quot;Screen&quot; and &quot;Windows Printer&quot;.  Is the &quot;Direct&quot; option part of Baan IVc4 or later, or perhaps it is an option for unix systems?<br />
<br />
    Anyway, I'll try the &quot;Generic&quot; printer idea and let you know.<br />
<br />
   Thanks again for all your help!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">21st May 2003, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Overtrim<br />
Thanks for updating your profile - Right you're on Unix that makes it simpler for me to explain:<br />
<br />
See the attached word document...<br />
Set up a device using the attached barcode 'driver'<br />
The driver should be the attached unix file saved in the directory<br />
$BSE/lib/printinf/b<br />
As you can see on my report layout the driver has already placed the device in label mode &lt;STX&gt;L<br />
My report spools each line with the appropriate info to the device.<br />
Line 1 sets the number of labels to print &quot;QFFFF&quot; where FFFF is a form field in Baan thats spools the desired number of labels. It's much quicker to do it this way then to use repetitive 'brp.ready' or 'rprt_send()' calls - the assumption made is that the labels are identical except for a count increment/decrement field.<br />
Lines 12/14 control the increment by 1 function for the previous field respectively.<br />
The last line on your report must be the letter &quot;E&quot; followed by a  &lt;CR&gt; this terminates label mode and starts the print job in the device.<br />
<br />
Do you have the datamax programmers manual if not I'll mail it to you?<br />
<br />
If this doesn't make sense I'll try explaining it again - Best of luck<br />
Rupert</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overtrim</div><div class="date">21st May 2003, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the file.  We are working with it now.<br />
<br />
I also found that it is possible to use an alternate set of codes.  From the printer menu goto communications/host settings and change to one of the alternate sets.<br />
<br />
1.  hex 5E (^) = SOH<br />
     hex 7e (~) = STX<br />
