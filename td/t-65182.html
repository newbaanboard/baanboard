<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smateen</div><div class="date">24th December 2013, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to  send session short cut to users as e-mail based on a setup. Presently we are able to send emails but not session short cut to users.<br />
For example if we want a  user to look into tsclm1100m000 session for a particular call send send him the session short cut as is avalible in choice &quot;Sent To&quot;  tsclm1100m000 {6aefe904-413c-46cf-af33-2731e5359139}.bwl<br />
<br />
Here i want to know how the  the string  {6aefe904-413c-46cf-af33-2731e5359139} can be constructed  dynamically, so the message can be send when ever there is any change in session to specied users in setup.<br />
<br />
The help which i require is how to confiure argument string.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the purpose behind that? Well, the first thing you need to know is, when you save a worktop document, .gct file &amp; .sct file is created in the templates.<br />
<br />
So, what you can do is, you can directly create a program that will edit the .gct file of the users document which is basically xml file and is used to design the things displayed in worktop.<br />
<br />
So, sending the shortcuts through email is not an option, you will need a program to edit the .gct file and add the shortcuts in the file.<br />
<br />
The second way can be using Centralized Deployment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smateen</div><div class="date">24th December 2013, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">1) We have a repsonsiblity flow (a customized form of mini work flow)  based on user actions and service activity requirements. This triggers e-mails to respective users based on the setup. The e-mails are generated in user DALs tssoc210ue using CMF mail functions. To this email content i want to add session short cut as well so that when the user double clicks is it directly opens  the  mentioned service activity in the session service activities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">24th December 2013, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh,<br />
<br />
Then you might want to go with OLE kind of automation. Like, you can create a .vbs file at runtime which will open the session using BaanOle. and then send the file to user.<br />
<br />
But again, it will have a few requirements to be able to be generic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smateen</div><div class="date">24th December 2013, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you are right. Beacuse user will be able to work only on one record which is opened by this short cut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smateen</div><div class="date">24th December 2013, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">can u pls  elobrate the comment &quot;..will have a few requirements to be able to be generic.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like, OLE requires a document to be able to call Baan sessions. So, first requirement would be every user should have a document created with a command name. The next thing is that, the document has a Host Name, again depending on users location either you have to use a local Lan IP or a static Ip to be able to connect to Baan.<br />
<br />
I am just assuming this requirement, may be you will need much more than this. But, once you start with the implementation you will figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smateen</div><div class="date">24th December 2013, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you are right. The user(s) is/are valid user(s)  of Infor LN from the local systems. My requirement is how to construct the argument part of the string .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smateen</div><div class="date">24th December 2013, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to Bhushan. I have found the clue. The   way for opening a session through file  with extension &quot;bwl&quot; is as follows:<br />
<br />
Syntax:<br />
<br />
[Configuration]<br />
hostname=&lt;hostname&gt;<br />
bse=&lt;bse path&gt;<br />
bshell=bshell<br />
[Query]<br />
session=&lt;Session Code&gt;<br />
company=&lt;Company in which code is to be opened&gt;<br />
query=&lt;((Key fields of the session main table))&gt;<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
[Configuration]<br />
hostname=serv1<br />
bse=j:\infor10<br />
bshell=bshell<br />
[Query]<br />
session=tsclm1100m000<br />
company=022<br />
query=((tsclm100.ccll = 'KYC474822' ))</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th December 2013, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Moved this to the correct forum.  The code and utilities forum is where you actually post code you developed and want to share with everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was very helpful. I tried searching for some documentation regarding bwl file, but was not able to find it.<br />
<br />
Can you please tell me from where we can find documentation for this...<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
