How did you populate the tables in the new company?<br />
If you filled them with data from another company, there will be fields containg company number of the old company - try to change these fields before reading in the data.<br />
<br />
just a guess<br />

<br />
I populated the tables with ttaad4227m000 and ttaad4225m000 sessions. I before going to up the information had the caution of changing the  company number with tccom0214m000 session.<br />

Thank you,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe, but I am not positive, that when we reloaded one company to use DEM flows we had to actually regenerate all the dem flows for the new company.  I am not positive about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gget79</div><div class="date">14th August 2008, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark<br />
<br />
Yes I had tried running the session using the menu browser and not through the DEM flow<br />
<br />
Can you help me in reloaded one company to use DEM flows?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Make sure the company and package combinations are correct.  Make sure the user is in the correct package combination. You might even want to check at the OS level that the data dictionary is present for that package combination.  You might also want to CRDD.  Not sure about this stuff since your profile shows Baan 5 and we are on 4.  Not sure if this thread would not be better off in the admin forum and this is not really what I support.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I really do not know what all we had to do to get DEM flows to work in the new company.  It seems to me that after we got all the tables copied the DEM flow mgr<br />
had to go thru and redo some stuff and then regenerate the world.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
Thank you for your support. I found the solution. In this case in LN We have to make sure that the Enterprise Unit is fine.  This I did it in tgbrg0530m000 session.  <br />
  <br />
Greetings,</div></div><hr />
