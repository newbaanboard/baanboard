<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 01:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The background is that we have 3 sites and 1 financial and loogistic company. Splitting them will not be allowed.  We are on 4c3 and have the a&amp;d extension. <br />
<br />
Now the problem is that we have the same part that is buy at two sites and make at one site. The typical part like this is buy on the item master and make on the group item.  The problem is that the leadtime is kept on the item master. GRP and all of our reports use the item master to get the leadtime.  The problem is that the planning and reports are pulling the leadtime for a buy part, in somecases this can mean a difference of 200 days.<br />
<br />
The only solution I have come up with so far is to <br />
add the leadtime to the maintain group item master session. This would be done using a new table and qkey. Then I would change our reports to use the leadtime from the new table.  AND I would copy this leadtime into the item master before each GRP run for a project group. Not a pretty solution and was hoping for a better idea from someone in this group.<br />
<br />
There are a bunch of reasons why parts differ from site to site, but mainly 2 sites are new manufacture and 1 site is overhaul. So a overhaul part X is not the same as a new part X.  Even on some parts that are purchased at all three sites the leadtimes are different(different vendors).  So any ideas out there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 03:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Appears you do not have source code. It would have been very easy.<br />
<br />
Here are a few points from the top of the head:<br />
<br />
a. If this is the ONLY item like that, get the user to agree to assigning a new item code to it. (Well, the Item Code can be the same as the original one, but pre-fixed or suffixed with say the Project Group).<br />
<br />
<br />
b. If it is allowed to change the Group Item table itself, and you will maintain the lead time manually, assuming no validations are required, all you need to do is change the table and then customize the form of the Maintain session to add the new field. You will not have to resort to QKEY or whatever. Even if you write a new session to calculate the leadtime by algorithm (for the make item), this should work fine.<br />
<br />
After that, though, you are right, you will need a new session to 'copy' the lead time to the item master before each GRP run. I understand from your note that the item have three different Project Groups. Otherwise, this will not work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply Shah. You are right we do not have the source. And we are not talking 1 or 2 parts, at last count about a 100 or more parts.  This will probably grow as newer products start coming in for overhaul. This does not include the fact that they want to keep purchasing leadtimes separate. Sigh - this maybe my only choice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">10th August 2002, 02:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I talked to my colleague and here is another possibility:<br />
<br />
If there is ROUTING Data for the item, then for those Group Items that are marked as MAKE, the GRP Engine will compute the Lead Time based on the routing. For the Group Item record marked 'BUY', it will pick the lead time from the Item Data. He believes it is possible to set up Routing Data for an item with Item Type 'Purchased'.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th August 2002, 05:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply it is appreciated.  But we already have bills and routings for these parts. One of the main problems is that GRP plans of the group item. So when we do plan to build a part that is buy on the item master GRP plans it wrong. It has us building them to the purchase lead time and that is way off. Some of my personal stuff actually asks the user if they want to explode purchase parts. If they answer yes - then I take each purchase part and look for a bill. If I find it then I calculate the leadtime.  This causes some of the top level end item BOM's up to an hour to generate. It works but the users do not like it.<br />
<br />
I guess what I will do is copy the leadtime and make/buy code from the group item to the item master. Run the calculate order leadtime session. Then run GRP for each project group.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the input.<br />
