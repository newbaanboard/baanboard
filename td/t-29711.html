<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a number of customised reports that compile fine on the dev box but when copied to live we get the following error if we try and recompile:<br />
<br />
<br />
Detail 1, PrintExp 'field'' not expected<br />
r_append_line not expected<br />
<br />
<br />
see attached screenshot.  Any ideas what could be causing this?  Both servers are running the same portingset and repgen seems to be the same version on both.<br />
<br />
The couple of example reports I have tried have been copied from std report (with no report script) then added fairly simple report script and changed layouts etc.  Help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">First thing that comes to my mind is - Are they on the same tools release or patch level?  It could be a library other than repgen.  I would report this to baan.  Of course you can always back up the production version of repgen and try putting a copy of the development version in place to test.  Just something to try while waiting for Baan.</div></div><hr />
