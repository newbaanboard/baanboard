It uses its proprietary 4G language to create the SQL script for the Oracle.  However, if I see any inefficient script from the Oracle DBA view point, How can I improve the script?  According to the business of BAAN, it is  in their contract that user can not modify the script, unless goes through the BAAN technical service.  Is that true? Someone said in other post that the performance of the total application is 90% BAAN and 10% Oracle.  Oracle DBA can only do so much  in term of oracle system setup, not else DBA can do.  As a newbie, I need some thoughts from experienced users.  Thanks.<br />

Otherwise you can notify Baan about the problem.  Of course if you modify the code you end up supporting the code.<br />
<br />
As a DBA there are certain things you can do in the back ground to help - my DBA's used to create indexes to help the backend queries.  In some cases it was our code that was ineffiecient, but the indexes fixed the problem. Some cases it was Baan.  We fixed our code and reported some sessions to Baan. All have been fixed - so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ciatecmx</div><div class="date">14th July 2006, 23:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks  Mark.  Actually you raised a question for me.  I thought (maybe I am wrong) that even the index has to be create by the BAAN side.  If I create index through the Oracle side, will BAAN script use it? By /+ hint/.  My BAAN admin told me negative.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giyer@baan</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 00:56</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as i remember, even though in the select query an index which is defined in baan is used and if oracle identifies another index which does the action better, the same will be used.  Hence index can be created in Oracle and support of the Baan will not be a problem to my knowledge ( We had a lot of experience in this scenario on my five years with Baan).   Only problem is from Baan V onwards, Baan developers can use HINT command so that they will force a particular index and informing oracle to select its own index.  But to my knowledge hint is used only in the Planning &amp; Warehousing scripts that too only in 2 % of the code.<br />
<br />
Finally, what i would say is index can be created.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ciatecmx</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 05:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we have BAAN V and the reason I raised the question is because I saw that HINT in one of scripts which indicated an alert in Oracle by OEM.  Furthermore, when I checked the Oracle recommendation of index, I found that index already existed.  So..  Thank for your thought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 07:22</div></div><div class="posttext">It is true that there is proprietary baan code that contains less than perfect SQL. It's been a long time since I've seen unmodified code shoot through the roof though.<br />
<br />
The hints in 3GL are mostly ignored, depending on your porting set. The database driver adds hints of its own, and in the past I've seen many questionable ones from the oracle8 driver.<br />
<br />
Forcing hints on the Oracle side is not what I consider &quot;best-practice&quot;, but it is an option, as is adding indexes.</div></div><hr />
