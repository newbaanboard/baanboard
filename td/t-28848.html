<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wrobins</div><div class="date">7th December 2006, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to print a larger font using the BWPRINT method of changing the font.  I have no problem specifying the User Font 16, and changing the font size.  When I set it to 14 or greater, the letters overlap.  I need to be able to change the horizontal font spacing.  Through BWPRINT I can select the Font Spacing option, but only the Vertical Spacing is available to be changed.  The Horizontal spacing is shown, but disabled.  Is there a way to enable this?  I read something in a previous thread about Windows Administrator rights having an impact on making changes, but I don't know if it refered to this.  Will logging on as an Administator allow me to change this?  Or, is there a way around it?<br />
I've tried changing the escape codes for Font 16 in the printinf file, but it doesn't seem to impact this.  I don't know if it is because I'm using the Windows default printer.<br />
Some help would be appreciated.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th December 2006, 22:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I can tell you is I sent a sample report in preview mode to my PC and I was able to change both the horizontal and vertical spacing.  Nothing special on the report I sent - used default printer(I guess nothing in device queue) and my user id does have admin rights on my PC.  Tried it a couple of times with the same report.  Worked both times.  Have you tried just using a standard baan report - like print paper types?  Sent it in preview mode and see if you can change the spacing.  One possibility is the version you are running for the client or bwprint - just a wild guess.</div></div><hr />

I guess I'll have to try to get an Administrator to logon and see if this is a Window issue, or a Baan issue.<br />
