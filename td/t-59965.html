<br />
We are in Baan IV c4.<br />
<br />
We are facing the strength issue in Text Editor. It’s not updating the record from ttaad4100 or if I update through query.<br />
<br />
We are creating the P.O through AFS but for insert Text we have to write insert into statement in Table tttxt001, 002,010.  The values are there in table tttxt010, but when I open it in Text editor, it’s not showing the values, its show void.<br />
<br />
PFA and please let me know the solution.<br />
<br />
I did the same in LN 6.1 FP3, its working fine there. <br />
Please advice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sudipta</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 simple questions:<br />
<br />
1. Is the definitely stored against the same company number (I can't see it in GTM!)<br />
2. In the text editor, you are looking in language 2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">som.papai</div><div class="date">2nd February 2011, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for ur quick reply.Yes your observation is correct.<br />
<br />
I was created it for two lines, then from GTM I deleted the second line contain. <br />
Yes, I’m checking for same company 115 in language 2(English).<br />
<br />
Now if I changed the record from text editor then same will update in table, but if I changed from GTM it’s showing void.<br />
<br />
But if I used external editor (notepad) rather than Text editor then the record is showing perfect. <br />
<br />
The setting I should change in Text Editor? I’ve not idea…not sure what to change?</div></div><hr />

Are you using direct updates or the text functions? This thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=58002&amp;highlight=text+tables) is how I create or append purchase text.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as i remember it was a problem with a corrupted index (the key fields exists in index but not in the table itself) or on db level the record already exists but was not visible on baan level for some reason.</div></div><hr />
