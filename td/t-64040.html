Check these things:-<br />
<br />
1. Check if the path for the output is same as the path given to the device in Session : Device Data (ttaad3500m000)<br />
2. If the above is correct, check if you have defined your application server in session: System (ttaad0550m000)<br />
<br />
Please attach your error window for clear understanding of error.</div></div><hr />

Dear,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply, but I have some questions for you:<br />
<br />
1. Why should I check device settings?, I commented that I made a program that uses the sentence server2client, but I do not use the program reports.<br />
2. We also consult you, if incorrect ttaad0550m000 session settings should not work at all.<br />
<br />
Please comment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, you have just written your script. Ok, Can you please post it. The problem should not be with the script as its working in Worktop, but you never know. <br />
<br />
I have done lots of reports with server2client and gives no problem on both.<br />
<br />
Also check :-<br />
<br />
$ese\Webtop\config\webtop.log file and check what you observe there.</div></div><hr />

We had the same issue with the client2server() function.  The return value was -1, which indicated an error, but the transfer was actually successful.  This only happened with WebUI (Webtop) and Worktop was fine.<br />
<br />
The issue was resolved in WebUI 10.6, build BL0075.  If you are using an earlier version/build, you will have to upgrade to get this problem resolved.<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
Stephan</div></div><hr />
