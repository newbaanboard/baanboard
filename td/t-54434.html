Our guys do have a lot of item text where they have something like e.g. ### Test Item ###<br />
Unfortunatley it looks like that ERPLN independent of the Printer always only print 1 #, so it comes out like # Test Item #.<br />
Semicolons do also sometimes cause problems. Are that reserved characters and can I do something to make the system print it correct? It shows correct in the little text window.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

As i understood your problem.<br />
I could suggest you to use ascii value to print reserved charecter.<br />
Use ASCII values of those reserved charecter.</div></div><hr />

I would check with Infor support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">4th December 2008, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">This is based on the experience with the % character in labels. If you want to print/display the % character using a label, you have to specify the character twice (as %%) to show just once in the display.<br />
<br />
So, to extend on that, to get your text output like you want, you may want to try ###### Text ###### to get output as ### Text ###.<br />
<br />
Yes, the ## character is a macro-expansion reserved character, so maybe the system is treating it specially somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for the answers.<br />
<br />
It seems like the last answer is pretty close. Just tested it.<br />
<br />
1x #: nothing prints<br />
2x #: it prints 1x<br />
3x #: it prints 1x<br />
4x #: it prints 2x<br />
5x #: it prints 2x<br />
6x #: it prints 3x<br />
<br />
I guess I will just replace the hashes with something like No. because that is what they use it for.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
