<br />
He has supplied the solution, and I will document.  The solution is, do not use the darn quick guide, and we don't need the user font work around either.    <br />
<br />
Here's a walkthrough:<br />
<br />
- Nothing in the report script<br />
- On the report field put:<br />
     Print Expression:  the field to print, in my case tdpur045.pono, no astricks or other special characters<br />
     Font:  I picked Small.  This is the font for the human readable version under the barcode<br />
     Barcode:  I picked 9 for 3 of 9 font.  A list of all options can be found in the bw.print help:  Barcode Configuration / barcode type<br />
<br />
That's it!  As long as barcodes print in the Print Preview / Barcode Font test, then this should work.<br />
<br />
And it's Easy! Thanks again Vamsi.  Per his suggestion, I will try and gather all for a better write-up as a WIKI for bar code printing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Years ago (about 6/7 or so) I made an include that will take care of sending the information to bwprint. Since then I've implemented this times after time, and it is still in use.<br />
<br />
Here is the code:<br />
<br />
| Include file for printing barcodes on different documents.<br />
| This include should be called from the reportscripts.<br />
| The combination between include and separate variables for the<br />
| barcode fields opens the possibility to use more barcodes on 1 layout<br />
|<br />
| Ex: Call function in reportscript: <br />
| print.item.field = set.barcode.field(tdsls041.item,type,height)<br />
| print.unit.field = set.barcode.field(tdsls041.cuqs,type,height)<br />
|<br />
| The field print.item.field is the variable that will be printed as<br />
| barcode, this field will be filled with the field tdsls041.item, including<br />
| strings that will represent the type and height.<br />
<br />
<br />
| The barcode type is determined (according BW Help):<br />
| type  Naam<br />
|    1  EAN13<br />

<br />
Is there any way in bw.print methods to NOT print the text underneath?  I can see the height and the type, but not that text option.  In Unix print drivers it's an option, so I would think there is something to be done...</div></div><hr />

I have tried to test print barcode but I am getting blank from the preview. Any suggentsions(See attachment)?<br />

We are on Baan 5c, Windows 2000 Server , BW version 7.1c.137, BWprint porting set 7.1c<br />

Hello Lisa,<br />
<br />
)#&amp; means Code39 , Hight = 3 , Characters = 6   &quot;999999&quot;<br />
<br />
)#$ means Code39 , Hight = 3 , Characters = 4 &quot;9999&quot;<br />
<br />
This problem i solved with an include, which calculates the length of the Barcode string and sets the right code, depending on the stringlenght. I'm using it with Code128.<br />
<br />

I resolved using the other method, but this brings up...where did you get that info?  If there is some site or doc that we can refer to to translate those commands it would be very handy!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are failing the BW Print Barcode test, you don't have the barcodes installed (at least how Baan expects them).<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, my test printed right with that porting set / same BW version as you have, so I can only guess.  I think you need to register the font.  The directions in the BW Print Quick Guide #1310 walk through this, but I found them to be old and the fields are not named the same.  When I upgraded my bw client it fixed it for me, but you seem to be on the latest.  <br />
<br />
If the quick guide command:<br />
<br />
c:\Baan\bin&gt;c:\windows\system\regsrv32 dbcocx32.ocx<br />
<br />
does not work for you, try whatever ocx you have in that directory.   I have axbarcode.ocx.   If neither works, maybe contact Baan and see if they can update this Quick Guide 1310, or maybe someone else here has the answer.</div></div><hr />
