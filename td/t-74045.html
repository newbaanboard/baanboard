With each alias being a different tdsls041 table in a different company.   I am not sure that would work and even if it did you would then have to figure out how to display the various records.  I keep coming back to something I did in the past.  I would create a main session and say something like give me a part number, then the user clicked on continue, the subsession built a table with set of records to display.  Nothing fancy.<br />
<br />
I typically built reports for the users to run and export for multi-company data. So I could get same data from same tables using _compnr in a library.  Again nothing fancy.<br />
<br />
I can't think of an easy way to do this - at least not with a display session.  I can think of other options, but none I think are what you are really looking for.</div></div><hr />

Okay thank you very for the reply mark, so there is no way to do with this requirement<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">30th September 2021, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">As SO functionality by company may be completely different (order series, params, ...) I would think there should be no way to do this.<br />
However, you may have organized things in a way that this is not an issue and all goes well in different series etc, known in all companies...<br />
<br />
Then maybe you can end up with a &quot;shared&quot; table where a CDF company field is making the difference...<br />
<br />
Or one archive company where the different orders are stored...<br />
<br />
Maybe you could use one (main) query with different nested (for each company) subquery (and use a swithc.to.comp() in between to be sure you read all references from that particular company). With no permissions (or different package combination) this will also fail. In that case you could even use a get.all.sales.data.from.compnr(i.compnr) function with in it the (same) query for each company after the if switch.to.company(i.compnr) = 1 then statement...<br />
<br />
This will probably work for a report, but not for a main display session.<br />
<br />
Maybe you could use a MMT session for each different company?</div></div><hr />
