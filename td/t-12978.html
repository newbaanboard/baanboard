<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warans</div><div class="date">15th September 2003, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Your question is not very clear...<br />
<br />
However, here is what I had understood.<br />
<br />
You do have a script existing in your BaaN version and when tried to open, it always shows as empty on your editor.<br />
<br />
1.  You need to clear your BaaN Client temporary folder completely, for example, if your BaaN client is installed in C:\ drive, then delete all the files from C:\Baan\Tmp folder.<br />
<br />
2. Make sure that your software components direcotry is pointed correctly on your VRC structure.<br />
<br />
Try it again!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">15th September 2003, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Another interpretation of your problem: you are trying to customize a script that, according to Tools, is in the standard B40_c4 VRC.  If this is the case, and you do not have a source code agreement, you're out of luck.  The source does not exist in the standard VRC!  In Tools it is reported to be there, and that is correct (meaning, don't remove the entry/entries!), but the actual file $BSE/application/tcB40_c4/ptccom/pcom11020 does not exist.  When copying, it copies the entry in the Tools table, but, finding nothing on UNIX, creates an empty file.<br />
<br />
If, however, you know the file exist (for instance, you're copying from B40U_c4_stnd), check the file permissions of the pcom11020 file.  If the permissions are wrong, the file will not be copied.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
