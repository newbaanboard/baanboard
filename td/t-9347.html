<br />
I have one baan standard session ( timrp1421m000 - Print Planned MRP Purchase Order ), now the user is asking certain changes in that ...can i modify that session i mean Input form and put certain more filters of the input screen ??? and then create another report which calls my newly created report.<br />
<br />
Is this method recommended ? or it there any problem in doing so ??<br />
i tried modifying the form and after saving it i clicked on the Dump button, but still it doesn't show me the newly created form.<br />
<br />
How should i go about it ?<br />
<br />
the package VRC where my session is - ti B40o b2 pat<br />
I am using BaaN B2 Version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The source code for the session is required. Otherwise the input fields are not known to the session. Thus the input fields can't be incorprated in the session implementation.<br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">You may not be able to put form filters into effect, if you do not have the program script. But, you can change the format of the report, if you wish, by creating another report in your current VRC. But, again it is not advised, as the future patches on this report would be useless for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 13:53</div></div><div class="posttext">let's say if i don't need to add/delete the filters on the input form, i just want to change the label on the input form. and also add additional report to this standard session which provided me certian more fields as output ( logic i would be writing in report script )<br />
<br />
tell me is it advisable to do it ??? if yes then how should i export this standard session , what all options should i chose while i would be doing export of session ???<br />
<br />
is there any risk involved doing so ??? till now i haven't customized any standard session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">1. You need to copy the standard form in your live/production VRC.<br />
2. Modify the labels that you need to.<br />
3. Make a new report/copy the standard report in you live/production VRC. Make changes (be careful!!). Compile.<br />
<br />
The only risk involved here is, if there is a patch from BaaN for this form or report, then the changes will NOT be visible to you!!<br />
<br />
Good Luck...</div></div><hr />
