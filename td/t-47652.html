<br />
Can anybody please tell me that what is the exact difference in DAL and DAL2 apart from hooks:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">3rd February 2008, 23:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to the latest SSA ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide for more info.<br />
 <br />
Extended DAL (DAL2)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Overview<br />
In SSA ERP LN the DAL concept is introduced to centralize integrity checks. One of the goals is to be able to re-use these integrity checks rather than implementing them again and again. In practice however, it appears that these integrity checks are hard to re-use in the UI layer. As a result, a lot of business logic is programmed in the UI scripts. Another problem is that since developers often only test the application via the User Interface, the DAL on its own is not well tested. <br />
<br />
It also appeared that it is very hard to use the current DALs for Integrations via Baan OpenWorld, because too often business logic is spread across the DAL and the UI scripts. <br />
<br />
The DAL2 concept is introduced to tackle these issues. With DAL2 a number of new hooks is introduced that make it possible to define the integrity checks in such a way that they are easier to re-use. One of the major benefits is that the 4GL engine now re-uses these hooks to perform automatic disabling/enabling of fields and commands. <br />
<br />
Another important improvement is that DAL2 makes it possible to define field dependencies in such a way that they can be used to determine correct values for fields that are not known by other components. Until now (in the Corelli Release), this was already possible for external products that Integrated with SSA ERP LN using Baan OpenWorld. The DAL2 concept now makes it possible to re-use the field dependencies in the SSA ERP LN application as well. Also, the 4GL engine makes use of the defined field relations in order to determine default values in the User Interface. <br />
<br />
Include files<br />
You have to include bic_dal2 in your DAL to make it an Extended (DAL2) DAL. <br />
<br />
Testing DALs<br />
The 4GL engine can be run in 3 different modes that can be used to test an Extended (DAL2) DAL. See DAL2 Test Mode for more information. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freebie82</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 05:11</div></div><div class="posttext">To your question, as you said Hooks itself are the major difference between DAL-1 and DAL-2.<br />
<br />
DAL-1 Has Object Hooks and Property Hooks. DAL-2 has (along with the other 2) field level hooks as well.<br />
<br />
For example, Guess Field  C is dependent on field A &amp; B. Any value change in Field A or B results in value change in C as well without any UI Programming. Properties for these fields are set via respective DAL.<br />
<br />
Also, upto Baan 5.2, with DAL-1, it seems only a majority of Integrity Checks was taken care by DAL-1, not all. But from LN onwards its claimed that using DAL-2, the entire Integrity checks has been implemented via DAL and so UI programming has been made only for program/business logic and not for integrity checks in general.<br />
<br />
Also,with DAL-2, its possible to display/hide fields in a session as per Role/Authorizatoin. {Methods allowed/not}<br />
<br />
These are quite a few i could recollect. But, if you feel, you are looking for something more, let me know. I can refer and let you know.<br />

And one most important thing regarding Property Hooks in DAL2 they will directly reflect to UI.</div></div><hr />
