<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">S.K.Jala</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 08:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
Is there any way to block the text for modification, deletion etc.<br />
I want the text to be blocked fully (it should become read only) if some criteria is met.<br />
For example the text in purchase requisition should become read only if the status of purchase requisition is not equal to &quot;raised&quot;. This is creating confusion as people can change text even after purchase order is raised.<br />
This I tried through that table field authorisation but it does not work.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">13th January 2003, 05:55</div></div><div class="posttext">As you probably know, text authorisations are by text groups. Thus a user can have different authorisations to a particular group and for purchasing you could set up a specific group for purchase order text.<br />
<br />
BUT, there is a problem with this. It is global for the order, so the user can still enter (if they have authorisations to that text group) text against the order. The only way to prevent them from modifying the text after the order is created, is to edit the session script (if you don't have source, you will need to get it customised). If you do have source, then in the text choice option, all you need is a couple of lines of code;<br />
<br />
choice.text.manager:<br />
before.choice:<br />
    if not ( condition to write text ) then<br />
          attr.textmode = 1   |* Read-Only Text<br />
    endif</div></div><hr />
