I have few questions:<br />
1. What is the default record separator character use for the Baan report and is there way that we can change it, for specific report or in general for all reports?<br />
 <br />
2. What is the Baan reprot format, If someone have any information and can share. I am asking about the out put temp file generated by the Baan for report. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

1. In the tabular reports the default delimiter is &quot;|&quot; (Pipe). There are other reports that have &quot;:&quot; as their delimiter. AFAIK you will have to change it in each report. You can not do it for all reports together.<br />
<br />
To change the report delimiter you will have to go to maintain Reports (ttadv3130m000) and find your report (It must be in the current VRC if it is not copy it to the current VRC). Then click on the &quot;Layouts&quot; button, select the layout you want and click on &quot;Edit Layout&quot;. You change the delimiter there.<br />
<br />
2. Baan can generate many formats. What device did you use?<br />
However, the famous Baan is called BWPrint <br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

I mention the STX character that is used in the sort file and how you can change it.  I do not know of a way to change this character.  You can put a report in debug mode and step through everything to see how it works.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how that temp file report file is created - all I know is on a UNIX box you can not just print the report using LP.  It has to go through something to apply the printer formats.  I really do not know enough about this piece - I do know if you need to read it you can run ottstpconv with the ASCII format.  Then a temp file is created that contains plain old text.<br />
<br />
What exactly are you trying to accomplish?  It might help someone come up with other solutions.</div></div><hr />

Probably  a delayed response .<br />
<br />
1. Default separator for  for baan report is  ^B ie chr$(2) .  I think it's not deleted after report is printed .U can not change this separator probably bcos its hard coded in rprt_send and brp.ready functions and even in repgen6.1 .<br />
<br />
2. Output tmp file contains  all input  variables separated by chr$(2) . U need to check the order of the fields , sort fields and arraay fields (input fields with depth  &gt; 1 ) . In excel u can read the tmp file using separator chr(2) .</div></div><hr />
