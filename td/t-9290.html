<br />
Can we import a session in BaanIV into BaanV using export data dictionary and import data dictionary??<br />
<br />
or we have to manually create the sessions??<br />
<br />
Iam talking about report sessions.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You will need to do all the manual work on changing tables, fields etc.. (where they have changed) to get the sessions to work, but it's quicker than creating from fresh.</div></div><hr />

We had faced problem in porting sessions from ERP 5b to ERP 5c.<br />

Importing from 4c4 to 5c works fine so not sure why you had problems with 5b to 5c. You have to do some manual tidying up one the components are over but there are no tools errors when importing.</div></div><hr />

If you have an older port set for the BaanIV env this maybe the  problem as this defines how the dump files are created.  There were some posts regarding this problem of dumps created with an older port set and trying to bdbpost them with a new port set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if the import works, there will be very, very few report sessions ported from BaanIV that will still give out meaningful report in BaanERP. The data structure is almost completely different. If I were to port the customised report sessions in BaanIV Distribution and Manufacturing to BaanERP, 99% of them will churn out rubbish. It might however, work for the 1%<br />
