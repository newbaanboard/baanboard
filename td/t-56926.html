<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th October 2009, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but I am not understanding.  You have a report with text in it - does the text print ok to dislay devices or printers?  Next it looks like you download the report into excel - at this point I do not understand what the problem is.  The only problem I have with reports with text is converting them in excel - the text does not line up with the field columns. So usually I just delete the text or move it to its own column.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure if that is what you are asking about.  I have never really worried about bringing text into excel without me doing a bunch of manual formatting in excel.  Maybe others will have better suggestions.</div></div><hr />
