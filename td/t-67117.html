<br />
in session tdpcg0130m030(ERP LN) standard session, there is one field called tdpcg030.prgr(price group) is present in DFE. But when I run session its not appearing in session screen. I made the visibility true for both detail/overview session. Then tried with customization grid,but failed to add this new field to customization Grid.<br />
<br />
Could any body guide and give some suggestion how we can make the visibility true for this already linked field in DFE, so that it will appear in session screen when we run the session. I tried creating a new group and link this field to the new group, still its not appearing in session o/p screen.<br />

<br />
Some things you can check are:-<br />
<br />
1. Have you compiled the session after DFE changes?<br />
2. Is the session present in your PVRC?<br />
3. If present, is your package combination set to the same?<br />
4. Are there any Table Field authorizations?<br />
5. Have you tried to copy the session and tried making changes?<br />
<br />
Check the above things.</div></div><hr />

I don't have LN access now, but I believe there is a session ttadv9100m000, where you can define the fields that you want to see in a session for its different views.<br />

Hi Vamsi,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your kind reply and valuable time. You are absolutely  right. But we do not have source code for this as its a standard session. But its really suprising that when one of my friend runs this same standard session from her company then she can see all the fields in personalized grid and has the flexibility to hide/visible from that grid. where as when I run the same session in my organization its showing only 4 to 5 fields in personalized grid. How come the standard object behaves differently. Ideally it should not be. and so far the session ttadv9100m000 concerned, I have already checked. There is no entry for this session , but i explicitly tried to insert the field in this session but even though its not appearing in session o/p.<br />
<br />
Could you please advise any other idea so that I will do further digging before a giveup.<br />
<br />
Thanking you all again for your sincere help and putting some effort and time in replying.</div></div><hr />

Hi Gaurav,<br />
<br />
I copied the standrd form to customized VRC. then I unticked the check box to make it visible for both detail/overview session. Still no hope. Its not appearing in session screen.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your suggestions and kind reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanhp</div><div class="date">28th November 2014, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi  Gaurav,<br />
<br />
I have attached the screen shot for ttadv9100m000. Could you please help me in letting know how exactly the table field is maintained in this session. I mean if you see the column &quot;Name&quot; next to column &quot;Personalizatopn type&quot; you will find expression such as tdpcg030.ifbp-11.  Here tdpcg030.ifbp is table field. its clear, but what does the meaning of -11. every where they maintain tablefield-some number.<br />
<br />
Could you please tell me the syntax for maintaining the table field in this session so that our desired column tdpcg030.prgr can be maintained. For your info when I explicitly tried to insert this table field tdpcg030.prgr it says invalid field. That means it need some number e.g.tdpcg030.prgr-20 like this i should maintain<br />
<br />
Awaiting your kind reply.<br />

Could you please give some detail idea about session ttadv9100m000. Suppose I add a new field in this session for a user, should it automatically appear in the personalized grid for that user after logout/login.<br />

Still I am not able to resolve the issue. Could you please tell any price parameter is there which should be ticked, so that the field tdpcg030.prgr(price group) should appear in session screen.<br />

Try this... May b this will help.<br />
<br />
Goto DFE then goto properties of tdpcg030.prgr. Now in position tab check if<br />
<br />
Initial Hidden   (Overview / detail)      is checked or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
if it is checked then uncheck it</div></div><hr />

Hi Mohammad,<br />

These are the basic initial things which are supposed to be done. Long back I have tried these things, but no result so I posted it in BAANBOARD.</div></div><hr />
