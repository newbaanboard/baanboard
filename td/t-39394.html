Does anybody know if AFS is working with dynamic sessions? If so how?<br />
Because I am using now the DAL technic and to find the DAL's or DLL's that handels a session is like seeking a needle in a haystack. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Which version of Baan you are currently using? With LN6.1 DAL2 works pretty well for executing integrity and business rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I currently work with the latest version of LN6.1 that is FP3. I will tell you in short what I intended to do. I wanted to approve a sales order automatically from a customized session. I used the AFS coding to put the fields into session tdsls4211m000 (&quot;Approve Sales Orders&quot;) afterwards I tried to run it but it didn't work. So now I am using the dll (tdsls.dll4110.approve.sales.order.with.commit) instead and it works perfect. <br />
But to find out for each dynamic form which DLL it is using that's the issue. I know I can use bic_info6.2 to find that out, but that is very time consuming and isn't it better to use AFS instead, so you can better control the session while  programming?<br />
<br />
