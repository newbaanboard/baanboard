(Service Orders, Invoices, Agreements etc)<br />
<br />
We have recently tried to use MS reporting services (.rdl) files created using MS visual studio report designer (part of SQL Server 2005's BIDS package).<br />
<br />
It seems that MS report designer is NOT as flexible as the origional baan/infor set up.  Especially in the areas of conditional header &amp; footer layouts.<br />
MS Report designer can only accomodate a signle header and footer per report.<br />
<br />
Is anyone one else trying to use MS report designer / reporting services to format output forms (not to be confused with usual reports)?<br />
<br />
What are most of you using to format your orders, invoices, etc?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Strictly spoken this is true, but within headers and footers you can do a lot of things conditionally. Moreover, you can decide to remove the page header and use the first row(s) of a tablix as page header. In that case you can easily include data from your dataset in the page header.</div></div><hr />
