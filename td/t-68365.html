<br />
I'd like to create a Report selection list like in the tccom4400m000 Business Partners session (see also the attached screenshot). Here I can select a Report out of the Printer mask and not out of the menu.<br />
How can I realize that? I haven't found it yet in the forms. Is there an instruction available?<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Bernd</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you mean you want this selection window to select the report? If yes, then all you need is to attach the reports to the session and compile the session. Now, if the program script has rprt_open() under choice.print section, you will get the pop up window for selection the report you want to print.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaBernd</div><div class="date">13th November 2015, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Bhushan,<br />
<br />
yes, that's exactly what I want.<br />
<br />
then all you need is to attach the reports to the session and compile the session<br />
You mean, in classical Infor reports, attaching a Report to a session is create a Report in &quot;Reports&quot;-Session ttadv3530m000 and add a new data set. Starting the creation with Report Generator or not, doesn't matters?<br />
<br />
if the program script has rprt_open() under choice.print section<br />
I didn't find this function within the program script &quot;tccom4400&quot; for Business Partners, too. But I only can open the old Version B61U-a7-stnd. For the new Version B61-a8-stnd we have no licence or the source code. Maybe rprt_open() is only included in the newer Version, which I can't check.<br />
<br />
I will check your description anyway. If it won't work I will create a new Version of the program script with the rprt_open() inside.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Bernd</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Keep the group number same as the other reports. Just use a new sequence number while adding the report to the session.<br />
2. Create the report in your current VRC to avoid problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks. Was a important hint, cause I've meanwhile thought about how to write the Report Name. :-)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaBernd</div><div class="date">13th November 2015, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Bhushan,<br />
maybe you can help me again.<br />
Now I've created a new Report. But I'd like to Keep most parts of the original Report in the new one. So how can I copy These layouts in the classic Infor Report tool between this reports?<br />
I've thought first I can do that with the &quot;fill / read buffer&quot; Option in the layout Editor. But it seems not to work.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Bernd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaBernd</div><div class="date">13th November 2015, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for questioning.<br />
Now I've found the correct way:<br />
In &quot;Layouts...&quot; in the Menu &quot;Secific&quot; the Option &quot;Copy from other layouts...&quot;<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Bernd</div></div><hr />

<br />
is there also a way to copy a classic infor Report into a new Report?<br />
Should I open a new thread for this question?<br />
<br />

<br />
What do you mean by copying a report? Do you want to copy it to a new VRC with same code or duplicate it with a new code?<br />
<br />
Both the options are possible as mentioned below- <br />
<br />
1. Copy to current VRC by selecting the existing report<br />
2. Duplicate the report and give a new report code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd like to duplicate a Report rename it as a new Report and will Change some Report code or better parts of the layout.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">17th November 2015, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll need to copy the report in the maintain reports session ttadv3530m000. There you can copy an existing report into a new one. Then link this new report to the print session (in the reports-subsession of the session ttadv2500m000).<br />
<br />
Don't forget to compile the new report and the labels first. I've had some issues with this (LN would not show any reportselection, after linking a new reports without compiling the label of the reportname first). A compile of the session itself may also be needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaBernd</div><div class="date">17th November 2015, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Andreas,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for this helpful instructions. Meanwhile I've recognized that I can left away a lot of the layouts so I've copied the rest manually.<br />
<br />
But the next Report is still waiting ;-). Then I Need this instructions. And I think especially the hint for handling the Labels, cause I very often put new Label in afterwards.<br />
