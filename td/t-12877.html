<br />
I have a basic question. In case of a standard session of Baan where the source code is not available, is it possible to stop a message that is popping-up while entering data in the session. This message is from the standard script, which is not relevant and need to be discarded. Is there a way out?<br />
<br />
Please let me know....<br />
<br />
Thanks.....<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 13:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you be a bit more specific, like session code, field and message?  Then we'll be able to replay it on our systems, and see whether there is a &quot;default&quot; way out, meaning that Baan (or a customer! ;)) has thought of it before, and that the message can be switched off by some parameter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While we try to match purchase invoices with orders, in the session &quot;Match Receipts&quot; (tfacp1131s000), if the invoice date is earlier than the receipt (of goods) date then the system gives a message &quot;Invoice date earlier than receipt date&quot;. It is only a warning and it reapeats for all the lines we are trying to match for an invoice. Can this message be avoided, or else it is irritating for the end user to say yes to this message always.<br />
<br />
Hope this explains very clearly.<br />
<br />

John.</div></div><hr />

I tried finding a similar message on the Dutch system available from where I am now, and can not find it! :(  Do you perhaps have the message code?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmathew</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Nico,<br />
<br />
The details of the message is given below;<br />
<br />
&quot;tfacp1131.1&quot;<br />
&quot;Receipt Date later than Invoice Date, continue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope this information is enough.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Perfect information!  Only a pity that you must be on a different SP than this customer :(, because there is no such message in this system!  Somebody else will have to help! Sorry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">This seems to have been introduced with solution 128028 and refined with solution 130279 (only appears once during the process, not per line).<br />
<br />
I don't think there is a parameter to stop it.<br />
<br />
If you have source, I think the functionality is in tfacp1131.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">We had exactly the same problem.<br />
<br />
This &quot;improved&quot; message has been removed in later solutions for that object.  Have a look for the latest solution on www.support.baan.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 00:13</div></div><div class="posttext">And if you do not have source you could probably use the Extend source code solution in the code and utilities forum to suppress this error. Not an easy solution to implement but it MAY be possible, just hard to say without having source code.  This method is better suited for adding functionality rather than suppressing functionality.  Since we own qkey we have used it to suppress some simple checks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Wish I could supress some unnecessary messages in the standard programs as well. <br />
If I choose to print a report, but decide to cancel it, why do I need to get a standard message &quot;Printing Cancelled&quot; ??????<br />
I don't get such a message when I cancel a printjob in Word or Excel or whatever Windows program. End-users are getting RSI from this behaviour.<br />

You must be joking, or cancelling a lot of reports, which maybe points to some other problem... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 10:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Not just from this particular message, but from all messages together they get on a day; yes. It was just my example to show that many of the messages may be unnecessary.<br />
