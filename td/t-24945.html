<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Gurus,<br />
i have a problem in replacement of some functions to make my sessions run in Webtop.<br />
Here's the situation:<br />
I made a session which selects a file on the client and transfers it to the server. There you can browse the folder by means of a gbf function from tgbrg0019 (select.file). Your'e also able to view the content of the file with a function from the library ttdlldisplay (view.file) which uses the Baan display browser to show the content. So far so good. Every thing works fine.<br />
Now i tried to make this session runnable under Webtop.<br />
I get the File Browser to work by changing the used gbf librarys from tggbf to ttgbf. But i have problems to find an alternative to the ttdlldisplay. The view.file function did not work in Webtop because it's a 3gl-function.<br />
I think this function is also the one Baan uses for printing to Display. So the alternative in Webtop is to create a HTML file and send it to the Client. That's the way Baan do it when printing to Display in Webtop. So i searched the Tools-librarys by means of bic_info6.2. In ttstp_stddll i found some functions related to thin client all beginning with 'tc.'. One of them is a function called tc.send.report.html.file which i tried to use.<br />
This function indeed produces a html-file and sends it to the client but with no content in it. The showable file is found by the function because it is removed by it after calling.<br />
So what have to be done to get the content of a file displayed in Webtop?<br />
Maybe the guys from SSA/Baan looking around the board can give a hint how this can be obtained.<br />
