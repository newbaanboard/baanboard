<br />
Does somebody have experience on call a generic dll function via command, and get the result?<br />
<br />
Something like call otcdll001.helloword, via ba, and get the result &quot;Hello world&quot;?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

You can call a Dll extern function and get returned a string..But dont think you want that.</div></div><hr />

It basically ran the DLL function and wrote to a file.  This way I you could run ba6.1 executable and get the data.  Then I could read the file if needed - never did really use it and doubt I even have the code anymore.</div></div><hr />

Smart idea!<br />
Basically, I think it caused that ba6.1 executable method is asynchronous, not synchronization method. <br />
Of course, in a general session or dll to store the result to 'TMP' place, then access the 'TMP' place using the GUID key, could be a smart idea. Something like MQ etc.<br />
What's your idea?<br />

Thanks.<br />
