<br />
Hope someone can advise.<br />
<br />
I need to print a report that contains all the items from a BOM structure from table tibom010 and these items need to be sorted by selection code (tiitm001.csel).<br />
<br />
My problem is that I failed to sort the report by selection code. I am using session tibom1411m000<br />
<br />
To print the report, user only require to select the parent item.<br />
<br />
I have access only to report script, not program script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">10th October 2006, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">May be it is not important not to have source. I think that you want to change sorting type. Try to add field tiitm001.csel to report. Add sort your report according to this field. Don't forget to compile your report.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th October 2006, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Let us know if mr_suleyman suggestion works for you.  If not there is another solution using only the report script - just be forewarned that it is not easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">10th October 2006, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that tiitm001.csel is directly available -- what should it belong to: tibom010.mitm or tibom010.sitm?<br />
<br />
So, you could have a look at my thread http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9090 where I described some time ago what to do in such situations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th October 2006, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">And if you need to actually sort by the tiitm001.csel field then see this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=1908&amp;highlight=report+sort).

<br />
I understand your approach. Now I have problem with the sort function.<br />
<br />
I am using Compaq Tru64 Unix V5.1B. At operating system prompt, I can use the follwing to sort a file called sort.tmp<br />
<br />
sort -t &quot;|&quot; -k 2 sort.tmp -o sort.tmp<br />
<br />
In BaaN report script, how can I use this sort function with run.baan.porg ?<br />
<br />
I tried the following but without any success.<br />
<br />
i = run.baan.prog(&quot;sort&quot;,&quot;-t| -k 2&quot; &amp; &quot;sort.tmp&quot; &amp; &quot;-o&quot; &amp; &quot;sort1.tmp&quot;, RP_WAIT)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I think -K argument is invalid. Pls  check sort6.1 -? to check for valid options .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fallguyjg</div><div class="date">18th October 2006, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">hi teddybear,<br />
<br />
you should use the following syntax within a baan script:<br />
<br />
i = run.prog(&quot;sort&quot;, &quot;-t '|' -k 2 sort.tmp -o sort.tmp&quot;, RP_WAIT, &quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<br />
<br />
this calls the unix sort command.<br />
<br />
hope this hepls,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nad2006</div><div class="date">7th December 2006, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I am working on bw (baanIV_c) <br />
<br />
Because my report session is very slow, I moved all totals from program script to report script. My report is grouped by tccom010.seak. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
after.tccom010.seak.10:<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
balan.amnt = tot.home_0 + tot.home_1 + tot.home_2 + tot.home_3 + tot.home_4 + tot.home_5 + tot.home_6 + tot.home_7<br />
<br />
if balan.amnt &lt;&gt; 0 then<br />
	perc = (abs(balan.cost / balan.amnt)) * 100<br />
else<br />
	perc = 0<br />
endif<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
This report requires to be sorted by balan.amnt. On input field section I have :<br />
Balan.amnt	Descending  	1<br />
Tccom010.seak	Ascending	2<br />
<br />
But whatever I am doing on the sort seq number its ignoring the balan.amnt sort<br />
<br />
Then I tried to add the logic suggested above to the report script:<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
#define ORIGINAL.FUNCTION()     originally.generated.r.sort()<br />
#define r.sort()      ORIGINAL.FUNCTION()<br />
<br />
functions:<br />
<br />
#undef  r.sort()<br />
<br />
function        extern r.sort()<br />
{<br />
        |**<br />
        |* call the original function and do some additional stuff<br />
        |**<br />
        ORIGINAL.FUNCTION()<br />
	r.sorttab(1) = 1<br />
	e = run.prog( &quot;sort&quot;, &quot;-t'|' -k 1 &quot; &amp; r.datafile$ &amp; &quot; -o &quot; &amp; r.datafile$, RP_WAIT )<br />
	if ( e &lt; 0 ) then<br />
		message(&quot;Sorterror %d: The sort process can not start.&quot;, e )<br />
	endif<br />
}	<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
******After the output file generated, I want this function to sort by Balan.amnt (1st sort field in my list). There is no error on compilation but this is not doing any change to the results: completely ignored) <br />
<br />
Would you tell me, please, if there is any thing wrong with adding this function to force a second sort by field 1 (balan.amnt), or if there any easy way to get this sort done properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th December 2006, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure the report will be quicker than the session script.  Maybe if you posted more information someone might know a method or something to speed up the script.<br />
<br />
Anyway are the tot.home variables passed in one record to the report?  If so then see the link in one of my above posts.  It demonstrates how you can a field to the report records to change the sort.  Basically what you do is add the total field as an input.  Then in the after.receive.data you can read the temp file, add the fields up, re-write the temp file, then run the sort.  Then when the read routine kicks in it will find the data sorted and all fields filled.  <br />
<br />
What you currently posted will not work because you can not sort by a field that is filled in an after.field layout.  I think you need everything sorted before the printing begins - at least if I understand your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th December 2006, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Re the performance of the report , I would suggest u  to go through this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=28569)  , which can improve the performance susbstantially. The dll in the thread uses the summarizing using memory as against disk based slow grouping which Baan reporing is  using .<br />
<br />
As Mark suggested modifying a sortfield in the reportscript only complicates . U may probably work around with re-sorting the file which i would not recommend due to slower performance .<br />
<br />
As regards descending sort on the group total, I would reocmmend u can use the grouping using the dll functions in the thread aforesaid . After the grouping is over , u need 1 more descending sort on the balan.amnt .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">11th December 2006, 10:26</div></div><div class="posttext">#define ORIGINAL.FUNCTION()     originally.generated.r.sort()<br />
#define r.sort()      ORIGINAL.FUNCTION()<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, but that's doesn't work. My original suggestions redefines r.write.seq.file(); it concerns adding some missing data that can be determined during looking to detail, or storing detail data to retrieve them during the regular report processing later on.<br />
<br />
The typical problem &quot;what is the percentage of the totals&quot; could be done as mentioned in my suggestion. But: Sorting on the percentage is a bit more tricky, because you need to program a new, separate loop to calculate the total before you process the first record!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th December 2006, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">As u get the grouped values  with use of the dll mentoned earlier , all u need to do is to write one additional function to sort the numeric values in the array of accumulators . And then use the sorted information (top / down values ) .  Alternatively u can do the sorting in the report .<br />
<br />
Performance wise first option will be good (u should use pre-sorted option in report) . In the 2nd alternative u dont have to write extra thing and still accomplish the result just by changing the report sorting .<br />
<br />
With this dll , questions like  'What is the % of group total ' can be easily answered by importing the array of group values in before.report section and using the same in report. Weighted averages too are extremely easy just by dividing one accumulator with another correct accumulator .<br />
<br />
PS - Do not forget to use free.mem function in the program script and report script as soon as it's no longer needed (e.g . in program scrip after rprt_close ), as the memory is vey important scarce resource to be used judiciously .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nad2006</div><div class="date">12th December 2006, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your answers. <br />
To make my report runs faster there is, for now, only one way is to review my select statement in the program script. For the sorting, I find a way to generate a temp data file that I use as input from my program script to send it to another report with detail layout section that allows me to sort it (Asc/Desc) and it's working fine. <br />
<br />
For the performance, I'll try Hitesh 's suggestion  with using the dll. <br />
