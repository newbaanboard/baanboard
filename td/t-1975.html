Some coworkers and I were having a discussion on some development project we are working on.  <br />
<br />
It involves adding a new column to a custom table we use.<br />
<br />
The table (Lets call it &quot;tisfc999&quot;) currently contains 5 columns - we will add a 6th.<br />
<br />
Person A Says:<br />
<br />
We need to perform a &quot;Where Used Report&quot; on the table name to find all sessions/scripts/DLL's that access the table and re-compile them.   Otherwise - any program that uses SQL in the following format:<br />
<br />
Select tisfc999.*<br />
from   tisfc999<br />
where........<br />
<br />
Will not return the correct data because of the table change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Person B Says:<br />
<br />
That shouldn't be the case - identifying and re-compiling some 200 sessions/scripts/DLL's that access this table will be a waste of time and is not required.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since neither person would budge on their opinion - I wanted to post the question to www.baanboard.com and get some opinions and answers.</div></div><hr />

I've done this many times.  <br />
<br />
Person B is right.</div></div><hr />
