<br />
I have to read file form the server in a directory.<br />
the file name format would be:<br />
ITM-XXXXXXX-PART-MMDDYYHHMMSS<br />
<br />
There would be several such files on the server.<br />
I have to pick the latest file ov the current date.(MMDDYY).<br />
<br />
Is there any Baan function which can sort the files in the path and pick the <br />
latest one of current date after which, i can transfer the file using server2client?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You can make use of &quot;file.stat&quot; get the list of files in the directory in a flat file in sort order you want and then accordingly pick the file you want .<br />
<br />
Hope this helps .<br />

There are no ready-made functions in Baan to do this, but you are on Unix so you can use the find command options:<br />
<br />
-atime n	True if the file access time subtracted from the initialized time is n-1 to n multiples of 24 h.  The initialization time shall be a time between the invocation of the find utility and the first access by that invocation of the find utility to any file specified by its path operands.  The access time of directories in pathname_list is changed by find itself.<br />
<br />
-mtime n	True if the file modification time subtracted from the initialization time is n-1 to n multiples of 24 h.  The initialization time shall be a time between the invocation of the find utility and the first access by that invocation of the find utility to any file specified in its path operands.<br />
<br />
-ctime n	True if the time of last change of file status information subtracted from the initialization time is n-1 to n multiples of 24 h.  The initialization time shall be a time between the invocation of the find utility and the first access by that invocation of the find utility to any file specified by its path operands.<br />
<br />
-newer file	True if the current file has been modified more recently than the argument file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had came across similar things but on windows.<br />
i used - run.prog(&quot;command.com&quot;,&quot;/c dir *_%date:~7,2%_%date:~4,2%_%date:~10,4% &quot; &gt; c:\&quot; &amp; fname ,RP_NOWAIT)<br />
<br />
<br />
(file was of the format xxx_03_02_2009.xxx )<br />
<br />
i.e i used to pick the file name by today's date and place the name of the file in another file.<br />
<br />
I assume this helps .!!<br />

<br />
Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
i used the find command in shell in the following way.<br />
<br />
shell(&quot;find /export/home/users/gssapatw –name ‘*-020409*’ &gt;fileout&quot;,0)<br />
<br />
i am expecting the list of files in fileout which is a tmp file created using creat.tmp.dir().<br />
<br />
However I  am not getting the list.<br />
Manually if i use this command i get the list correctly.<br />
<br />
I am i missing something?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

shell(&quot;find /export/home/users/gssapatw –name ‘*-020409*’ &gt;fileout&quot;,0)<br />
the name string should be within double or single quotes and not starting with ` (grave-accent)<br />
Example command line usage:<br />
find /app/lms/lmss/opt/bse/tmp -name 'tmp*08*'<br />
or<br />
find /app/lms/lmss/opt/bse/tmp -name &quot;tmp*08*&quot;</div></div><hr />

The functions in question are:<br />
dir.open, dir.entry, dir.close<br />
<br />
<br />
long dir<br />
string path(1024)<br />
string dirent(1024)<br />
<br />
path = &quot;.... my path...&quot;<br />
dir = dir.open(path)<br />
if dir &lt; 0 then<br />
  *problem with path* <br />
  return<br />
endif<br />
while 1  | loop for all files in directory<br />
        dirent = dir.entry(dir, TFILE,<br />
                      type, size, mode)<br />
        if dirent = &quot;&quot; then<br />
            *no more files*<br />
             break<br />
        else<br />
            *process file, filename is stored  in dirent*<br />
        endif<br />
endwhile<br />
dir.close(dir)<br />
<br />
Function dir.open creates a static snapshot of a directory. Files created by another process after dir.open will not be read within loop.</div></div><hr />
