We share a server with another location that needs to print reports in lang 4 (french), standard is english.<br />
<br />
How do you program the script to print the report in language 4.  The BaaN companies are different companies.<br />
<br />
I not a BaaN &quot;programmer&quot; so be nice....:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 08:42</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't know programming , you can add 4 different reports to your program. When They run session they will see 4 choices (FR / ENG / ... )<br />
To add report to your session, go main session and then add your reports to session's report part. That's All.<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 09:59</div></div><div class="posttext">The language depends from the user. Normaly you only have to copy the report to language 4 and compile it. If the user has also language 4, baan should take the french report automaticaly. <br />

Like csecgn (what a name...) says, the system language - i.e. user's language - is used as default, so if indeed the user is working in language 4, then all you need to do, is stand on the report, and via 'specific' select 'copy to other language'. Don't forget to compile (Ctrl+F9 or 'Specific' -&gt; compile) <br />
<br />
If system language &lt;&gt; 4 and the only thing that determines the required language is the business partner's language, then it is very easy to program this. All you need to do is select the BP's language, and open the report in that specific language</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason Patte</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I thought I had it but the issue is the users language must be english (all menus and reports must be in english).  However the only one report needs to be in lang 4 (SFC Order).  The employees on the factory floor can't can't english but all the office staff can.<br />
<br />
Make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you own the source? What report is it exactly about? Standard Baan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvpBaaN</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two approaches - temporarily change the user's language (which is not preferred) or create a new user with language as 4, only for SFC work.<br />
If both these are not possible, then you have to do it programmatically. In this approach, it depends on the command used to call the report. Check the command (could be rprt_send or brp.ready or print.report or spool.report) - check the help of the command used. You will find a parameter for langauage. Here, you can set the language as 4 if company number is the France company number...<br />
Hope this helps...if not, tell the report command...<br />

<br />
Copy the existing Report to a new Report No. in the same group.<br />
Link it to the Current Session.<br />
So, automatically a Selection window will pop-up at Runtime ( To select One of them)<br />
<br />
If I am not wrong...the data will surely be in English....but the labels will be in the Language u want....for the understanding of person at Shop Floor.<br />
<br />
So edit the new report &amp; only change the labels to required language.<br />
I mean create labels in BaaN - English Language but actually in French alphabets....( I think I have confused u more )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 09:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Beginner, this is exactly what suleyman also suggested. Of course this is an option, and is easy, but not so neat. This means that all users that use this session, will always have one moe step (=click) in their procedure; something users love moaning about...<br />
<br />
I personally find, that - IF Jason has access to the source - this should be done programmatically; this is very easy, not complicated at all. Jason, if you send me the complete program script, I will apply the necessary changes for you, with pleasure. Even if you don't own sources, you could do this still using AFS. A bit more work, but also no problem at all. Let us know Jason what you opt for...<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

I too thought this would be the easiest choice.  Copy the current report and add the new report to the report selection when running session &quot;print order documents&quot;.  Then the user can select either the english report or the &quot;english&quot; report with french label translations.  I tried it but when I changed the labels on the new report it also changed the labels to french in the english report in other BaaN companies (which is bad).<br />
<br />
Script modification to print the new french report when printed from the new company would be best, I think.<br />
<br />
I apprectiate all the suggestions and will continue to ask for help and let you all know how this newbie makes out... :)</div></div><hr />

I'm running into the same issue here where the menus have to be in english, but some of the reports must report in Polish.  These reports are standard (without source) but exist in english and polish language.   Our goal is to avoid setting the language to Polish for the Polish users.  But these specific internal reports must be printed in Polish.<br />
<br />
How would you go about using the AFS to do this?  I've done a few AFS sessions in the past so I have an idea of the functionality.  The way I'm figuring is I would have to create an AFS session for each session that I want to be able to print in Polish?  Is that correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
