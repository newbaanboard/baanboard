<br />
Let's say i have a table field having a value tdcus015.field=&quot;baanboard&quot;, now i want to extract characters from 5th to 8 in my variable , that means it should give me result as var = &quot;boar&quot;<br />
<br />
how can i achieve it, the type of field is string, also let me know how can i do it if this field would have been of type long ?<br />

<br />
As for a long: what do you want to extract?  It is a binary value!  If you need to extract characters from it, you will first have to convert it to a string, and then use the subscripting technique again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">26th May 2003, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as soon i posted this post , it ried it myself also &amp; was able to figure out. initially i was doing tdcus015.field(2:4)<br />
<br />
which was having syntax related problem, anyway what if if this field would have a binary value such as tdcus015.field = 123456<br />
<br />
so in this case also i would first take this field in a string by using str$ function and then do string_var( 2;4) &amp; that will solve my problem and if in case i need to do some calculations with this variable let's say 2 * string_var, then i have to first convert this srting back into integer using lval() function , &amp; then do the calculation.<br />
<br />
Am i right?<br />

In order to us wild cards use 'In' operator. U can see it's help under 'expr.compile' function.</div></div><hr />
