<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">18th July 2011, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently our Product Constraints use arithmetic operators on our Routing, namely the routing value  'run_time'  where we say something like &quot;Run_time = Run_time + CalcAdd&quot;  for example in the constraints.<br />
<br />
I have been asked if we can do the same type of manipulation for the &quot;Setup&quot; Time value in the Routings.  Can I manipulate that value in a similar manner as the Run_time constant?<br />
<br />
I have no documentation on the details of the product constraint programming values like this.  Can anyone please help ?   Thanks !<br />

We do it using a dll called by the contraint in the generic routing so I haven't tested doing it directly in the constraint.<br />
But the point is - our setup time is calculated.<br />
<br />
hope that helps (in a minor way!)<br />

<br />
That would be over my head  hee hee ..<br />
<br />
I did however play around with a constraint on my test server and tried setup_time  similar to run_time in the constraint and it did pass compilation. I will report back if I get anywhere with this .....<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip however ...</div></div><hr />
