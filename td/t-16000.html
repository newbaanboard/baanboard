<br />
I have a small problem. One of print session (wninh4440m00, Print load) prints two reports, one is Loading instruction and other is Delivery instruction against the load identification number. <br />
<br />
I want to get the report name in the device script. I tried to get the report name using spool.report. This spool.report always return only one report name (the second report name), even though the spool.id returns the different value of spool Id. what could be reson? <br />
Is there any other way that I check which report is going to print. Getting report name is not important, just wanted to know, is Loading instrcution is going to print or Delivery instruction.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

It should work.</div></div><hr />
