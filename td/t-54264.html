Another application is writing in baan-tables (specially dedicated for this), baan is reading from these tables to insert sales orders/lines. (One table for header, one for lines).<br />
Now a problem has arised: Some orders only get some of the lines, no errors detected at all.<br />
People from the other application suspect that we read the data while they are still writing. They 'commit' after all is written.<br />
Can this happen? Can baan read the data before it is committed by the other application? And if so, under what circumstances?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason was that the application commits on every inserted line.<br />
<br />
You can check this at all or make the other application activate a trigger to start your program. In this case the program will start only if the application finish the other process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In some databases &quot;dirty reads&quot; are impossible (like in Oracle), in some databases it depends, like in Informix.<br />
<br />
Not sure aboyut SQL Server in this case. My assumption was, we have by default read consitency here. But in SQL Server you can influence the isolation level/granularity for example with the &quot;set tranaction isolation level&quot; statement.<br />
<br />
So it is technically possible.</div></div><hr />
