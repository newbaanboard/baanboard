  Now my mfg. consuitant wants to prevent every user who have been assigned as super users to avoid the pain of authorizing them,to use the parameter menu in the stnd.baan menu tccom00000.now for that i suggested to change the menu structure by removing it from the tc menu.<br />
 so can anybody tell me the exact procedure how i can prevent the users from accessing the parameter menu in tc,but allow the instructor to do so.<br />
thnx.</div></div><hr />

What we did in a case like this was to make the super-users normal users, grant them everything.  Then we went in and removed only those session we did not want them to have - in our case mostly tools sessions.<br />
<br />
Removing the session from the menu will not really keep them from having access.  All they need to know is the session name to run it. So I would make them normal users.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">mark_h is correct - if the user knows the session number they can choose to enter it through the File / Run Program option on the main menu.  But you can turn that off by user - User Management &quot;Call Session by Code&quot; option can be turned off.<br />
<br />
To remove access via the menus, which Parameters session are you referring to?  There are many...one on each Module's menu.  To control access via menu to all parameters sessions, you will need a modified menu for each Module that calls the parameters sessions.  Then, a modified Main Menu (tccom00000000) that calls your new custom menus for each module.  You then replace the user's Start Up menu (in Maintain Users) to the modified Main Menu.   Be sure to do the converts all over the place.<br />
<br />
Also, then, they have access to all the tools sessions, I assume.  They would still be able to go into Maintain Sessions, look up the session, and run it that way.  You can control that by menu too I guess, since you are in there modifying all the menus.<br />
<br />
All of this still does not take into account any zooms that are in place to go to those sessions, or, if they really know what they are doing, they can modify their menu quickly and get to them anyway.   <br />
<br />
So, it sure is a lot of work.   Seems easier to do it the &quot;normal user&quot; way as Mark suggests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the related few parm sessions, our near-absolute soln is to rename (in unix) the related form object. After we broadcast that the session will be off-limits (and we rename the form object), when the session is subsequently invoked,  a fatal error will occur.<br />
<br />
On the rare occasion that a parm value requires change, we will reinstate the form to allow the change by appropriate personnel, and then deactivate again.<br />
