Then in the init.form section (this is for baanERP and baanIV, maybe in Ln must be init.group, I donÂ´t have LN) if the variable with the number is not empty then use ignore.first.event = true, assign to tisfc001.pdno the order number and execute(find.data). <br />
<br />
zoom.from.all:<br />
on.entry:<br />
         import(&quot;variable in the first process&quot;, variable in tisfc0101m000)<br />
<br />
form.1: (or group.1)<br />
init.form:<br />
       if not isspace(variable in tisfc0101m000) then<br />
            ignore.first.event = true<br />
            tisfc001.pdno = variable in tisfc0101m000<br />
            execute(find.data)<br />
       endif <br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you.</div></div><hr />

But you could clone the session to a new session with the find set as the start option(same forms and scripts). Then in the calling session you might be able to set tisfc001.pdno(or LN equivalent)to the order you want.<br />
<br />
Something else I thought about(and again I do not know about LN), but hesitate to recommend is to change the user defaults.  There is a tools table that has what the session was last exited with(like save defaults), you could try parsing that out and updating it with what you want.  I do not know if that exists in LN.</div></div><hr />

i'm on 5.0c and don't know if it's available on LN, but<br />
maybe you can try this:<br />
<br />
Search for the functions in tools ttstpextstart (by equivalent of bic_info6.2).<br />
In 5.0c there is a function in it called:<br />
start.filtered.session( const string sess_code(), const long comp_id, const string c_select(), const string c_from(), const string c_where() )<br />
<br />
With this function you are able to start a session filtered.<br />
Hint: the second argument has to be called by reference.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />

from your attached file i saw that this is not a type 2 session. I don't know this one.<br />
But maybe you can try the following.<br />
When starting tisfc0101.. try press Ctrl+Shift+4.<br />
It should give you the select statement that the 4GL-Engine executes on session startup.<br />
Maybe you can find some hints there.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 14:36</div></div><div class="posttext">In the script of tisfc0101 the next can be found: import(&quot;zoom.pdno&quot;, tisfc001.pdno)<br />
So if you set in the initiating session the variable zoom.pdno to the wished order number then it will do the trick. zoom.pdno must be defined as external.<br />

<br />
Thanks for all your suggestions. But we are still stuck up. Let me explain what we exactly want.<br />
<br />
We have created a display/maintain session from where a user can see multiple production orders and other related details e.g Sales Orders.<br />
<br />
Now from this session the user wants to zoom to a Standard Session of Maintain production Order or Maintain Sales Order against that particular selected record.<br />
<br />
While zooming to standard session we are not exactly able to zoom to the selected record, but the default record (last viewed).<br />
<br />
Please note that we don't have scripts of standard session, hence we cannot make any changes in Standard Session.<br />
<br />
Awaiting your fresh suggestions<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlluRajasekhar</div><div class="date">29th November 2007, 09:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Navin,<br />
There is a way to solve your issue. Please do the following in your latest session that you have developed. I have tried this approach and it works for me. I have tried it on Baan IV C4 environment.<br />
<br />
For Maintain Production/Sales Order Session<br />
<br />
Before user zooms to Production/Sales Orders session assign the current order number to the concerned table field. In this case tisfc001.pdno. For Sales Orders Session it will be tdsls040.orno.<br />
<br />
before.zoom:<br />
tisfc001.pdno = assign Prod. Order number here<br />
zoom.to$(&quot;tisfc0101s000&quot;, Z.SESSION, &quot;your customized session here&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
<br />
Please follow the same for Maintain Sales Orders Session too. However, please note that you should mention session as tdsls4101s000. This subsession will also do the same as session tdsls4101m000 does. Same is the case for production orders session also. Instead of tisfc0101m000 use tisfc0101s000.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlluRajasekhar</div><div class="date">29th November 2007, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Naveen,<br />
Forgot to add this info in my earlier reply.<br />
<br />
The start option for tisfc0101m000 is 44 while the start option for tisfc0101s000 is 7. This small diff. solves ths issue. Same is the case for tdsls4101s000 too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">29th November 2007, 12:28</div></div><div class="posttext">For LN when zooming to tisfc0101m000 you should use:<br />
<br />
before.zoom:<br />
zoom.pdno = assign Prod. Order number here<br />
zoom.to$(&quot;tisfc0101s000&quot;, Z.SESSION, &quot;your customized session here&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">som.papai</div><div class="date">29th November 2007, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
Thanks for all your suggestions.<br />
I also do it with start option 7 and 44 it's not working in session tisfc0101m100.<br />
<br />
I also do it in session tisfc0101s000, it's not working.<br />
The start option of session tisfc0101s000 is 0 ,so i make a copy to<br />
my current Package VRC with start option 44 and 7,but still  it's not working.<br />
<br />
I also have a another work to open a another standard session tfacp2522m000 from my customized session.<br />
<br />
It's start option is 7,so made a copy in my current VRC with start option 44,<br />
so that the last save one will show.<br />
For that i write AFS to find with particular Business Partner then end the session.  <br />
But still when i open the session tfacp2522m000  after AFS function it's not opening with correct one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Awaiting your fresh suggestions<br />

Can you post your code so that anyone out there can try it out and help you. I will also give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">som.papai</div><div class="date">10th December 2007, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
Thankx for ur Suggestion.<br />
It's done by this code.<br />
<br />
query.extend.where.in.zoom(&quot;tisfc001.pdno = '&quot; &amp; timsl314.pdno &amp; &quot;'&quot;)<br />
zoom.to$(&quot;tisfc0101m100&quot;,Z.SESSION,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,0)<br />
<br />
In Ln query.extend.where.in.zoom does like same as in baan before.program section query.extension .<br />
