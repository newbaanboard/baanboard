<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanlover</div><div class="date">1st September 2003, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Try running Create Runtime for that Table. Select Domain also along with table and reconfigure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmathew</div><div class="date">1st September 2003, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
We have tried the Create Runtime with the Domains box checked, but still the error remains.<br />
<br />
Could anybody tell the directory in the server where the data definitions reside so that we could do something manually. While we create a new table, which are the directories in the server where data is created.<br />

Thanks,<br />

Check the Event viewer and log files also and see any error is there for that table ? U can check the details of that table in the folder &lt;dict&gt;\&lt;your package comb&gt;\d&lt;package name &amp;module name&gt;</div></div><hr />

      I will suggest , first do convert runtime DD for complete range( there may some comp. need to get converted to DD)<br />
<br />
and then run create runtime for you package and your table with reconfig. table flag equal to &quot;Yes&quot;<br />
<br />
try this<br />

Check the shared memory. Delete the object (table) from the shared memory and reload the shared memory. Then you will have access to your new field<br />

                      I think the system is not able to find the new data definition for ur table. It happens. Best way is to delete the field what u have added. Do runtime convertion so that the existing definition is same as the old one. Logout n login. Now add the field required then do convert to runtime with reconfigure tables checked. If ur table has any references to other packages then include those packages too while converting to runtime.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps.</div></div><hr />

Can you check the following ?<br />
<br />
Go to &lt;dict&gt;\&lt;your package comb&gt;\d&lt;package name &amp;module name&gt; folder.<br />
<br />
Check if any '.new' extension file has got created for the table for which you have converted RDD. <br />
<br />
Here is example:<br />
Suppose cu is package mod is module,<br />
<br />
if you tried to convert cumod100 after making changes to the table, then in the above said folder cumod100.new file would have got generated.<br />
<br />
Just remove the file  'dcumod100'  from the folder and rename the file 'dcumod100.new' to 'dcumod100'.<br />
<br />
Relogon to BaaN, just run the session 'ttaad4225m000' [Reorganize Tables], that will all do the trick.<br />

<br />
The problem was with shared memory. This problem was solved by deleting the table from shared memory. Earlier we found that this problem is also solved by re-booting the server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frajer</div><div class="date">24th March 2004, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Yesterday evening while converting one table to runtime DD (because of two new fields) I came to the same situation or error:<br />
&quot;field &quot;xxx&quot; not found with rdi.column&quot;<br />
<br />
But - this morning while I was searching baanboard and found your thread I checked that table again: a miracle!!! Error was gone. Fine for me. But why? I did not do anything else then CRDD.  Was it 'shared memory' :confused: <br />
<br />
Anyway. I have a question: How the table could be deleted from shared memory?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th March 2004, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Did the Baan application or server get restarted?  Or maybe even shared memory got restarted.  Also after the convert to runtime did you remember to log off and back-on.  I still forget to do this from time to time.  Just some thoughts.<br />
<br />
Mark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th March 2004, 07:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably  u may have created new domains also for new fields and improper sequencing in convert for domain / tables and logout / login may have caused this error. Just a possibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frajer</div><div class="date">25th March 2004, 08:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx to both. Now I'm sure I forgot to logoff/logon. That's why the error gone the following day.</div></div><hr />
