<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomasm</div><div class="date">24th September 2009, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a need to every month change data on forms for sessions that are in jobs. For example: we work with service orders for the whole next month, but not for the next 30/31 days. So the date on the form should always be the last day in the next month.<br />
<br />
Another example is automated printing of financial data. In some cases this is based on the financial period, so each month we need to change the period.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have some kind of tool where this can be done more efficiently than setting the session in the job again and again, or by changing the string in the jobs table via GTM?<br />
<br />
Any ideas will be appreciated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomasm</div><div class="date">25th September 2009, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your comment, but the problem is not that easy. In my first example I need to keep the date fixed for one month and then change it and keep it fixed for another month.<br />
<br />
In my second example it is not at all a date so the change functionality built into the job system does not apply to this.<br />

At least I did it once for a customer. Don't think Infor has a solution although you can explain it to your account manager and ask him if Infor can fix it.<br />

<br />
1. If u have downloaded earlier the ERPJewels , there is provision for handling periods of unequal days and numeric period indiacators like month / week through front end . Now if  u need it (with latest enhancements) , u need to buy the same from us. Now with 100 million rows in Excel 2010 and all leading reporting tool converging to XL  for BI last mile  , this is worth the price. If u need it , please send me a PM.<br />
<br />
2.  The sample code indicated on this thread to be run just before the job<br />
to change 503 values.<br />
<br />
3. If  u want program specific development , u can write some few lines of code in before.choice of run.job (in absense of run.job , use cont.process) to change the period values dynamically when job.process is true. Not a big problem when program is customised or u have source.</div></div><hr />
