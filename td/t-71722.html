<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asandova</div><div class="date">19th February 2019, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi , I have succesfully configured SSRS and Infor Ln  in order to design my reports in BIDS. <br />
<br />
I'm currently designing an Purchase Order report, and most of the fields are showing their value correctly, but there is this particular variable that is calculated   in the before.layout section, wich shows it's value correctly if I print it via Display device. <br />
<br />
However, no  matter what, when I print it with SSRS ( (designer mode/xml file) or view directly to the report server), this variable has a blank value.  I have tried to declare this variable as external, and I event put it as a report input field.  I tried to print before and after the Display Device,   all to no avail. <br />
<br />
Do you have any suggestion? (The variable is &quot;impuestos&quot;)<br />
<br />
Code :  <br />
after.orco.9:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	otbp.pur4401 = tdpur400.otbp<br />
	tax.exempt.pur4401 = true<br />
<br />
	tdpur.dll0032.calculate.report.totals(			|#860-TAX.sn<br />
		tdpur400.cofc,<br />
		tdpur400.fdpt,<br />
		tdpur400.ccur,<br />
		tdpur400.ratp,<br />
		tdpur400.ratf,<br />
		tdpur400.ratt,<br />
		tdpur400.otbp,<br />
		tdpur400.otad)					|#860-TAX.en<br />
<br />
<br />
|*  hold.cvat.totl is used in report but gets value from tcmcs.dll0160<br />
Impuestos = hold.cvat.totl<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tl;dr :  I can get any table value ( p.e : tdpur400_oamt, tdpur400_odat).   But I can't obtain values from   input fields/variables that are not part  of the main entity.</div></div><hr />
