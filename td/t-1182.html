<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to set 2 indices on a table:<br />
<br />
Terr/cuno/comp/shpt/ctyp/citg/item/year/prno/type<br />
(integer,str,integer,long,str,str,str,integer,integer,enum)<br />
<br />
And<br />
<br />
Terr/cuno/ctyp/shpt/citg/item/comp/year/prno/type<br />
(integer,str,str,long,str,str,integer,integer,integer,enum)<br />
<br />
When I try to set these up - even if I remove my second index and only set up one of them- I get the following error.  <br />
&quot;Index has too many parts&quot;.  This is on my custom table.<br />
<br />
I understand that an index can only have 8 parts - according to the HELP.  What I don't understand is the relationship of the domain types (strings vs longs).  I've seen lots of complex indices in Baan.  I've tried combined fields, but this doesn't help either - I can't convert the table def without error.<br />
<br />
I need the index so I can sort my data naturally in my session.  Users need to input and they need it speedy!<br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone who can help explain this to me!<br />

<br />
 I cannot test it now, since it is Saturday, but I think it should work to have 2 combined fields:<br />
<br />
 cmba = Terr/cuno/comp/shpt/ctyp<br />
 cmbb = /citg/item/year/prno/type <br />
 <br />
 And then set the first index as cmba+cmbb. <br />
<br />
 The same thing for the second index (two combined fields, made of 5 fields each.) <br />
 <br />
 You have said that you have tried combined fields, though....<br />
 Is it still not working? Try this, I hope it works.</div></div><hr />
