I want to create some sample files and upload them</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now all of the custom uploads like this we did in 4c4 was done thru exchange schemes that we developed.  You can search for that.  At this point in time we develop AFS upload scripts that the customers(mainly IT personnel) use to do mass uploads.  Each of these programs exchange schemes and AFS code is specifically designed for our system and our need.  Standard baan does have some defined but we have never used them in our 4c environments.  We have always developed our own load programs like this.  I am not sure about your version and what might be standard.  I know a lot of people on this board use DAL2 to create things like this - maybe not specific to your situation.  So show some patience and hopefully someone with know of your version can give you better guidance than me.  The other alternative is to search the infor support site and see what documentation you can find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">6th August 2016, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">So, what is the volume of each master data you are wanting to upload?<br />
<br />
If the volumes are reasonably small, you may be better served if you use the standard BAAN sessions to enter the master data manually, as the session will validate for any references and such and once done, you are very sure you have very clean master data. Such data entry can be done in what is called a 'gold company' so that it is kept up to date and the data can be copied to any target environment - development, testing, and ultimately production. <br />
<br />
It may take more time to develop the upload programs and test them, and after all that, still have to validate that the master data now in the system is correctly uploaded.  So have to go with a 'cost-benefit' type of approach.<br />
<br />
Also, in order to avoid referential integrity errors, you have to know up front which reference tables to first define and upload. Vendor master has a few references which are mandatory and upload will not be successful without first making sure the reference masters have all been accurately created.<br />
<br />
All in all, it is not a 'small' effort to write one's own data upload programs.</div></div><hr />

I plan upload through Baan Session. The difficulty I have is file input parameters. I don't any sample files. Where can see the file input parameters.  To view such programs, please advise me how to navigate.(Tools &gt; etc. etc).  We are using Baan version - Infor  8.8a3</div></div><hr />
