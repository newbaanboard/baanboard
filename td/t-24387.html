<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">24th June 2005, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a multi-occ display session, in which the user enters search arguments on top half of screen, and results are immediately displayed (upon hitting tab on each field) in the bottom half of the screen. So what I do in the script is a query.extend.where and a rebuild.query/execute.first.set after each search field.<br />
<br />
So far I didn't enable wildcards, i.e. table field contains &quot;ABCDEFGHI&quot; and user enters &quot;AB&quot; gives result, but if user enters &quot;BC&quot; it doesn't give result. Now there was a request to enable wildcard.<br />
<br />
I know there normally is an option to use pos(), but can I get this working also with my query.extend.where clause? Same thing with LIKE operator; I have no idea how I can get that working; made several attemps, so far no result...<br />
<br />
Here is part of my code:<br />
<br />
	nama = strip$(shiftl$(nama))<br />
	set.max(nama.t)<br />
	nama.t = nama &amp; nama.t<br />
<br />
	query.extend.where(&quot;tccom100.nama inrange :nama and :nama.t&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot; and	tccom100.seak inrange :seak and :seak.t&quot; &amp;<br />
               prst.string &amp;<br />
	&quot; and	tccom100.fovn inrange :fovn and :fovn.t&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot; and	tccom100.cadr refers to tccom130&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot; and	exists (select 	tccom110._index1&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot;		from 	tccom110&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot;		where 	tccom110._index1 = {:tccom100.bpid})&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot; and	tccom130.namc inrange :namc and :namc.t&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot; and	tccom130.hono inrange :hono and :hono.t&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot; and	tccom130.name inrange :name and :name.t&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot; and	tccom130.pstc inrange :pstc and :pstc.t&quot; &amp;<br />
	&quot; and	tccom130.ccty inrange :ccty and :ccty.t&quot;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
this works in Baan IV:<br />
<br />
       query.extension = &quot;tdsls001.seak like &quot; &amp; chr$(34) &amp; &quot;.*&quot; &amp;<br />
		strip$(shiftl$(search.seak))&amp; &quot;.*&quot; &amp; chr$(34)<br />
 <br />
<br />
You should be able to use something similar in Baan V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">24th June 2005, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Great Vahdani, this works perfectly! Just the explanation I am still not sure of?? I guess it has to do with the following: Baan translates the queries to the database (driver), and retrieves the result based on conditions, except for LIKE operator, which is only re-filtered within Baan after being fetched from the database. So there might be a conflict between the string closing tags, i.e. &quot; or '.... Does it have to do with this???</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose the reason is that the comiler cannot deal with or understand a line like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
       query.extension = &quot;tdsls001.seak like &quot;.*&quot; &amp; <br />
                                 strip$(shiftl$(search.seak))   &amp; &quot;.*&quot;&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SanttuP</div><div class="date">7th July 2005, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried and tried but cannot get like-expressions to work when session is running. If I initialize the variable in before.program, before query.extension it works fine, but any change in variable value doesn't have any effect. This only happens for the like-expressions. All the other work fine with calling refresh() after initializing variable value.<br />
I have also tried calling execute(first.set) and execute(find.data) but no success.<br />
Any ideas ? Baan IVc4</div></div><hr />

<br />
use the function rebuild.query().<br />
<br />
<br />
       query.extension = &quot;.......&quot;<br />
       rebuild.query()<br />
       execute(find.data)</div></div><hr />

Me dummy. I already saw use of rebuild.query in earlier posting, but it obviously didn't exist in my help-file/Scite-keyword-list (scite by the way is excellent editor, thanks a lot for this forum for finding it). It didn't highligt and I thought then that it must be Baan V funtions. Should've thought twice  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You can fix it by adding them into your baan.properties file.  Just follow the syntax formatting - not hard.</div></div><hr />
