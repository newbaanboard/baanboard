<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">1st February 2018, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I have a question about printing an LN report through DOM.<br />
First of all, I made some modifications to the Maintenance Sales Quotation Documents, and now I'm tying to print using DOM.  The document type has an overlay which is not printing correctly. The overlay is printing off the sides of the report.  It's odd because the exact same overlay works correctly for every other document type...PO, SO, etc.   <br />
I've shortened the width of the report and also shortened the width of the individual layout lines, but the overlay is still printing off the sides of the report.<br />
Does anyone have any other suggestions of how to correct this?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help,<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please try to reduce the overlay size, and see if it fits.<br />
<br />
I have seen strange errors, when the data length does not fit with barcodes.<br />
<br />
Trial and error is the best way, as we do not have control on these dynamic reports.</div></div><hr />
