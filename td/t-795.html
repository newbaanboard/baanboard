<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mikica</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">We generate a new session which used  main table and script of the session tdsls4404m000, but when we calling tdsls4404m000 we got message : <br />
&quot;Unknown formfield printed&quot;<br />
&quot;Unknown formfield inv.date&quot;<br />
and for more 22 fields.<br />
We Create RDD, also we did dump of the forms, also we deleted the new session (which used the script and main table of the tdsls4404m000) but still we have the same problem.<br />
Does anybodody know how to resolve that? <br />
Also we do not have a source code for the session script. <br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Session &quot;Maintain Sessions (ttadv2100m000)&quot; indicates that you are using the script tdsls4404? If not, please enter that script here.<br />
<br />
If yes, please go to that script (Second form, Button &quot;Scripts&quot;):<br />
Is that script in your production VRC or in the Baan Standard VRC?<br />
If it's in the production VRC, than you created a new script and aren't using the Baan standard script any more. If that's true, you have to delete that script, and it should work.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">The error means that you have those two fields on one of your forms but not defined as an extern variable in your compiled program script.  Since those are in the standard Baan program script, I suggest you try ulrich.fuchs' course of action.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit unclear on what exactly was done with each of the components. If you still have problems, perhaps elaborate on what you did to get to where you are now.</div></div><hr />

You were right, after deleting script in customized VRC, it is working without problem.<br />
