Is anybody aware of a normal system process that removes records from the tdpur703 table (Assign Purchase Order Change Codes?).  We have recently started to use change codes to mark PO line items when material is returned due to quality issues.  Last week there were several records, now many of them are gone.  Does Baan remove records from this table when the PO reaches some status?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I know on production orders when you close them you lose certain pieces of information - mainly the link to text.  Just wondering if the close process may do this.<br />

Do you know when this happens?  I checked some of the PO's that information appeared to be missing and their PO lines are at different statuses...</div></div><hr />

When deleting PO's or PO lines the 703 also gets deleted.  Also there is a routine in tdpur4401 that deletes tdpur703 records, but it looks like that is for EDI orders.<br />
