<br />
Need your advise on how to get 'copy to clipboard' to work<br />
<br />
I see that in the standard dashboard, this option works fine.<br />
We can click the first record in the copy range and the last record, and we can copy and paste the range to excel<br />
<br />
But in my customized dashboard, this option is not working. <br />
It only copies one line rather than the range.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to get this to work ?<br />
<br />
thanks n regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
I belive this is problem is not about only copy.to.clipboard function, but in range (global) functions in customized programs.<br />
<br />
I say that becouse my copy.to.clipoboard command works just like yours, only copies the marked records and not the range when in customized sessions, but also global.delete form command doesn't work for customized sessions... never get enabled, even with the standard form command flag marked.<br />
<br />
We've noticed Infor, but got no answer yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rberti</div><div class="date">5th October 2010, 01:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys!<br />
<br />
Accidentaly i've found out why the command global delete wasn't working.<br />
It depends on the TIV number in scripts details. When greater then 1075, global delete doesn't get enabled, but if lower it get's enabled! Thats why most standard programs got this command workin: They were made in an older porting set version, wich current TIV was 1075 at most.<br />
<br />
There are many TIVs avaliable to use in LN, depending on wich porting set you are working on. Some &quot;ghost&quot; problems can be solved changing the TIV number to the one that work with the features we need.<br />
The problem is that the help doesn't explain too much about it, and it is also not always actual as the system that we are working on.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanspider</div><div class="date">5th October 2010, 06:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi rbeti<br />
<br />
What is TIV number? Can we change the TIV number freely?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help on this<br />
<br />
thanks and regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rberti</div><div class="date">5th October 2010, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi baanspider.<br />
<br />
TIV is Tools Interface Version. Every new version, brings new features.<br />
It can be changed freely, according to the porting set od the system.<br />
As I've said, we work here in two installations, the one with the newer p. set is able to work with a TIV number of 1640, and the older 1540, at most. <br />
One difference beetween this numbers of tools interface version is that in the greater one the &quot;select all&quot; standard command works.<br />
For example, if I change the TIV from 1540, default for new programs in our actual porting set, to 1075, the global.delete method works. But if I change it to a higher number, It stops to work.<br />
Another example is in this thread: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=166289#poststop<br />
<br />
My version of the Help only explain features until TIV 1300. But we work all new programs with the version 1540, by default.<br />
<br />
Here it goes what the help file I've got says about it, and you can change TIV number in details of your program script session, ttadv2530m000.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tools Interface Version (TIV)<br />
The Tools Interface Version (TIV) is a concept supported by the Infor ERP LN Enterprise Server to guarantee backwards compatibility. By setting a TIV number to each object the behaviour can be different for incompatible features executed with different versions of the porting set or Infor Enterprise Engine. The TIV number is a property of the program and library scripts, and can be defined in session &quot;Program Scripts / Libraries (ttadv2530m000)&quot;. The bshell also has its own TIV number.<br />
<br />
Determing TIV number<br />
<br />
Developers can determine which TIV number is used in an object or porting set and may use this information to use a different program flow. Next macros are known to determine a TIV number.<br />
<br />
Macro Description <br />
GET.BSHELL.TIV() Returns TIV number of running bshell <br />
GET.TOOLS.TIV() Returns TIV number of tools <br />
GET.OBJECT.TIV() Returns current object's TIV number <br />
GET.OBJECT.TIV(string object) Returns TIV number of specified object <br />
 <br />
Caution<br />
<br />
When updating a component to a higher TIV level, it can be necessary to do rework. This is for example the case when adopting TIV level 1075 (or higher). Whatever the reason is to do the TIV level upgrading, the rework for Record selection must be done. The session will not function with the old record selection mechanism anymore. Mandatory rework is indicated in the table below.<br />
<br />
Supported Porting set TIV numbers<br />
<br />
The supported TIV numbers related to porting set versions are listed below.<br />
<br />
TIV Type Description Remarks <br />
200 bshell original TIV level when TIV was introduced in 4c <br />
500 bshell original TIV level when TIV was introduced in Corelli  <br />
TIV 1000 bshell<br />
<br />
tools<br />
 Initial TIV level for porting set 7.5a  <br />
1001 bshell porting set 7.5a.01 ftp functions added in bshell <br />
1010 bshell Initial TIV level for porting set 7.6a  <br />
1011 bshell porting set 7.6a ftp functions added in bshell <br />
TIV 1012 bshell<br />
<br />
tools<br />
 porting set 7.6a.01 Functions for Outbound Publishing<br />
<br />
String size limit removed for xmlSetAttribute and other xml functions<br />
<br />
db.get.child.transaction function added in bshell<br />
 <br />
TIV 1014 Tools Added tt.is.domain.separated() function.  <br />
TIV 1020 bshell<br />
<br />
tools<br />
 New functions in Enterprise Server 8.2  <br />
1050 bshell porting set 7.6b Added Unicode support. <br />
TIV 1075 bshell<br />
<br />
tools<br />
 New functions in Enterprise Server 8.3/porting set 7.6c Note: Mandatory rework in record selection. <br />
1076 bshell porting set 8.2b  <br />
1078 bshell porting set 8.2b.01  <br />
1100 bshell porting set 8.3a  <br />
1101 bshell porting set 8.2b.01 changed interface handle.report.pool() to handle more than 252 arguments<br />
<br />
added syslibpath.env.var$() bshell function. Useful for ERP installer to determine system dependent env. var.<br />
 <br />
TIV 1200 bshell<br />
<br />
tools<br />
 New functions in Enterprise Server 8.4/porting set 8.3b  <br />
TIV 1300 bshell<br />
<br />
tools<br />
 New functions in Enterprise Server 8.4 for handling field dependencies.  <br />
 <br />
Base TIV levels per Enterprise Server Feature Pack<br />
<br />
The Base TIV levels per Feature Pack are as specified below. Those levels are the base levels. During the lifetime of a Feature Pack, additional numbers may be inserted.<br />
<br />
If software is developed on a 'latest Feature Pack' development system, for release to customers who might be on a lower Feature Pack, the TIV level of the software should be maximized to the base level of the target Enterprise Server Feature Pack. If specific functionality within the target Feature Pack is necessary, installation of additional tools solutions or another porting set might be necessary before the newly developed software works correctly.<br />
<br />
Example: when developing software for an ES 7 (LN FP1) system, the TIV level of the new components should be maximized on TIV level 1010. Only when the function tt.is.domain.separated() is used the level should be set to 1014 (And the target system needs to have solution 202854).<br />
<br />
Version BASE TIV level <br />
LN without feature packs 1000 <br />
Enterprise Server 7 (LN FP1) 1010 <br />
Enterprise Server 8.2 (LN FP2) 1020 <br />
Enterprise Server 8.3 (LN FP3) 1075 <br />
Enterprise Server 8.4 (LN FP4) 1200 <br />
 <br />
Note: The TIV level can not be set higher than the current level of the tools or porting set.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
If your tools is on FP5 or later, then in the program script of your custom session, try setting the TIV (tools interface version) to 1540, compile the script and check.<br />

Can you give me some more details about it.<br />
Even I am facing the same problem in FP6 our FP3 MMT session's copy to clipboard is not working when taken to FP6 ; infact it is giving a fatal error after selecting the record range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did anyone find any solution for this copy to clipboard issue?<br />
I know we can set the TIV for a particular script at a lower value to get it work, but it's really not feasible to do every time when you create a new script.<br />
Please update this thread if somebody has found the solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

please help<br />
 I also tried to click on make &quot;MakeP-VRC Curren&quot;t with this i able to change the TIV but cant compile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's always better to copy the component in your own VRC and then make the changes required. Do not modify the standard component in standard VRC.</div></div><hr />
