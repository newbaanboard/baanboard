<br />
I'm an LN newbie. I have recently imported this session onto my test server, but I am unable to get it to start.<br />
<br />
I have run Create Tables, and both Create and Convert Runtime after the import.<br />
<br />
The message I received was &quot;Cannot read session or object&quot;. In the eventviewer, I noticed these: Errno	: 2 (No such file or directory)<br />
BdbErrno	: 111 (No record found)<br />
<br />
I am able to open the table via ttaad4100.<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer any advice or point me in the right direction? <br />
<br />
Thank you, and have a great day.</div></div><hr />

On 4c4 I make sure the form, session and any reports are out there - plus the objects for them.  It might not just be the table causing the issue it can be one of the other components.</div></div><hr />

I did a Export DD based on the session to find out what components were linked to it, and did another test with PMC using all listed components. However I received the same bdberror 111 when I tried to start the session.<br />
<br />
I did notice that in PMC, I could only link the session as an Integrated Session, rather than a normal session. Could that be a cause for the issue?<br />
<br />
Once again. Thank you for your assistance.</div></div><hr />
