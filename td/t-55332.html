I run several jobs with startjob and they all run as setup. I am now trying to set up a sql job to runs at night and my problem is the query when using Ctrl G sets up a job session in company 000 not in the company I am working in. I have tried running the query in company 000 and I get the errror &quot;object of report not found in your package&quot;<br />
Any help appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose u mean ttaad tables and not ttadv tables. CTRL + G is the front end to enter data in the tables u described . <br />
<br />
The report object u may have created may be in a vrc not in ur package combination of the company u run job in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindar</div><div class="date">18th March 2009, 00:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I did mean the ttaad tables, and yes something seems to be wrong with the way the query setsup.  When I use a &quot;G&quot; at choice the job sets up in Company 000 and when activated I receive the error object not in VRC, even though I am in company 250 (our company number) <br />
<br />
When I activate the job today it will run, (after I hand inputed the file information). But tonight the system will shutdown and restart in the morning, the job will not activate tommorrow. I will get a runtime error in the jobdata file. <br />
<br />
All help appreciated</div></div><hr />
