<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">14th June 2012, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">In Sales Orders / Order Lines, once an order gets past a certain point in the process, fields are locked down to prevent certain changes.  Makes sense.<br />
<br />
We do, however, often need to edit certain non critical or text fields that also get locked down after a certain point. This usually means we have to either GTM or maintain text session to modify...<br />
<br />
Is there a way, perhaps via an uedll that could be set up to prevent these certain fields from locking ??  maybe it is just a table def change but I am curious of some kind of action I can try to implement..<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance ....<br />

The UEDLL only allows for infuencing the save and destroy actions.<br />
However, if you have the development license, you can create your own session to do this. Add this session as a form command in the Sales Order / Line session.<br />
But be very careful! What you consider as non-critical may be critical in LN's logic. Infor's support will not be happy if you bypass the standard logic in this way and there are issues.</div></div><hr />

Our backup solution was to create a session and forms to allow the fields to be updated that would access those order fields we wanted.  Mostly it is text or carrier selection as we do this now via GTM changes....  i would drop an option form the Specific tab to go to that session for editing.  Was just hoping for an easier work around.<br />

Thanks !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you aware of the fact that the text might be copied ?. If itÂ´s locked then a copy exist somewhere. Also the carrier selection might be copied to other tables. To change fields in sales orders via GTM can end up in a big mess.</div></div><hr />
