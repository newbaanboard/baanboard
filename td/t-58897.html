<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">croezen</div><div class="date">27th July 2010, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
I am using mess()  to let the user track what the program does.<br />
It works fine but within an selectdo it does not show!<br />
If I run it in debug, it shows !<br />
example<br />
<br />
mess(&quot;tdebns0020&quot;, 0, &quot;start ...&quot;)<br />
<br />
select bla bla bla<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
clean.mess()<br />
mess(&quot;tdebns0020&quot;, 0, &quot;start second step&quot;)<br />
<br />
select bla bla <br />
selectdo<br />
       clean.mess()<br />
       counter = counter + 1<br />
       mess(&quot;tdebns0020&quot;, 0, &quot;busy with record &quot; &amp; str$(counter) )<br />
endselect<br />
As I said, in the debugger it works fine, but when i run the program normally it does not show the message with the counter, just blank :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th July 2010, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep - I tried that in 4c3 years ago and I can't remember what convinced me that it would not work.  So now I just add a status line on the bottom of the screen. I just put something in the status and do a display.  It was easier to control to me.  I think I also once did a progress bar, but can't remember which program that was in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">27th July 2010, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Try removing the clean.mess<br />
<br />
SELECTDO processing is quite fast, so the clean.mess 'hides' the next mess().<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can 'slow' things down by a suspend(333) for example, after the mess(), and display the mess() every 1000 counts. Not sure if the users will like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th July 2010, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">This is natural as the program runs on server and screen refresh is done client using client resources which is bit of a slow activity compared to server CPU processes . <br />
<br />
I had similar thing for tracking the % of  work done on a screen and it use to jump randomly to 100% depending on actual gaps between each screen refresh . <br />
<br />
U can try suspend as recommended or use display or display.fld  function to display messages on screen . But both these option will slow down the program . So as an alternate u may accept the current situation if  not making great difference.</div></div><hr />

With this statement you will remove the message which was set after processing/counting the previous record.</div></div><hr />
