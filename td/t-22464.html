You could probably put the report in debug mode to see what the call to the detail.1 layout is - then just use a call to that.  Not sure about what it would do as far as calling detail.2, but this is something you could try.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">30th November 2004, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to do control this outside the reportscript in the program script. Then you can control what detail will be printed by special vars (this don't need to be/have to be tablefields!). Remember: every time you send a rprt_send() or brp.ready() you create a new line in the report output. This don't must be a new record in your table! I've often use this. It's a bit tricky, but it works fine.<br />

Thanks for your input.... <br />

I know will be easier do it in the Program Script. The problem with this report is that it is a very complex layout in Jetform where all formatting has been handled in the report script and in the layout itself. Since I can't add more than 20 lines by layout detail I have to use a second detail layout to fit more values. The layout detail.1 is it has a loop it prints (layout.again()) as many times need. So my second layout detail.2 is printed after detail.1 finishes its looping. I want to loop between both layouts detail.1 then deatil.2 and come back to layout detail.1 till detail.2 reaches the number of loops.<br />
<br />
I did try the &quot;goto detail.1&quot;(thanks Mark) which compiled in debug it is what it makes  layout.again() reprint the layout. But the report script doesn't compile &quot;Unknown Label&quot; as an error message.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
