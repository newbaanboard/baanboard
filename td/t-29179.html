Group Alignment<br />
As you could read in the section about field alignment, the fields are arranged in columns. These columns can be manipulated with the group property Group Alignment. For groups, you can choose the following alignment methods:<br />
<br />
Default. <br />
Dependent on other groups. <br />
Independent of other groups. <br />
If a group is default aligned, the fields in the first column start on the same x-position as:<br />
<br />
The fields in groups with the same alignment. <br />
The fields in groups that are aligned with the &quot;Dependent on other groups&quot; option. <br />
For the next columns only the fields within a group are aligned with each other.<br />
<br />
If for a group the alignment depends on other groups, the fields in all columns in all groups with the same alignment are aligned with each other. For the first column the groups with Default alignment are also taken into account.<br />
<br />
If a for group the alignment is independent of other groups, the fields in all columns of that group are aligned with each other. Other groups are not taken into account.<br />
<br />
The following two images contain an example of how group alignment works. The first image shows the treeview of the DFE, and the second image shows how the groups will look on the form. The form in the example contains four groups, the description of each group shows the type of alignment of the group.</div></div><hr />
