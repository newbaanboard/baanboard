<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baantool</div><div class="date">23rd July 2003, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I am currently trying to print Purchase Orders to a Tally line printer via BWPrint and a Win2k driver.<br />
<br />
The report is 66 lines long, Letter paper type (also defined to 66 lines).<br />
<br />
Current output to any laser printer results in the correct output.<br />
<br />
However, when printing to the line printer, there are page break problems where the last two lines of the Purchase Order print further down the page.  When changing the page size in the windows driver from Letter to Legal, it prints correctly.<br />
<br />
When printing multiple pages, it seems that the page size is 10.5&quot;, because the next page begins printing at the bottom of the previous page at the 10.5&quot; mark.<br />
<br />
Would anybody have any ideas as to what sort of things I can look at to fix this problem?  The windows driver seems to override any configuration settings that I may apply on the printer hardware itself.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">23rd July 2003, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">If your report is 66 lines and the page size is 66 lines, it won't print on one page unless your top and bottom margins are set to zero.  Are they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baantool</div><div class="date">23rd July 2003, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, the margins in the report settings are different:<br />
<br />
Top Margin: 0<br />
Bottom Margin: 10<br />
Left Margin: 0<br />
Foot Margin: 9<br />
Page Length: 66<br />
Page Width: 132<br />
<br />
This was done because the Purchase Orders are to be printed on pre-printed forms, and the footer information must always be printed starting at a specific line of the page.<br />
<br />
I was thinking my problem may be related to an imaginary 0.25&quot; border space around the page which laser printers almost never print on.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you can suggest a better way of doing this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">24th July 2003, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Not being there to actually see the actual problem, the easiest way to ensure that a detail and footer print where you want is to have a &quot;need&quot; value on the detail.  i.e. need(10) in either the report script, or on the layout will print the detail only if there are 10 lines available on the device.<br />
<br />
Having a page footer though, should ensure this, so you may want to code the report script and see what the scoop is.  <br />
<br />
Forget about the imaginary borders on the page.  An 8.5 by 11 page should be able to print 66 lines with 0 margins.  Note that the margin's are used to calculate how much data is available on the page.  <br />
<br />
The footer margin in the report setup should only be set to non zero if you have multiple footers of different sizes.  This number would be the maximum size of all your footers.  I'm assuming you only have one footer of a particular size, so set this to zero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baantool</div><div class="date">24th July 2003, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks very much for the ideas.   I will try them out.<br />
<br />
I did get some additional insight.  It seems this report is printing only 63 lines per page, and strangely enough, even standard reports are exhibiting the same behaviour.<br />
<br />
Doing a preview with bwprint, however, does show proper formatting for each page.<br />
<br />
This leads me to believe this may be a Windows printer driver issue.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">24th July 2003, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">You should check to make sure that some of the blank lines (i.e. on the top or bottom of the page) are not actually being printed by the report.  You can print the variable &quot;lattr.lineno&quot;  to see what the actual line number is when data gets printed from the report, or run the report through the debugger and watch that value.  Printing it in the layout is usually easier.<br />
<br />
Check your fonts by paper type to ensure that the paper size is in fact 66 lines on the page with the font that you are using.</div></div><hr />
