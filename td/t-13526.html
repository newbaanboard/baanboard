<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hanslokhoff</div><div class="date">6th November 2003, 11:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I want to call session tiitm0202s000 (copy item) from within a self-written session.<br />
In the original form I can find some inputfields for this subsession (e.g. copy.item) which (I presume) I can 'send' to the session (using export(...) )before calling zoom.to$.<br />
My main problem is that I can not find out which field the session expects for the item to copy FROM.<br />
<br />
My question: Does anybody know how to find out which parms the session uses/needs?<br />
<br />
With kind regards,<br />
Hans.</div></div><hr />

On my system &quot;bic_info6.1 otiitm0202&quot; revealed that there is a orig.item and copy.item.  Give it a try and see if you can find what you need.<br />

Two things...<br />
<br />
1) When one program needs to pass variables to another, you can't &quot;send&quot; variables... you can only &quot;get&quot; them.  <br />
<br />
The reason for this is when you export them in the first program... where do you expect them to go if the second program has not started up yet.  What you must do in the calling program is make sure that the data you want to pass is stored in a variable declared with the &quot;extern&quot; tag.<br />
<br />
Now when you start up your second program, you can import the variable from the EXTERN declared variable. <br />
<br />
Same goes for passing information back after the called program is done and is about to return control back to the calling program.  You can't import the  data after it is all don and when you are in the calling program, because by that point, the data is GONE along with the program that was called.  You must export the data to a EXTERN delared variable in the calling program from the called program.   <br />
<br />
2) Most BAAN code like this seems to use variables named zoom.*  So in this case, I would guess that the item to be copied must be declared in an EXTERN variable named zoom.item so that the session tiitm0202s000 can then import the data when it starts up.  <br />
<br />
I am not sure, but I get the impression that you also want to set the new item's name automatically as well... but I don't think that is part of the standard functionality.  At that point, if that is what you want to do... I guess you could try AFS.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">6th November 2003, 21:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I can suggest you can explore more using the functions -<br />
<br />
at.base() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_variables_based_at_base2) <br />
<br />
If that function doesnt compile in your Baan-4 series, then it might be -<br />
<br />
long base.extern(ref variable, string name(,), long process_id)<br />
<br />
the variable has to be declared extern.<br />
<br />
Common variables (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_3gl_features_common_variables) <br />
<br />
put.var() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_variables_interprocess_transfer_put_var) <br />
<br />
put.indexed.var() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_variables_interprocess_transfer_put_indexed_var)</div></div><hr />
