<br />
I wish to get the purchase price in the price book for a item. Is there any predefined function or library which I can use? I am sure there is a function I can call so that I may use it in my program to get the price.<br />
<br />
Please help. <br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">23rd February 2008, 03:50</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a couple ways to pull it off.  I have written a batch load that was run nightly to import the prices from another system's exported price list.  After doing this for a bit, the users decided that the Baan price list provided a bit more detail than the other system, so we turned the interface around = maintain in Baan, export to outside system.  Writing a custom session to import based on quantities isn't a bit deal since the price tables are pretty small.<br />
<br />
The other direction would be to run (shell, run.prog) an executable that could get the data from the other system's price list structure by API or ODBC access.</div></div><hr />

tdpcgdll0001<br />
tdpcgdll0005<br />
tdpcgdll0010<br />
I made this once for customer on the sales side.<br />
