<br />
We just upgraded from SP 13 to SP 26 in BaanIV, and I'm wondering if Infor changed something in calculating sums in reports...<br />
<br />
I have a detail layout with an amount field, and an afterfield with the sum of this amount. The sum in the afterfield is calculated by the aggregate option &quot;total&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now what happens when I suppress the printing of the detail?<br />
Case A: when adding a printing condition false to the detail layout<br />
Case B: when adding lattr.print=false for the detail in the report script <br />
In SP 26 the result seems to be the same: the sum contains all detail values, no matter how you suppress the detail.<br />
<br />
If I remember well, this behaviour used to be different:<br />
Case A: details suppressed are not included in the sum<br />
Case B: details suppressed are included in the sum<br />
<br />
Does anyone know about this problem?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

I used to create some summary reports by just copying the detail to a summary report and setting the detail print condition to 0. A quick and easy summary report.</div></div><hr />

Sums should not include values of detail lines which are suppressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st April 2010, 00:43</div></div><div class="posttext">What version of baan are you talking about?  I have several reports where the detail layout output expression is 0 and the after.field report totals are correct?  How are you all talking about supressing the detail lines?  In our case we just set the output expression to 0 so the layout does not get printed.  At least this is how our current version of 4c4 works.  Am I missing something.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
