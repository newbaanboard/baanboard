<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">17th March 2016, 22:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone ever taken the Close Project error report and modified it to seek out what (on the purchase invoice) side is causing the hang-up... for example going to all related Purchase Orders to see if there are any open line statuses, checking AP to make sure all lines are matched and approved...etc?<br />
<br />
Looking for assistance if anyone has some code that could help with the digging.<br />
<br />
It could also be applied to production orders for subcontracted operations.<br />
<br />
The issue is we have logistics people digging down just to find out that the true issue is a hold up in Accounts Payable.  This report would allow them to only focus on those with a true logistics issue and hand the rest over to Finance.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
