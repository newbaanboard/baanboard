I want make some changes in a special menu, but it is difficult to find out what the menu is named. Is it a way to see the mapping between a session or form and which menu that is used as the special menu ?<br />

<br />
yes thats right. But what if the menu is called from the program<br />
with zoom.to(...), like in tdsls4102s000 (Maintain Sales Order Lines)?<br />
<br />
<br />
Halvorn,<br />
<br />
If you use BW you only see the menu description and not the<br />
menu name if you zoom to a menu from the special field.<br />
<br />
If you work with BAAN IV use the BA client. In BA the menu name<br />
is shown in the upper left side. <br />

I know now that I can display/edit the form and look at the Choice field.<br />
I suppose that it is only possible with one Choice field on a form  that has a link to either a menu or a session.<br />
So if the one Choice field is linked to a session (which is the case for tccom2101m000), then it is not possible to add menu items by changing the linked menu.<br />
Then I have to add &quot;user&quot; buttons and use &quot;zoom.to&quot; in the script (which I don't have).<br />
Alternatively I can change the one Choice field to link to a menu instead of a session, and add the previous linked session to this menu. Then I have the possibility to easy add new &quot;items&quot; to the special menu. <br />
<br />
Any Comments ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">24th June 2002, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">When you are at the point in the application where you want to know what is active (like the menu is on your screen), you start a new process: ttstpshell (in bw.exe: option &quot;Start Shell&quot;) and enter the command ps (show current active processes). Maybe it is listed.<br />
<br />
You can see the menu if it is a RDD file when you log the file usage with &quot;-- -dbgfile -keeplog -logfile WhatFile&quot;.<br />
<br />
And then you can also use the bic_info program to see what string variables are used in the object: <br />
bic_info6.1 -s oppmmmcccc<br />
or <br />
bic_info.exe -s oppmmcccc<br />
o = object<br />
pp = package<br />
mmm = module<br />
cccc = code of component</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think there is some misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
The zoom option from the choice field of Session tccom2101m000<br />
is linked to a session (tccom2103s000). A menu is not linked to the choice field, so a menu which is not exist can not be changed.<br />
<br />
You are right that you can create your own little menu and link it <br />
to the choice field. This menu contains the session ccom2103s000 <br />
and additional any other sessions you want.<br />
<br />
The function &quot;zoom.to&quot; is used in another context. In this case you don`t need them.<br />
<br />

You say:<br />
The zoom option from the choice field of Session tccom2101m000 <br />
is linked to a session (tccom2103s000). A menu is not linked to the choice field, so a menu which is not exist can not be changed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Response:<br />
From my point of view this is exactly what I'm saying in my previous posting:<br />
&quot;So if the one Choice field is linked to a session (which is the case for tccom2101m000), then it is not possible to add menu items by changing the linked menu.&quot; <br />
