    <br />
I am working in  Baan IV    <br />
    <br />
I need to know if exist some way to compile a program script and show me in a log the time that it has taken each sql  instruction.    <br />
    <br />
I listened about compile with debug profile the program script.    <br />
    <br />
Anybody can explain me how to do it?    <br />
    <br />
The question is for I have a big problem, because I am making a select instruction to one table that it has a lot information (tfacr200), and then this instruction, take a lot of time.  <br />
  <br />
What should I do in this situation?  <br />
  <br />
Thank you a lot</div></div><hr />

<br />
To know about execution times, one of the way is to compile the script in Profiling mode. In baan 4, if i remember well, its in the second form of the maintain program scripts session.</div></div><hr />

   I tried<br />
compile the script in Profiling mode<br />
but when I execute the sessions or 3GL scripts I cannot see any report or something similar by which I can know the execution time. I tried it in Baan IVc4 as well in Baan LN<br />
<br />
As well, I have even tried<br />
-- -keeplog -logfile mysqllog -set TT_SQL_TRACE=02000<br />
But the file created mysqllog in the tmp folder has nothing except TT_SQL_TRACE=02000.<br />
<br />
Please help me, where I am going wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">25th February 2009, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Pleas try:<br />
<br />
-- -set PROFILE_ALL=1 -set PROF_DIR=/home/bsp<br />
<br />
    * PROFILE_ALL. Setting this parameter to 1 starts profiling for all objects.<br />
    * PROF_DIR. Redirects the output file to the specified directory. Else it will be placed in BSE_TMP.<br />
    * PROF_RTIME. When set to 1 to get also a section sorted on wall clock time (real time) will be added.<br />
<br />
-- -set PROFILE_ALL=1 -set PROF_DIR=&lt;path for file&gt; &lt;session name&gt;<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<br />
-- -set PROFILE_ALL=1 -set PROF_DIR=/appl/baan5/bse/home/bsp tfgld1101m000<br />

--Rahul<br />
<br />
When you compile any script in profiling mode and then execute the session/script, a html file is created in your home directory or tmp folder, this html file contains all execution times...Not sure if this file is created in tmp or $HOME :confused:, plz check both the folders after executing the session ...</div></div><hr />

     Thanks a lot Kozure and Cyprus.<br />
<br />
-- -set PROFILE_ALL=1 -set PROF_DIR=/home/bsp<br />
<br />
This worked for me and I can view the html file in the mentioned directory (PROF_DIR).<br />
<br />
As suggested by Cyprus. If I dont give path for PROF_DIR. The html file was created for me in tmp folder.<br />
<br />
I even got the information that the name of the file is in the format <br />
profile.&lt;pid&gt;.&lt;session name&gt;.&lt;bshell_pid&gt;.html<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
