<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 21:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to take Baan data and format it into an Excel report (using a pre-defined format) using IVc3.<br />
<br />
We also need to incorporate some external numbers from<br />
an outside report.  The Baan script I'm creating can read these<br />
numbers and report via references where required.<br />
<br />
Making the type 3 report and getting all the details is already handled, now we need to automate the Excel formatting.<br />
<br />
Should we start in Excel and use VB to call a Baan DLL to extract<br />
the data per cell or range of cells ... or ...<br />
<br />
Should we launch a session in Baan to create an ASCII file,<br />
use app_start with the file (haven't decided whether or not to incorporate select.file) and then use macro to format ? <br />
<br />
I have been able to use select.file and app_start separately,<br />
but now I need to open the app and open the selected file.<br />
<br />
Also in the past I haven't has much luck forcing a macro to<br />
start after opening using app_start().<br />
<br />
(I also, need a breakdown of the app_start arguments).<br />
<br />
Pretty much I can do anything in Baan, but I'm normally at the mercy of what I can do in Excel via manual effort or via recording macros.  We do have internal expertise that can get data from within Baan.<br />
<br />
I've seen the BaanXL notes, but I'm kind of in the dark as to how<br />
to ensure that a column of data goes into specific cells (eg. A3 to A20).<br />
<br />
What approach has worked for others in the past ?<br />
<br />
Any and all help would be appreciated.  We are on a tight schedule.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done this both ways.  In one case I have excel pull the data from Baan and in others I run macros on Baan reports.  If I was you I would not use Excel to pull data from Baan - has more dependencies and is more complicated. The way I did Excel was to create a device called PCEXCEL. This device uses the fileout parameter along with the report name to know which macro to run.<br />
<br />
For example a user runs a BOM report selects device PCEXCEL and puts LOU in the fileout parameter.  I use this to look up on a table what the download filename is and which macro to run.  The macro knows how to read the report and create what the user is doing.  The using this macro you could pull other info from other resources.<br />
<br />
For the parameters to app_start you can do a bic_info on ottdllbw to see its parameters.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
