I am sure all of you have expericned this problem. When a user goes into an previously unblocked Sales Order line and changes anything like adding text or date, the order gets blocked again (for e.g. if the customer is doubtful and parameter is set to block etc...).<br />
<br />
What approach people have taken to get around of this issue? I have made soultion, but would like to see how other people have addressed this issue.<br />
<br />
I am referring to Baan IVC. <br />

<br />
What I understand is when we go for unblocking and then change the text or any other smallest change in the system, it will be like a new SOC being punched in the system.<br />
<br />
So the SOc gets blocked, Then we again have to unblock the same SOC. <br />
<br />
What solution have you found for this??<br />

Ofcourse my solution was to customize it. But it was not a straightforward customizatio. I browsed through Finance/Distribution  forum and I never saw any posting for such issue. I thought that this being a very obvious problem that every Baan user might have faced. SO wanted to get the people's opinion that if they have worked on this issue and they consider this an issue or what? And I don't know if Baan has handled this issue in Baan V in a better way.<br />
<br />
I can see why Baan is not able to give a Fix in Baan IV as it is not designed to handle this.<br />
