ticst002<br />
<br />
This table houses the estimated and actual hours information.  Is sequence 0 always the estimated amounts and sequence 1 the acutals?  It appears that way in the records I checked, but I just wanted some confirmation.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe ticst001 is updated at issue time - when outbound is released. Not sure about backflushed material.<br />
<br />
 I am not really sure about the hours, we use Autotime. I think each time we pull them across the ticst002 table gets updated. I know for a fact the tihra100 and tisfc010 tables get updated. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">looking back at the original post for table ticst002 focusing on the seqence (ticst002.rono).<br />
<br />
if the sequence 0 is estimated, and sequence 1 is actual.. what is it if there is a sequence 2, 3, etc.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">10th October 2008, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">What does a value of &gt;1 mean for the .rono field?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">16th July 2009, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have an answer for this?  <br />
<br />
I have a question about this table. Does it get updated upon creation of the tisfc001/tisfc010 table for the production order?  What if the Pdno isn't ever worked on or moved from Released to Active?  Will it still exist in this table forever?  Do the records get deleted from this table if a production order is cancelled or deleted?<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to do is get the count of production orders that went through specific operation for the last 6-mths.  I thought this would be a good table to go to.  Does anyone have any other suggestions?  Maybe tihra100?  Just a count of orders don't care about hours or costs.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Nikki</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The values of rono &gt; 0 are the various times that the operator(s) clocked time to the production order - operation. <br />
<br />
For example, in our case, an operator starts work on a bundle, and spends 2.5 hours on it and he clocks that time to the order/operation (this is rono = 1). Then he has to do some other production order that is hot. He finishes that and returns to this and spends 1 hour more on it, clocks it (this is rono = 2)and goes home. Then the second shift person takes over and clocks 3 more hours to the same order/ operation and clocks it (this is rono = 3 BUT different employee number on the same order/operation). And so on. Each clocking action is given a new sequence number. The total of all those become the total actual time spent on that operation. The .rono = 0 is the total standard allowed time. The difference will be the variance.<br />
<br />
The ticst002 will also tell which employee clocked the time, so it is possible to get actual time spent by employee also, per day, per week, per order and operation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">18th July 2009, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is correct. That would be another source of about the same information.<br />
<br />
<br />
Operation Completion, however, is a separate transaction.</div></div><hr />
