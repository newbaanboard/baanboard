<br />
Create a new device with the below details.<br />
<br />
<br />
DeVice Type : Rewrite File<br />
<br />
4Gl Program :  ttstpconv<br />
Argument :  ascii:notepad.exe<br />
Path  :  ${BSE}/temp/file.txt  <br />
Change allowed  :  Yes<br />
Page Length : 66.<br />
<br />
If you select this device while printing, it will open the o/p in Notepad in the client PC and they can save the result in the local HDD. Pls make a note that the Notepad should work from command prompt(Dos Prompt) in the client PC, otherwise this device will not work. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">12th July 2003, 03:00</div></div><div class="posttext">you can use the seq.* and server2client to create a file for the<br />
report output and then bring it over with additional options to<br />
open using Notepad, Excel etc.</div></div><hr />

I am using the copy2pc option. After creating the script and device, while running the report, it is giving following error<br />
<br />
1: Process 8 - Error : Can't read session or object (tctpltest) <br />
<br />
I had created the script as tctpltest under current package VRC (tc B40C c4 003 -Common Dev), script compiled without any error. <br />

Thinking about your problem has lead me to believe that the session has not been created. In my case the session is called tccomcopy2pc without forms or reports. And the attached program code of type 3gl is also called tccomcopy2pc. If both the script and the session exist then try the following:<br />
In maintain sessions go to form 2 and use the special+start session option - does it start? If it does then try the file+run option on the menubrowser and call your session - does it start? If it does then there should not be any problems when its called from the device.<br />

Happy hunting,<br />

<br />
Thanks for the help. Yes, I had created only the script without the session, now it is working after creating the session with same name.<br />

However, every report I do get a blank line in between every line.  Have you had this problem?  When I use the regular ASCIF device to a text file there are no blank lines.  It doesn't look like anything in the copy2pc code because it basically just creates the file and moves it to the client right?<br />
<br />
hmmm</div></div><hr />
