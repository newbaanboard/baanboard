<br />
here is my problem. I'm dealing with the session tppss6110m000 (Maintain Material Recommendation), I am able to insert records in it, no problem, but when I call the stpapi.end.session, it does not work.<br />
<br />
In the code (We have it, there was a patch!), in the choice.end.program section, last line of code is &quot;switch.to.process(parent)&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know that from the menu this session is being called by session tppss6810m000 with the process info set to 6110. I know it's triing the return the process to tppss6810m000.<br />
<br />
When I try to do a handle.sub.process in tppss6810m000 to tppss6110m000 and go on, it hangs on the call on handle.sub.process. When I dont use the tppss6810m000 at all, I am able to do all my code, but it does the stpapi.end.session call, continue in the code, and does everything fine. But when I start a bshell and type the ps command, the session is still opened and hangs there until I do an End Task on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th May 2002, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did with one of my funtions servers was to create a parent process.  So what I did was create a session that all it did was call the sub-session.  Then when I killed the sub-session it dropped back to my parent session. Then I controlled how it ended.   So in your case you could build a dummy session that activiated the tppss6110m00 session, then when you end the 6110 the switch.to.process(parent) would come back to your session.<br />
<br />
It is not a great solution, but it was the only one I came up with when I was doing my function server.  The session I was having problems with was tpptc9810m00c and how it called tpptc9110m00c.  <br />
<br />
From the sound of things you do not own source, so changing and compiling the Baan code may not work.  If you could do that then you could check the api.mode and skip the swith.to.process statement when ending the session<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
