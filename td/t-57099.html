I deleted the Infor ERP LN Studio workspace after a crash, and tried to clean up the related tables from the record inserted by eclipse <br />
(in particular I removed the record from ttadv120 and tlprj110-130)<br />
<br />
Now, when I tried to check-out a session I checked out before, I obtain the message  I obtain the message &quot;Integrated session has already checked out by you&quot;, but I do not know how to fix this, nor can check out again my session.<br />
<br />
Somebody can help?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Cleaning up the tables after a workspace crash is not the preferred way and not needed either. After a workspace crash, you can open a new one, set your (connection) preferences again (or import them if you saved the workspace preferences of the other workspace before the crash :)), and then just open the activity again in the activity explorer and recover the activity. See chapter &quot;To recover an activity&quot; in the Application Studio User Guide (which is also present in the Eclipse help).<br />
<br />
I don't understand why you deleted records in ttadv120 and tlprj110. Those are generic and not activity related. Activities are in table ttadv122. Please let me know how you want to go further. Maybe I can help you with the steps to solve the current data corruption.</div></div><hr />
