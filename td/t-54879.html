Now I want to deploy my changes to production.  I have saved the code changes to text files.  Without having to 're-do' all the changes again on Production environment, what are the steps to deploy the changes to production?  Basically, developers are not allowed to make code changes on the production environment anymore.  Is there a documented method?  If not, does someone have a set of procedures that they use to deploy changes to production?<br />

Thanks a bunch!<br />

Then ftp to other machine if on a different one and import into the appropriate VRC on your test box.  After testing, then deploy in the same manner to production.<br />

See help on session Export Data Dictionary session ttiex1280m000 and Import Data Dictionary session ttiex1285m000.  Keep in mind that some components (sessions/domains/tables) need a Convert to Runtime after being imported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimw_143</div><div class="date">28th January 2009, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for responding.  I ran session ttiex1280m000, look at help, and it is not very intuative.  If I wan't to 'export' the source code for an existing session, how do I get only that session code to where I can edit it.  Before, I have used session ttadv2100, opened the script source, saved it as a text file, made my changes, and then replaced the text with my edits, compiled and tested.  That seems like going through Chicago to get to Dallas from Midland.  I've not found any programming manuals that explain the export, develop/test, import procedure.  Does someone have one?<br />
<br />
Struggling to understand.  It seems a little strange, but there is no checkout, checkin procedure, version control, etc.  At least not that is easily seen from the software.  Kinda opens you up to some major issues if not done correctly.  Are there source code controls that can be implemented for Baan customized sessions?<br />
<br />
Thank you, everyone for your assistance!<br />
