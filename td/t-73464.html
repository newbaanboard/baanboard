<br />
I have a session which is in a VRC say VRC-1.<br />
For this we have its script customized say in VRC-1 and VRC-2. VRC-2 is derived from VRC-1.<br />
Now after getting the same component (session and script) in LN studio, when I do certain change only to the script and check-in it. Ending the activity, puts the session as well into VRC-2. Earlier the session was only in VRC-1. Only the script was in VRC-1 and VRC-2. How to not customize the session?<br />
<br />
Anyone knows about this particular scenario? That will be helpful</div></div><hr />
