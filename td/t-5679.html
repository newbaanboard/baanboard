<br />
How does this criteria get passed to the sql that I want to use?<br />
Or is there a way to import the settings into a range?<br />
<br />
I want to select records based on date criteria.<br />
<br />
We do not have developer licenses so I cannot see what the session is doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">1st July 2002, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the session's form variables are external variables, so they are available to you in the report.  However, the session is going to send the report records of data based on the form criteria and the processing within the session's program script.  You can use this within your report.  However, it kind of sounds like you want to do your own SQL query within the report.  In this case, I guess you would have to ignore all the records of data from the report except for the criteria you desire.<br />
<br />
This seems like a lot of effort to create report data, but maybe that's the way it is when you don't have the developers license.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've managed to this on a couple of standard reports (receipt log and shipping log) without having a developers license.<br />
<br />
Follow the following steps;<br />
<br />
1. Add fields to form using the free$ variable. Check out the programmers help for info on free$.<br />
<br />
2. Create the report script to read the contents of this variable and then in the report script exclude detail records based on the values read from free$.<br />
<br />
You really do need to reasonably confident with report scripts to achieve this but it's definately worth the effort as a some of the standard reports do not have the desired ranges.<br />
<br />
If I get time and you're interested I'll try to put some more info together with screen dumps unless somebody else already has some.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
