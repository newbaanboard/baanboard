<br />
If I ran my script in company 555, then I changed the company to 222 (using ttdsk2003m000). How can my script know the new current company?<br />
<br />
get.compnr() will return the original company that my script was executed in (same as get.company() and COMPNR variable), but I need to know the current (menu browsers) company, any ideas?<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th December 2006, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">About the only thing I can think of to try is something like this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9763) uses.  You use licmon to get the bshell id and then use the bshell pid to run the process list.  You might find something that reveals the company number for the browser.  I can not say for sure because I have never figured out how the bshcmd command works - since I am on a UNIX server the command and format are different.  Just doing a bshcmd6.1 -p &lt;bshell_pid&gt; does not work for me(gets nothing) and bshcmd6.1 -p -s -u 10 -w 10 bshell_pid gets all kinds of stuff and ottdskmbrowser has different companies.  So you might see something like ottdskmbrowser with the current company number - again I am not sure.  And I never really figured out the appropriate format of bshcmd6.1 for unix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">4th January 2007, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
This code works for me:<br />
./bshcmd6.1 -p -s -u 5 -w 5 5445<br />
<br />
The resault was:<br />
<br />
     2      0      2 ottdskmbrowse      76123 00000060 B 200   266104<br />
object: ottdskmbrowser<br />
oic:<br />
        ottdskmbrowser<br />
        ottstp_stddll<br />
        ottdskmenu<br />
So I new that the menu browser is in company 200.<br />
<br />
The problem that only user 'root' (or the user who is using this PID) could activate this command (with good resaults) other users didn't return anything.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
user 'root' can see the sessions that user 'george' is using now<br />
user 'george' can see the sessions that user 'george' is using now<br />
user 'bsp' can not see the sessions that user 'george' is using now<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david7</div><div class="date">15th January 2007, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion..<br />
<br />
But I've encountered this command (bshcmd6.1) before and it wasn't stable, so I'm not sure if I can rely on it now.<br />
<br />
Also it's a unix command but I need this solution to work for NT server too.<br />
<br />
This solution is too complicated and long, isn't there any other way to get the menu browser's company ? How does the menu browser know his current company ? Is it a global variable ? In a file ? Table ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david7</div><div class="date">24th January 2007, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Any ideas ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th January 2007, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope - sorry to say no new good ideas have popped up.  To me it looks like the company number is a local variable to the menu.  Can you explain why you need to do this?  It might help someone else come up with a solution.<br />
<br />
Other ideas:<br />
(1) write your own change company code to log it in a table in a specific company.<br />
(2) try running a function server on ttdsk2003m000 to see what company is returned.  So when you change company to 123, run a session.  Then go back to the menu browser and change company to 100.  Then in then session running in company 123 run ttdsk2003m000 and see what company it tells you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">31st May 2007, 09:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for the record... I have tried the AFS solution and it did not work.<br />
<br />
I have also tried to activate (&amp; sleep) ttdsk2003m000 and try to get the company using get.var but it also didn't work since it did not have the menu browser company, it had the parent company.<br />
<br />
Best solution for now is the bshcmd command.<br />

It's a known issue - custom ttdsk2003m000 (Change company) (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=24801&amp;highlight=change+company)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">31st May 2007, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi NPRao,<br />
<br />
I was reading the same thread before I posted my last post. I was thinking that getting the global company is easier than changing it. I believe there is a way to do so and as you say &quot;Where there is a will, there is a way&quot;, no? ;)<br />
<br />
Maybe an undocumented variable/function that we can use...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">31st May 2007, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish it was that easy, I found another situation where your idea will fail:<br />
<br />
2 0 2 ottdskmbrowse 76123 00000060 B 200 266104<br />
<br />
 You can easily write a custom program which can change company and open multiple menu browsers. Refer to the posting - menu in commandline starts ascii (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=10308&amp;highlight=ttdskmbrowser)<br />
<br />
You can easily test it by 2 statements-<br />
<br />
change.company(200)<br />
start.session() or activate() or any other function call for &quot;ttdskbbrowser&quot;.<br />
<br />
In that case you have to trace every ttdskbbrowser instance that does not have a parent process id (means it was started by the Standard Program when you logged in) and if it has a parent then it was started by your custom program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">1st June 2007, 09:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. You are right. I have noticed that. But it is not that common to start a new menu browser. Is it?<br />
<br />
Anyway bshcmd is the best we got for now, but I am sure there is a better solution and I am sure that it WILL be found.<br />

But it looks better than bshcmd route considering bshcmd may not give response if bshell is too busy doing something else.<br />

attr.company$ has correct string value of the company which we can query ttaad100 and get the compny number .<br />
<br />
Also each Window title has company number included (pls check for forms where company special field is not there). If u can trap this variable , u should be able to ge the current company . <br />
<br />
And last (which u know and have probably done) to query ottdskmbrowse for each externally declared symbol (to find correct variable) using get.var function . The process id needs to be searched using pstat function .</div></div><hr />

I could not find the predefined variable attr.company$ in all the manuals that I have. I tried it in a test program and got compilation error:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">4th June 2007, 07:20</div></div><div class="posttext">NP , For ERP Ln there should be some different variable . attr.company$ is present in Bann IV . <br />
<br />
George , attr.company$ is present in every instance of a program . U need not query ottdskmbrowse for that purpose . Duplicate description can not be addressed for sure with company descriptions .<br />
<br />
U can try ttfgld300.titl which contain window title with company number . U can trap the number enclosed in square brackets . Caveat - Check this on forms without special field company number .<br />
<br />
Last  - a cent percent perfect solution is to get the exact variable which holds the company in ottdskmbrowse and get the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ttfgld300.titl does not exist in ottdskmbrowse. However I know that it does exist in every 4GL session.<br />
<br />
I could get the name of the description of the company in the past but since it is not a unique key in the company table I can not get the company number from it, since there could be two company numbers with the same description.<br />

It's ttgfd300.titl and not ttfgld300.titl. It contains window title (including company number in square brackets) . If  ur program is 4GL with a company number on form , then this should suffice ur requirement .<br />

Know it may not be a complete solution for all situation. But a good workaround in a given situation .</div></div><hr />

I have tried all the 4GL tricks that I know but ottdskmbrowse is not a 4GL session. So it is different.<br />

I have also tried to start a session from Maintain Sessions (ttadv2100m000), it always starts with the users default company and not the Global company.</div></div><hr />

No knowledge of the same as of yet. Have not tried it bcos i am sure u must have had put enough efforts on the same . And I am sure I will not able to give enough time for this .<br />

Even I mentioned the same .  Before going through any workaround , one must know it's flip side also.<br />

If none of the workaround suites ur sitation  , bshcmd with its pitfalls may be the only way out for u .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">8th June 2007, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. You are right. The win API will fail also if you had more than 2 menu browsers open.<br />
