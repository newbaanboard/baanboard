<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andyen</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 12:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We are preparing a migration to Baan 5.0c from an AS400 ERP based solution. A number of customisations / new systems (some quite large) will be required to cover missing functionality on Baan especially in the servicing and recording and validation of complex calibration measurements of sold equipment. I need to identify the best platform for this bespoke work. We could look at using Baan Tools and scripting or one of the many other development tools available. As we are currently starting to evaluate the .net environment for Web development I would like to explore  the issues around using VB for the customisations. <br />
I have read many of the threads already relating to VB on this site but most of them, written by experienced Baan guys, fly straight over my head. What I am after are simple guide lines or examples of how VB apps and Baan apps can co-exist. How each can call the others functions etc, how best to deploy and manage the new programs etc.<br />
Any views help or advice on this topic would be most appreciated.<br />

I am using VB to Baan. We can call any Baan DLL and then pass the  parameter to it. And to call VB I think best approach will be to write the information to a file and call VB EXE to read the file and then execute the whatever logic. This is waht can be done very easily. On Baan ERP you can use some XML tools also.<br />
