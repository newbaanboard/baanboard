<br />
if you are like me you also wish to have similar functionality to Baan Tools when you want to program after hours on your pet projects away from Baan. I have looked around for something similar but nothig seems to come near to Baan tools in ease of use. Baan tools lets you concentrate on the business logic than the nitty gritty of putting fields on forms and validating them  with general purpose tools like VB, etc. Anyone used to programming with DAL's can only give a sad smile at efforts like J2EE, UML and the like where you have to program like crazy to achieve the simplest of results. <br />
<br />
Any ideas? Please...:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">6th October 2003, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, VB.NET has wizards based on tables.  It will generate your forms, even make them HTML, etc .  Not sure of the validations, I need to play more still.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with you on this respect, though.  The Baan tools are way ahead of their time, especially in terms of ease of use.  They have had a session wizard for 10 years!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">6th October 2003, 19:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. Nothing is better than BaaN Tools to develop Database-based applications. More than 10 years, I've used another 4GL called PowerHouse, made by Cognos but it was far away from BaaN...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">There isn't. Yet.<br />
<br />
I once started a project on sourceforge, to develop something like Baan tools in Java - exactly for the reasons mentioned. The project was sleeping a long time, but I am currently thinking about reviving that project and just did some major re-codings in the last months.<br />
<br />
There is already a prototype of an inline SQL to java precompiler, I have a working data dictionary (like in Baan), I have a working application server and I am willing to donate a lot of code from a commercial application of mine (www.equilipresto.de) for building the form engine and probably also for doing a better relational-OO mapping.<br />
<br />
So basically all the things that would be needed for building a Baan Tools equivalent in Java are already done - partly conceptually, most of them in some sort of code already; the thing is absolutely feasible.<br />
<br />
But I stopped the project, because it's too big for just one guy to handle, there is too much actual coding to do. So if someone would like to join me developing the thing, send me a mail! I think with two or three people with some Java experience we could gain enough critical mass to find additional developers.<br />
<br />
I think there is a need for an open-source development tool like Baan Tools, and there is nothing available. Meaning of course, that there is a potential market, and I strongly beleive a freeware ERP system could generate a lot of consultancy fees...<br />
<br />
MooN can be found on <br />
<br />
http://sourceforge.net/projects/moon/<br />
<br />
There should be an installation software. You will need java 1.4, RMI and some XML extensions to have it working, but if you're interested and have difficulties, drop me a line - I can mail you a better working new version.<br />
<br />
By the way, the project is called MooN, because sheep baa and cows moo...<br />
