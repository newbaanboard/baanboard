Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a report script that shows totals per group, basically something like this:<br />
<br />
tdsls040.crep|tiitm001.ccde|tdsls045.amnt|tdsls045.copr(1)*tdsls045.dqua<br />
<br />
in the report i have totals per amnt and copr(1)*dqua after every crep and every ccde.<br />
now i need to show tdsls045.amnt/(tdsls045.copr(1)*tdsls045.dqua)<br />
<br />
but in the totals if i use the aggregate function named &quot;total&quot; i got a sum of tdsls045.amnt/(tdsls045.copr(1)*tdsls045.dqua) and if i use &quot;average&quot; i will get the average of that expression but what i need is something like this:<br />
<br />
total(tdsls045.amnt)/total(tdsls045.copr(1)*tdsls045.dqua)<br />
<br />
i'm trying to avoid do the sum manually because the script will become more complex, so the question is: is there any way to get the value of a grouped column to be used in another field (in the same line, of course)?<br />
<br />
i hope my explanation was clear enough... :)<br />
<br />
suggestions?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
