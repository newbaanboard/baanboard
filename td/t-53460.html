<br />
I have been playing around with this command in our development VRC/package combination and although it will look like that the reconfig has happened with row counter and index creation messages, but when we go back and look into Baan, the table has not changed and nor the reconfigure change indicators in table ttadv501 - 504 has cleared. During the reconfig I also checked to make sure that the R file did get created.<br />
<br />
Has any one else any experience with running bdbreconfig6.1 through command line?<br />
<br />
Here is the command that I am using.<br />
<br />
bdbreconfig6.1 -Ntdinv700 -t/baan_export/invtrans -e/baan_export/invtrans/table.err -i -pB40Cc4d0 -n -m -f -R -C010</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you try to simply set the BSE_TMP variable, before starting the session?<br />
<br />
This should tell the bdbreconfig, where to put the file.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
This is a viable option but we did not have a good comfort level using this variable. We will for sure look further into it.</div></div><hr />

Markus is right, setting BSE_TMP will move the R file.<br />
<br />
Aside from that that - bdbreconfig doesn't clear the reconfig indicators, or move the DD.new file into place (it also doesn't create a DD.new btw) the CRDD session does all of that.<br />
<br />
So to use bdbreconfig from command line you need to:<br />
1. Generate a &lt;table&gt;.new file in your Package Combination directory<br />
2. run bdbreconfig .... (your command line looks ok)<br />
3. mv &lt;table&gt; &lt;table&gt;.old; mv &lt;table&gt;.new &lt;table&gt;<br />
4. clean out ttadv501-503<br />
<br />
Only safe way to generate a &lt;table&gt;.new is via baan. run CRDD Without the reconfigure option checked.<br />
<br />
But since you're there already, just set BSE_TMP and make your life easier.<br />
