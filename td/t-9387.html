<br />
The general structure of the invoice includes a header section, then up to 33 detail lines followed by a footer section which prints the totals.  The footer is defined in the layout as an after.inco.10 layout.<br />
<br />
I am trying to add a line to the after.inco.10 layout but when it prints, the system continues to print 33 detail lines on page 1, then it prints part of the after.inco.10 on page 1, form feeds and prints the last line on the next page in the detail section. <br />
<br />
I'd like for the system to print 32 detail lines on page 1, formfeed, print the 33rd detail line on page 2 followed by the after.inco.10 layout.  I've modified the page length and tried the need() function but I'm not satisifed the results.<br />
<br />
How can I control this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a thought!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">26th March 2003, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, the invoices have some footer size control in the report script.  There are the commands 'skip.to(spool.pg.length - 12)' in there.  If I remember right, you have to make that a larger number to give you more room on the footer.  This is in conjunction I think with the footer length that ssbaan is talking about.  For this reason, the invoices are a little tricky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">26th March 2003, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I just discovered in report script a line of code in after.inco.10 before.layout section.  The code says skip.to(spool.page.length - 12).<br />
<br />
Apparently this is how our implementors controlled the printing of invoice totals at the bottom of each invoice.  I have never used this command before.  <br />
<br />
Where can I find documentation about skip.to()?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">26th March 2003, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">It's in the report script functions section of the programmers guide:<br />
<br />
skip.to( expr )<br />
 Skip to the line number indicated by expr. Intervening lines are left blank. If the specified line number is less than the current page number, a new page is started.<br />
 <br />
It is standard code in there, not something put in custom.</div></div><hr />
