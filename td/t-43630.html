For example, with get.var I can get company name in company.name variable:<br />

<br />
As I have noticed before when I tried to activate ttdsk2003m000 from AFS (or baan tools command) it got the company number of my process since it was activated by my process. I could see in the shell that my process was the parent. But when it is activated by the menu broweser then it will have the menu browser's company because the menu browser is the parent.<br />
<br />
I will test it again and confirm that.<br />

Alejandro, <br />
<br />
Are there specific sessions/processes that you are looking for their comapny numbers? <br />
Are they 4GL/3GL?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">30th October 2007, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">First thank you and sorry to all.<br />
<br />
I tried some searches for this matter but did not find that so interesting thread NPRao pointed me to.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have also tried make bic_info6.1 for process running and tried almost every extern variable. I agree with Hitesh Shah in what he says in this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showpost.php?p=117199&amp;postcount=17).<br />
<br />
What for I want this.<br />
<br />
I use it for inactivity control user.<br />
All users are running a process (no form, all code in before.program section) that use ps.stat and ps.cpu.use functions in order to know if he is working.<br />
<br />
There will be a suspend every 2000 miliseconds and if every thing has no change after 16 minutes this process make a kill for all inactive process and user is automatically logout.<br />
<br />
I want to send a signal to the process, I do not how yet but I'm thinking in create an empty tmp file in a public directory with the bshell.pid and cntrl extension, for example.<br />
<br />
The user running process will see this file and will initiate a procedure to fill a table with data similar than you obtain when in option dialog open a shell and put a ps command. Then that tmp file will be deleted.<br />
<br />
I have tried all this with bshcmd6.1 command but I do not like it. I have to run it like root and take care with an application lock because you only have one call to this function in your system at the same time.<br />
<br />
Company number is important and sessions, objects, etc runninng with ticks, memory, etc...<br />
<br />
About your question:<br />
<br />
Are there specific sessions/processes that you are looking for their comapny numbers? <br />
Are they 4GL/3GL?<br />
<br />
<br />
AS I use ps.stat I am reading all running processes. Some are 3GL other 4GL.<br />
I look for all process's company number. Some of them are 0 (standard program, init process, etc...)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">30th October 2007, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there are other ways to know if the process is active or not. Using the bshell.pid() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_processes_bshell_pid) you can get the process ID of the current bshell (at operating system level). Then, on the Baan server you can check wither or not this process is active.<br />
<br />
I am still interested to find a solution through Baan Tools though and I am still looking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">30th October 2007, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably simplifying ur requirement and use of standard tools may be a good idea . Nevertheless  we too have developed daemons (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=10551&amp;highlight=replicate+file+system) such as this but for different purpose .  Also did not understand why before.program section only . U can use 3GL  program without form and attach the same to a session .<br />
<br />
Also to get company with which user started get.resource$(&quot;compnr&quot;) may be of help . <br />
<br />
While using pstat function u can trap  variables such as choice , maintable$ ,key values of the main table , update.status , form.type etc to determine what a user is doing . Also u can exclude tools  program being listed in process listing . Also  parent  child program, reports , long text  entry etc   may need special treatment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">30th October 2007, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Your post has really good suggestions.<br />
You are right about using 3GL instead a 4GL.<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">31st October 2007, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are watching all the processes, you can know every process's company by knowing the parent's company at the time the child was activated. In other words, when you see a new process, the company should be the same as its parent at that time.<br />
<br />
This is solution has one problem and that is you do not know the company of the Menu Browser (almost the grand parent of all other processes). You know only the default (start up) company, but you do not know when the user changes the company using ttdsk2003m000.<br />
<br />
So in order to know the company any process you will have to know the company of the Menu Browser at any time. This takes us back to the old conversation (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=29046).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">25th April 2008, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have found a way to get the current company of any Maintain/Display session. This way does not always work for print sessions.<br />
<br />
The trick is to use the get.var function with the &quot;&lt;Main Table&gt;._compnr&quot; variable. For example this will get the company of maintain Item data:<br />
<br />
rt = get.var(ses.procid,&quot;tiitm001._compnr&quot;,curr.ses.comp)<br />
| ses.procid is the process number of the session<br />
<br />
In order to get the main table of any session you can use the following function:<br />
<br />
function ses2tbl(string s.pac(2) ,string s.mod(3) , string s.name(9))<br />
{<br />
select ttadv200.mpac,ttadv200.mmod,ttadv200.mfln<br />
from ttadv200<br />
where ttadv200._index1 = {:s.pac,:s.mod,:s.name}<br />
and   ttadv200._compnr = &quot;000&quot;<br />
selectdo<br />
   ttadv422.cpac = ttadv200.mpac<br />
   ttadv422.cmod = ttadv200.mmod<br />
   ttadv422.flno = ttadv200.mfln<br />
endselect<br />
}<br />
<br />
To get the process Id number and the session name you can use the pstat function (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_processes_pstat).<br />
<br />
This way will work on the print session if you printed the report. If you didn't print it yet, it won't work<br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />

Alternatively one can also use get.session.vrc function in ottdllextint to main table as well as main program script.<br />

Even this way one can not get company no in before.program sections and in places where the same table is read for different company as functionality requirement .<br />
