 <br />
It isn't possible to cut and paste text into the report editor, maybe because it is not really necessary?<br />
 <br />
When we had a requirement like this for the first time, we decided to use the normal text functions; in the report it's the easiest way, and the text editor can be used ro read in an ascii file. So the only thing hat either has to be hard coded or that can be stored in a new (separate) database table is the text number.<br />

Inside the Editor you may copy texts, labels, fields ...etc by using the copy block from the menu then select the required block then paste it...<br />

     Thanks a lot to all. <br />
<br />
     The idea of using the text was good, but we are having just one such report where we have some hard coded text and using text for it would cost me a new table (for maintaining the text). So I have finally typed all the stuff in the report editor.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to all.<br />

Hi Rahul,<br />
another option is to save the text as messages and use the messages in report script.<br />
That's how we solved a similar requirement.<br />
