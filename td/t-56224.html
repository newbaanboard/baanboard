I have a problem with the choice.abort.program section which is in my case not reaed. I use LN and wanted to clear the main table when the session is aborted by clicking on the 'X'. The choice about program is not reached though. Has anyone ever had this problem before as well. I would appreciate any help.<br />

<br />
1) Is the program closing when you click on the 'X'<br />
2) Can you tell us what is the type of the session?<br />
3) Can you please post your code?<br />

<br />
If this is the case; you can use before.choice subsection.</div></div><hr />

I just want to start a function which is clearing the main table for onf user. (multiple user can create entries in this table and only the entries for the current user should be deleted) The code is:<br />
<br />
choice.abort.programm:<br />
        before.choice:<br />
	        clear.tdpas602()<br />
<br />
I have tried before, on and after choice but neither of them works.<br />
The program shall be closed when clicking on the 'X' and no other functions besides deleting the entries will be called. The Type of the Session is List Maintain.<br />
<br />
PS: Thanks for the welcome within baanboard :)</div></div><hr />

And is your code a copy or is that a typo on &quot;program&quot;?  Sorry can not help on ln, but this works on 4c4 when hitting the x.<br />

before.choice:<br />

this was just a typo. I wrote it with 1 m of course. I will try your solution because I still didn't get it running. Thanks for your help in advance!</div></div><hr />

If you click now on the &quot;X&quot; does the session close? I just want to make sure that the &quot;exit&quot; option is checked on the standard form options.</div></div><hr />

yes the session was closing but It is working now. I just have changed the sessiontype from list maintain to list display and somehow it worked. I have no clue why this should be connected but changing it helped. Many thanks to you all for your support and I hope I will give this support back sometime.<br />

&quot;<br />
choice.abort.programm:<br />
before.choice:<br />
clear.tdpas602() &quot;<br />
<br />
You have written choice.abort.programm:<br />
<br />
It should be choice.abort.program:</div></div><hr />

<br />
this was just a typo in here. I checked the spelling within the script and it was correct. But thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />
