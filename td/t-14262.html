<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">22nd January 2004, 01:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone out there running and customizing a Baan IV c4 installation/environment where multiple localizations are being used at the same time?  For example, if a company has users in North America, Spain, France, Germany and Italy, you could see c4 standard, Iberian, French, German and Italian localizations all having to be implemented and maintained.  Things can become more complicated if you need Supply Chain, Automotive, A&amp;D or other extensions applied globally as well.<br />
<br />
What strategies have people used to deal with these complex environments?<br />
<br />
We've got Baan deployed in North America, Spain and France and having to support and customize the functionality of the nas0 (North American automotive), scor (Spanish), mven (Spanish) and fre0 (French) localizations.  We have source code, and ended up basically adopting the entire scor, mven and fre0 localizations as our own customizations  and in fact merged their functionality with nas0.  So we have a single custom VRC derived from nas0 that contains all our customizations, in addition to scor, mven and fre0 localization functionality.  This is nice in the sense that all our users are basically running the same code, but it's a nightmare when installing and retrofitting Baan solutions and Service Packs.</div></div><hr />
