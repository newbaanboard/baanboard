  i have a field 'item' with 3 segments(segmented domain),of which the first segment is made invisible,the second segment contains the item code whereas the third segment contains the manufacturer code.<br />
<br />
I have a problem when i try to find a given record, with the help of find(binocular icon)from session and when i try to search item it should give me an error at the end of segment 3 if that particular item is not found.<br />
<br />
As well as it should throw me an error on the click of OK button(without tabbing out to segment 3) after specifying the item in segment 2.<br />
 <br />
I am attaching a word document which contains the screen shot of the session from where i am finding as well as the find.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanking in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onceuponatime</div><div class="date">13th November 2006, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the domain you are using for item have 3 segments? If yes, you need to provide a zoom after the third segment and not the second.<br />
You would want to use check.input to provide a message at the end of segment 3 if the item is not found.  If the domain only had two segments and the third &quot;segment&quot; is just another field, then providing the zoom on the second segment is fine. Here again you need to use check.input to check if the reuired item is present in the database.<br />
<br />
For the second problem, you need to code in the choice.cont.process. You can use the same logic or even the same function that you might use to give a message on check.input as above. Or you could define the third form field as mandatory. This will automatically give a message if nothing is specified in this field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan_Fresher</div><div class="date">14th November 2006, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in my case my domain contains 3 segments i.e. standard tcitem domain.<br />
<br />
Now, the first segment i.e. the project segment we have delibaretly made it invisible and the rest 2 segment user is able to enter the values, although it is not neccessary that he would always fill in the 3rd segment.<br />
<br />
so bottom line is :<br />
Item : A    GB<br />
where 'A' stand for 2nd segment i.e. item <br />
and 'GB' stands for Manufacturer code which is 3rd segment<br />
<br />
so my requirement is that when user clicks on Find button i.e. (binocular  icon) , and he enters only 'A' then a validation should be performed, and if enters 'A' as well as 'GB' then also validation should be performed.<br />
<br />
This validation should be performed if he presses TAB or starightaway clicks on OK button which is there in Find Session.<br />
<br />
I cant use choice.cont.process for this purpose because its a standard Find session.<br />
<br />
Any help, clue would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
