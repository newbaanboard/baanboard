<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warans</div><div class="date">21st October 2002, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone have any answer to this scenario:<br />
<br />
For a single table, a new session is to be generated with multiple forms on it. (say 6 forms). Each form has the same view field.<br />
Ofcourse, the forms have multi-occurence records...<br />
The user will maintain different data in different forms...the point is the underlying table is still same...<br />
<br />
Like on form1 he may have different set of data...on form3 he may have different set of data....<br />
<br />
The maintenance includes insert/delete/modify as usual....<br />
<br />
How to have this set up...? any suggestions...<br />
<br />
Have a GREAT TIME !! <br />
<br />
THANKS for your HELP in ADVANCE !!!</div></div><hr />

However the way I accomplished it then was very painfull! I lost aprox. 15kg and 15 years of my life. Would you like to know more?<br />

<br />
Version of BaaN is B40_c4...<br />
<br />
I had said form 1  tiitm001  set A data....<br />
<br />
form 2  tiitm001  set B data....<br />
<br />
not different table....<br />
<br />
now do u think this may take lesser time than the one you had mentioned....:D <br />

<br />
In your script you need:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
before.form:<br />
  tiitm001.item = item.1  |* I don't know where item.1 comes from?<br />
  execute(find.data) <br />
<br />
form.2:<br />
before.form:<br />
  tiitm001.item = item.2  |* I don't know where item.2 comes from?<br />
  execute(find.data)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Easy!</div></div><hr />
