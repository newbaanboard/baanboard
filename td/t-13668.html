<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImmuBaan</div><div class="date">19th November 2003, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to output and save our invoices in the .bpf format (because we want to retain the format incase they need to be reprinted on their preprinted forms).  However, out invoices run as a job at night, and there's no way we can do print preview and then save as because they are running as an automated night job.  <br />
<br />
So I was wondering if it's possible to automate the process of outputting to .bpf ????<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very simple:<br />
In 'Sessions per job' (ttaad5101s000) in the output details, you enter a device type that writes to a file - or even better, you create a new device for output to a bpf-file - and in the file name you enter a .bpf file name. The files will then be saved as bpf files.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImmuBaan</div><div class="date">19th November 2003, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the suggestion.  I should have mentioned that I tried that already.  The only problem is while the file is saved as a .bpf, the format of the report is not retained.  And since this report is being printed on a pre-printed form, the format must be retained.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImmuBaan</div><div class="date">19th November 2003, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, after I created a new device and removed the 4GL Program and Argument entries (default is ttstpconf &amp; ASCII), everthing worked great!  <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help...</div></div><hr />

Don't really understand what the problem was. Maybe you can just explain in short what caused the problem and how it was solved, so that others can learn from it when facing a similar situation.<br />

Thanks! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImmuBaan</div><div class="date">20th November 2003, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I originally copied the F device which contained values in the 4GL Program and Argument (default is ttstpconf &amp; ASCII).  When I used this new device with values in these parameters, the file that was generated (saved) was formatted just as if I printed a regular text file (.txt).  However, since we use pre-printed forms, I needed the format of the report (saved file) to be the same as the pre-printed form.  For whatever reason when I removed those two values, the report saved in the proper format.  I'm assuming it's because it tried to convert the output to ASCII?  Someone else maybe able to shed more light on this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">21st November 2003, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try following code before rprt_open. This will have your invoices open in bwprint in the next morning.<br />
<br />
if job.process then<br />
	spool.device = &quot;windows&quot; |Name of windows type printer device<br />
	spool.preview = true |to get the output in bwprint<br />
endif <br />
<br />
While creating job also u may specify the windows type printer .<br />
<br />
Further u can always reprint the invoice later on also and view the same in next morning if required. It's baan standard functionality.</div></div><hr />
