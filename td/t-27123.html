<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">16th May 2006, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I need a variable as a counter to make a page break after 4 Records in a lable report. Unfortunately the free$ variable is already used. <br />
I tried a normal variable, but after each lable (4 are on each side) the variable ist 0 again.<br />
So, how can I transfer the value of my counter from lable to lable?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th May 2006, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure I understand - you can count each time a layout is printed.  After the 4th time you can issue the page() command.  Are you opening and closing the report each time or sending all the records to be printed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">16th May 2006, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I defined a variable which should be increased each time a lable is printed, but the variable keeps 0 all time. After 4 lables there should be a page break which is already realized (the position is stored in free$ at the end of each lable). If the report contains a value of labels not divideable by 4 I get no page break at the end and the printer wait 2 Minutes.<br />
<br />
Bthw. we are using Kyocera Printers with makros, no default baan reports.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th May 2006, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you just add a after report layout and set the page break?  This would force the page break once everything is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">17th May 2006, 07:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably variable is also input field. Remove that from input field and declare the same in report script , it will not be zero . <br />
<br />
Also Mark's  suggestion can be tried .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">17th May 2006, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, my first try was to use the &quot;after report layout&quot;. But then after each lable the after report layout section is executed. So unfortunately each lable is sent as a seperate report (the makros from the printer care for the right position on the sheet of paper - 4 on each).<br />
I think this is the reason why my variable is reset after each lable.<br />
The original programmers of the report used the free$ variable to save their counter after printing a lable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th May 2006, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you just add a new variable to the report and session?  In the session script you can do something like this:<br />
<br />
    cnter = cnter + 1<br />
    rprt_send()          | Send one label<br />
    if cnter = 4 then<br />
          cnter = 0<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
Then in the report you would have a empty after.report layout with the page clicked.  The output expression for this layout would be cnter=4.  Remember cnter has to be declared external and added to the report.  This layout would only print when the cnter was equal to 4.</div></div><hr />
