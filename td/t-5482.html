<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">12th June 2002, 02:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of us know the difference between inrange and between in Baan SQL. This is the situation I had:<br />
+Selection Range----------------------------------+ <br />
¦ Business Partner        FFFFFFFFF  -  FFFFFFFFF ¦ <br />
¦ Year/Period             FFFF/FF    -  FFFF/FF   ¦ <br />
+-------------------------------------------------+<br />
The Year/Period were coming from tfacr200. In this table (BaanERP) they are not a combined field. My need was to be able to select contiguous year/periods. For eg:Year/Period             2001/10    -  2002/02 is a valid range. The usual select will not work here.<br />
<br />
Ok, here is the solution I found perusing some scripts in &quot;tf&quot;. The select needs to look like this.select	tfacr200.*<br />
from	tfacr200<br />
where	{tfacr200.year, tfacr200.prod} between {:year.f, :prod.f} and<br />
		{:year.t, :prod.t}...<br />
<br />
The idea of creating a combined field on the fly seemed to be very nifty to me. Thought I would share this with you guys. If you already knew this please ignore my excitement :).</div></div><hr />
