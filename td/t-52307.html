<br />
Is there any behavior difference on these two statements?<br />
<br />
Function  abc()<br />
{<br />
<br />
long  count<br />
Â….<br />
if count &gt; 0 then <br />
or<br />
if count then<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
I believe that a long if it is greater than 0 will consider as true for a boolean comparison, isn't it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd May 2008, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - I believe that is what the support center told me.  In baan it must be 0 to be false and anything else is true.  I am not 100% sure of that, but I think they told me that back 3 to 4 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">23rd May 2008, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used it that way always... but I got a complain from a user on a customized session and by checking the script, it is the only thing that I could think of that could make it fail.<br />
<br />
I'll stick to the believe of 0 false, greater than 0 true.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

Actually I was debugging someone elses program. We have seen this several times with various little things - nothing serious, but just enough to make us wonder about backend issues. Those type things us developers do not really see.</div></div><hr />

No. The boolean comparison considers if its 0 or not. <br />
Here is a sample code:<br />
<br />
long count<br />
<br />
count = 1<br />
if count then<br />
	message(&quot;True&quot;)<br />
else<br />
	message(&quot;False&quot;)<br />
endif<br />
count = 0<br />
if count then<br />
	message(&quot;True&quot;)<br />
else<br />
	message(&quot;False&quot;)<br />
endif<br />
count = -1<br />
if count then<br />
	message(&quot;True&quot;)<br />
else<br />
	message(&quot;False&quot;)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
In LN there is a new datatype for boolean. The online help on the forum does not have the boolean listed.<br />
<br />
Data types<br />
There are six types of variables: long, double, boolean, string, table, and domain variables.<br />
<br />
Long variables can contain any whole number from -2147483648 to 2147483647. For numbers beyond this range, use double variables instead. Physically, four bytes are reserved for each long variable.<br />
Double variables are used for any number containing a decimal point, with a maximum of 15 significant digits (8 bytes).<br />
Boolean variables can have two values: true or false.<br />
A string variable contains a string constant. The maximum length of a string is 1024 characters.<br />
A table variable is used for database tables in your program. The table must be defined in the data dictionary.<br />
A domain variable is a variable of a certain type that is defined in the data dictionary. Each of the following types are possible: long, byte, integer, date, enumerate, set, float, double, string, text. Each domain defined in the data dictionary can be used in a declaration of your program. See also Domains.<br />
<br />
To avoid potential issues it is always good to be explicit, when you are using a long variable for boolean behavior and avoid &quot;if count then&quot; statements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th May 2008, 02:03</div></div><div class="posttext">NPR - is that a feature of LN?  A couple of service packs back, the support center told me (and I think this is what they said) in baan 4 a boolean is false it will always be 0.  Then everything else is true.  <br />
<br />
I agree with your last statement to clear confusion.</div></div><hr />
