If you happen to know if it not supported under a specific porting set, but actually runs, please let me know that too.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have stopped supporting qkey for quite some time and it has been &quot;end of lifed&quot; for over three years.  Fullscope could not tell me if it will stop working for any versions of Baan5 or LN porting sets or feature packs going forward.<br />
<br />
So I am back to square 1.<br />
<br />
Are there ANY qkey customers out there are are using LN, or 5x and if so, what porting set and or feature pack are you using?  If you were a qkey customer and the functionality stopped working for a particular porting set, that would be very good information to know.<br />
<br />
It seems this is the only way we can definitively know if it stops working at some point.</div></div><hr />

I have written my own to cut down the time it takes to create the wrappers around standard objects.  Rush works ok, except you have to do a lot of typing, expecially if you are using it for a DLL or DAL.  RMC has RMCGEN that is similar to QKEY, although I have not seen the product personally. I plan to release my version shortly in both a limited edition and a supported version.<br />
<br />
Please contact me if you would like to discuss further.</div></div><hr />
