<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">5th September 2006, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 3 type form session. The principal table has 10 fields that are similar in all the records for a group, the same behavior that the table tfgld102 (no finalized transactions).<br />
<br />
I want to show this 10 fields only one time in the 3rd type form session, and:<br />
--- if the user modifies some of these fields that automaticamente are modified in all the registries.<br />
--- if the user create a new record in the 2nd type part of the form, the record has the 10 fields shows in the above part of the form<br />
<br />
Is it possible? How can I do that?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th September 2006, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what she is saying is that there are 10 fields on a table that she only wants to show once as multi-occurence session.  If the user changes once of the fields then this field is updated for the specified view fields.  I can picture what she is asking, but I do not have a good solution.<br />
<br />
I had a requirement like this for workcenters - what I did was write a separate session where the user could provide me the main workcenter and/or the sub-workcenter ranges, then the user would give the field value to set all the records for that group to.  Kind of what she is asking - I think she really wants a maintain session and not a processing session like the attached.</div></div><hr />

If I understand well, then it's not so complicated at all. In the when.field.changes sections of the view fields (first table), you just write an update query for all those records matching the currently selected view fields (top part of screen). You may want to use alias in your queries, to make sure that your pointers are not messed up... This is the concept. Hope this gets you somewhere. If you are stuck with anything, just post us your scripts and some screenshots, and we will surely try to assist you further!<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

If I want to change something in one field of this part the control goes to the first field of the second part. I cannot change anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">14th September 2006, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, because that is how the type 3 form works. What you should try, is to put the view fields (top part of screen) as stand-alone form fields, not as table fields. Then in your script, write the update queries based on your current form field selections</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much for your quickly answer.</div></div><hr />

I change the name of the field by stand-alone fields and I have the same result. I cannot have the control of this fields.<br />
<br />
Some ideas?</div></div><hr />
