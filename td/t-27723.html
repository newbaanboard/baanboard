Are you sure there is error while compilation. AFAIK, there is no error in your report. The contents are displayed every time a report is compiled. Have you checked by actually running the report whether report is compiled with your changes in report?<br />

<br />
As it has been said before, the first attachment has no error and the second one shows that there is an error but we can know it.<br />
<br />
Try to compile again and post the error.<br />
<br />
Also it will be helpful if you post your report script.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">28th July 2006, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are confused. The first attachment does not show any error. The second doesn't specify any error. If the output of compiling the report now, is what we saw on the first attachment, then your report is fine. Do what George said: run the report and check if it's working (i.e. if the changes got compiled). If you're not sure (depending on what your changes are), just write a message or so in  your script, and track it, OR compile in debug mode and see if you get the debugger..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">28th July 2006, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also check if the report is compiled correct by checking the modifucation date/time of the object ( not the source ). If the report is compiled with errors the object will not be modified.<br />
<br />
Futhermore you could check if any errors as a result of the bic objects did occur in the $BSE/log directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why dont u actually include an erorr in your report script and compile it and let us know the output. Then remove the error and compile it again. <br />
<br />
It seems like you are compliling it in in5p VRC, do you always carry out the development in this VRC? I wonder whether it has to do something with access rights for the report object. This is just guesswork but let us know your findings.<br />
<br />
It is indeed a peculiar case :confused: <br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />
