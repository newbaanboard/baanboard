<br />
We create in the Product configurator a 31 character text string like this :<br />
<br />
&quot;Length:  123.0000m +-15mm    &quot;<br />
<br />
I need to copy into a string variable everything AFTER the meterage in the string. In other words, I want to extract &quot;+-15mm&quot; from the string. Once the string is trimmed, the +-15mm is pretty well constant as far as spacing it takes ( all tolerances are 6 characters long )<br />
<br />
I cannot find any advanced operators for extracting within a string. Can anyone point me to the right direction ?  Thx !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">_Ralph_</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 23:08</div></div><div class="posttext">U can use string.scan<br />
<br />
<br />
domain tcmcs.str256  primary.string<br />
domain tcmcs.str256  secondary.string<br />
<br />
primary.string = &quot;Length: 123.0000m +-15mm &quot;<br />

Hope it helps! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">OH, OK, I see. Thankfully  there is no M in before the metrage  :) .... <br />
<br />
I'll try that out. \\BTW, what does the S stand for at the end ?  I presume that 's' could be anything except a value between the m and the end of the string ?<br />
<br />
I'll give it a shot, thanks again ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The m is the separator and the &quot;%s&quot; means the remaining string.  Look at the sprintf command to see what else you could do with the format string.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, since I am looking at a numeric reference in my code, I have to use a text.to.buf conversion too.<br />
<br />
This meant my string vars to the following array style.<br />
<br />
extern	string			ordered_length(23,1)<br />
extern	string			field_cut_length(28,1)<br />
<br />
	text.to.buf(&quot;tipcs021.txta&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,1,ordered_length)<br />
	<br />
	string.scan(ordered_length(23,1),&quot;m%s&quot;,field_cut_length(28,1))<br />
<br />
Now, I origianlly had both these string fields set to 30.<br />
<br />
ordered_length grabs text &quot;Length: 40.0000m  +/-15mm    &quot;. This one seems to work just as expected.<br />
<br />
BUT, when I do string scan I would get nothing with more than 29 characters in the string.I found out the problem was when I scanned in past the next 'm' in ordered_length  :( ...  then it gives me nothing .. can't even view the variable at all.<br />
<br />
something else that was strange, field_cut_length in debug gave me &quot;                                                     -&quot; as the result, so it doesn't seem to be picking up the scan properly ...  pads in pile of blank spaces, so I must be off with the string.scan function.<br />
<br />
I tried numerous lengths of strings for testing but anywhere past the position when a second 'm' pops up, there is nothing ...  Strangeness ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this the actual command you used - string.scan(ordered_length(23,1),&quot;m%s&quot;,field_cut_length(28,1))?  I think it should be string.scan(ordered_length(1,1),&quot;m%s&quot;,field_cut_length(1,1)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, you see, when I tried the 1,1 earliser, I also changed my string variables to the same.<br />
<br />
This time I left them as declarations of 30,1 and 30,1  and changed the string.scan as you suggested.<br />
<br />
I don't think i fully understand the difference between why my declarations have to show all 30 characters of the string and why string.scan only needs (1,1). I thought it needed to scan all the 30 places of my string declar.  Darn ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I say one step closer because now both ordered_length and field_cut_length both equal the same values:<br />
<br />
&quot;length:  24.000m   +/-15mm   &quot;<br />
<br />
So it looks like it missed the first 'm' ...<br />
<br />
wow, i didn't expect this to be so hard, but definately my 'greenness in the syntax' has not helped me at all ..  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marioth</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">This from the manual from BaaN, hopes it helps.    <br />
<br />
long STRING.SCAN( str_expr, string format(.) [, variable, ...] )<br />
    This function scans the given string expression str_expr using the<br />
    format string. The values found in the string expression are placed in<br />
    the specified variables. Conversion symbols should be stated in the<br />
    format string at the position where an expression is expected. The<br />
    function scans the string expression as long as characters belongs to<br />
    the given format, or until a separator is found. For example, in case of<br />
    conversion symbol %d, the system keeps reading until a non-digit is<br />
    encountered. The following conversion symbols can be used:<br />
<br />
    %s   for (multibyte) strings<br />
    %f   for doubles<br />
    %d   for longs<br />
<br />
    A separator should be always one unique character. Make sure that the<br />
    separator is not used in another string in the string expression.<br />
    If more than one separator characters are placed between two conversion<br />
    symbols they are ignored unless they are matching with the input.<br />
    Note that scanning of the argument stops if the input character mathes<br />
    with the first expecting separator character.<br />
<br />
    This function is able to scan multibyte characters. This only applies to<br />
    the input string. The function doesn't allow the use of multibyte<br />
    characters as separators in the format string. The function returns the<br />
    number of scanned fields.<br />
<br />
    Examples:<br />
    double D<br />
    long L<br />
    string S(80)<br />
    long ret<br />
<br />
    ret = string.scan(&quot;string 123 456.78&quot;,&quot;%s %d %f&quot;,S,L,D)<br />
    | S contains &quot;string&quot;, L contains 123, D contains 456.78<br />
<br />
    ret = string.scan(&quot;string|123|456.78&quot;,&quot;%s|%d|%f&quot;,S,L,D)<br />
    | S contains &quot;string&quot;, L contains 123, D contains 456.78</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, I read that about 10 times and what was suggested should work according the that, as %s should be my string ...  <br />
<br />
hey, I see what you mean, says it should be a unique character.  With that, I grabbed the ':' instead, now the field_cut_length = the first 15 characters of the string, not the first 15 after the ':'  LOL   Man .....  <br />
<br />
Still at it ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally I understand this !<br />
<br />
I had to make a bunch of declaration variables and basically break up the string into little chunks and only look at the chunks I want to ...   man, clear as mud ...<br />
<br />
So, final working sol'n was :<br />
<br />
<br />
string.scan(ordered_length(1,1),&quot; %s:%sm%s&quot;,field_cut_length(1,1),field_cut_length2(1,1),field_cut_length3(1,1))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That grabs FCL = Length<br />
                FCL2 = 24.0000<br />
                FCL3 = +/-15mm.<br />
<br />
Boy, seems so simple now that I get it  :) ...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help and hints !!!!!<br />
<br />
Much appreciated ....</div></div><hr />
