I have a problem to link a label with field table.<br />
I create a table in td com with number 902 and create domains for this table, but when I have created lables for the table, don't find label corrisponding with field created.<br />
How can I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th July 2019, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure I completely understand.  You created a table and when you created the table did you type some label descriptions in?  And now when you got to like maintain labels you do not see them?  And did I get it right td com or tc com?  I am on 4c4 and only have tccom package and module.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RavCOder</div><div class="date">30th July 2019, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created three tables :<br />
tdcom901<br />
tdcom902<br />
tdcom904<br />
I entered the domains and labels , and then run the convert runtime dictionaries.<br />
Now I have a problem with session: I have created a session for the management of the tdcom901 table only, but it gives me errors of the type that it cannot find the domains that I have created before.<br />
I don't know how to do it, because I haven't found solutions to my problem.<br />
Unfortunately I'm a new Ln developer so I don't know if I did the right steps.<br />
p.s I also checked if the package was correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">30th July 2019, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend you to take atleast a basic training on Infor LN Technical things so that you can easily do simple development activities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably your CRDD didn't ran well? Did you check via GTM(ttaad4500) if you are able to open the table? If you face the similar errors there, you need to convert your domains as well. Again, I would recommend going through the basics so that you can troubleshoot the problems and do smoother developments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RavCOder</div><div class="date">30th July 2019, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I only saw the official documentation and saw that to do training you need an account that I don't have.<br />
Where can I find more information on how to develop?</div></div><hr />
