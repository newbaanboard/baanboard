<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th June 2012, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming you have developer id and VRC permissions. <br />
(1) Copy report to your development VRC.<br />
(2) Edit the report<br />
(3) Add new input field to report.<br />
(4) Then maintain the layouts - I usually just maintain all layouts.<br />
(5) If necessary expand the header layout and add header for the field.<br />
(6) If necessary expand the detail layout(or layout where field will go) and then use edit and add the new field.<br />
(7) Save and exit report.  Then compile the report.<br />
<br />
These are some of the basic steps and depending are what you are doing it is going to be a little different.</div></div><hr />

I want to add Item Description column in &quot;Print purchase order by order number&quot; report after item code column. So give me solution about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th June 2012, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I put the basic steps above and all the commands are on the menu bar.  Good luck! And look into getting some training.  Baan is not exactly the easiest to pickup.  And search this board first reading as many threads as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was &quot;punished&quot; for an answer like this a few years ago :confused:. See<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th June 2012, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">It may seem like it, but I do not think so.  If you notice nobody else has responded to the thread and I was not intending to sound short or anything in my response. I wanted the requestors to make some attempts at trying it themselves. I do not ignore any thread posted in this forum.  If I can answer then I give it a try.<br />
<br />
So I answered the first question in my first post.  The subsequent questions were add ons - also answered by my first post.  It was kind of strange to get so many questions on the same topic in the same thread - especially by new users for their first post.  I pointed out that was answered in the first thread, recommended training(BaaN is not that easy) and recommended reading the board.  At the same time they came back and deleted their threads - not sure why.  They are always more than welcome to report any post - even mine.  The reported posts end up in the moderator forum and Pat will see them.  Even I am can be reported.<br />
<br />
Now if the OP posted some screen shots and errors then my response might have been different. The requestors do need to try some on this on their own.  The other thread was a back and forth.  There have been multiple threads where training gets recommended.  We do our best to make all feel welcome, but we are not perfect.</div></div><hr />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">11th June 2012, 05:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you mark. This is forum is help in situation with assumption that users have some knowledge of Baan and cannot be a forum to train it, as it is not a realistic things. I do see you answer lot of queries and I really appreciate your effort.<br />
