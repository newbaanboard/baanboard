<br />
we have a customised session which looks up in some standard table for particular condition to be true and then updates our customised tables.<br />
this is as per sequential programming rules so no harm in it. have also debugged the code many times and it works perfect.<br />
<br />
but in Live run time env. many a times the table am referring to is updated after i refer to it and my condition fails and our table is not updated although conditions are right and it should be updated.<br />
<br />
is it possible for the system to behave in such asynchronous manner??<br />
<br />
also for the delay to be introduced (as i have did 500 throughputs) what could be the right no. of iterations needed for the system to have synchronised operation.<br />
<br />
Please sugggest <br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
