Hi!<br />
what is you question? If you want to know how to send a mail I would recommend you to use the Baan eMessage Connector if available in B4. In case it's not available I would use some shell script or other executable.<br />
As you arent using a question mark, it is hard to figure out what your question or problem is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pradeepcr</div><div class="date">8th March 2019, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response. We are using a device called 'OUTLOOK' where the report is sent as an attachment in an email from outlook. My question is - how to pass the recipient email address from the program script into the outlook message and also send the email behind the screen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th March 2019, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I don' think the emessage connector is available in 4c4.  What we did was just use sendmail - I assume that is available for Linux. Based off the other post you made on the topic.  Is it an option?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pradeepcr</div><div class="date">12th March 2019, 22:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark,<br />
sendmail is available in our Linux and we can use shell command in the program script. But cannot send the report as an attachment. <br />
<br />
So used a device type called OUTLOOK and the argument calls the outlook API and attaches the report to email - issue here is we should be able to pass the email id and send the mail automatically with out user input required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th March 2019, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry we actually switched to mailx - and we used 2 different commands the uuencode I think makes the file an attachment.<br />
<br />
		cmd = 	&quot;uuencode &quot; &amp;<br />
			err.file.name &amp; &quot; Errors.txt &gt;&gt; &quot; &amp; temp.file &amp; &quot; | mailx -s 'PeopleSoft/Baan Employee Errors (Automated Email)' &quot; &amp; <br />
|			strip$(email.addr) &amp; &quot;&lt;&quot; &amp; temp.file<br />
<br />
And in this case I think(not sure) - it send everything in the body of the message.  You can even see where we did an update last year and I had to pause it because it was having a issue going out.<br />
<br />
function send.some.msg(string mail.addr(1024), domain tppdm.cprj mail.cprj, string mail.body(255))<br />
{<br />
	string	temp.file(255), msgtxt(255), cmd(2048)<br />
	long	inputfile, rc<br />
<br />
| Create temporary file to copy the PC file to<br />
	temp.file = creat.tmp.file$(bse.tmp.dir$())<br />
	temp.file = strip$(temp.file)<br />
	inputfile = seq.open(temp.file,&quot;w&quot;)<br />
	msgtxt = &quot;Project &quot; &amp; strip$(mail.cprj) &amp; strip$(mail.body)<br />
	rc = seq.puts(msgtxt, inputfile)<br />
	rc = seq.flush(inputfile)<br />
	rc = seq.close(inputfile)<br />

	cmd = 	&quot;mailx -s &quot; &amp; chr$(34) &amp;&quot;Project &quot; &amp; strip$(mail.cprj) &amp; chr$(34)&amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; strip$(mail.addr) &amp; &quot;&lt;&quot; &amp; temp.file<br />
	rc = shell(cmd, SHELL_NO_OUTPUT)<br />
	suspend(2000) 	| 20180801 - add suspend to give the email a few seconds to get set.<br />
	rc = seq.unlink(temp.file)<br />
}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pradeepcr</div><div class="date">13th March 2019, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">mailx worked similar to sendmail utility but not the attachment command did not work. it did not give any errors but does not do anything, not even an email is sent. Thanks for your help. Do let me know if you come across any other commands that can do attachments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th March 2019, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you try with uuencode? I shelled out to unix and did this manually at the unix prompt:<br />
uuendcode search.csh errors.txt&gt;&gt;test1.txt  - this create the encoded file.<br />
mailx -s 'Test' myemailaddress.com &lt;test1.txt - mail the file<br />
<br />
It came into my email as an attachment. Of course nothing in the body of the message but it was an attachment that I could read and see my shell script.  Not pretty but it did work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th March 2019, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I did it again but this time I did:<br />
uuendcode search.csh errors.txt&gt;&gt;test1.txt - this create the encoded file.<br />
cat search.csh errors.txt&gt;&gt;test2.txt<br />
mailx -s 'Test' myemailaddress.com &lt;test2.txt - mail the file<br />
<br />
This time I got the script in the body of the message and as an attachment.</div></div><hr />

For uuencode I would add the copy command in front.  When you shellout it typically runs in your home directory.
