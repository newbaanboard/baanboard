<br />
I have a requirement to provide Windows-like functionality: in several multi-occurence display sessions, it should be possible to click on a column (or a button above the column) and the display should get sorted by that column. Press again, it will be sorted in descending order. Press a different columnt, all records will be sorted in that column, etc. Really like Windows functionality. <br />
<br />
I have never done this yet, nor given it a proper thought of how to do it best. Preferably I would make it a general solution (dll or so) which will be able to be used in many display sessions. Is there any way of implementing the actual Windows functions?? If not, has any of you done such a thing? Any tips, advice, etc are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

<br />
We have the Query in Tools menu in a Session, you can goto the second form and set your choice of sort.<br />
<br />
We can automate this, I hope and give more flexibility.<br />
<br />

To go to the filter option, click second form, and then select the fields etc, is quite a hassle. How can I make myself a shortcut? Can I access the ttstpqbf functions/fields myself in the program script? If yes, please give me an example..<br />

Thanks,<br />

Baan does not allow you to place buttons on top of columns (as a matter of fact, it does not allow you to place buttons anywhere specific since it handles the button placement for you).<br />
<br />
You can retrieve and pass mousepointer coordinates, but you should ask yourself if you really want to go there.<br />
In the end it is most likely a lot cheaper to train the users how to use Baan.</div></div><hr />

Psudo code would be:<br />
<br />
<br />
choice.user.1:<br />
|* Button on Form for Export to Excel<br />
on.choice:<br />
      Select same data as on the form (same key info)<br />
      Write a .CSV file of this data<br />
      Open excel with .csv file as input, using the app_start command<br />
<br />
<br />
I have done this before, it's not too slow.  The excel sheet comes up on their PC, then they can sort, total, whatever they are used to.  If they need to update, this would be more complex, but you could write an excel update using OLE.</div></div><hr />

Press a different columnt, all records will be sorted in that column, etc.<br />
If you have the columns as Index fields and if you enable Dynamic Index Switching you get the option to choose View -&gt; Index.<br />
<br />
The problem is not with sorting the data, but with emulating the point-and-click functionality.<br />
Baan does not allow you to place buttons on top of columns (as a matter of fact, it does not allow you to place buttons anywhere specific since it handles the button placement for you).<br />
This is possible in Webtop, but only for the Index fields.<br />
Alternatively, you can add buttons on the form for different fields and add code to execute a rebuild.query(). <br />
Another option is to put on a button to export to Excel. You can do this yourself, or check out Nazdaq's tools.<br />
You have to write more code to do that and Nazdaq's tools are options from the print session and not maintain. Alternatively, you can use the option : Edit -&gt; Copy to Clipboard and paste in an Excel sheet.</div></div><hr />
