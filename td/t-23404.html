I don't know what about baanV, but in baanIV there isn't the event &quot;double click&quot;. Howewer, you could simulate this event adding a button on the form (with a zoom.to$ in its on.choice section) and setting it as the default button, as it happens with many subsection of display type. <br />
The result is the one you need: double clicking on a record you'll open the other session.</div></div><hr />

I disagree: you enter in choice mark.occur (and so on the zoom) at the first click on the occurence, not with the doubleclick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">10th March 2005, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">True, unless you count the number of clicks and, if the count is 1 you give a choice.again(). Only with count is 2, perform the desired action like zooming.<br />
