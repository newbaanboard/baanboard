<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">18th December 2013, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">We are migrating from UNIX to Windows.  This is one of several issues to overcome.<br />
<br />
In shipping, we have 2 printers. Each printer has 3 trays.<br />
<br />
I need to print packing lists from tray 3.<br />
I need to print invoices from tray 2.<br />
<br />
So, following your directions, I have run all changed devices to windows printers and ran each report, saving it on the desktop. Open bwprint as administrator. Open packing list files and right click assigning bin0 as tray 3.<br />
<br />
Then I open invoice files, right click and assign bin0 as tray 2.<br />
<br />
Then I print each document from both printers. Using the above sequence, all documents are pulled from tray2.<br />
<br />
Since the packing lists are supposed to be pulled from tray 3, I reset bin0 to tray 3 in the packing lists.<br />
<br />
Then I print each document from both printers and all documents are pulled from tray 3.<br />
<br />
I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I need some help.</div></div><hr />
