This session doesn't appear to have a script in it's standard form. Is it possible to create a script or will that need access to source.<br />
<br />
My change is to include some data from another table onto one of the sessions forms.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
As this is only a display session, can you not use 'generate sessions' to create a new display session for the table (tdrpl100) and add code to look up the new fields from the additional table(s). <br />

<br />
 I don't have any experience of the product, so I cannot really comment on its effectiveness or if it is totally relevant to your problem.  Just thought I'd mention it.</div></div><hr />

Then again if you all purchased the source, then I would give Baan a call to get it. <br />
<br />
If you do not own source then you can use a product like Qkey or the Rush project that ~Vamsi has setup.  We own Qkey, but I have started to work on ~Vamsi's code. I am still far from complete.  Anyway both Qkey and Rush allow you to extend Baan functionality of a session, without having to own the source. <br />

When I get a chance I will edit this message and drop in some links.<br />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
You say that there is a script associted with this but if you go to ttadv2130m000 - Maintain program scripts there is no tdrpl0514 script available to view. Is this normal?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

When I ran Generate Sessions and get down to the section that generates the script which option do I pick under &quot;Stndrd Script&quot;?<br />
<br />
Anything on Form 2 that I need to know about?<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
We are on Baan 4c3 and we have a script for that session.  As a matter of fact it is one of the few programs we have source for - must have some in on e of the patches.  So I am not sure why you do not see at least a record in ttadv2130s000.<br />
<br />
I do know that on certain type of sessions you do not have a script associated with it. But since I never create these type of sessions I can not recall any details on this. <br />
<br />
What does it say in ttadv2100m000 for the field standard script? Mine just has no with a script listed below it. Maybe that will help the others.<br />

I would click on generate script,put no to standard script and then fill in the script name that you want.  The only thing I would look at is the form type.  I usually end up running these a couple of times before it generates what I want.  Just remember to delete all of the components if you want to try again.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
In ttadv2100m000 it says &quot;Standard Script&quot; - No with the script tdrpl0514 listed below. The same as yours by the looks of things<br />

<br />
Choose form type 2.<br />
<br />
Remember to de-select any fields that you do not wish to be on the form(s).  ('Application', 'Selecting and ordering fields').  You should make sure that you select all fields relating to the key (index1).<br />

<br />
No I do not think it is normal to have a session that has a script and you can not see it in ttadv2130m000.  I know you only need the object to run the session, but usually we can see the script in ttadv2130m000, but when we try to view it we get some kind of message about the file not existing.  So I do not have a clue as to why you do not see it.<br />

<br />
Are you sure your developers parameters are set to show all Package VRC's?<br />
<br />
If you go to maintain sessions you will see the script associated with the session.  <br />

<br />
You are correct in what you are saying, I can see the script in B40_c4 but when I try to view it I'm told that the source for prpl05140 is not present.<br />
<br />
Yes I have developers authorisation for all VRC's<br />

<br />
I guess I did not understand the original question.  But &quot;yes&quot; it is normal to see a script in a VRC, and not be able to view it, IF you do not own source. At our site we do not own source code so we get the error you described. I was thinking that you did not see the script record in ttadv2130m000 - I WILL see the record, but when I click on view I get the source not present error.  The only way we get source is from patches. And I forgot all about the developers data and viewing all VRC's. Sigh.<br />
