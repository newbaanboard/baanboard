When a group is deleted all fields defined under that group get deleted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 11:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Form in LN doesnot have an independent existence, rather it is a integrated part of session itself. You may probably move the form object and modify the form, however you can move only &quot;form object&quot; and not &quot;form source&quot;. I dont know where the form *source* is stored.<br />
<br />
As pointed earlier you may modify the group as you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">schweizer</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your answers.<br />
I noticed, the problem is different.<br />
When I try to delete the group I get the message &quot;can not retrieve question&quot;, that means something is wrong with the installation or tools because the question code is not available.<br />
But thank you anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The question code is most probably the &quot;Confirm Group Delete&quot; which asks whether one wants to delete the group and all sub-components. Is the problem happening on all client machines? If no then most probably its a buggy installation of Dynamic Form Editor(try reinstalling it), else you should lodge a case with baan for the same</div></div><hr />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
