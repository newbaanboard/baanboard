<br />
I explored almost all the discussed topics for this reason but nothing worked for me.<br />
<br />
Recently we have disabled ftp port of our AIX server because of security reasons. Some users are still using ASCII mode.<br />
<br />
I am facing issues while using client2server as it is getting hanged because it internally uses ftp. Also client2server cant be used in jobs.<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell any alternate for downloading file to client or may be any example of file.mv.across.hosts function?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

Is &quot;Shared folder&quot; an option for you? You can put a file on a folder that is shared. The server can copy the file there and the client can take it by activating a copy script.<br />

<br />
1. Do u use server based program editor (like  VI ). Client based program editor too may not be working .<br />
2. Do u use server based direct or wondows server printing . Print devices such as baan2notepad , baan2excel, windows client printing may not work.</div></div><hr />

George - I think shared folder will not use in client2server.<br />
<br />
Hitesh - I just would like to copy 2 files from server to client PC.<br />
<br />
Gunther - Yes..its really bad news.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">9th September 2008, 07:35</div></div><div class="posttext">When default ftp port 21 is disabled or blocked , programs/functions running on default FTP port will not work e.g. server2client or client2server . So u need to configure another port for FTP routine legitimate FTP work (like 2 files  u want to transfer). For that purpose u need to write ftp scripts (bat / shell scripts ) to work on configured ftp port. <br />
<br />
As far as baan is concerned , many programs (standard &amp;/or customized ) use server2client and client2server. These programs may not work if u disable ftp port . U need to take Infor help to understand how u can accomplish this easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But is there any other alternates? Or do you have any example of file.mv.across.hosts function?<br />

<br />
My observations are not empirical ie I have not experienced such things  bcos i dont have such requirement . So please confirm / reject the observations with elaboration . That will help all others on the board while u take help from the board.<br />
<br />
I have experience of remote copy across unix servers for which there is sample code already posted on this board few years back . Source - destination needs to be prefixed with server name and exclamation mark. For windows also it should work. U can try UNC naming . For drive letters u can try C$ . <br />
<br />
That's  all. I dont have any tested samples for windows .<br />
<br />
Again posts the results of ur actions  when u r finished . The board can expect at least that much from u .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks...I will follow elaboration part.<br />
<br />
However, I am not sure sample code will work for me or not, since its different scenario (we have blocked ftp port). And as I wrote we are having AIX OS not windows.<br />
<br />
Will update my solution..soon.</div></div><hr />

File copy in ttdllfilehand works for sure for remote server copy. It's  tested on unix (solaris servers) .It does not use ftp  protocol / ports. It uses remote copy (rcp OS  command) .  If source and target both are on aix servers , it will work for sure.</div></div><hr />
