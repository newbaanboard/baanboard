<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jholdrid</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">My users are requesting that they have the capability to do a wild card query by customer name or prospect name where the main table of the session is not tccom010 but holds the customer number column.  The customer name is displayed on the form type 2.<br />
<br />
My users have entered many projects into a custom table and need to query by name in order to locate all projects that are for a particular customer and they do not know the customer number but do know part of a customer name so that they can for example, use (&quot;like&quot; .*VENT.*) to find VENTURI WASHINGTON.<br />
<br />
Is there any way that I can provide this functionality ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

My users have been trained in the use of the standard Baan Queries to make selections of records using the drop down -&gt; Tools -&gt; Query Options.  <br />
<br />
But in this instance, The Customer name is not listed on the query by form, only the customer number.  They want to query by customer name.<br />
<br />
Is this possible ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

You say the table holds a customer number - can't you provide a zoom to display customers?  The user could then run query by form on the name and find the customer number.  Then return to the main session and filter on it.  Does not sound too good, but it would be a solution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">13th October 2004, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternatively, you can ask the user for the field value and use rebuild.query() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_sql_query_extensions_rebuild_query).<br />
<br />
Refer to the posting - executing before.program()  (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_sql_query_extensions_rebuild_query)</div></div><hr />
