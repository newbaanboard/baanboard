   I am trying to run some program on the server using 3GL program with command run.prog().  But when I ran this 3GL on development server, every thing worked out well, but when I ported on production server, it is not working for some users.  <br />
<br />
   Java programs are executed for all normal &amp; power users, but when I execute some other programs, it doesnt work for normal users.   I am really wondering what kind of user credentials are used while executing commands thru run.prog().  Does it needs every user as power user on the server?  I dont think it is, because java programs are working for normal user.<br />
<br />
  I appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />

Are all of the users setup the same?  Do they all have access to where this file is?  Just some questions that may help someone else solve the problem.<br />

Not sure if that applies to your problem with run.prog.  I would also be interested if any network guru type has tracked down under what network user the exchange and run.prog functions use from the various Baan User / Network User combo's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trchandra</div><div class="date">21st March 2003, 06:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I explained our network guys, the complete scenario of the program how it is working on one system and not working on other system.  They found some interesting facts that the windows 2000 security policy is little bit different between two systems.  In order to change security settings, we need a system reboot, so we have to wait until weekend.  I 'll update once we get a solution.</div></div><hr />
