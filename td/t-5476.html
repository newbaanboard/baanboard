That works well if no other instance of bw.exe is running on the client at the same time.<br />

If a instance of bw.exe is running a runtime error occurs and <br />
the bw messeges window shows the following message:<br />
<br />
Error in CreateInstance(IUnknown*, REFID, LPVOID*). SendOleEvent timed out.<br />

Does anybody has an idea why this happens and how to fix it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This post and this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5350&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=2) mention the Set baan = CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application.nameofBWconfigfile&quot;) format.  My question is -Does this require a certain client?<br />
<br />
On my system I make sure I run my ole type reports one after the other just to avoid the problem olabas mentioned.  The format you and the other poster mentioned may solve this problem, but since I am on an older client b40c.044 and gunther mentioned a b40c.063(I think) client.  Would the newer client provide this functionality? I guess registry entries need to be created before the above format would work and I am thinking a new client would take care of that.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
The case no 112133 fixed my problem. The mistake was that ottstpoledaemon was not running. Now it works well.<br />
<br />
To mark_h:<br />
<br />
My idea was to give users some helpfull tools in excel. Normaly they will work with both (excel and baan) at the same time. That was just impossible before.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all</div></div><hr />
