<br />
When I try to open any form, in any session, I got the following error: NO CONNECTION COULD BE MADE (error 48; Error in Loading DLL)<br />
<br />
I installed LN on a new notebook. Same versions of BECS, BW, WORKTOP DFE and I had the old. <br />
<br />
I tried to uninstall everything and install with newer versions, but the error remains the same<br />
<br />
Can someone help me? <br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />

It uses the OLE connection that is in the bw configuration (Automation tab, classname). I had a different error, because working on a thin client not mine and I haven't the administrator option to change the register to write the new class into. Maybe is not your case, but you can check in the register if the class is written or there is something wrong in it?</div></div><hr />

In classname, i have the value &quot;Baan.Application.InforERPLN&quot;.</div></div><hr />
