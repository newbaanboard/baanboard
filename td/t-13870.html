<br />
I don't know if this is good place, but...<br />
<br />
I want ask about sources for BaaN. In Poland there is really big problems to reach sources. The is no problems eg for SAP. <br />
I want only to know if it is worldwide rule/restriction for that. It is very important to me, because of that we are consider option of moving BaaN out of company. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing wrong with the question.  I always assumed if you were willing to pay for the source then you would get it.  It is not cheap.  My company elected not to purchase the code, so we do not have source.  I think you will find that others around the world do not have source.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chodix</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">It is ok, but ... (again) ... we cannot even buy sources. It can be kind of solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the first I have heard of Baan not selling source in any country.  Maybe someone else from Poland will see and answer this question.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The question is do you really need source?  There are a lot of people who have Baan and donÂ’t have source code. They using Q-Key from Fullscope (www.fullscope.com), RMCgen from RMCis (www.rmcis.com) or RUSH (Baanboard) to modify the code.  (Do a search on RUSH and you can find additional information.)  There was actually a presentation from RMCis at the 2003 BWU conference regarding this issue. <br />
<br />
Additionally, remember that once you starting modifying source code you are creating a maintenance issue.  Anytime there is a patch that involves a script that you modified you will have to get the update source and reapply you changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 23:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time I asked in UK, I was told that Baan were not going to sell any more source code licences. This was approximately 1 year ago.<br />
<br />
Not sure if SSA think differently........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chodix</div><div class="date">9th December 2003, 00:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I know these restictions about maintanance. I will plain use Fullscope solution for avoid that problem, but for example in sales I need to do changes with standard sessions. Sometimes lack of sources means that You have to create something what can be done by using combination of standard functions. Cheapper way is getting or buying sources. <br />
I cannot understand BaaN in case of sources. Another systems gives You that option in standard.<br />
BTW I will check another from Qkey solutions. Maybe it will be solution for me. Qkey allow me only add my functions.<br />
<br />
Thanks for answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">9th December 2003, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you will have to distinguish between a source license (which includes ALL the Baan sources) and the source of a particular session. You should be able to get the latter one by Baan support, but you must be prepared to pay a fee for it.<br />
<br />
If that is not possible, I would strongly discourage you from using Baan - really. It is a MUST for running a business critical software to have the sources available if really needed, and Baan/SSA Global MUST be able to deliver those sources at least on demand if they want to stay in market. I do not know a single Baan installation in Germany without source code level customizations. QKEy etc. ist not an option, the TCO is far higher compared to creating (well documented) customizations in a Baan session script.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">9th December 2003, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">When I asked, they would not give me any source - even for 1 session. They wanted all their users to have customizations performed by themselves or their Authorised Customization Partners.<br />
As I said in my previous post, this was a policy around 12 months ago - I hope SSA Baan will have a better attitude.</div></div><hr />
