<br />
Pjohns , Please calm down. Germanicus was refering to a person &quot;BaaN Decision Manager&quot; &amp; it was not for you!!!<br />
<br />
Some fun has to be there during serious discussions !<br />
<br />
Enjoy</div></div><hr />

We are implementing DM2.1 right now.<br />
It is used as a tool to build Data Warehouses for KPI and other reporting.  So far I found it to be extremely easy to use (though admittedly we are just beginning).<br />
See the attached announcement from Baan on our implementation.<br />

<br />
in fact I have used a wrong word in my posting.<br />
<br />
Instead of vacation I wanted to say vacancy. <br />
<br />
I was going to point out that in most bigger companies there are managers for each strange (and useless) position.<br />
<br />
Or 2 managers for 1 job.<br />
<br />
But this can not happen in the Baan Organisation as it is<br />
compleatly LEAN now. :D <br />

<br />
Here is a serious reply to your question :-)<br />
<br />
Decision Manager is Baan's Business Intelligence solution (BIS).<br />
It has 2 parts - Infrastructure (ETL tools for datawarehouse) and Business Content (pre-defined templates). The beauty of DM templates is such that it can be deployed very easily for any BaanIVc or BaanERP 5.0c system. The implementation time is very short (vanilla basis). DM tools can read data from any ODBS complient database and content from Legacy or Web can be also merged into the datawarehouse. Applications such as Crystal Reports (fixed format reports) and Crystal Analysis Professional (Analytic reports on OLAP) read and present the data for analytics.<br />
<br />
Content is available for domains such as Sales, Purchase, Inventory,Finance,Projects, Mfg. etc. This solution helps users to get answers such as : What is the trend in sales, which customers have large open amounts, which product is slow-moving and so on. It also has KPI's that indicte efficiencies of various business processes.<br />
<br />
Quite a serious and lengthy answer ? :-) Hope it got you some insight into it !</div></div><hr />
