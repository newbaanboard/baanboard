<br />
             I am trying to add a computed field to the form   for the session tisfc0130m00  report operations completed. I need to add a balance  field in the form - ie. (tisfc010.qplo - tisfc010.qcmp) - tisfc010.qrjc. As the program is standard program , there is no source code available. What is the best way out please advise.  Thank for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ncgjiju</div><div class="date">23rd August 2005, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I  have tried adding the expression and it does not work at all as it takes the field name lenght only . Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">23rd August 2005, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I see what you mean; indeed the input length of field &quot;field name&quot; is 17 positions only. Hmmm... then I don't know of a way without using a &quot;wrapper&quot; or AFS..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">23rd August 2005, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought of one other alternative: I don't know exactly what the needs are, but if you have important issues of viualisation, and you can stick it into a report, then you can do anything. In other words, you can attach a report to the print icon in the session, and in the report script, or the report field expressions even (those are long..) calculate according to your needs... Woudl this be a satisfying solution? It would be the &quot;cleanest&quot;....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think your suggestion will work. You still would need to modify the program script to call the report, right?<br />
<br />
I may be wrong but could you explain further on your suggestion, if you think it will work. Would like to know also as I need to add some data on existing forms.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">26th August 2005, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">What I mean is, if the requirements are good and clear visualisation of data, why not adding a reporting session to this session, which will be called simply by clicking the 'print' icon in the relevant session. Upon hitting the print button, all the relevant information pops up on the screen (I.e. print with bwprint-preview, so the user will still have the option to send the data to a printer)...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...<br />

str((tisfc010.qplo - tisfc010.qcmp) - tisfc010.qrjc) .<br />
This way u should be able to view the calculated item on form.</div></div><hr />
