The form was saved and exited.  Trying to start session produces 'Error: unknown formfield '&quot;$'&quot; (std_main() in object ottstpstandard). Trying to edit the form produces 'Run-time error 13' Type Mismatch' and the dynamic form editior automatically closes.  Basically, i need to remove this field from the form but cannot get to it through the editor, maintain form fields -- which is display only, or ttadv300 tables (appears dynamic form info is not contained there). <br />
<br />
how can i remove this field?<br />

thanks,<br />

This can be done on reports, and old-style baan forms, but the dynamic form editor has a problem with it. Does anyone know where/how dynamic forms store data???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">25th October 2002, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">You can look into the contents of the tables - ttadv300-318 which store the form data.<br />
<br />
Did you check the ttyeno domain as I mentioned early?</div></div><hr />

Was there ever a resolution to this issue posted? <br />
I didn't see one, but we have one programmer who is having the same problem and we don't know how to fix it. <br />
He's reloaded his laptop twice, reinstalled the LN DFE, but still gets the same error when he tries to modify or create a dynamic form. <br />
<br />
I did notice in table ttadv300, one of his forms has 17 occurrences (ttadv300.ocnr) which seems a little odd, when all other records have ocnr = 1. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />

<br />
As NPRao said, go to ttaad4100 for maintain tables and look for the ttadv300 to 318 tables.<br />
<br />
find the table with problems and modify its properties there.<br />
<br />
I solve my problem after that I put a wrong display format and after that get the message 'Type mismatch'.<br />
