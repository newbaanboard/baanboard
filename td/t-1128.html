I must open the zoom session tdilc0510s000 to show the locations associate to a certain wharehouse.<br />
The Zoom session is in the standard layer and I would not like to modify it. <br />
In practice the same behaviour which is present in the tdilc0110m000 session or in the tcmcs0103m000 (form 2).<br />
<br />
I have tried to set the value of the field tdilc001.cwar (in before.zoom event) with the wharehouse  which I have preselected but the session always shows me the first set. :mad: <br />
<br />
Help me!<br />
<br />
Bye<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">you can use export function in the session and import function in the subsession.<br />
<br />
The field has to be defined as extern in both programs.<br />
<br />
Main Session:<br />
<br />
before.zoom section<br />
<br />
export(&quot;variable&quot;,expression)<br />
<br />
In Subsession:<br />
<br />
In before.program:<br />
<br />
import(&quot;variable&quot;,ref variable)<br />
<br />
You have now in your called session the value to find.<br />
If you want to restrict occurrences to that value you can also use in this section the predefined variable queryextension<br />
<br />
queryextension=&quot; where ...=[value imported] and apply this only if import is successfull.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

This is OK, but I cannot modify the sub session. <br />
What I do not understand is as the sessions like the <br />
tcmcs0103m000 work, they do that one exactly that I would like without no particular code (at least then it seems to me). <br />
It must be another road there. <br />
<br />
Thanks however. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it doing a first set (same warehouse, first location) or first view (first warehouse, first location)? I could see first set if you didn't also define tdilc001.loca in your before.zoom since it is part of index1.  However, I get the impression that you are seeing first.view.  If so, I'm as puzzled as you.  You shouldn't have to import the table fields.<br />
<br />
I know you don't want to alter the zoom session, but could you at least temporarily put one in debug and see what is happening?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">E.Toniolo</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, it is a first.view (first warehouse, first location).<br />
<br />
Ok, I try to debug the session :( .<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't want to modify the subsession, it must be set up to recieve from a main and do the look up already.  There are 2 ways: <br />
1.  The session options are set to look up using the &quot;find.data&quot; (Refresh) Start Option.<br />
2.  The zoom.from section is written to receive values and do the lookup when zoomed to.  If that's set up, it will ignore the event defined in the session.<br />
<br />
The second is the most common.  But, this one doesn't do either.  It has no zoom from section, and the start option is &quot;get.defaults&quot; (??).   I suggest you copy the session only (not the script component) and change the start option to 7 - find.data (Refresh).</div></div><hr />

	There is no need for exporting/importing stuff or coding in the zoom sections.<br />
<br />
	Just assign the values to the &quot;find&quot; fields b4 calling zoom.to function.<br />
	In your case Warehouse.<br />
<br />
        Check the following example.<br />
         <br />
function main()<br />
{<br />
	string hold.str<br />
	 <br />
	table	ttdilc001<br />
	<br />
	tdilc001.cwar = &quot;3TR&quot;<br />
	zoom.to$(&quot;tdilc0510s000 &quot;, Z.SESSION, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
