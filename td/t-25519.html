<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">1st November 2005, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,  I have a session that have two forms. There is no button on form-1 and  there is a button I created on form-2. In general all user will use form-1 and  one or two people will use form-2. There are lots of fields on form2 and form2 is a big screen size. There are a few of fields on form1. When I run the session form1 's screen size is equal to form2 and too large! Because of form2 and form2's button. The posit&#305;on of button on form2 is right side. But I have a space in bottom of my form2. I think that If you change the position of button on form2, I managed to shrink my form2. In this way form1 screen will be small screen. I think that you understand my problem. I must use these two forms in a session. How can I handle screen size of form1 ?<br />

THANK YOU ALL !</div></div><hr />

You can't define where the buttons will be placed. These are always placed right to the data. <br />
<br />
Why not create a separate session for these specific users so all other users have the session with only the first form<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd November 2005, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Youp - sorry to dis-agree but in 4c3 and 4c4 you can place buttons anywhere you want.  You use the special field while editing the form and pick button.  If you do not like the default continue button on the right side of the form then define a button where you want and select option 50.  See attached.  Not sure I understand his request, but your suggestion of a separate session is a good answer.</div></div><hr />
