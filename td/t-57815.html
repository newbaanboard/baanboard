<br />
One of my clients has a new PC with Windows 7 on it. Latest BW is installed on it. There is a user 'jos' who can't logon to Baan on this particular PC. He can login however on any other PC. Here is the story.<br />
<br />
Jos types his username and password on the Windows 7 machine and the error<br />
Not authorized to run as user 'tftp'<br />
appears. Well, there is no user 'tftp'. Next he tries to logon as bsp: this is no problem. Even some other users can logon with BW on that PC, while jos is logged on as Windows user.<br />
<br />
The problem is not in the user settings; the u file 'ujos' states<br />
unixuser:jos<br />
If the problem was in the user settings, jos would not be able to logon on another (non Windows 7) PC.<br />
<br />
The command line in the BWC file is empty (there is no line like<br />
-- -set USER=tftp<br />
or something. I am beginning to wonder if this might have something to do with Windows 7...<br />
<br />
Any hints?</div></div><hr />

<br />
tftp is usually a protocol for filetransfer. Maybe the user jos has some scripts on the ERP server that uses this protocol for transfering files to/from the pc where the BW is running.<br />
<br />
Which OS is running on your ERP server ? Do you have checked the log files ?<br />
<br />
Are you using worktop ? if yes: Do you use central deployment for Worktop ?<br />
<br />
Did you try Webtop ? Do you get the same error ?<br />
<br />

<br />
I am aware of the fact tftp is a protocol, but I cannot understand why this error solemnly occurs when logging in as user 'jos'.<br />
<br />
The OS is HP-UX B.11.23 U ia64<br />
<br />
The logfiles only show lines like<br />

<br />
This problem occurs without worktop, just with plain BW, so central deployment is not an issue<br />
<br />
Webtop is not installed, so we can't try this.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I am not often at the customers site, so I cannot have a proper look at the Windows 7 machine on which this problem occurs. It is a problem on the specific PC, because Jos can login on another Windows 7 PC. Furthermore, it is the combination of Jos' PC and BW version B40c.97, because an old version of BW (version B40c.61) does not give any problems.<br />
<br />
So I have a workaround now, but I am really curious what causes this problem.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">16th February 2010, 13:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Please note, that bwc files for BW ver.61 and 97 are stored by default in different locations on local machine. For version 61 they are kept where BW is installed for instance:<br />
c:\Program Files\Baan\Lib\User<br />
Version 97 uses a directory in user area:<br />
&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Local\Infor\BW\Baan\Config<br />
<br />
So, you may use different bwc files to connect with different BW version. Did you locate and check both?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is of course a major difference. It still does not explain why one user can login and the other can't. I think the cause of this problem can only be found by a thorough investigation of this particular PC. What doesn't help is that version 97 is uninstalled by now. The configuration of PC's is the customerâ€™s responsibility, so I am afraid I will not get an answer on this one.</div></div><hr />
