I read the article they said I must add  tiitm001:455:ora(ORAPROF=0.2):N   into  tabledef6.1. I added and I logined baan. Run print sesion for tiitm001. It takes more than 30 seconds. But on unix I couldn't find oraprof file ?<br />
What is problem ?.  and What N means in command ? (N ? / Y ? )  where this file is located ????<br />
It should run only for tiitm001 in company 455. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Refer to - Oracle Database Driver Technical Reference Manual<br />
The format of the tabledef6.2 file is as follows:<br />
&lt;table name&gt;:&lt;company number&gt;:&lt;driver type&gt;(&lt;environment<br />
variable&gt;=&lt;value&gt;):&lt;audit Y/N&gt;<br />
If multiple environment variables are to be specified for a single table and<br />
company number, they are listed within the parentheses and separated by<br />
commas. If all tables or all companies are to be specified, the asterisk (*) is used<br />
in place of table name or company number. For example, the following entry can<br />
be made in the tabledef6.2 file:<br />
tccom010:812:ora(ORAPROF=0.4):N<br />
In this example all the queries on table tccom010812 which require at least 0.4<br />
seconds are logged in the ORAPROF file. Note that this table is considered to<br />
have a different database definition from other tables. If an Oracle driver is<br />
already running, but is accessing a different table, a separate driver will be<br />
started for this table. Environment variables that appear in the driver<br />
specifications of the tabledef6.2 file are put into the driverÂ’s environment before<br />
it is invoked, so they are available to the driver at startup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">23rd October 2006, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding your question about ORAPROF: I assume you created the entry by hand as it contains the N at the end.<br />
<br />
The short answer: set ORAPROF in the last line:<br />
<br />
*:*:oracle8(ORAPROF=0.0):<br />
<br />
The longer story:<br />
<br />
If you want to trace, never (or almost never) only trace only 1 table. The problem you are facing is probably not related to 1 table and by setting only tracing to this table you introduced another part of complexity: you started an additional  database driver and thus got more/ other queries than you normally would get.<br />
<br />
Further you specified ora, but ora should be replaced by the name of your oracle driver as specified in the ipc_info file, probably oracle8<br />
<br />
3rd point: ORAPROF will give you the bad query, but no relationship to an application query or why Oracle is doing this wrong. I recommend to use the Call Graph Profiler and Oracle SQL_TRACE.<br />
<br />
Last but not least I recommend to read this file (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7665).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
