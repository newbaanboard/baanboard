<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">21st February 2014, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
I have a question regarding the use of the open.url.local function in LN.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if it makes a difference what version of Internet Explorer is running on the users machine when trying to use the open.url.local function within a LN report script?<br />
<br />
We're both running the session through the LN webui.<br />
I have a link in a LN report script to a reporting services report using the open.url.local function. When I try to run it, I get an error stating cannot find webpage.  When a coworker runs the same session, the reporting services report appears with no problems.  The difference is that I have IE10 and he is running IE9.  <br />
<br />
I was wondering it anyone else has run into this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any comments,<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />
