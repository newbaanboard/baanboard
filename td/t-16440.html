<br />
There are three ways that I have used to get a file from the client - client2server, ftp, rsh commands.  I use client2server for most of my baan coding and ftp for some other files.  I no longer have software that allows me to rcp from PC to the server. Unix group thought this was too much of a security risk. Another method is pc nfs - never used it, but it allows you to remote mount a Unix directory onto the client.  Then all you have to do is save the file on that directory.<br />
<br />
I do not know of a way to automatically get a file from outlook or put a file from outlook to the Unix server.  I suppose there are macros you could write for outlook, but I am not sure.  We do not use outlook.<br />
