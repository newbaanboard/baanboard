<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walter01</div><div class="date">22nd March 2005, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">We had new fields with labels added to tiitm001. The labels could be seen in ttaad4500 en ttadv4520m000. Everything was fine.<br />
At a certain point I kopied everything from the vrc with the tabledefs and labels to a new vrc (closer to std Baan) in the same package combination. After that I removed everything from the source vrc with ttadv6250m000.<br />
Everything works fine except for the labels. The labels did not show up in ttaad4500 and ttadv4520m000. Then I used ttadv1141m000 to edit the labels in the new vrc. They were all there. I checked the source vrc. It was empty. As it should be. I didn't change anything but used save and exit to exit the session. After that the labels did show up in ttadv4520m000 but not in ttaad4500.<br />
Since than I have tried several things to get te labels working from the new vrc but without any avail.<br />
Did I mis something here ? I didn't Convert the tables to RDD since they seem to work fine. I checked the vrc directories and the vrc derivations (is that english?) and the're all as they should be.<br />
Can someone tell me how to get things working ?<br />
<br />
thx,<br />

If it does it could be stopping you from getting the labels from the new vrc.  It seems to me last time I did this I actually had to create rdd on the old vrc to actually clear out the old tables.<br />

<br />
I checked the old vrc and except from the labels that I intentionaly copied there to get the labels working, it is completely empty.<br />
How do I go about creating rdd on just one vrc ? Both vrcs are in the same packagecombination. One derived from the other.<br />
I didn't create rdd yet because we have a replica database running. So it takes some effort/time before I can create rdd. <br />
What you said about creating rdd though, reminds me of when removing a user, you must also create rdd for that used after you removed it from Baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd March 2005, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually I just use the zoom from maintain tables - and do a convert on the package combination I am working in.   Sometimes I do have to run ttadv5210m000 or ttadv5215m000 to get the DD correct.  And we typically only have 1 VRC that we work in per package combination.   As far as I can tell you would need both to do both VRC's.  <br />
