Is this possible how can we know which users are inactive for 5 days . we can probably disable by changing the u file so that the user cannot login anymore because if we change the user details inside Infor LN we need to convert to runtime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What can be a plausible reasoning would be this: users that are logged in but their bshell has no activity for these 5 days... Their (server based) bshell may still running but the user did not logoff before closing the browser (and after that did not go back to the LN UI page).<br />

Check the Session Timeout posts here if that is what you want.</div></div><hr />
