I have some questions about the new style options in Infor 10.5 because we want to switch in the next future from 10.3 to 10.5. with ming le.<br />
<br />
In 10.3. it was possible to change the optical view in 4 styles (metal, blue...) in 10.5. I am missing everything to change this.<br />
There is one style without having the chance to adapt it for the users, is this real?<br />
Also for the whole 10.5. the view is &quot;unsteady&quot;, working for a long time could be a problem to focus.<br />
Also the Shortcuts from 10.3 are changed to worser Bookmarks without having the possibility to create external links.<br />
<br />
If someone have the solution, please write.<br />
<br />
Bye, Harry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rochus</div><div class="date">26th February 2018, 07:51</div></div><div class="posttext">there are some ER for having new &quot;skins&quot; like in webtop. At the moment you have 3 different styles, Normal, high contrast and dark.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harryooe</div><div class="date">1st March 2018, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but what are &quot;ER&quot; ?<br />
<br />
I have tested some weeks ago the normal, high and dark option and also the compressed mode.<br />
It is a shame for Infor to release a version with this poor options to create a comfortable style. They step back when I compare to V10.3.<br />
The workload for the eyes is increasing after working for some hours with 10.5.<br />
Also the not switchable &quot;Show Mouse over in Grid&quot; is awful. The continously activation of lines confuse the users.<br />
In total, the improvements for the programming architecture may be perfect, for the comunication with the user at the end of the line they invested nothing.</div></div><hr />
