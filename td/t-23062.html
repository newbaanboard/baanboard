I am new to BAAN IV and i am in learning stage so i wants<br />
<br />
to know how to copy a session with it's all components as forms,reports,program script/library in the same package VRC  with new names only so that it could not harm the original session in anyway<br />
<br />
and so i can check the processing of the session by changing  some code<br />

I'm not sure about Baan IV, but in BaanV you simply mark the session, hit the 'duplicate' button to duplicate the session. The system will then ask you if you want to copy the Forms as well. In case of report session, the system will offer to copy reports as well. Note: if you choose not to duplicate forms/reports, the old ones will be linked to the new session.<br />
<br />
For the program script: if you want to use the existing script you don't do anything; the script will be linked to the session. If you want to duplicate that one as well, you simply duplicate the script, and in 'sessions' you assign the new script to the session.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />

Umesh i guess you are into the initial stages of implementation. So i would<br />
suggest its a good practice to create a new dev. env. to learn Baan.</div></div><hr />

If you start with developing for my opinion it is very important to understand the VRC structure of Baan.<br />

<br />
thanks for your detailed solution to try BAAN customations but all the terms <br />
you have mentioned are very new to me. and do not have any standard procedure<br />
i to do that step by step, and the current custiomation required by my user is to add<br />
one field from table to present report so i have adopted the simple method to copy the<br />
session with new name so.<br />
<br />
so thanks, and please forward me some notes if you have in this regard<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
