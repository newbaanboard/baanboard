<br />
When creating customisations for customers without development tools, we frequently use procesinfo$ to allow a user to add &quot;additional&quot; selections which we can use in a report script. When working with becs or worktop this is no problem on ERP LN.<br />
<br />
However on webtop this does not seem to work. The value entered in the form is somehow not transported to the report. <br />
<br />
has anybody got any experience and/or ideas on why this is happening and how to solve this?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />
Thieu</div></div><hr />

The solution is : ... Copy a field that is working from the form and change it to procesinfo$. Really no kidding, I took pdno.f, copied it and changed it to procesinfo$ and it worked ....:cool:<br />

Sometimes happens that people never seen this problem, so why you don't share it in the community?<br />
<br />
P.S.: For your collection of &quot;nothing&quot; in various languages, &quot;niente&quot; is for italian.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the update on my dictionary ... ;)!<br />
<br />
You refer to an uncommon problem, which in itself you are correct that the problem related to webtop was strange. The usage of procesinfo$ (and free$) itself is not uncommon I would gues/hope... :confused:<br />
<br />
It has served me well in the last 10 years whenever I was &quot;challenged&quot; to get more out of BIV with or without out development tools....:D...<br />
<br />
I was just a lilltle bit disappointed and the fact that I have just quit smoking problably also did not help ... :o <br />
<br />
Anyways If you (or anyone else)  wants some additonal info on the &quot;creative&quot; usage of procesinfo$, just give ma a sign ...</div></div><hr />
