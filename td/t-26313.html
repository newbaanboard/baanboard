<br />
we have a minimized Baan session running on a handheld device. In this session the user scans barcode and everything runs fine.<br />
As we only have 10 lines and 20 rows, we want to draw the users attention by showing certain lines in reverse mode if something unusual happens. No problem there too, but it would be perfect if we had no session code ( also in reverse mode) in the Form. <br />
Can anyone tell me if it is possible to have a form without the session code displayed in the upper left corner? The form already has no box defined, the user has the setting &quot;session code in title=no&quot;, but this seems to be meant for the GUI. <br />
The handheld is running a telnet client and starts ba6.1 as vt200 terminal.<br />
It's a nice application already and this would only be the chocolate on the cream, but why not ask for everything *g*<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />
<br />

<br />
Why you don't remove the sessionname? AFAIK it's only a special field.<br />

<br />
should it really be that simple?<br />
I don't have access to the server atm, but AFAIR I couldn't place the cursor on the label when editing the form. But I will investigate further and report here in a week or so.<br />
<br />
nice weekend<br />

<br />
I remembered correctly :-)<br />
I don't have access to this field, it is not contained in the menu, but displayed  (by ba6.1 I assume).<br />
I looked up the ba6.1 section of the tt-help, but couldn't find any option to suppress the session code in the upper left corner of the screen.<br />
Setting 'Runtime Box' to 'No' shows the menu without a frame, but sessioncode ist still displayed.<br />
As I already mentioned this is not an urgent matter, but I'd like to know how it could be done.<br />
<br />

<br />
In Maintain users it has a &quot;session code in title&quot; tickbox. I know it says for GUI only, but you never know!<br />

thanks for your suggestion, but of course I tried that before I wrote the first post.<br />

<br />
with the help of a friend I could solve this puzzle (Thanks Gerd!):<br />
<br />
Create a new module, set statusline=No ...... and voila! <br />
Each session in this module has no status line.<br />
