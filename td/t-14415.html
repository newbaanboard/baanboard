<br />
is there a variable that contains the device name that a report is being spooled to?  <br />
<br />
Looking for something similiar to &quot;job.device(14)&quot; that can be accessed from the report script (by a user directly, not through a job) to see where it's going and take actions appropriately.<br />
<br />
The help files in 3.1 don't seem to say anything about &quot;device&quot; other then &quot;job related&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Makes sense, I can't believe I didn't figure that one out.  <br />
<br />
Out of humliliation, I took a quick look to see if I could find that one again and I couldn't.<br />
<br />
One more question for you then - seq.no of the print job - is that in a variable somewhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Just a thought though.  If you can run this as a job manually in debug, while in you program script debugger enter &quot;L&quot;.  This will  show you a listing of all the open program variables with their value.  Maybe something undocumented or a job variable that is external will be available for you to check this.<br />
<br />
Let us know if so.</div></div><hr />

You sent me in the right direction - it's spool.id.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
