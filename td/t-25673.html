Mostly, everything goes right, but it happens that the mail is sent by a wrong user.  Of course, this causes misunderstandings.  <br />
Situation: User X is working in a Baan session that generates a mail without user assistance.  The mail contents and TO-recipients are okay, but the mail is sent from user Y.  (The wrong user Y is always the same, user X differs - user X can also generate correct mails)<br />
<br />
The from recipient goes sometimes wrong, but I have no idea where I have to look for this problem.  In reality, the from address must not be filled, it is taken from the NT-user.   Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Veerle</div></div><hr />
