<br />
Double click on your session and set the start command as first.set and see if that helps.</div></div><hr />

Since you stated that by clicking on the next record button, it shows the record then try simulating the action at the start of the session.<br />
May be something like:<br />
execute( first.set )<br />
or <br />
execute( next.set )</div></div><hr />

I tried with all possible things but not worked. Can anybody test my script at your end and suggest me the correct script.<br />
<br />
This will help me to improve my knowledge.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">4th October 2018, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to make sure: you need to set the start command to first.set for the session that you have a problem with showing records (from your description it is unclear to me which session among the two you have that problem with).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have set the first.set in the session and tried but no result. I think pointer is not set correctly but I don't know why?<br />
I have customized session tisfc0130m100 and calling standard session tisfc0130m000 from this customization session with start.session function as I already given script details beginning.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">5th October 2018, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need to call rebuild.query() in tisfc0130m100, remove it. Also instead of using c.pdno in query.extend.where.in.zoom() try to hardcode some pdno that you know definitely exists in tisfc0130m000 (like query.extend.where.in.zoom(&quot;tisfc010.pdno = &quot; &amp; quoted.string(&quot;0000001&quot;))) and see if it works.</div></div><hr />

Even though hardcoded production order number, not showing record selected order. <br />
If you have system, can you please test at your end for know the exact issue?<br />
If you need any more information, please ask me but we need to resolve the said issue ASAP as it is very urgent for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">5th October 2018, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, i checked it myself. tisfc0130m000 has views, so the start command you need is not first.set but first.view :) Try it on your end.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for prompt response. As you suggested, I have checked with start command first.view but still same issue. I requesting you to please share your code if possible? this will very helpful for me.<br />
Here I am sharing customized session tivir0130m100 details as below which I have created.<br />
Main table : tisfc010<br />
start command : 2 (first.view)<br />
session type : display <br />
Window type : list window<br />
Main session : ticked (yes)<br />
synchronized dialog : tivir0130m100<br />
<br />
Now you correct me where I am wrong?<br />
<br />
awaiting your reply....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">8th October 2018, 09:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a test session (for experiments) and its script has your exact code. Upon start tisfc0130m000 is opened with the correct pdno positioning.<br />
<br />
Are you sure you are not mixing up start command of tisfc0130m000 with the start command of tivir0130m100? Why is the latter first.view too? And why does it have synchronized dialog?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sghatge</div><div class="date">8th October 2018, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi giggty,<br />
<br />
First thing is, tisfc0130m000 is standard session and cannot do any changes for this standard session.<br />
<br />
Secondly, tisfc0130m100 is my own customized session and trying to opening standard session tisfc0130m000 from this customized session as per my code given.<br />
<br />
Please let me know in which session I put the start command first.view and synchronized dialog whether blank or what.<br />
<br />
If possible, please share your customized session values as I already mentioned above. If there is any changes, I will try with your values and then I will check.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">8th October 2018, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Open tisfc0130m000 in ttadv2500m000 and change Start Command to 2.<br />
 <br />
Thing is tisfc0130m000 will now position itself on the first pdno every time it is opened. Which might not be ideal. To do it more properly (if you do not own sources and i presume you don't) one could generate a wrapper for this standard session and adjust it in such a way that the standard command is ignored if it was zoomed from tisfc0130m100. This can be done using RUSH (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=559) for example.<br />
<br />
For starters just try to change start command in ttadv2500m000  and see if it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great news. It is working fine now after changing the start command to 2 for standard session tisfc0130m000.<br />
<br />
Thanks you so much for sort out my problem. <br />
<br />
Once again thank you so much.</div></div><hr />
