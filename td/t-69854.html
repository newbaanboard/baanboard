My tccom999.srch value could be something like &quot;yahoo&quot;.<br />
The overall idea is that we don't really know what the associated value in the <br />
#define will be.  That would end up being defined in a #include &lt;file&gt; at some<br />
point.  So I can't really assume the value will contain &quot;yahoo&quot;, or &quot;google&quot;, etc.<br />
I would then just want to read my table field's value, from tccom999.srch,<br />
and then I was hoping I could use that value, such as &quot;yahoo&quot; to then<br />
be associated with a &quot;#define&quot; token, such as &quot;#define yahoo   &quot;https://www.yahoo.com/&quot;.<br />
<br />
But having trouble figuring out how I can use a table string field to store a value, <br />
and then use that value in 3GL code such that it can refer to a token in a #define statement.<br />
Example:<br />
if I have table field tccom999.srch = &quot;yahoo&quot; <br />
and the following code:<br />
<br />
#define	yahoo	&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/&quot;<br />
#define   google	&quot;https://www.google.com/&quot;<br />
#define   mycompany &quot;https://www.search.local.engine.net/&quot;<br />
#define    bing   &quot;https://www.bing.com/&quot;<br />
<br />
string search.url(80)<br />
<br />
select tccom999.srch<br />
from tccom999<br />
selectdo<br />
	search.url = tccom999.srch<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
| This only sets search.url to &quot;yahoo&quot;.<br />
| An idea on how I could get the search.url to equal &quot;https://www.yahoo.com/&quot; ?<br />
| I had no luck with get.var, no luck with expr.compile<br />
| Of then if later the value of tccom999.srch was changed to &quot;mycompany&quot;,<br />
| then the value of search.url  should change to &quot;https://www.search.local.engine.net/&quot;.<br />
| But I am just having no luck in getting this to happen.<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
string search.url(80)<br />
<br />
select tccom999.srch<br />

<br />
Just concat the the strings in normal way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JustaPackfan</div><div class="date">13th March 2017, 23:30</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks Rahul, I updated my post a bit.<br />
For that subsequent value associated with the #define token/symbol, it would not always be as straightforward as substituting a keywork like &quot;yahoo&quot; or &quot;google&quot;, or &quot;bing&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
So if a developer defined a value to be something like &quot;http://www.baanboard.com/search/site&quot; and then associated that to a token named baan, such as<br />
#define  baan  &quot;http://www.baanboard.com/search/site&quot;<br />
then I'd like to somehow get the value &quot;baan&quot; from tccom999.srch and be able to then have a means to  see that &quot;baan&quot; actually defined that value, &quot;http://www.baanboard.com/search/site&quot;.<br />
But all I try fails, and I only ever end up seeing &quot;baan&quot; as my value.<br />
Such as <br />
string    temp(200)<br />
temp = tccom999.srch    | this just sets temp to &quot;baan&quot;<br />
get.var(pid, tccom999.srch, temp)  | this too sets temp to &quot;baan&quot;<br />
get.var(pid, &quot;tccom999.srch&quot;, temp)  |as does this also&quot;</div></div><hr />
