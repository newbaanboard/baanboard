<br />
we have a requirement where the user wants to have some additional fields in a standard display session (TISFC0501M000). this session refers to main table tisfc001 but the user wants to display field which is located in another table (project description located in table tcmcs052).<br />
<br />
one way is to create a separate display session (which i already know). can anybody guide how this can be accomplished in standard display session.<br />
<br />
if this can be done, it will be of great help as we are not required to development extra display session and we can add fields in other standard Ln sessions. we have following ERPLn environment:<br />
<br />
Application : FP2 with india localization<br />
Tools : FP5<br />

In baan iv I would add a display field for the description and then just look it up in the session script. Of course we use QKEY for this since we do not own source.</div></div><hr />

If the two tables have reference fields then this will sometimes work - no real coding change.  Most times it does not work, but never hurts to try.</div></div><hr />
