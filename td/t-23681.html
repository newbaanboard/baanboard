<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">11th April 2005, 02:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted this in the AFS section, but realised it's not just an AFS issue, but a Tools question;<br />
How do you call ttiex1280s000 from your own custom session?<br />
<br />
The first thing, is you need to create a component list file. This can be done easily enough, by calling the 'create.deliver.file' function in the ttdlldeliver library. Passing a patch code and file name. The patch code, has a list of components (from tables ttiex400/ttiex410) that specify what objects need to be exported. The format of this file, is in the correct format for ttiex1280 (according to bic_info6.2 on ttdlldeliver).<br />
<br />
Ok, so we have the list of components in a file, now how do we activate ttiex1280s000 to process this file (similar to choosing 'Export' from the ttiex4110m000 session).<br />
<br />
Doing a bic_info6.2 on the ttiex1280 object, has a number of variables, that we have tried to set, such as; from.iexpatch, iexpatch, sess.from.file and session.file. The issue, is that this object controls ttiex1280m000 as well as ttiex1280s000. The 'm' session, is the export data dictionary session, which allows you to specify a whole heap of settings (such as; sessions from file and the file name). Thus, the variable, holding the file name that is passed to the 's' session, may not be one of the ones listed.<br />
<br />
The other thing, is that when we activate ttiex1280s000, we get the error message of 'Order line not found'. I think that has something to do with ttiex100/ttiex101, but when we run the session manually (from ttiex4500m000/ttiex4110m000), there is no reading/writing to ttiex100/ttiex101. Thus, there must be a flag that turns off looking at delivery orders as well.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to activate ttiex1280s000 or have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">11th April 2005, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">If you need sources also, you have to set the environment var CUNO_SRC=1. The value is not important, the session only checks for existance of the var. We are using cust. projects for collecting all the stuff we want to dump and then create the file from a customization project. Works fine   ;) . <br />
Another place to find the syntax for the file is ttiexdeliverp. The online help of the session is very helpfull.<br />
<br />
<br />
Example code for the sessioncall:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	extern	domain	ttaad.path	path.components<br />
	extern	domain	ttaad.path	path<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
function export.software(<br />
		domain	ttaad.path	i.path,<br />
		domain	ttaad.path	i.dump.list)<br />
{<br />
	path = i.path<br />
	path.components = i.dump.list<br />
	zoom.to$(&quot;ttiex1280s000&quot;, z.session, &quot;iexpatch&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Just meant to add, that CUNO_SRC seems to be ignored. The component type, in components by patch (ttiex410) seems to control whether source is generated.<br />
<br />
For functions;<br />
Type: Function - will only give the function record (no source)<br />
Type: Function Source - will give both the function record and source<br />
<br />
For scripts/libraries;<br />
Type: Script/Library Object - will only give the compiled object (no source)<br />
Type: Script/Library Source - will give both the compiled object and source</div></div><hr />

Must be bcos code must zoom.from.iexpatch section where actual export must be taking place.</div></div><hr />

Let's say user clicks button, and right away all records between A and D are displayed ordered by field X in descending mode, for instance.</div></div><hr />
