I'm printing from BaaN with a ZPL printer, a Zebra TLP2824-Z.<br />
Since I have to print a barcode in EAN128 code, I read the ZPLII manual and came out with this line:<br />
<br />
^FO40,180^BCR,80,Y,N,Y,D^FD&gt;9(241)AF95537A-04-11801^FS<br />
<br />
Here we have a barcode, with UCC/EAN mode enabled (the &quot;D&quot;), Start Code A, and a text ((241)AF95537A-04-11801).<br />
<br />
The issue is that, when I print this barcode, the one I get is shorter, because it stops right before the first score (I mean &quot;-&quot;).<br />
<br />
It's just the same output as if I had written ^FO40,180^BCR,80,Y,N,Y,D^FD&gt;9(241)AF95537A^FS<br />
<br />
I just can't figure out what I can do in order to print the whole barcode: I tried changing the Start Code, changing the Y,N,Y,D flags with different ones, but nothing worked. I would need something like an escape sequence, in order to let the Zebra print the label without stopping at the first -.<br />
<br />
Does anybody here have any suggestion about that?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I also thought, but it seems that the whole US-ASCII (http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ascii.html) set should be supported. At least, this is what I read here (http://barcode4j.sourceforge.net/2.0/symbol-ean-128.html).<br />
<br />
Here  (http://www.bokai.com/barcodeactivex/allbarcodes.htm)there is also a EAN128 barcode with an - in it, so I can't figure out why I just can't make it.<br />
<br />
The best thing would be - maybe - to find an online tool to have ZPL code of a specific barcode just setting the barcode type and the code itself. But I never found anything like that...</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
as attachment you'll find ZPL II for BC128.<br />
As i see from your ZPL statement :<br />
Barcode128<br />
Rotate 90 degree clockwise<br />
High 80<br />
Print interpretation line<br />
Don't print interpr. line above<br />
UCC check digit = yes<br />
---&gt; Mode D ? (N=no mode selected, U=UCC case mode)<br />
<br />
Special conditions if UCC case mode is selected:<br />
Excess digits (above 19) in ^FD or ^SN will be eliminated ...... !<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Uhm... I think I'm missing something.<br />
I set the &quot;D&quot; mode because I had been trusting Zebra's programming guide, which says:<br />
<br />
m = mode Accepted Values:<br />
N = no selected mode<br />
U = UCC Case Mode<br />
• More than 19 digits in ^FD or ^SN are eliminated.<br />
• Fewer than 19 digits in ^FD or ^SN add zeros to the right<br />
to bring the count to 19. This produces an invalid<br />
interpretation line.<br />
A = Automatic Mode<br />
This analyzes the data sent and automatically<br />
determines the best packing method. The full ASCII<br />
character set can be used in the ^FD statement — the<br />
printer determines when to shift subsets. A string of<br />
four or more numeric digits causes an automatic shift to<br />
Subset C.<br />
D = UCC/EAN Mode (x.11.x and newer firmware)<br />
This allows dealing with UCC/EAN with and without<br />
chained application identifiers. The code starts in the<br />
appropriate subset followed by FNC1 to indicate a<br />
UCC/EAN 128 bar code. The printer automatically<br />
strips out parentheses and spaces for encoding, but<br />
prints them in the human-readable section. The printer<br />
automatically determines if a check digit is required,<br />
calculate it, and print it. Automatically sizes the human<br />
readable.<br />
Default Value: N<br />
<br />
Anyhow if I change it with a &quot;U&quot; what I get is a barcode without parenthesis and withouth scores (&quot;-&quot;). I'd like one having them both! I think it's because with the &quot;U&quot; mode I get a Code128, of which the EAN128 I'm looking for is part.<br />
<br />
Anyway thank for the attachment, it's a useful companion!</div></div><hr />
