I know we could export and import the data, but that will not be an option.  I have seen this mentioned before and was wondering if someone could guide me through this - if it is possible.<br />

<br />
Using ttaad4110m000 create a database definition for the other Oracle instance.<br />
Using ttaad4111m000, assign the special table to the database definition you created.</div></div><hr />

At that point we are going to try to create the dd entries on the Baan side. When everything is complete I will post another response.<br />

<br />
What we did was create a baan table, the DBA then went in and pointed the table using a view to the table in the other instance. A ez-sql query returned data.<br />
<br />
The reason I say semi-successful is because we were not able to do a convert to runtime on another table I was working on.  The convert always returned a message like - &quot;This is a restart&quot; and tried to drop the above table and could not do that.  So there are still some bugs to work out, but it looks like it is feasible.<br />
