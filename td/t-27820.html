I'm trying to create a window with 7 tabs by means of DsCtabFrame. I suspect the object type isn't supported by Baan4c4 because I get the BW error &quot;object  nr_object is unknown type 52&quot;. I couldn't find any help in the board. <br />
Can someone help me?<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

AFAIK DsCtabFrame does not work in Baan IV. I tried it in Baan V and it worked.<br />
<br />
You can imitate it by putting some images (or text with frame) on the top of the window and when they are click you can change the window's content.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

Unfortunately the tab frame was just what I was looking for. I wish I could avoid to draw form tab.<br />
Now I'll try this way.<br />
<br />
Thank you again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">9th August 2006, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way, why don't you use the regular session with two forms attached to it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">I.Benini</div><div class="date">9th August 2006, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be an idea.<br />
The fact is that it is required a &quot;graphic display&quot; of weekly data: for each day some data could be represented by means of rectangles, coloured texts and so on. <br />
Now all the data are drawn on a DsCmwindow: seven lines where labels and texts are written. This solution is good if the amount of data is small.<br />
<br />
If I understand what you mean, I could use a session with 7 forms and in the before.form section I could activate a 3GL to create a mwindow where represent all the other UI objects.<br />
I think it could work.   <br />
Did I understand your advice?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can still draw on the 4GL window/form. All you need is to do is to find the window's ID. Check NPRao's post on this thread (http://baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=26607):<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />
