<br />
I used the  &quot;tdpur.dll4109.approve.purchase.order.with.commit&quot; dll for approving the purchase order in my script.<br />
Now when I run my session with all the conditions then the purchase order get approved but the activity of releasing to warehouse is not performed though this activity is auto.<br />
 If I manually approved the purchase order from the header of purchase order then this activity is functioning properly.<br />
<br />
I could not find the reason for this.<br />
Please help me in this context.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are you calling the DLL?<br />
<br />
Use show.dal.messages(MSG.ALL) right after the call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">3rd July 2014, 20:48</div></div><div class="posttext">you MIGHT have to use a separate DLL to release to warehousing, just a guess. i would look at the wh package for the DLL. the fact that you can check/uncheck the activity to be manual or auto almost tells me that these are separate functions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">3rd July 2014, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe you can try tdpur.dll4108.release.orderline.to.warehousing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">4th July 2014, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Also note, there are a lot of DLL's which require some table read before executing else they will never work.<br />
<br />
This is unfortunately very tough to find if you don't have the sources. In your case, I guess you will need to read whinh200, whinh210 for the Purchase Order and some parameter tables for the release to warehouse activity.<br />
<br />
Also, there are some DLL which are dependent on some other DLL to work. Again, difficult to track.<br />
<br />
This is the reason why you should not use DLL if you dont have source code as he problem is with the implementation of these standard DLL's and yes none of these kind of information is documented in ttstpbaandoc (General Library Documentation).</div></div><hr />
