<br />
I have a table whose index is prodid,orderdate, so when we enter same combination of prodid and orderdate, &quot;record already exists&quot; message is shown.<br />
Is there a way to modify the message like &quot;record already exists, do you  want to modify?&quot; ,<br />
precisely, how can we avoid the message &quot;record already exists&quot;?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

If it is present you can do what every you want - give error message or execute a find.  You will need to figure out which event actually provides the message.  You can probably trap it in main table io before.write event.  I have not really trapped an error like that, but on one multi-occurence session I do this:<br />
<br />
choice.start.set:<br />
after.choice:<br />
	on.main.table(check_found)<br />
	if found then<br />
		execute(find.data)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
For the start set it runs routine check_found - if the view fields(primary index fields) already exist then it does a execute find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your reply and I tried in check.input. It is showing me the message which i needed followed by record already exists (database message). How can I avoid the system shown message ?<br />
<br />
I tried in choice sections, nothing worked. only with check.input atleast I am getting my message. <br />
<br />
Also &quot;Record already exists, Do you want to modify?&quot; If no, choice.again(),<br />
If yes record has to goto the existing combination record ? How this can be done ?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

Single or multi occurence?  Maybe a screen shot would help.  The thing that keeps coming to my mind is the problem with the primary index - and modifying those fields.  Maybe a screen shot of the session and the complete script will help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th April 2006, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I would probably keep it simple - I would use check.input.  So lets say after they enter prod-id - in check.input you would look to see if it exists.  If it does pop up a message and use input.again.   You could check after which ever field you want. I do not see where I actually tried this on this type of session. The problem as I see it is you are trying to take them from insert mode, to find mode, then modify mode.  I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but I do not recall doing this.  I have a multi-occ session with view fields that finds a record, but it does not return the record already exists error.<br />
<br />
Something else you can do is something like this for those case statements:<br />
<br />
	domain	tcmcs.str8	somevar, somesern<br />
	somevar = &quot;00000000&quot;<br />
	somesern =  somevar(1;8-len(str$(tiudi903.sern))) &amp; str$(tiudi903.sern)<br />
<br />
You can play with the lengths to make it meet your needs.  I think your variable is already string and the same above I used an integer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th April 2006, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats the problem as I see it - switching from insert to modify. I am not saying it can't be done, but I have never tried it with just the main session.  I have created input sub-sessions for the users to do things like input a record, delete records, etc - but I do not know of way to do what you are asking.  If you know a baan session that does this then I would see how it works - otherwise you may have to wait for one of the real gurus.</div></div><hr />
