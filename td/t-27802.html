<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 06:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I thought it would be better to start a new thread so here are doubts on using index w.r.t. performance issues,<br />
<br />
Consider following code,<br />
<br />
Code 1:<br />
<br />
Select	tiitm001.*<br />
from	tiitm001 for update<br />
where	tiitm001._index1 inrange {:item.f} and {:item.t}<br />
selectdo<br />
	|update code<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
where item.f is blank and item.t is &quot;ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ&quot;<br />
<br />
Code 2:<br />
<br />
Select	tiitm001.*<br />
from	tiitm001 for update<br />
selectdo<br />
	|update code<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
I would like to know whether usage of first code offers any performance boost since the index is <br />
<br />
mapped for full range or on other hand would it downgrade the performance due to unnecessary <br />
<br />
computation of index values.<br />
<br />
Also consider a case wherein a table(taxyz999) has three fields in index1, a1 , a2 , a3.<br />
<br />
Code 3:<br />
<br />
select	taxyz999.*<br />
from	taxyz999<br />
where	taxyz._index1 inrange {:a1.f , &quot;   &quot;,:a3.f} and {:a1.t , &quot;ZZZ&quot;,:a3.t}<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Code 4:<br />
<br />
select	taxyz999.*<br />
from	taxyz999<br />
where	taxyz._index1 inrange {:a1.f} and {:a1.t}<br />
	and taxyz999.a3 inrange :a3.f and :a3.t<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
I would like to know which of the above two &quot;where&quot; clauses is advisable?<br />
<br />
Kindly guide me on the same.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 06:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - my personal preference is (1).  Not because it might slow down the search because it looks like something I use for reporting.  I also think both generate a full table scan so I think they would be the same.  Hey have you tried writing a simple program with start time, the query and the end time? Might not tell you much, but it is a thought.<br />
<br />
As for the second question I would use (4).  But in cases where the second key (like pcs project on some of our tables) I would use (3) if the from and too range for the second element was always blank.  Something like {:a1.f , &quot;   &quot;,:a3.f} and {:a1.t , &quot;   &quot;,:a3.t} - I have done that.<br />
<br />
Not sure if I answered your question, but it will be interesting to see what others say.  Lets hear from others!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 10:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Code 1 vs. Code 2<br />
<br />
If you have many items and many users on your system I would prefer <br />
a 2.1 variant.<br />
<br />
code 2.1<br />
<br />
select	tiitm001.*<br />
from	tiitm001 <br />
order by tiitm001._index1     | Just for ordering<br />
selectdo<br />
          select	tiitm001.*<br />
          from	tiitm001 for update<br />
          where        tiitm001._index1 = {:tiitm001.item}<br />
          selectdo<br />
  	            |update code<br />
          endselect<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion this code is faster because of smaller transactions and smaller redo logs/rollback segments. Too large transactions with a large, completely locked table can crash your rollback segments or slow down your system dramatically (for my experience...). Especially if the table like tiitm001 becomes updated from many users very often.<br />
<br />
Code 3 vs. Code 4<br />
<br />
I don't think that there is a big difference in the performance. <br />
<br />
Like Mark, I also would look at what I need. And maybe add an additional index with a1, a3, a2 for better performance. But if ever possible with duplicate = no. Index with duplicate can give much trouble if you use it in a form or with ttaad4100/ttaad4500 and try to go back... . On a really large table (40.000.000 records) it can need hours. An index without duplicate allowed needs less than a second.<br />
