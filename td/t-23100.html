<br />
You may have come across examples in this forum where certain DLL's are being called, but these are collections of functions contained in DLL's which the developer him/herself has created for his/her own convenience.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the example in the Programmers' Help (&quot;User interface objects: example&quot;) for more info.<br />

Search this forum and you should find several posts on this topic.<br />
