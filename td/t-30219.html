<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ccattaneo</div><div class="date">19th January 2007, 23:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running 3 servers (Development/Certification/Production) and Dev and Cert use the license on our Prod server. We recently had a hardware failure and our system failed over to our backup Prod server. When we were running on the backup server, we had to run Configure Application on both our Dev and Cert servers to remove the Illegal Object messages from all sessions.<br />
<br />
We have since falied back to our primary server. I again ran Configure on both our Dev and Cert servers. These systems are running but we discovered that we now have to run Patch Objects after Error Solving every time we recompile a script. If we don't, we get the Illegal Object message for the session which uses that script. Previously, we had to do this on our Prod server after a recompile but not on Dev or Cert.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know why this is now happening and what we can do to stop it? It's a pain to always have to patch before we can run a session after compiling.<br />
<br />
NOTE: We're running the MK application and not Baan. However, MK is very similar to Baan IV so I think our tools are the same as those running Baan.<br />

Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would suggest to contact your Support Centre rather than playing with business continuity.<br />
<br />
I am hearing first time about MK application. Anyway, If your MK is very similar to BaaN, have you tried putting new IP address of licence damon server into licence6.1 file of Cert/Dev? Try it and after that run ttiex3225m000 (Configure Application).<br />
<br />

Thanks for the reply. I did some more research and I was mistaken in my first post - we only get the illegal objects message on our Dev server. Our Cert server is working as it used to.<br />
<br />
I had actually changed the values in our licence6.0 file when we were on the failover server. We have DNS names rather than IP addresses and this file contained the names of our primary and our backup server. The primary was first and backup was second. I had changed the file to put our backup first and primary second. <br />
<br />
I had thought that maybe this was the problem so I restored the original file and re-ran Configure Application. Unfortunately it didn't change anything.<br />
<br />
I will do what you suggest and log a ticket with the Support Center.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.</div></div><hr />

They said that this happens sometimes when the license daemon is stopped. They suggested running Validate Tools Set and then stopping/starting the application. The Validate session must be run as root and our unix admin was unable to get it to run. He just got a blank screen. So we then ran rc.stop/rc.start and this corrected the problem.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this will help anybody but I wanted to post the solution in case someone ever ran into a similar issue.</div></div><hr />
