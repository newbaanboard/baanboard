I have to put a report together with about 40 fields in one line. Is there a way to fit many fields in the report layout. I wouldn't like to do a seq.open, seq.puts...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

There is a limit to number of fields in a report (If I remember, 255). <br />
However, there is a limit of 255 characters in a line, so it's highly improbable that you can do this, if the average length of the fields are more than 6.375 chars (without separation characters).<br />
If you use the report to produce an ascii file, maybe it's better to use the seq.X instructions instead...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd June 2010, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - I have done it two ways.  One report has one input field of like 200 characters. The report field is buff.  In the session script I just did a select and then build the buff field. Using like buff = buff &amp; sprintf(&quot; |%s&quot;, some.field).  Something like that.  <br />
<br />
The second way is in the report script.  Basically the same thing except I was printing like the newest records(like last 5 PO's).  So I knew the string would only be 30/40 characters long.  Other than that it was a normal report.</div></div><hr />
