Is anyone storing something like PDF attachments in oracle for Baan 4c4? What version of Oracle? I know we could like to a shared drive to pull up files, but it was requested I ask this question.  When I get a chance I will try to find out more information.</div></div><hr />

Store the PDF file as a baan text, obviously do not use the standard baan text editor but you have to develop a DLL to do this. <br />
Basically the DLL must contains:<br />
- A function to 'pack' the pdf file as a text.<br />
- A function to 'unpack' the text in a temporary file with extension .pdf and a call to winapi to display it.<br />
<br />
Years ago, I've written an application to store and display word files with this method, so the same method can work with pdf files.<br />
...Sorry, I haven't anymore the DLL :(</div></div><hr />
