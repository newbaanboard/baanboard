<br />
I am generating barcode sticker through BaaN and I have gone through all document and all previous positing and I am able to print barcode successfully. Even I have gone through BaaN document QG 1310 guide.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But I am able to reduce the barcode size upto 58 mm not less then this, but I have to reduce it upto 55 mm ( 6.6 mil) size. I am using 33 character string. I am using font spacing and font size.<br />
<br />
Any one can reduce the size ( length ) of the barcode . Is there any command or any syntax. How to paly with size of barcode<br />
<br />
I am giving my code below :<br />
<br />
barcode = (chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp; &quot;*#A&quot; &amp; (ticus992.item &amp; str$(ticus992.ldno)&amp;str$(ticus992.pdno) &amp;  ticus992.seqn))<br />
<br />
ticus992.item  = 16 chr<br />
ticus992.ldno  =   6 chr<br />
ticus992.pdno =   6 chr<br />
ticus992.seqn =   5 chr<br />
<br />
With Best Regards<br />

Experiment by taking and placing each item on a seperate line and changing the sizes to see if you can then print smaller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">24th January 2005, 23:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this using the BW Print method then?  And, did you play with the ratio ability there?  You may have already done this as you indicate you did shrink it some, not sure how far this will let you go... <br />
<br />
BW Print:  Print the document and choose Print Preview.  If / When the barcode comes up in Print Preview, Right Click on the barcode, you should see an option for Barcode Ratio.  You can play with that to make it skinnier.  Make sure it still scans ok.<br />
<br />
If that's the trick, you have to do that on every PC that will be printing it (just once).</div></div><hr />

Thanks to lbencic &amp; toolswizard<br />
<br />
I can reduced the barcode size but that will not scanable. Lastly I made it 57mm of the barcode length. Now I am planning to change my sticker size.<br />
<br />
thanks to all<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">25th January 2005, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, that's a plan.  Also, I have found that other fonts scan better than 3 of 9, if that is what you are using.  Code 128 is clearer, we found that it copies better than 3 of 9, so maybe it would scale better for you.  Not sure which method you  ended up with to get it on there, but where code 3 of 9 = 9 in the Barcode Type field, use 10 for Code 128.</div></div><hr />
