<br />
Created a VB utility that simply reads the parameters (to, from, subject etc..) from a text file and sends the email through Outlook.<br />
The only problem is, When the application is sending this email, Windows/Outlook comes up with a popup window with a mesg that says something like &quot;An unauthorized email is being sent out, Could be a virus. Would you like to continue Y/N&quot; ?<br />
If I click on &quot;Yes&quot;.. the email is sent successfully... otherwise not.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to block this or get that &quot;yes&quot; 'clicked' in the background ? :)<br />
<br />
This never happened on Windows 2k. Happens only on XP.<br />
If i send that email from my server, the message does not popup, since the server is on Win2k. But If i send the email from my PC ( on XP), the message pops up.<br />
<br />
All suggestions are welcome. Thnks<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">12th May 2004, 02:04</div></div><div class="posttext">There are various ways to do this:<br />
<br />
Option 1: As you suggest, email a file on the client PC using a third party program (e.g. mailx).  You can use various programs to do this. I have seen third party applications started in a DOS/cmd shell window, but this creates a temporary window that pops up on the users screen and looks unprofessional.  <br />
<br />
Option 2: Using Outlook via COM automation.  Using standard COM components will give you the warning message you report, which was part of Microsoft 98 Outlook Security patch (thanks to the Mellisa virus).  To get around this a seperate COM components has been developed called Outlook Redemption, see here http://www.dimastr.com/redemption/ . We use this via automation with vb scripting (.vbs) and windows scripting host (wscript.exe). The advantage is that all emails sent are added to the users sent items folder, but the downside is that if any outlook errors occur sending the mail (e.g. mailbox is full/over size limit) then a vbs script error will have to be handled gracefully.<br />
<br />
Option 3: Send the mail on the server.  One way to do this is to have a report run to the ASCIF device using the brp.*() functions, and then start off an server side application (with run.prog() ) to process the report and send any emails.  I prefer using perl with MIME::Lite to do this, mainly because it is platform independent and freely available, but any scripting language should do.  Advantage: more likely to work, disadvantage: difficult to handle errors in the processing, e.g. bad email addresses.<br />

Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
 Thanks for your suggestion. Option 2 sounds great. <br />
<br />
I'll read up more on that and try to use that. The COM component you are using, is that a generic one that can be directly downloaded &amp; used or would that be requirement specific ? <br />
( The utility we have is in VB and developed inhouse.. is there some such COM component that can be re-used) ?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.<br />

Could you please post your VB Script and tell me the path where it is to be copied.<br />
