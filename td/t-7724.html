session in the same server   in development VRC can be put in to debugger.  I cannot get the same session in debugger in PROD VRC,If  I compile the script in the prod vrc. but  I can import the   debugger version of the compiled  script from  the dev to Prod.  <br />
Now it works in debugger.<br />
Dev is not derived from Prod .<br />
We are in Baan 5.0c  ... any  suggestions how to  make debugger to  work in Prod</div></div><hr />

When you compile in debug, do you see a change in object date/timestamp? Do you see the -l option used in the compiler? What does &quot;bic_info -h&quot; tell you about the object? Is the 2=DEBUG flag present next to the 8=DLL flag? When starting the debugger, do you see a black screen alone, without source?<br />
<br />
What if you do a bic_explode (or explode6.2 on Unix) on the object? Where is it located? And the program script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">20th November 2002, 11:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Also remember that your user is linked to a package VRC, if the script you are compiling with debug is in a higher/lower VRC (depends how you look at the derivation structure) you'll never be able to run that object at all as Baan will pick up the object linked to your VRC not the one in the lower/higher VRC.<br />

<br />
Also, I know that it is very difficult to debug DAL scripts in 5c.  If any other session uses that script and someone has the session active then the debug will not come up, this also is true if GTM is active for the table whose DAL you are trying to debug.  You are probably the only one working in your development VRC and that is why you have no problem with the debug there.</div></div><hr />

&gt;<br />
if you are on a unix system, you can at least try to rename (mv, not copy) the object file; the file name and directory can be figured out by explode6.1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please refer to the other posting with a utility which can help you to verify if any user has that session active -<br />
<br />
CODE: Show which session a user is running (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1936) <br />
<br />
This works in Unix OS only. Please put your baan/os/db info in your profile.<br />
<br />
Also check what is your current Package-VRC, that will determine the VRC tree you are working with.</div></div><hr />
