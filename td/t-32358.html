<br />
I have a text field in BaaN which needs to be edited with some richer formatting than the plain ascii texts, like color, bold, underline, etc. <br />
<br />
I switched to a text-group with Word as editor. That is fine, the text is stored in rtf-format (rtf-data stored in table tttxt015 ), and when displaying this text field in a Baan form, Word is started with the correctly formatted text.<br />
<br />
However, I need to also PRINT this text field on a report. This does not seem to work, the text is printed in ASCII. Since the report I try to print it on, is printed always in html-format, I even tried to just get the text fields as strings via txt.to.buf in my html conversion program (3GL), but then I only get the text strings from tttxt015, which mean nothing to html, and therefor are not converted/interpreted as such.<br />
<br />
Anyone an idea how I can still print formatted text field to a (html-) report??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

I have the same problem. Is there any solution or work-around available to print the formatted text that is stored in tttxt015 ? <br />
<br />
An output as XML would be sufficient.<br />
