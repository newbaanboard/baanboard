I have tried different page sizes on the report, and inserting 'skip(...)' commands in the report script, but still have not been able to resolve the problem.  This issue only occurs when printing Barcodes as per document QG1310.  Printing normal reports to bwprint works fine.  Any assistance will be much appriciated.<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th June 2006, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We do not use this method, but just from glancing at the report it looks like the barcode itself is throwing the line count off.  Have you tried changing the barcode size?  I am not even sure if this is possible, but was wondering if you could make it larger and maybe keep the line count consistent.  Just a thought.  It also seems to me that for our printers I had to &quot;check&quot; the for feed option on the printer itself. I no longer remember why I did this, but do know it had to do with page creep like you show for some reports. I do not know if it was for our version of barcode printing or not - too many years ago.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the thoughts.  The problem that I am seeing in the page creep is actually displayed when using the preview option with BWPRINT.  I don't beleive at that point it knows anything about the printer it is going to be sent to? You can change the height of the barcode by using a different control character (in document QG1310), I did not really want to make this bigger but I will try it out. <br />

It says a formfeed is sent at the end of each page.  I am not sure how this would effect the preview option.</div></div><hr />

So if you choose a barcode that's 3 lines high you have to make your detaillayout at least 3 lines so it can be printed.</div></div><hr />

before.program:<br />
   lattr.barcodelines = 3<br />

(for example)<br />

good luck</div></div><hr />

thanks for tip, but this line of code does not appear to want to compile - is the syntax correct - it says that lattr.barcodelines has not been defined?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy Purdey</div><div class="date">19th June 2006, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem was caused by spaces to the right of the text in the in the data string.  When I rith shifted all of the fields the problem went away.  <br />

Thanks for all the comments.<br />

I just checked our barcode fields and we use shift left for everything not left justified.  Just curious.</div></div><hr />
