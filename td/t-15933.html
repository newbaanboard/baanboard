Form 1 has main table &quot;table.1&quot; and i want to change the main table to &quot;table.2&quot; when user changes to form 2.<br />
Or any other solutions for that?</div></div><hr />

I presume the situation in which u need this is for tables having <br />
parent child relationships ( like sales order  &amp; lines). In such <br />
case u can have an interactive sessions with different main tables.<br />
<br />
If main table  io on child table are ok, u should be able to <br />
accomplish the objective with separate forms too.</div></div><hr />

I had a similar requirement in which I wanted to base a display session on 2 similar tables, if the record is not found in the 1st table, then the session should search in the second table.  There were some solutions provided for this, but when i tried them, they were making the session very slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 08:07</div></div><div class="posttext">There were no parent child relation ship among the tables. Table was replica of the other in ur case. So in that case it can not work.<br />
<br />
Here also no magic is going to work . User will simply fetch the details from parent session in display the same in 2nd form for the first rec of the multi-occ form (sort of ttadv4100m000) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sachin03</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">But in ttadv4100m000, both the forms have the same main table.  as u have rightly said, in baan a session can have only 1 main table.  so how is it possible that the first form is based one table and the second on another table?  what happens when the user navigates between the records using next previous, or next set, previous set, how is the system going to fetch records from 2 tables?</div></div><hr />
