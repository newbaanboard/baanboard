But they still have ttaad4500/ttaad4100 (General Table Maintenance) still work with the ASCII interface. Anyone know how to create sessions that work similarly?</div></div><hr />

I don't think there is a way to create these sessions this way anymore.  By not supporting both versions of the interface, the BW interface was free to do anything they could program in there.  It no longer uses the &quot;choice&quot; field, so there would be no way to communicate all those options.<br />
<br />
You're right, the General Table Maintenance, and a few other sessions, still have the ascii interface as a throwback, including the Maintain Forms session (?!?).   I believe this is because GTM NEVER ran on standard 3GL code, it just looks like that ASCII Interface.  Even in Baan IV GUI, the GTM is in ASCII still.</div></div><hr />
