<br />
i've a table tccom125 with iban and bano (bank account), with the session tfcmg0524m000 i generate an xml that sends data to the bank, with certains BP i have only the bank account and not the IBAN (for example the country Oman &quot;OM&quot;), the question is: how can i replace iban with bano when country does not support iban?<br />
I already found a dll that split countries with iban and no iban ones (tccomdll002), but i can't found HOW LN send data to the XML, i only have seen the DLL (tfcmgdll1265) that sets some attributes with xmlSetAttribute, but i can't find WHERE the values are taken from table and put into the XML file.<br />
Is it possibile? Or i have to create a new tag xml in tfcmg0524m000 and assign the value to that new tag?<br />
<br />
I hope for an answer and know if it is possible,<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
first of all I am no expert in this part at all. What I see is that the elements of the  XML-file are defined in the table tfcmg026. If the Element is &quot;010301000000&quot; then the Bank number (bano) is used. If the Element is &quot;010302000000&quot;  then IBAN is used!<br />
<br />
What you could try is to copy a working layout with IBAN in tfcmg0524m000 and search for and change the element in the new layout in tfcmg026. And use the new Layout for your Oman-Customers etc. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
An export would do this with a blink with standard sessions (tfcmg0624m000,..) Somebody like me would have to use ttaad4100 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

i found that in the session tfcmg0540m000, if i open the details of a record, there are some checks to use bank account or IBAN. However, in the correct method of payment (SSF) for foreign customers, there are already selected the correct entries but the customer say to me that is still incorrect. The BP that i'm testing is correct, because it has a bank account but no IBAN...<br />
I think this session should work..<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
