We have imported certain sessions from Baan IV to ERPLn. In ERPLn, while trying to open the associated form, it opens as a static form in ERPLn. I have also tried to convert this session and form from static to dynamic but ERPLn says 'Form not found' whereas the form is present.<br />

LN uses always language code 2 for dynamic forms as the form is language independet but in Baan IV it was language dependent.</div></div><hr />

English Convert to integrated session blocked checked out <br />
TOOLS VERSION(S): 7.6_a5 <br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: &quot;Integrate Dynamic Session and Form&quot; (ttadv2910m000) <br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
During conversion of a static session with the &quot;Integrate Dynamic Session and Form&quot; (ttadv2910m000) session, the static session was updated correctly, but its form was not (i.e. the &quot;Integrated&quot; check box of the form remained unchecked). This resulted in an inconsistent session form relationship and made it impossible for the user to checkout the session (the message &quot;Form not found&quot; appeared). <br />
<br />
This problem only occurred if the session was present in the current package VRC but the form was not. <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
During conversion an additional check is done to verify that the form is also present in the current package VRC. The conversion only proceeds if both session and form are present in the current package VRC. Otherwise, the conversion will skip the session and write an explanatory message in the session's log file.</div></div><hr />
