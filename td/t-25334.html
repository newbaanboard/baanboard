I reduced the length of all the layouts to 188, but when I run the report it gives me the message &quot;Report does not fit on paper&quot;.  It will let me print the report on letter landscape and everything fits but it gives me two or three pop-up messages first.  Is there something I'm missing?</div></div><hr />

You should also change the field report width on mask 2 of maintain reports (and compile again).</div></div><hr />
