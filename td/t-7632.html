<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staugner</div><div class="date">13th November 2002, 19:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to show item issues by date (1999 issues, 2000, issues, etc.) and don't know how to code it.  The problem is that when it searches for the 1999 issues, if it does not find the item code it tosses out that record and does not look in 2000, 2001, etc.<br />
<br />
If I use an 'or' statement, it will only give me the issues for the 1st year it finds, and not for all of the years.<br />
<br />
I am a beginning programmer and would appreciate any help.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have tried:  <br />
<br />
where ttayear.item = tdinv001.item<br />
and     ttbyear.item = tdinv001.item<br />
and     ttcyear.item = tdinv001.item<br />
and     ttdyear.item = dtinv001.item<br />
and     ttayear.year = 2002<br />
and     ttbyear.year = 2001<br />
and     ttcyear.year = 2000<br />
and     ttdyear.year = 1999</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure what tables the ttayear, ttbyear etc are. Are they aliases for the same table?  If so you could try without the multiple tables  something like the following...<br />
<br />
where ttayear.item = tdinv001.item<br />
  and (ttayear.year = 2002 or ttayear.year = 2001 or<br />
         ttayear.year = 2000 or ttayear.year = 1999)<br />
[could also use ttayear.year in (2002, 2001, 200, 1999) ]<br />
<br />
If the are different tables you may be better off with separate selets for each one<br />
<br />
Hope this helps <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staugner</div><div class="date">13th November 2002, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks - the aliases are all for the same table (tdinv750).  I will try your solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you trying to display the item issue per period as in to the screen? Why not set up a display session of type 1? Single Occurence with main-table. Or is the data intended for print output? Why alias the table four times? Are you trying to display four years on one form? <br />
By the way hardcoding variables is not good practice ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staugner</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I'm trying to display issues by item for four different years on the same form, thus the four aliases.  Is this possible?  It is to be a printed report...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Can I create the report and send you the dumps, that'll start you off and then you can finish it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staugner</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">That could be a tremendous help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I'll have it ready in half an hour!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Attached please find the dump archive I have created, use winzip (or similar) to extract ftp or file copy to your baan system. In baan go to tools/software distribution/internal import/export/import data dictionary supply the path to the dumps files, overwrite yes/no depending on the session (I've called it tdinvc470m000 - does it exist already? I hope not). At the option &quot;write software to other package VRC&quot; choose your customization VRC.<br />
<br />
Click continue - once it's imported you may need to go to &quot;maintain sessions&quot; and  change the session status from developing to finished, press save and then change it back to developing again and press save again. (sometimes this is necessary to register the object and session)<br />

Good Luck,<br />

<br />
Just a thought. If you'd like to show such report on your sales goods (ie you'd like summary of sales qty for year 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002) it can be done easily with Sales Statistics (SST) module. It can produce this timewise column arrangement with no problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staugner</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Paul, but we haven't activated the Sales Statistics module at this time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 02:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure thing, Sharon :) . It's just a thought :) . By the way, should you decide to implement it in the future, pls be informed that this SST module is a reporting module only. It doesn't have any impact on any other business process. Should the time come and you need assistance, I and many other BB members will surely be happy to help :) . Have a nice day!<br />
