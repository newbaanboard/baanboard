<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I am porting a session from 4c4 to 5c.  The form contains a table field that has an enumerated domain.  When entering new records, I see the full list of enumerations on the first record I enter.  If, however, I tab through the fields to start entering a second new record, when I get to this field, the pull-down list is empty.  If I tab through the field, the first enumerated value is automatically entered and then I can go back to the field and see the entire enumeration list.  This happens on my converted form as well as one generated via Generate Sessions.  Both are type 2 forms without any synchronization.  I have tried rearranging the field order -- that doesn't help.<br />
<br />
I know I could probably get past it by making some synchronized sessions for entry.  However, I really would like to know why this is happening (and how to fix it).<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">4th February 2005, 05:25</div></div><div class="posttext">What do u mean by porting? Ru creating the session afresh or using a tool??<br />
<br />
Did u check whether in the form level there are any conditions that are present for this enumerated form field??<br />
<br />
Is there any set.enum.values function being used in the program script??<br />
<br />
