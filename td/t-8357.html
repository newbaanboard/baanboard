This is a new table created to track actual ship dates per sales order line. I need the seqn to record partial shipments per order line - similar to multi receipts on a purchase order line. The orno, pono, seqn is the primary/only index on this table. As part of the insert there is some data validation against tdsls041 for orno, pono, item must exist and dqua cannot exceed oqua. I was able to insert multi records but then data validation didn't work, knowing my users I need to make this idiot proof so the data feed going to corporate HQ contains valid data. How would you tackle this? DD seems to be fine, I have deleted and re-created table just in case it wasn't quite right.</div></div><hr />

 I decided to start over from scratch. In debug everything looks ok, has the correct values and as soon as I try to 'save' the message 'record already exists' is displayed. Something is very weird so I thought best thing to delete session etc and try again. I'll let you know how it goes....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 00:31</div></div><div class="posttext">You can check in Display Table Maintenance (ttaad4500) to see what the Runtime thinks the index is.  It sure shounds like the runtime thinks it's Orno/Pono.<br />
<br />
In Display Table Maintenance, when you first pull up the table, the primary index will be underlined.   Enter '*' at the choice field to see the index order.  <br />
<br />
Then, hit the space bar at the choice field to get a drop menu down listing of options.  Go to the 'Browse' menu and choose 'Change Key'.  How many keys are there?  As you choose them, you will see the new keys underlined in the records...anything unexpected there?  Is sequence # part of all of the indexes as seen at Runtime?<br />
<br />
If still in doubt, try inserting a record through General Table Maintenance (ttaad4100).  If it's an index error you will get it here too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have found that it is a bad idea to perform additional select statements on your main table without using aliases.  My guess would be that the select in the section field.tccom807.dqua is what is getting you.  <br />
<br />
If you were to change that select so that you use a table alias, I think things migth improve.  Try:<br />
<br />
select com807.dqua:hold.dqua<br />
from tccom807 com807<br />
where com807._index1 = {:tdsls041.orno, :tdsls041.pono}<br />
order by com807._index1<br />
selectdo<br />
      dqua = dqua + hold.dqua<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
In any event, in order to find out where things are going wrong, have you tried watching the variable  tccom807.seqn in the debugger?  Use the command &quot;T tccom807.seqn&quot; and the debugger will tell you when the value changes.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

The seqn is incrementing the way it should, no problem there. <br />
I tried your suggestion regarding usage of an alias for checking summing up the previous dqua already recorded in the main table, unfortunately this didn't resolve the 'record already exists' error message.<br />
<br />
Anything else I might try?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">13th January 2003, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Just noticed that you are using the phrase 'record already exists' and while that sounds similar to 'duplicate record' error (I think) 100, it would appear to not be the same thing.  If you are getting a ttstp message and not the ugly white error message box, then I would think it is not an index thing.  <br />

Do you have a commit.transaction() command or a db.update/db.insert commands in your code?  I am assuming that your session is of Type 1/2/3 and in such a session, the above commands would confuse BAAN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th January 2003, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure without debugging.  Looks like the sequence number will update, but only if you change the position.  Are you doing that?<br />
<br />
Debugging should resolve - try setting a dummy message, I think the main table io / before write section would be good:<br />
<br />
<br />
main.table.io: <br />
before.write:<br />
      message(&quot;This is the after write section&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
But a break point on the message, and when it stops, check all the values.  Trace the value of your seqn.  I think you saw already that it is updating ok initially, but maybe it gets overwritten.<br />
<br />
Also, similar to this, you can set tracing options on your session to see what values it is trying to insert into the table.  This thread has a discussion and attached instructions on session tracing:<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7456&amp;highlight=TRACE<br />
<br />
Edit:  I just saw Mark's post - his update of the sequence number is a more standard approach, and should work.</div></div><hr />

Yes the session is type 1/2/3 and No the only code written is the field section posted - plus declarations - no other code whatsoever has been written.<br />

Hi Mark,<br />
I'm not too familiar with main.table.io, am I understanding this correctly?....move the seqn 'stuff' from the when.field.changes of com807.pono to the new main.table.io section, before.write. Is there anything else that would have to change?<br />
<br />
Thanks lbencic, will work thru suggests, never used session trace before, could be interesting....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th January 2003, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">At this point I think if you create the main.table.io sections and watch what happens there you may see where the tccom807.seqn gets reset.  I am hoping that by moving the section I mentioned then writing the record would start working.  Once the records are going into the table then we can make sure they get the correct values.  So if this fixes adding the record then the tccom807.dqua may also need to be moved. <br />

Sometimes when you generate sessions bugs like this happen,as apposed to creating the session/forms etc on your own.<br />

I would suggest (only if you originally generated this session and its forms etc...) that you delete the session and create a new one and attach the script/forms to it.</div></div><hr />

It just dawned on me as I was writing this message.  In your first posted code you used the tccom807.pono field to determine your next seqn field - but you used the when.field.changes event. This event will not trigger if the pono stays the same.  In my example I used before.input of tccom807.seqn and you could probably use the on.input of tccom807.pono.  Just remember that when the user inserts a record you always want this code to execute, otherwise the seqn will not get changed.<br />

I was trying to use combo orno + pono to determine if there was already a 'partial' shipment and if so then the seqn would have to be incremented.  I think it's better if the seqn is display on the form and increment the value as needed behind the scenes - KISS principle is required here! Your idea of using on.input of tccom807.pono should do the trick for this. Don't know why I didn't think of using sum() for dqua - must have been a blonde moment. (yes, I am a blonde, naturally).</div></div><hr />

<br />
To make it readable, I had to upload it to my UNIX server in binary mode and drop it back down in ASCII mode.<br />

Really glad you got it to work!<br />

I printed the script to ASCIF without a file extension, and then found out that I couldn't attach it without an extension. Thought I'd be real smart and just renamed the file with .txt - apparently not a good move. I'll do this again and post new version of script. Thanks for letting me know!</div></div><hr />
