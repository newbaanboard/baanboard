<br />
What is happening is that when an operation is completed in the session &quot;Report Operations Completed [tisfc0102m000]&quot;, the Start Date Remainder is made equal to the Earliest Finish Date [tisfc010.fidt]. The User expects the Start Date to remain undisturbed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th July 2008, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure - we investigated this about two years ago.  I know the conculsion we came to was - feature.  We did not even question Baan about it, but we did try to figure out when it changed and how it determined the change. Eventually came to the conclusion we did not want to use the field anyway. I could have swore I kept the documentation, but I can not find it(trying some different searches).<br />
<br />
FYI:<br />
We also just discovered that the planning engines apply learning curve to setup and runtime - at least on our system.  Then when you release it to the shop floor in only applies it to run time.  Makes a big difference when you have some large setup times.</div></div><hr />

I did also see where I completed a couple of operations and the production date also changed to the earliest finish date.  Sorry I was not any help.</div></div><hr />

You did help. I can now hopefully convince the user to live with it. We had also looked at this in 2005 and decided not to 'fix' it since we were not driving any metrics based on the START Date (we do drive the Work Center Completion Performance metric based on the FINISH Date, though [comparing planned finish with actual finish]) .<br />
<br />
I found out the hard way that it is so tightly bound to the operation completion process that making a fix breaks it down by causing the logic to make the FINISH Date equal to the START Date! Luckily, I did not spend too much time on the modifications.</div></div><hr />
