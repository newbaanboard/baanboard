    When I try to delete a record using the Main session in BaaN IVc4, It gives a message &quot;Update Cancelled&quot;, and also it's not deleting the record. What's the problem? Can you please help?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
the most possible reason could be the lock on that particular record i.e any other user might be accessing that record when u tried to delete it.<br />
<br />
If it was happening for all the records, then there could be a possible complete table lock on it.</div></div><hr />

Some sessions in Baan will not allow you delete the records until you have cleared all the child or reference records first.  And some session will not let you delete something that had any work done on it.  Of course the messages are usually a little more clear, but I know there are a couple cases where it comes back with Update cancelled.</div></div><hr />

    Thank you very much for the help. I'll try using both the answers to resolve the issue. Once it's resolved, I'll update what's the problem.<br />

Thanks Once again.</div></div><hr />

   Thank you very much for all your help. The session is custom new session, and there was a broken link between the parent, children and grand children. The children was deleted, but the grand children was not deleted. The user tries to delete the parent. So, it gives the error message. So, I removed the grand children in GTM, then it allowed me to delete the parent without any problem.<br />
Best Regards<br />
