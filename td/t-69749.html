<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pralash</div><div class="date">10th February 2017, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
 <br />
I'm fresher to ERP Ln... I am create a Report and also execute it successfully.<br />
But i can't get the clear idea of the following codes in the programming script. <br />
 <br />
|****************************** declaration section ***************************<br />
declaration:<br />
 <br />
  table   ttfedu710 | testing table 3 employee<br />
 <br />
   extern  domain  tfedu.inte       emid.f<br />
   extern  domain  tfedu.inte       emid.t <br />
 |****************************** field section *********************************<br />
field.emid.f:<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
   emid.t = emid.f<br />
 <br />
functions:<br />
 <br />
function read.main.table()<br />
{<br />
    select tfedu710.*<br />
    from tfedu710<br />
    where   tfedu710._index1 inrange {:emid.f}<br />
                                    and {:emid.t} <br />
    order by tfedu710._index1<br />
   selectdo<br />
       rprt_send()<br />
   endselect<br />
} <br />
While i execute the session, i'm getting two text box for getting initial and last employee id....<br />
But in the previous script, the value of emid.f is assigned to emid.t....<br />
So how can i get the report from 1 to 5 (if i give 1 and 5 are the first and last value)...<br />
 Anybody please guide me....<br />
 <br />
Thanks<br />

when.field.changes:<br />
emid.t = emid.f<br />
<br />
<br />
The code excutes only why the employee id from changes  .<br />
<br />
so in you case when you enter 1  for employee id from ..  its changed (from blank / 0 to 1 ) hence the above code gets excuted and  employee id to is also assigned 1 .<br />
<br />
Now you can move you cursor to employee to and enter 5 , since there no code for employee to .   .. current values of  emid.t and emid.t will be passed to the query when you hit the print button</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can we assume that emit.f as a first record and emit.t as a last record which one is provided by the user....<br />
<br />
suppose if we have totally 10 employees, now i want to list the employees from 4th to 8th.  Then We give the values 4 and 8 for the first and second text box...<br />
<br />
But in our script, we have assign emid.t = emid.f<br />
Since both are having same value, So how can we get the result from 4th to 8th employee details in the report?<br />
<br />

<br />
The when.field.changes will trigger only once to make the two field on form same. User can simply change .t field and print the report. It wont affect the further processing logic. <br />
<br />
The when.field.changes is from the standard template of a print session. You can choose to exclude it as well. It is just for avoiding large data selection in case if the .t field is kept zzzzz accidentally by user. <br />
<br />
e.g. When the data is huge (records in millions) and user want to print only 10 records, he will put 1 in the from field and if he leaves to field as blank, it will select all the rows if your code doesn't have when.field.changes section. <br />
<br />
If the code has it, the to field will be defaulted to &quot;1&quot; as well. User can simply change it to &quot;10&quot; and print the report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand the when.field.changes in the report...<br />
I also customize the report by giving the employee id with some conditions that is i have filter the employees in a particular city level....<br />
