<br />
I am developing some new sessions on our test server. The past few weeks I have put that project on hold due to higher priorities. However, now when looking back into it, I found I encounter the following problem: <br />
<br />
For two (new) sessions, when I make changes to the program script and compile, the changes won't have effect, i.o. when running the session the changes are not included. Also when compiling in debug-mode and running the session, the session is not ran in debug-mode. This happens only for two sessions in the same module, whereas I created about another 6-7 sessions at the same time, partially in the exact same module, yet those are alright. <br />
<br />
Can anyone help me out please with this problem? What to check? How to track the problem? I will be grateful!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, and a happy, healthy and prosperous new year to all my dear co-BaanBoard-ers!!<br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">31st December 2003, 14:08</div></div><div class="posttext">This is due to shared memory and file caching on M$WinDos - even though on disk there is a newer object, you are presented the object from shared memory. First try log off logon again. If that does not do the trick, restart shared memory, if that won't help, reboot server.<br />
<br />
Shared memory on Unix reloads newer objects automatically after they have been written to disk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all my best wishes for a very healthy, happy  and profound year!!<br />
<br />
Indeed, I had put some objects in shared memory. After taking them out, recompiling, and restarting the shared memory server, the most recent objects became active again.<br />
<br />
Btw, is this the way it is meant to go with shared memory? Whenever an object which is in SM is being updated, this whole procedure should be followed before getting the new objects avtive???<br />
