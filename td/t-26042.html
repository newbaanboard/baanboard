I am not sure which particular help are you referring to. Please post that document on here for others to refer.<br />
<br />
in which library or Header file the prototypes are present...?<br />
You can refer to the header files in $BSE/api/include.<br />
<br />
please let me know it ASAP<br />
We're (largely) volunteers. We take time out of busy lives to answer questions, and at times it is noticed that there isn't enough information provided. If you like a better response and help from others, please provide all information, what you want to do, tools versions etc, instead of letting others do the guessing game.</div></div><hr />
