<br />
I want to read the standard baan report format (which is with escape codes etc.) and transform it to an other format. For example, after reading the baan report format (which is dev independent I guess), I will conver it to a special HTML format with colours and various other formatting. The main thing I require is to know the standard baan report format (Which is probably the one temporarily placed in temp directory of baan, when any reports are generated).<br />
<br />
Its kind of quite urgent for me and I will highly appreciate any help/ideas in this regard.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Jabran</div></div><hr />

Is there a  reason you need to read that format or could you just convert it to ASCII as I state in the other post, then read it  in and do your special HTML formatting.<br />

Baan table ttadv330 to 337 contain all the information necessary about a report. Especially ttadv335 may be useful for understanding the report layouts. Baan's report generator uses the information in ttadv tables to generate a script which effectively prints the report in the format decided.<br />
<br />
Due to different programming styles , layout conditions and use /non-use of labels etc , understanding the Baan reporting is a quite daunting task.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked the ttadv330 and some other, but these are only containing formatting information (like, margins, widths, etc.). I need more than that i.e. I need to get hint about the field to which some data entry in a report belongs to. Just to give any example similar to what I want to achieve: To search names of business partners in a report and format them as italic/bold/differnt font in HTML. This will require to know a particaulr data item in a report is actually from which field. <br />
<br />
<br />
Please let me know your thoughts over it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
