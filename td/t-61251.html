Is there actually a detail layout?  I will have to go dig thru my reports to find an example, but I know for totals I had to actually include the detail layout.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
pay attention at the report flow and increase the variable at the right place.<br />
(Maybe it is reseted to 0 at ....seqn.1 an so never reaches the after.report section? )<br />
Maybe it would be better to increase in after.layout ?<br />
<br />
BEFORE.REPORT<br />
HEADER.x<br />
BEFORE.FIELD.1<br />
BEFORE.FIELD.2 .....<br />
DETAIL.1<br />
DETAIL.2 .....<br />
AFTER.FIELD. .....<br />
AFTER.REPORT<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">6th October 2011, 11:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You just need to define the field as total in after report section with appropriate aggregate expression . Coding is report script is required only when u need to do derive % or proportions on aggregates.<br />
<br />
In ur report script u have initialized grand.tot in before.field section  . It must be before.report  and u need to increment the variable in after.receive.data or  detail in appropriate condition.</div></div><hr />
