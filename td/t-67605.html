<br />
who can help me with this Problem: I have to calculate the total some listed amounts. For that I've used the &quot;total&quot; property of a mask field in the footer.<br />
<br />
But now the footer apears on a new page when the Report will created. That depends on the page size off 66 for the Printer device. <br />
<br />
1.) I only want to print the footer once on the last page.<br />
2.) I want to print it beneath the last normal printed line. For that I want to reduce the page size dynamical.<br />
<br />
Is that possible? Or do you have a better solution?<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Bernd</div></div><hr />

thanks for your hint. I've checked that and created an after.report layout. But this layout will not appear on the Report! :eek:<br />
What happens there???<br />
Maybe you have an additional tipp for me, why that could be?<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
here's the report sections:<br />
<br />
Report sections (report scripts)<br />
A report consists of a number of layouts, which define the content and organization of the various parts of a report (for example, the header, footer, and body of the report). There are a number of possible layout types, as follows:<br />
<br />
before.report – printed once at beginning of the report (a title page, for example)<br />
after.report – printed once at the end of the report<br />
header – printed at the top of each page<br />
footer – printed at the bottom of each page<br />
before.field – printed before each group of records in reports of type 3; if a group of records spans more than one page, the before.field layout is repeated at the top of the new page<br />
after.field – printed immediately after each group of records in reports of type 3<br />
detail – used for the individual records included in the body of the report<br />
The content and arrangement of these layouts are defined in the data dictionary.<br />
<br />
In the report sections in a report script, you can program actions to be performed before and/or after execution of individual layouts of these types. Report sections consist of a main section and a subsection. You use a main section to specify the particular layout for which the programmed actions are to be executed. You must follow a main section with either a before.layout or an after.layout subsection. These latter specify whether the actions are to be executed before or after the particular layout is printed.<br />
<br />
Main sections<br />
<br />
before.report.&lt;layout_number&gt;:<br />
<br />
Actions programmed in this section are executed for a specified layout of type before.report.<br />
<br />
after.report.&lt;layout_number&gt;:<br />
<br />
Actions programmed in this section are executed for a specified layout of type after.report.<br />
<br />
header.&lt;layout_number&gt;:<br />
<br />
Actions programmed in this section are executed for a specified layout of type header.<br />
<br />
detail.&lt;layout_number&gt;:<br />
<br />
Actions programmed in this section are executed for a specified layout of type detail.<br />
<br />
before.&lt;field name&gt;.&lt;layout_number&gt;:<br />
<br />
Actions programmed in this section are executed for a specified layout of type before.field.<br />
<br />
after.&lt;field name&gt;.&lt;layout_number&gt;:<br />
<br />
Actions programmed in this section are executed for a specified layout of type after.field.<br />
<br />
footer.&lt;layout_number&gt;:<br />
<br />
Actions programmed in this section are executed for a specified layout of type footer.<br />
<br />
Subsections<br />
<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
Actions programmed in this subsection are executed before the specified layout is printed.<br />
<br />
When lattr.print is set to false, the layout is not printed and the before.layout and after.layout sections are not executed. If you set lattr.print to falsein the before.layout section itself, the layout is not printed and the after.layout section is not executed.<br />
<br />
after.layout:<br />
<br />
Actions programmed in this subsection are executed after the specified layout is printed.<br />
<br />
As a tip:<br />
<br />
Place a Label in after.report layout, compile and test if this label is printed.<br />
Check if a print expression is set at this layout.<br />
Check if lattr.print = false ist set in reportscript for this layout.<br />
<br />

<br />
thanks for your help. Now I could solve the Problem. <br />
Don't know why I've overseen it. But your hint pushed me to right direction :)<br />
There was an after.report-section in the Report script that I've overseen.<br />
<br />
Now I added an additional after.report-section and now it works really fine.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
and happy Weekend<br />
