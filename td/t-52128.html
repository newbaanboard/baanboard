CRDD for the same has been done succesfully. We have seen the same getting reflected in GTD as well as at informix level.<br />
<br />
As we go to select the index in change keys in Maintain Session, the newly added index does not appear in list, even after doing the Create Runtime DD for the session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th May 2008, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried creating a new session, just to see if the new index shows up on the session?  To me it still looks like a data dictionary issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beluver_2k</div><div class="date">2nd June 2008, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Mark,<br />
Thank you for your response. On new session also the new index is not appearing it seems that BaanIVC4 only consider the index till 19 the 20th one does not appear in any case.<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">_Ralph_</div><div class="date">2nd June 2008, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the Infor LN 6.1 Programmers Guide:<br />
<br />
<br />
Known limits<br />
<br />
Reports<br />
sorting doubles correct to 6 decimal places<br />
maximum 255 fields on a report (including array elements)<br />
<br />
Bshell<br />
maximum string buffer size is 4K â€“ be careful when concatenating strings with '&amp;' sign<br />
maximum function stack depth is 500<br />
<br />
Bic<br />
maximum 255 arguments per function<br />
maximum 32K variables per compilation<br />
maximum BRANCH of 32K (BRANCH refers to the amount of generated code per function, including macros etc.)<br />
<br />
SQL<br />
The nesting level of subqueries is limited to 10. The nesting level is defined as follows. The nesting level of the main query is 1. The nesting level of a sub query immediately contained in the main query is 2. The nesting level of a sub query immediately contained in another sub query is the nesting level of that sub query plus 1.<br />
The number of index hints that can be given on a table is limited to 4.<br />
The SQL processor has no limit on the length of string values. However, the databases may impose restrictions on the length of string values. It is advised to keep the length of string values (including string literals and string values resulting from concatenation) below 4K.<br />
<br />
Tables<br />
maximum record length is 3072 bytes (for multi-byte columns take a factor 2 into account. For example, a multi-byte string of 256 characters will be 512 bytes long in a multi-byte environment.)<br />
maximum number of fields is 1024<br />
maximum field length is 3072 bytes<br />
maximum number of indices per table is 20:eek:<br />
<br />
Indexes<br />
maximum index length is 500 bytes<br />
maximum number of fields is 24 (no combined fields)<br />

I have never rechead any one of them, but i think this is reason for your problem.</div></div><hr />
