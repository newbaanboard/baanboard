Session Type is Maintain.<br />
Window Type is List Window.<br />
The requirement is that the user wants to see the items' image in the same session the user is going to select (it is a zoom session).<br />
<br />
I tried using Image field in DFE but it only shows in the details section, which is not what I need.<br />
<br />
Is it really possible? If so how?</div></div><hr />

So, I have gone with Chrome Extension to dynamically edit the page using JQuery with CSS and use NodeJS as a Web-Service to fetch the desired images by sending them as base64 encoded data through requests. <br />
It is now working almost as what I expected but it is acceptable for the moment.<br />
I might develop it more in the future since it obviously extends the opportunities of customizing the LN WebUI on the top layer for clients.<br />
See attachment for the result. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
As mentioned in a similar ongoing thread, you could use Infor IDM(Infor Document Management) where you can attach single or multiple files against a record.It would suit your requirement.<br />

<br />
I tried IDM before but it shows document attached to the selected records and only after the user selected each record manually. <br />
My requirement is that the user needs to see each item's image in the same record and in the same window. The column in front of the item code is the best place possible. However, IDM only provides a space to the right of the screen to see each record's attachments, which is not exactly what it requires.<br />
That is what I understand in the part of IDM for using image items here. If I misunderstand anything please correct and guide me so I don't have to use this method.<br />
<br />

We had one requirement that we ended up doing with a chrome extension, but it never actually made it to production. I would say, a valid response for the requestors in such cases should be &quot;it is not possible in ln, deal with it&quot;.</div></div><hr />
