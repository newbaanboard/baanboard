Things to check - put session and report in debug more.  Make sure the fields are being set in the session script.  Then make sure the fields are listed as input fields to the report.  Then with the report in debug mode step thru it and make sure the fields are getting populated on input from the session script.  At least that would be what I would do in 4c4.</div></div><hr />
