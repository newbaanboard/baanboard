&quot;label2&quot;-do another process.<br />
- Alternative option is to use the LN form commands and add 2 buttons to the session, enable/disable them based on certain condition/status.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply  ...but i want hyperlink like HTML ..not a button ..<br />
when i clicking this label or link,open a web page....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th February 2019, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah - so I added a button on the screen.  Remember I am on 4c4. I would build the URL and then basically launch it like below.  So I would create user defined option - then just go add that to the button form.  Or if I wanted I could edit the form - do special button and put in my user defined option.  Then I could put the button anywhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
choice.user.2:<br />
on.choice:<br />

Based on your other posts, it appears you are new to Baan/LN programming and need to get some more training.<br />
The purpose of labels is to display a meaningful name for the Table/form field.<br />
The purpose of the form-commands/choice options is to take &quot;action&quot;. <br />
You are mixing up both.</div></div><hr />

 label (&quot;it's should not be like a button &quot;)..clicking this  do some process... Is it possible in LN10.4?If yes ,how to do??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th February 2019, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what they are saying is that it is not possible to do it with a label.  But you could simulate it with a button to launch a URL.  I will not say that for sure since I have never played with building a window with like create.object or something like that.  Even using something like that I am not sure how you would get a link to work from the form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">19th February 2019, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You can simulate it by putting a display field on the form. Then you can set it inside the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AnuKass</div><div class="date">19th February 2019, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">i did as you set ...but i got nothing..<br />
can you please tell what i will do in program script?</div></div><hr />
