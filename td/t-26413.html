<br />
Well i m trying to send a file as attachment in mail but have not achived it.<br />
<br />
i have gone throug almost all the threads related to sending mail using different commands like mailx , mail, mutt , sendmail , blat etc<br />
<br />
Syntex for mailx that i m using :<br />
<br />
uuencode source_file dest_file | mailx -s &quot;subject&quot; email@a.com<br />
<br />
But the problem is that i m getting the mails without attachment<br />
<br />
What i think is that mailx is not the proper command to send attachment on Sun Solaris Server although it might be working on HP-UX servers.<br />
<br />
Plz suggest the commad , format , method to do this.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Instead, try using mailx -its &lt; filename. Before this command, be sure to attach the attachment file to the drafted mail text, using &quot;uuencode&quot;.<br />
<br />
1. Write the mail text (draft) in file1<br />
2. Attach attachment file to file1 using uuencode<br />
3. Use mailx -its &lt; file1<br />
<br />
Check commands uuencode and mailx for accurate info, as these depend on the version in use...<br />

<br />
check the man pages :<br />
<br />
EXAMPLES<br />
      To encode and send a compiled program foo to user friend:<br />
<br />
           uuencode foo foo | mailx -s 'new program' friend@domain.x<br />
<br />
      After receiving the mail message, user friend can decode the program<br />
      by first saving the message in a file foo.mail and executing the<br />
      command:<br />
<br />
           uudecode foo.mail<br />
<br />
 WARNINGS<br />
      The file is expanded by 35% (three bytes become four plus control<br />
      information) causing it to take longer to transmit.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I have no access to a system to check atm .... but I remember that I had to fiddle a bit until I achieved sending an attachment.<br />
The problem was that I didn't specify the name of the file that was uuencoded.<br />
And I am very sure that I used 3 filenames and then it worked.<br />
One filename for the source, one that specified the name to be included in the uuencoded file and the third for the destination file.<br />
I had yet another file that contained the message text, To: From: Subject: etc.<br />
So what finally worked was something like this (IIRC):<br />
uuencode datafile datafile.txt &gt; datafile.uuenc<br />
cat mess.file datafile.uuenc | /usr/sbin/sendmail<br />
<br />
