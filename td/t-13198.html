   I had created a Warehouse in tcmcs003.<br />
   Now I am unable to delete it.<br />
   It comes up with the &quot;Unable to delete; record being used in other table&quot;.<br />
   This Warehouse is not being referenced anywhere (not that I know of).<br />
 <br />
   I tried ttaad4229m000 - Print References to parent.<br />
   Even this session did not pick up any references.<br />
<br />
   How do I find out why it's not deleting the record?<br />
   Please advice.<br />
   Thanks.<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

One of the log files told me the referenced table name.  I can not remember which log file, but I was able to trace the relationships.  I think I had to deleted records from two other tables before I could delete the parent record.  The baan session aborted and so did the table maintenance, but table maintenance I think generated an error with the reference table name.<br />

I don't think the Print references to parent would look across to the other company, but the delete might.<br />
<br />
The other thought I had is if the reference counters are still in use, maybe one is non-zero by accident?  Use the Reorganize Tables w/repair reference counter to fix?<br />
