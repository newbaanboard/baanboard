Hi,  <br />

When I say connection problem I refer to any event, as network problems or energy problems that it happens while the process is in course, that is, while the process executing in the server but the process have been called from a client (bw or ba), then I need to know if exists some way to feel this events?<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you.....</div></div><hr />

I don't know if it is possible to determine the IP address of a client PC based on some Baan process ID which is registered in the licencedaemon ( licmon6.1 -w )<br />
In that case you could do some test by pinging the client to check if it is still alive.</div></div><hr />
