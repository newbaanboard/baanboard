<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th March 2011, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">In Exchange only conditions rejected and error rejected records create log file messages. But &quot;record skipped&quot; does not create a log message. Further more, a condition rejected record, will appear in the log file, but the reason the record is rejected is not mentioned. <br />
<br />
For end-users this is not very practical, for they do not see which records are skipped and don't know either why records that are rejected by condition, are skipped.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to use a (standard?) command or function to add a message to the log file? If so, how?<br />
<br />
Also, on the Exchange Schemes session form 2, there is a field 'add extra logging' (tuxch001.logs). Does anyone know what this field does?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance!<br />

Kind regards,<br />

I can use function log.mess() in Exchange conditions. Only don't know yet what the &quot;add extra logging&quot; option does...</div></div><hr />

They have to be done in the correct sequence.  <br />

I was going to say that we actually have a validate exchange scheme session that gives a somewhat more useful message that a consultant developed.  This would allow you to see how many would fail, etc.  Then again only IT people run exchange schemes here so we really just run it to see if 0 errors, if errors then we know to fix the data file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do additional logging will cause exchange to create an additional logfile for records that are skipped.  Very useful.</div></div><hr />
