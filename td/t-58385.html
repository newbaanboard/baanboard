<br />
<br />
have a question, what if there's more database field on the lnfp5 than in the sp1? is the migration tools will 'fill the blanks' or it will blank, and we need to fill it again?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
When there are new fields added by a solution or SP programs are sometimes supplied with the solution or SP to fill the extra fields from existing data.<br />
<br />
If you look at companies the is a field which is marked when a data upgrade is needed.<br />
<br />

The upgrade program will add the fields even the fields is not a standard fields but it is customise fields?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">1st June 2010, 09:44</div></div><div class="posttext">In a Feature Pack upgrade there are two steps regarding tables. First is the reconfiguration. At that moment new fields etc. are added to the table. The second step is the Data Upgrade Engine, which updates the tables from a content perspective. So, if new fields need to be calculated from existing other fields, the Data Upgrade Engine does that part.<br />
If you customize the table, reconfiguration will take care of changing the physical table to your needs. The Upgrade Programs that run within the Data Upgrade Engine don't handle custom fields, except when you have the source code of the Upgrade Programs. In that case, you can customize the Upgrade program to take care of you customized fields. But keep in mind that in this case you have to sync the installation of your customizations with the feature pack upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am trying to migrate LN Fp3 to FP5. I am doing it since last 3 weeks, still unsuccessful. Following are the steps i did.<br />
<br />
1) Installed Porting Set 8.5a - Successfull<br />
2) Installed Enterprise Server PMC Solutions - Successfull<br />
3) INstalled ES Add on PMC  - Successfull<br />
Till now all tools solutions done and succuessfull. ES updated to 7.6 a5 also Porting set to 8.5a<br />
<br />
Now i install ERP LN Application PMC Solutions.It took a looot of time do download missing solutions. It downloaded around 2500 over solutions and after that it was doing COnvert to Run time for the change in table definitions. Even this took a long time as our data is pretty huge. After a while , for those tables which have changes, R.table name files created in $BSE/tmp folder, but didnt get deleted, becasue it couldnt reconfigure the table with the existing data. Error message -- Error in alter table statment. <br />
<br />
I think the error is valid , as still data upgrade Engine is not yet run. After the Error message, i didnt continue in the INstallation process. I logged in ERP and downloaded few solutions for Data upgrade engine as per INfor instructions. <br />
<br />
When i start data upgrade engine, i get an Error - immediately.. Fatal Error .. Cannot conitnue in bcxxxdll1900. because of domain tcemm.euca. <br />
<br />
I tried to do CRDD for domians, restarted , nothign worked till now. Can Anyone help me out in this. <br />
<br />
I wanted to know<br />
1) Whether the process am doing is right or wrong ? IF wrong whats the correct process.<br />
2) If its right,, any solution to move ahead of this stage.<br />
3) What would be the next process ahead of Data upgreade engine. <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help <br />
<br />
Regards<br />

1) Whether the process am doing is right or wrong ? IF wrong whats the correct process.<br />
<br />
The process is right<br />
<br />
 2) If its right,, any solution to move ahead of this stage.<br />
<br />
The convert to runtime ie changing the tables in the DB has to work<br />
This usually does not work for example when fields have been changed from 6 char to 9 char.<br />
<br />
has to be checked and corrected by hand<br />
<br />
 3) What would be the next process ahead of Data upgreade engine. <br />
<br />
The data upgrade engine often fails because of corrupt data each 1 has to be checked and the data corrected. Sometimes they fail because there is no data, in this case you can just add a return(0) at the start of the DLL.<br />
<br />
When you have got it completed the first time (3 weeks) then you start again from the begining and try to get it done with less problems and quicker time.<br />
<br />
lots of luck<br />
