This is because many of the data entry people use the number keypad when entering data and it would be easier for them to hit return than tab.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to use the enter key to move from field to field on a form?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

We are also using Baan IV C4.  I don't think I've ever looked at the session mentioned, but I'll see if it works that way in this version.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Actually in my first post I was hoping naabio would post how that session does it.  I know I would be interested in how it works.<br />

Tab key came in vogue only with Bw.  I don't recollect how one can start a session in ascii mode in BW . If you run such sessions in ascii mode then  u can have the 'ENTER'  keys for data entry . <br />
<br />
Sessions like ttaad4100 run same in all platform and in the fashion you want .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just had a look at the source of tfgld1115m000 (tfgld1103). I couldn't find anything special regarding the &quot;Enter&quot;-Button.<br />
<br />
The function to.field() was used twice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi How can we start only 1 session in ASCII while remaining in BW (the way ttaad4100 works ) . I have seen 3GL programs in aSCII mode . But how abt any 4GL maintain session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">An example of a throw back ascii session within the normal GUI is tdsmi1102 script.  That calls the command 'switch.to.ascii.mode' in the before.program section.  It's not a function in that script, so I assume it's a normal tools function you can use.   It's not just a normal 4GL session converted to ASCII for the fun of it though, as you said it's a 3GL code with all the screen writes etc. done in the code.  That's why they could not use the standard GUI, it does not understand all that.  That's also why ttaad4100/4500 is still in ASCII mode, as well as some other sessions, I think the configurator.  ASCII screen programming had greater control, we have gone backwards with the GUI (but, gosh, it sure is prettier).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, we had the exact same requirements for our sales order entry staff.  They are all lightning fast on the keypad and the mouse would only slow them down.  Baan seemed quite limited in mapping the keyboard for individual users and I didn't want to recode every screen.<br />
<br />
We got a program called KeyGo.  This solved our problem in tidy fashion.  You can map any key to any macro (we set up the NumKeypadEnter key to be &quot;Tab&quot;, + key is Insert Line, - key is delete line etc...).  More information is at http://www.gdgsystems.com<br />
<br />
I hope this helps....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their Baan Colorizer utilizes the concept of hooking. Since a hook has already been created, they can easily incorporate the feature of converting Enter -&gt; Tab. The advantage would be that this would be enabled only on a Baan screen and not everywhere.<br />
<br />
Knowing them I am sure the pricing would be much better.</div></div><hr />

If your client is WinXP Pro (and I think it also works for Win2k)  - this is how I solved it: Used a registry tweak for the trick. You have to add a key to the registry. Here it is...<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]<br />
&quot;Scancode Map&quot;=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,0f,00,4e,00,00,00,00,00<br />
<br />
I now wish I had kept notes on this because I don't remember which hex value does what.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this will affect *all* applications!!!</div></div><hr />
