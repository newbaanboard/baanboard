<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stacy Long</div><div class="date">25th November 2021, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I've encountered a problem when using form.text$ to convert a message to a string for use on reports or other such uses.  If you change the text on the message itself, the change does not consistently take effect.  The old text is being stored somewhere.  By user.  If you have used form.text$ for this message before, Baan/LN remember and will not change.  You can even delete that message from the system and as long as it's converted that message for that user before, it still comes back with the same text.<br />
I need to change the text of a message and can't for the life of me figure out where it's storing this or how to wipe it out to show the new text.<br />
Please Help!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">26th November 2021, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a cache of messages for performance reasons. To get the changed message, user needs to restart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stacy Long</div><div class="date">29th November 2021, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried that.  There's more to it than that.  I need to be able to force clear these messages.  Any idea where they are stored?  I can see it's by user.  But not finding any table or Unix file that seems to contain this information.  Looked also locally and am not seeing anything.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stacy Long</div><div class="date">1st December 2021, 07:29</div></div><div class="posttext">yes thank you.  I did understand that to be what you meant.  I did that several times. I logged completely out of Baan.  But it did not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st December 2021, 14:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure the user is in the same VRC as the correct message.  Don't know LN but on 4c4 messages are maintained by VRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stacy Long</div><div class="date">13th December 2021, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes same VRC.  These are custom messages.  Everyone is on the same package combination.  The exact same message code, same VRC, new message text does not show.  Only the old message text.  Even if I completely delete the message from the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">6th January 2022, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">May be language related? Are you users on the same language as where you change the content of the message? Are you using that same language when taking the form.text$ function?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th January 2022, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep thinking since form.text reads from the data dictionary - for some reason or other once the message is change the data dictionary is not being updated.  I saw this in 4c4 with some tables and sessions at times - I am not sure what the admin did but he went in and forced an update.  Once he got that done we could log out and log in and see the changes - but that was 4c4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stacy Long</div><div class="date">7th January 2022, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there @mark_h,<br />
Now you're talking!  That is what I am looking for.  We are running both 4c4 and LN here (don't ask lol) and the problem exists in both.  Are you able to ask your admin what they did to force the update?  I am familiar with where certain things are stored in Unix for the DD, but for messages I have found nothing.  It has to be storing somewhere.  And you are correct that form.text$ refers to the DD in help.  I am just at a loss as to where this is being stored for messages.<br />
<br />
@Omeluuk, yes same language for all users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th January 2022, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry - he retired right after we converted from 4c4 to ebs.  All I recall is he would go into a table and delete some (or maybe all records) - then the convert to runtime would work. I also recall at times the data dictionary objects permissions and owner ship somehow got changed.  Then we had to change the permissions to were the bsp was the owner and then change the permissions again.  This happened a lot to some tables created by one developer - mainly it was the owner, group and world permissions that got screwed up. So we would fix those then redo create RDD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stacy Long</div><div class="date">11th January 2022, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark,  I do appreciate the reply none the less.  I will take a look at the tables again to see what I can find.  :)  Permissions should not come into play here as I have been the developer and the user for these.  And I know all my objects are defaulted to at least user and group bsp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">25th January 2022, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really want to know, you can add DBSLOG options to know what tables are touched and which message is retrieved from where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stacy Long</div><div class="date">26th January 2022, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't believe I didn't think of that.  I am accustomed to using those logs specifically for performance investigations.  Never thought to use it like that.  Thank you for the suggestion!  :)</div></div><hr />
