<br />
We are making Credit Card Interface in Baan LN.<br />
We have the Card Swipe Device, on which at the swipe of card we can get the Card Information on Notepad(The information comes automatically in the form of string) <br />
The same can be achieved on any active session in Baan. In Baan also the Credit card information comes automatically on the input field. <br />
This string contains entire Credit Card information i.e. Credit Card Number, Credit Card Holder Name, Expiry Details.<br />
<br />
Once we have Card Information, we have to split the required information into separate fields i.e. Credit Card Number, Credit Card Holder Name, Card Expiry Date.<br />
<br />
Once the Card is swiped, information is automatically available in Baan, but unfortunately I could not find any Event which gets  triggered on swipe of Card.<br />
As a result, to split the value currently I have to manually press enter after card is swipe.<br />
<br />
Does someone know, which event can be triggered after swipe of the card or how we can handle the splitting of Card Information into separate fields in Baan.<br />
<br />

Something like a barcode reader - you can search this forum for information on how people have done that.  I am thinking if you could get a tab or something then you could use the when field changes event to launch a routine to separate and process the card - something like that.</div></div><hr />
