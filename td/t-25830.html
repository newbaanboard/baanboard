Is there a way to access the same data the reprint function in maintain device queue uses? I could locate the packing slips via the ttaad320 table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">6th December 2005, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">You can reprint all the packing lists by specifying the range of packing list numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mick_m</div><div class="date">6th December 2005, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response. I did not mention that we have written our own print packing session. I would still be interested if there is a way to use the device queue data or some other method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th December 2005, 21:58</div></div><div class="posttext">How would you locate them using the ttaad320 report?  Do they all go to the same printer.  Also how long do you all keep the temp files(what ttaad320 points to)?  I am not sure this way is feasible.<br />
<br />
How about just changing your print packing session to write a table to log what is printed?  Then write a new session to re-print packing data for all of the records for current day - you might even be able to use the report from your current session.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mick_m</div><div class="date">6th December 2005, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the ttaad320 table I could locate all of the packing slip runs of the day by the package/module/session fields. The record also has the path to the temporary file. They do all go to the same printer and we keep the temporary file s for 2 days.<br />
<br />
Your other option would work I was just curious if there was a way to do it through the device queue.<br />

Thanks for your suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th December 2005, 14:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you could re-print them that way.  The only problem I see is that you will be printing a lot of single reports without really getting any benefits of a continuous report.  I do not know of a way to combine the temp files to do this - at this point they are formatted for a printer and not really readable.  I do know you could probably convert them to ASCII, but I do not see how that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you can write a session to collect all $BSE/tmp filenames and copy them to .bpf files and then run a serie of bwprints ...<br />
We made a .cmd file like following:<br />
<br />
REM edibw.cmd édition automatisée de documents BaaN avec code barre<br />
<br />
SET fidata=\\ramses2\scp\<br />
SET fiprog=C:\progra~1\baan\bin\bwprint <br />
<br />
if exist %fidata%desenlog.bpf<br />
con2prt /cd \\fru1imp1\U2SCPMEX13<br />
%fiprog% /p /r %fidata%desenlog.bpf<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
