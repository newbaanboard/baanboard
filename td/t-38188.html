I have seen the link that you have put to me, the options that are are with Java or the GhostScript, in my case in the sever we have installed Acroread, its possible to generate the pdf with the Acroread? <br />
<br />
Thx very much.</div></div><hr />

I don't think AcroRead32 (Acrobat Reader) can generate PDF files. However, I don't know about Acrobat Writer! There are other tools that can generate PDF files, you can serach in Google for them.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
as it's name say Acrobat Reader, you can't create PDF Files with it.<br />
<br />
There are some other applications for PDF creating.<br />
