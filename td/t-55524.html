That's why I have not purchased development license. However I have pressure from development team that development license is needed for them to modifiy reports.<br />
<br />
May I know what type of customization or modification can be done on standard reports without development license ?<br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />

<br />
a strict regulation against customization is nice, but in real life you need to customize your system for the needs of the company. I have never seen a system without customisations.<br />
<br />
Even with a development license you can minimize the impact in case of FP and version upgrades. A development license give you the possibility to compile your own programs, but you canÂ´t modify the standard programs of ERP LN. If you want to modify the standard programs as well, then you need the ERP LN source code, which is an additional license.<br />
<br />
A report can be modified normally without a develoment license, but if you wan to debug a programm because the report did not show the requested results, then you need the development license.<br />
 <br />
Regards<br />

<br />
In summary layouts can be added, changed or removed and report scripts can be written to allow data from any table in the database to be displayed in your own layouts.<br />
<br />
It is also possible to add the varaible procesinfo$ to the session form allowing you to use your own variables in the reports.<br />
<br />
Ideally you need to get hold of some documentation in respect of basic report development.<br />

<br />
As indicated by dieter , u can devise customization strategy which does not impede migrations / upgrades . It  can be like <br />
1. No changes in baan standard dd / domain<br />
2. dont make changes in baan standard programs as far as possible<br />
3. Creation of new programs and use of AFS to  facilitate automations and flexibilities. AFS is very good facility to do development in harmony with standard.<br />
4. Building /devising buisness procedures around ERP processes as far as possible.</div></div><hr />
