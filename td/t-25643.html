This is the method we use at my site - not an easy solution, but certainly feasible.  <br />
<br />
Here is another link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=1194&amp;highlight=logos) which includes ppt and word docs on how others do this.  <br />
<br />
You can find these solutions by clicking on &quot;search&quot; at the top of the page, go to &quot;advanced search&quot;.  Then in advanced search just put in &quot;logos&quot; as the keyword and click on the &quot;search now&quot; button.  This should help you find other threads on the topic.</div></div><hr />

Just convert to PS, to PDF with ghostscript and merge a background pdf with the document.</div></div><hr />

You can also checkout this discussion thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=12529&amp;page=2&amp;pp=15&amp;highlight=forms+packages) and maybe you want to call rmc (http://www.rmcis.com/) or NAZDAQ (http://www.nazdaq-it.com/index.php) to see what they can do for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you tell me any such font softwares(trail versions) which will allow me to export the font as ttf so that I can completely do the process ??<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th November 2005, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I only played with scanfont when I was trying to figure out how a consultant set up our logos.  I found out that we actually use the method ~Vamsi described in the code and utilities forum.  We have stuck with that since it seems to work - so I will not be any help with setting up true type font.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nansat99</div><div class="date">29th November 2005, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I purchased the scan font software and converted the logo into a font, added it to system fonts in control panel.<br />
<br />
After this I added a detail layout to the report (with font as User font 3)on which the logo has to be printed. In edit layout i even gave the character &quot;A&quot; (since I assigned the character&quot;A&quot; to the font (ttf)). but the logo is not getting printed on the report. <br />
<br />
I am trying this in baan5c. As per Vamsi's document, the font has to be changed for windows printer. but in baan 5c I couldnot see any font filed for windows printer session.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me out of this ASAP.<br />

Thanks<br />

Follow these steps:<br />
- Print the report, making sure you preview it.<br />
- You should see the &quot;A&quot; in some font within BWPrint. Right click on the &quot;A&quot; and choose the Fonts option<br />
- Set the User-3 font to the font you created<br />
<br />
Reprint the report. You should see the logo.<br />
<br />
The downside of this solution is:<br />
- When you followed the above steps you were modifying the registry and now you have the task of setting the registry to the same values on every PC in the company.<br />
<br />
BTW, did you have a chance to read through an excellent presentation at this link:<br />

Did it work? What were you missing when you tried the first time.</div></div><hr />

We are using HP printers with an additional RAM module. You can store your logos as a macro in this module and call ist from your printfile with barcode-fonts of the driver (this is just a way to call unix-scripts during printing. We use it to add some PCL Code for calling the macros. To create a macro you can use a word document and print it to file.<br />
<br />
The scripts are executed at the end of your printjob. They are very helpfull if you want to add some information (i.e. a file  :rolleyes:  at the start of your report you create during printing... . I've tested it successfully :D ). <br />
<br />

B.T.W: This only works on Unix!</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Have to use PCL files as overlays. Look for a Code &amp; Utilities solution from yours truly.<br />
- Second solution is to use PDF. There are tools that can overlay or underlay files on each other. Commercial and Opensource solutions abound.<br />
<br />
There are also commercial solutions that accomplish the whole thing much easily. Post in Third Party Tools asking for recommendations.</div></div><hr />
