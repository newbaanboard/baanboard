<br />
can someone give me a hint how to achieve that the windows GUI start button of a session has another text instead of &quot;print&quot;?<br />
<br />
I have to change this next monday on a customers system and no system I can experiment on atm.<br />
<br />
The session in question was generated as a print-session because of the naming convention.<br />
<br />
The session works well, all printer related stuff has been removed - but the customer demands that the button to start the processing mustn't be labeled &quot;print&quot;.<br />
<br />
I used to work with ascii-clients and never bothered much about these button stuff in the GUI.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
You can go to Session - &gt; Specific - &gt; Form Commands.<br />
<br />
For that specific form command, you can add a New Label with whatever text you require.<br />
<br />
I guess this is what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
If there is no form commands i.e. they are using standard print command, then you can create one and add your specific label to it.<br />
<br />
Now, in your script, create a function:-<br />
<br />
function extern form_command_name()<br />
{<br />
execute(print.data)<br />
}<br />
<br />
Now, double click on session, go to Form Tab, and in default button make Command Type as Form Command and Default Button as your new form command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd October 2014, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Bhushan - Not sure it works that way in 4c4.  What I typically do is 1 of 2 things.  First I would go into the maintain form session and hit buttons - they might have just labeled the continue button as &quot;print&quot;.  In this case all you need to do is change the label. <br />
<br />
They second way is to go into &quot;Spec. Options&quot;.  The original developer might have added a choice.user button.  Again you would just need to change the description or short description.  <br />
<br />
In either case no coding should really be needed in 4c4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it was specifically for LN.In LN, its not possible to change the label of Standard Print Button. Hence, we need to add a new user command and give it a label as you want ( Same what you said) <br />
<br />
The coding part will come into picture, only if there is a requirement to replace standard print button to customize button with a new label.<br />
<br />
PS:- I am looking forward to see you in LN soon ;)</div></div><hr />

Me too!  I am hoping we start in 2015.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">6th October 2014, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I am too stupid :-(<br />
<br />
In Maintain session, mask2 under forms if I choose &quot;buttons&quot; I find 3 checkboxes:<br />
<br />
Weiter (continue) - not checked<br />
Abbrechen (Abort) - checked<br />
Weiter (seems to be print) - checked<br />
<br />
With this settings, the button is labeled &quot;print&quot; and choice.cont.process: on.choice is executed when I press this button.<br />
<br />
If I change the setting and check the first button and uncheck the third, the button displayed has label &quot;OK&quot; - which is great - but on.choice is not executed when I press it -<br />
<br />
As I had to admit, I never really cared about buttons so far - any help greatly appreciated<br />
<br />
thx in advance<br />
<br />
Norbert</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th October 2014, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I always thought the &quot;ok&quot; button was the same as continue.  I guess not.  You can fix it two ways - just click the continue button and remove anything from the &quot;label continue button&quot;.  Or you can change the &quot;label continue button&quot; - with Ok, Process, or what ever you think the customer would like the best.</div></div><hr />
