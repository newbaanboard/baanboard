	Does anyone know how I can switch between oracle 7 and 8 drivers? Meaning, we did a porting set upgrade couple days back and since then I think baan is now using oracle8 driver (I am not how confirm this). But the problem is that now we have performance problems with some of the session. These session use run just fine before we did the porting set upgrade and I am assuming it was using oracle 7 driver. I want now force baan to use oracle7 driver and see what happens.<br />
<br />
	Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

We had performance issue with the batch jobs but after using oracle7 driver our jobs completeing successfully.<br />
<br />
BDB_DRIVER=oracle7      ;export BDB_DRIVER<br />
ORACLE_SID=baaniv       ;export ORACLE_SID<br />
ORACLE_HOME=/oracle8/app/oracle/product/8.1.6; export ORACLE_HOME<br />
<br />
ps -ef|grep oracle8 would  show you whether you are running oracle 8 driver or not.<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

I tried what you said but it did not work. We had no other choice but to go back to the old portingset for now. Will try it again sometime later.<br />

Thanks again,<br />

You can specify different database drivers/versions in the Database definitions. You would also need to have 2 different Oracle binaries in the $BSE/bin and then you need to change the $BSE/lib/ipc_info to make 2 tags/entries for Oracle-7/8 drivers and then the $BSE/lib/tabledef6.2 has to be modified accordingly.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if BaaN Support will support this configuration or not.  You can explore at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Good Luck! :p</div></div><hr />
