<br />
In our organization we use BIRT reporting engine to get report outputs from LN.<br />
In one report, i have used code39 barcode to print on the BIRT report.<br />
Users print the report in webtop and then export it to PDF.<br />
Both, webtop and PDF were showing barcode without any issue.<br />
<br />
However, after I restarted the LN server users are unable to see the barcode in PDF.<br />
It can be seen in other exported formats (excel, word, html), but not PDF.<br />
I have restarted the server several time before, but this issue never happened.<br />
<br />
I have tried changing the barcode font, designing a new report, but nothing seems to get work.<br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered a situation like this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Tushar Jain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you try resintalling the fonts on both reporting server and the client machine? Can you check if the fonts are present under directory similar to this - &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Reader 11.0\Resource\Font&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, can you check if you save the word file as PDF, does the font show up?</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
Yes I've tried reinstalling the fonts as well, on both client and server machines.<br />
If I save the word or excel file as pdf, the barcode shows up in pdf. <br />
I have tried other pdf readers also, but its still the same.<br />
So I think that pdf reader is not causing this issue.<br />

Yes I've tried this too, but it didn't work for me.<br />
Maybe I should try a different way to generate barcode in the report.<br />
Do you have any suggestions? <br />
Thanks,<br />
