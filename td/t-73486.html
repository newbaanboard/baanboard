<br />
I am working on a Session Extension. I made a Custom Form Command that will open up a customized session upon executing the command. However, the system will do this for every record selected at that moment, which is where I would like to change.<br />
<br />
I tried by putting the condition to check if the number.of.marks is 1 then execute it so that it will do only when 1 record is selected. The point is I need to put a message in else statement stating that the user selects more than 1 record when the situation happen.<br />
<br />
The problem comes now in the else statement because it will pop out multiple messages according to the number of selected records.<br />
<br />
Is there any workaround for this?<br />
<br />
I just want it to work on 1 record only and display message when no record or more than 1 records are selected.<br />
<br />
if number.of.marks = 1 then<br />
 . . .<br />
 { Execute something once }<br />
 . . .<br />
else<br />
  message(&quot;Select 1 record only.&quot;)   | &lt;--- Problem here when multiple records are selected<br />
endif</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is an Advanced Properties in the Properties section of the Custom Form Command. Inside it, there are multiple options available to configure.<br />
There is one option called &quot;Enable for record selection&quot;, which allows me to choose the selection type I want to use. For this case, I choose &quot;One Record Selected&quot;. Press OK, and then save/check-in/commit as one would do normally.<br />
<br />
Just like that, and it works now. The Custom Form Command will be disabled upon 0 or more than 1 selected records, and will be enabled only on 1 selected record, which is exactly what I am looking for.</div></div><hr />
