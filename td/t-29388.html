<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">2nd January 2007, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello - I've recently discovered a problem in our Baan system.  I've had two reports now that I've wanted to just add a couple of form fields to and when I go to maintain the report layout I see there are no form fields on them!  The skeleton of the report is there...the header label fields, the lines if there are any but there are no data fields.  I have no idea how widespread this problem is yet, as I have recently switched jobs, but I'm curious if anyone else has seen this?  I'm thinking they maybe switched servers at some point and when moving things to the new server maybe something go lost?  When the reports run they are fine - the objects compiled are still good.  But if I were to compile them they'd lose all the data.  I've needed to basically rebuild two reports now because of this.  Very, Very strange!<br />

When then the report is removed from the main language, the layout is gone in other language too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">15th January 2007, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">hello - I've now come across my fourth report with the problem of no layout fields.  I've had a user ask me just to change a column header.  When I go in to do it - there are no form fields in the layouts of the report!  I can't make this small 2 minute change without having to basically rebuild the report. I believe this is widespread now and not just a select few reports.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this before or know of way to fix it other than just throwing the form fields back on the report?  Luckily the input fields are still there and I can pretty much figure out which one goes where but man - this is a nightmare!<br />

And no I have not found a better solution.  You might want to start keeping a copy of the customizations - I export mine to a place in my home directory.  The minute I make any major changes I create a customization and start exporting it. Wait until you lose a company 0 in development with no backup(it was only dev says the admins).</div></div><hr />

This is really crazy and I'm afraid it is every single report from here on out.  I know I probably already mentioned this but I just started with a new company after working and customizing Baan from new implementation for about 8 yrs.  To come here and see this kind of thing is very frustrating.  Especially when i just want to change a column header :)<br />

Thanks for your response, you are always a great source and I'm always hoping to get replies from you.<br />

<br />
Did you check if the reports exist in other languages/VRCs?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">18th January 2007, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked in other VRCs but hadn't yet check languages because some of the reports are customized and I didn't figure they would've ever been created in another language.  One good thing is the report layouts and the label fields and lines are usually still there I just have to drop the input fields back onto the reports.  The input fields still exist - just aren't on the report.<br />
