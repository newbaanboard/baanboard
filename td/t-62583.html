<br />
I have inserted a new layout to the tdsls440301000 pack slip report but it prints in the wrong location.<br />
<br />
The layout I have inserted is Detail.45 but it prints before the Detail.40 layout and I cannot see why.<br />
<br />
Neither of these layouts are manipulated in the report script. The conditions against each layout are:-<br />
<br />
Detail.40 - line = 0 and not stand.desc<br />
Detail.45 - line = 1<br />
<br />
Can anybody please give me some pointers as to what may be causing this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
the print packing slip program first sets the &quot;line&quot; variable to 1 and sends its data to report. So all layouts that have line=1 as part of their condition are printed first if the rest of the condition applies. The program then sets the &quot;Line&quot; variable to 0 to print the line text. Now all the layouts with line=0 as part of their condition are considered for printing. Therfore in your case detail.45 with condition line=1 is printed before detail.40 with condition line=0.<br />
<br />
Simple really! Just Kidding. I still remember the sleeples nights I had as a rooky with no idea what &quot;line&quot; stood for.</div></div><hr />

I only do a bit of development here and there so I put my hands up to being a 'rooky'.<br />
<br />
I think I understand now. I have set 'line = 0' on my layout and it now prints where I would expect it to.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<br />
You have to be careful here: If the sales order line has no text, no line = 0 is ever sent and your layout will not be printed! If you must always print your layout then I woud move it to an after.field.tdsls045.pono layout with print condition = 1. Such a layout will always get printed after all the detail layouts are printed(text or no text)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">5th July 2012, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The extra layout needs to be after each so line as it prints specific text based on the signal code of the item.<br />
<br />
I have tested with a SO that has no line text and my new layout is printed as expected.</div></div><hr />
