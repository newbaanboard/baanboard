<br />
I'm having issues with totals on a pack slip layout I've created.<br />
<br />
I have a field called &quot;amount&quot; which is printed in the &quot;after.dico.5&quot; layout only if the pack slip is raised for a certain customer. This field is a total for each line on the pack slip.<br />
<br />
If I print one pack slip for this customer the total is correct. If I print a number of pack slips which may or may not be for this customer the amount field ends up being a total of ALL pack slips. I've tried resetting the amount field each time on the after.dico.5 layout but it's not working. I also have a detail layout which is specific to this customer which is where I'm calculating the amount. <br />
<br />
Can I please ask some of you clever Baan users to help me out with this? <br />

<br />
 If I understand your code correctly, you are incrementing the variable &quot;amount&quot; every time, regardless of the value of  cuno. Try putting the statement amount = amount + tdsls045.amnt within your  &quot;if&quot; statement so it will only be incremented for the desired condition.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

The other thought I had was - should you only get the tdsls040.cuno once in the detail layouts? It should be available in the other layouts from the first select.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for your replies.<br />
<br />
Putting the &quot;amount = amount + tdsls045.amnt&quot; within the &quot;if&quot; statement resolved my issue.<br />
<br />
The first select does make cuno available in the other detail layouts.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
