<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now what exactly are the records selected in the selectdo ?? Lets say the user enters a sales order number 10, it has 10 lines and each line has 2 deliveries.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
How many times does the selectdo statement get executed ? 1 time, 10 times or 20 times. ?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Is it dependent on the order by clause ? If I say order by tdsls040._index 1 then the selectdo is hit 1 time <br />
<br />
If I say order by tdsls041._index 1 then the selectdo is hit 10 times<br />
<br />
If I say order by tdsls045._index 1 then the selectdo is hit 20 times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Without know the tables but going by what you described the answer would be 20 times.  The order by only determines the sort on the records, so it would not effect the number of records.  A &quot;group by&quot; would effect the number of records.  This is assuming the only thing you have is an order and there are no other restrictions.<br />
<br />
So maybe I did not understand the question.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">here is the P code:<br />
<br />
select tdsls040 tdsls041 tdsls045<br />
from tdsls040 tdsls041 tdsls045<br />
where tdsls041.PlannedDeliveryDate between UserEnteredDate<br />
or tdsls045.DeliveryDate between UserEnteredDate<br />

              accumulate the Delivered and Order Qty's<br />
              section  is hit 20 times ???<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Basically I am trying to accumulate the ordered and delivered qtys for orders that either have their Delivered date (tdsls045) or Planned Delivered Date (tdsls041) within the range provided by the user on the Form (UserEnteredDate).<br />
<br />
This question came about because I got an Oracle error when the query ran regarding the Outer Join could not be performed. It compiled o.k<br />
<br />
Thanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks to me like you will need to different queries.  One based on delivery date and one based on planned delivery date. I am not sure if you could do it in one query.  At least not that I can see and not where you are using the &quot;or&quot;. Maybe a real expert knows how to do this, but I don't.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
The user does not provide the S.O number.<br />
<br />
thanks anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
use variable long ran.query that gets initiated between retry.point() and the select and gets incremented right after selectdo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, use the clause between only with combined fields, for non-combined use always the clause inrange.<br />
<br />
Your selection with the planned date of the tdpur041 and tdpur045 does not make sense. Are you sure about that? Try to check this information.<br />
<br />
I built a example using the planned date of tdpur041, the field tdpur041.ddtb. In my example, ddtb.f and ddtb.t are form variable, the date entered by the user. Try to use the select of tdpur045 separated, it's much better to read and understand the code and doesnt make much difference in performance.<br />
select   tdsls040.*, tdsls041.*<br />
from     tdsls040, tdsls041<br />
where  tdsls041._index3 inrange {:ddtb.f} and {:ddtb.t}<br />
and      tdsls041.orno refers to tdsls040<br />
selectdo<br />
        select tdsls045.*<br />
        from tdsls045<br />
        where tdsls045._index1 = {:tdsls041.orno, :tdsls041.pono}<br />
        selectdo<br />
             make.your.calc.here()<br />
