<br />
i have a problem by using different fonts in a report. <br />
<br />
All fonts were printed fine until an form-field with &quot;userfont-16&quot;. This form field still is printed fine but every report-row after this one is printed &quot;small&quot; and &quot;bold&quot; - except those, which have defined a different font then the font defined in the report properties.<br />
<br />
I think there is something wrong with the Unix printer-driver. Maybe in the escape sequence of pfont16?<br />
<br />
pfont16=\E(s1p48v0s3b4101T<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an idea?</div></div><hr />

Have you any other idea?</div></div><hr />

It keeps active until an 0b at another font resets it. For my experience you don't need it, because it only sets the whole font to bold. Better remove it from the font definition. If you need a single field in bold, you can set the bold flag. <br />
