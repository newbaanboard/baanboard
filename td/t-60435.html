               I have the same report layout in Development Environment and also in Production Environment. But when I run the report in Production the Total Field is getting printed in the desired area but when I run the same report session in Development Environment the Total is getting printed in Next Page. <br />
                 What might be the problem or root cause for this issue. Please help me to solve this issue.  <br />
                  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
    Let us know that which report you are printing, in which layout you are getting the total value and in that report any text data is there or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sameer.don</div><div class="date">26th April 2011, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Such things can happen if either you are using different devices to print report on development and to print on Production server.<br />
<br />
But, if you are using same device , you need to compare device settings and page lengths on both the servers.<br />
<br />
If there is difference in these to parameters, change settings of development server to make it identical as production server, and then print the report.</div></div><hr />

                           Thanks a lot for your quick response.<br />
The total is getting printed in &quot;After.Layout&quot;.<br />
I will compare the device settings in Development Server and also in Production Server then let you know about the problem.<br />
Once again thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />
