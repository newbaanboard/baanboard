<br />
You can create 2 variables say x and y. Now, in your script you can assign the amounts to these variables and show it on your report layout.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
extern domain tcncmp amt.comp.x,amt.comp.y<br />
<br />
amt.comp.x = 0.0<br />
amt.comp.y = 0.0<br />
<br />
select table_name.amount_field<br />
from table_name<br />
where table_name._compnr = :comp.x|Select data from company x<br />
... conditions<br />
selectdo<br />
    amt.comp.x = table_name.amount_field<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
select table_name.amount_field<br />
from table_name<br />
where table_name._compnr = :comp.y |Select data from company y<br />
... conditions<br />
selectdo<br />
    amt.comp.y = table_name.amount_field<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Now add amt.comp.x and amt.comp.y on your report layout.</div></div><hr />
