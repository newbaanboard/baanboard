Try this. Query using indexes are faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your great help. Now the query is very fast.<br />
<br />
As I am new to tools development, your explanations helped me to understand the usage of Index.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th April 2013, 23:43</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Not sure about SQL, but with Oracle using the _index4 tells the optimizer or the oracle query plan to use that specific index.  Not sure if the wording is correct.<br />
<br />
2. &gt;= :i.item.f means find all items greater than the value of i.item.f.    <br />
<br />
3. The inrange means to find all values between the item.f and item.t.  <br />
<br />
4. The tibom010._index1  questions means use index 1 and find the items matching the tdsls401.item.  In this case it only uses the item part of the index.<br />
<br />
There is a manual attached to the forum that I suggest you peruse for write baan sql code.  It might answer some of your questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">16th April 2013, 06:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
By your question I will assume that you have not yet got your tools training. But for your questions in addition to Mark's answers I would like to add a few lines.<br />
<br />
1. If you know, every table has some primary keys. So, indexes are nothing but the primary keys of a table. A primary key can be a group of fields or a single field of a particular table. The 1st primary key is index1 , 2nd primary key is index2 and likewise.<br />
So, when you say tablename._index1 it means 1st primary key of a table.<br />
<br />
2. &gt;= :i.item.f states that, you are querying for the items greater than or equal to the items in a table where i.item.f is a form field and not a table field.<br />
<br />
3. Inrange is used to get the values between two fields. Here, item.f and item.t<br />
<br />
4. tibom010._index1 is compared with tdsls401.item which will give you all the records of tibom010 table where tibom010.item field of tibom010 table are equal to tdsls401.item field in table tdsls401<br />
<br />
You can get Programmers Guide which comes with Standard LN installation media's else as Mark suggested use this :- Programmer's Manual (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp) of Baanboard.<br />
<br />
Keep practicing.<br />
<br />
NOTE:- Its not always possible to use index fields as we sometimes need to put the other table fields in the WHERE clause. But, whenever the field in WHERE clause is an index field, you should use in the above mentioned way as index based searching/querying is always a faster way to get the data.</div></div><hr />
