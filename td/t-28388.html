We set it to 10. If user open baan and wait 10 minutes without do anything on baan. Baan is automatically closed. Some our users are very clever. They open baan and directly open BAAN CALENDAR. They take baan calendar to back and hacked our Session time out settings. In this condition session time out property fails. May be solution can be prevent open calender but this is not good way. Some people needs it . IS that BUG for it ? <br />
<br />
Thanks All</div></div><hr />

I would complain to your management and let them take action on it. I don't know what the session name is they open, but you can maybe:<br />
- remove that object<br />
- test every 5 minutes what users are having open a calendar. If they have it open for 5 more minutes you stop that users.<br />
<br />
Anyway I think you deal with a cat and mouse game. If they notice their calender &quot;option&quot; is not working they will create a script that is doing the same. You better talk to these people, complain to their or your management or live with it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Because this is a bug for the system. People doesn't responsible for these things. They are right, they can use this option may be they aren't aware of this bug. But it effects badly our system. As a system expert we should fix this open points. This is our task .<br />
Second suggestion can be done but this is add on for our system. Anyway <br />
thanks again Dik. I am waiting other suggestions.</div></div><hr />
