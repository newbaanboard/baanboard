<br />
I have a Standard Print session , and on the form there are certain fields, one of the field has a Zoom which zooms to a standard session , now as soon as zoom action is triggered, it opens up display session having 7 forms and 3rd form becomes active.<br />
<br />
I know how to zoom to a session , now my doubt is how can i also set default form as 3 for sub-session ??<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
If u give the details, it may probably help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have the same question as &quot;learner&quot; and I saw your reply on &quot;special code for the entry section in the zoom section&quot;.  Could you please elaborate on that?<br />
<br />
I have a customized field that zooms to the &quot;Maintain Item Data&quot; session.  The customized field has been set to &quot;automatic zoom&quot;.  I would like it to zoom to &quot;form 4&quot; on the &quot;Maintain Item Data&quot; instead of the default form 1.<br />
<br />
How can I achieve this?<br />
<br />
Pls. let me know if you need any further info from me.<br />
<br />
I do not have access to Baan Source Code.<br />
<br />
Thanks, appreciate your input in advance,<br />

<br />
One workaround is to generate a display session on tiitm001 which uses the<br />
form 4 of tiitm0501s000 and display the item details. This will save u form <br />
design effort in customization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had earlier provided only the necessary fields for the user to update but I was hoping to  provide the standard Baan forms on the item data, if possible, for the user.   <br />
<br />
But, if it's not possible without the source code then my current arrangement has to remain, I guess.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your time and fast reply,<br />
