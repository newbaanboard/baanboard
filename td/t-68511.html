<br />
I have a report with max width set at 188 and report layout also spanning upto 188 characters.<br />
<br />
However, when I try to take a print on a US Letter landscape paper type (11 * 8.5) for Small characters (17.1 cpi), it only print 185 characters of the layout. Last 3 characters are falling out of page and never print. There is no border spacing in the report/print.<br />
<br />
There are no errors like 'Report doesn't fit **' etc. when I print, but still the whole report doesn't print.<br />
<br />
And this is happening with all of my printers. What could be the reason for the same?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jatin</div></div><hr />

You can double click on the report and check if the Margins defined are proper and not more.</div></div><hr />

If so:<br />
Print to bwprint with &quot;Preview&quot; checked.<br />
In BWPrint you get the file in display mode.<br />
Here you can try to change the font characteristics (right click on a text) and see if the text is complete in the file when you lower the character width (or make CPI higher).<br />
If the text is there, it is a problem with the printer<br />
If the text is not there, it is a problem with the report</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue seems to be with the device driver setup and somehow the driver is not reading the 17.1 cpi info correctly.<br />

Thanks,<br />

You can check it out.  For some reason I also seem to think we limit reports to 180 characters or so.  Not really sure anymore.</div></div><hr />
