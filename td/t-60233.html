<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">16th March 2011, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a problem where some variables created in a report script don't print correctly when the user prints the report to Display (using a Screen printer). They do work when the user uses any other type of printer. <br />
<br />
Report Script<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
     extern domain tcamnt rpt.total<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
      if [condition is met] then<br />
           rpt.total = rpt.total + detail.total<br />
      endif<br />
      lattr.print = false<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;rpt.total&quot; is then added to the &quot;after.report&quot; section. If printed to display, this shows $0. If printed elsewhere, it shows the correct amount. <br />
<br />
I usually try to avoid report scripts as much as I can. I admit I don't fully understand how to handle the variables here. I've tried various declaration methods, but nothing seems to work. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
R</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th March 2011, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">What you show should work - I recommend setting the total to 0 in the before.program section.  Second make sure that condition is set if going to screen or a printer.  Then just put it in debug mode with the two different devices to see what is not executing correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">16th March 2011, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. Your suggestion about before.program pointed me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
I forgot to show this in my sample, but I was resetting the variable in a &quot;before.field&quot; section. I had forgotten that this is fired whenever a new page is encountered. Our normal screen printer only shows a few lines, so new pages are encountered a lot. <br />
<br />
I just put &quot;if lattr.break then...endif&quot; around the code that resets the variables and it works. <br />
<br />
As I said, I usually try to avoid report scripts, so I forget these things.</div></div><hr />
