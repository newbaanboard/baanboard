<br />
I am facing problems in achieving the below request, baan Gurus please share your taught to make this happen.<br />
<br />
Actually, My session updates/insert the item master data into the company &quot;A&quot; (current company)., Now my new request is, this Update/insert should also happen on company &quot;X&quot;, say this company also exists under same package combination. <br />
I tried doing following step and stuck up with 606 reference errors.<br />
<br />
Once my update/insert is completed on company A, then call the new procedure to read this recent update/inserted data and update/insert into the new company &quot;X&quot;. but this is not working, it is throwing reference error.<br />
Item is not getting inserted into the company X.<br />
i used switch.to.company, compnr.check, table,_compnr = X . but all are throwing me the same reference error.. please guide me to proceed on this.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
if reference error is shown, first check if the references are existing in target company.<br />
<br />
With switch to company i'm using some checks.<br />
<br />
<br />
e.g.:<br />
<br />
function read.item.data.from.target.company()<br />
{<br />
<br />
	ret.switch = switch.to.company(target.comp)<br />
	<br />
	if ret.switch = 1 then<br />
	<br />
	select 	tiitm001.pris<br />
	from	tiitm001<br />
	where	tiitm001._index1 = {:artikel}<br />
	selectdo<br />
		pris.113 = tiitm001.pris<br />
		cups113 = tiitm001.cups<br />
	endselect<br />
		<br />
	endif	|ret.switch(target)<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
function analyse.ret.switch()<br />
{<br />
	if ret.switch = -1 then<br />
		message(&quot;Company not available !&quot;)<br />
		end()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
	if ret.switch = -2 then<br />
		message(&quot;Change Company not allowed !&quot;)<br />
		end()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
	if ret.switch = -3 then<br />
		message(&quot;Package Combination not identic !&quot;)<br />
		end()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
	if ret.switch = -4 then<br />
		message(&quot;First day of week not identical !&quot;)<br />
		end()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Of course, you must also check that the referenced tables and insert the records into table that THOSE tables refer to, but that should not be too many of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By your problem description - we could make only rough suggestions or guess work - i would still recommend with what mark_h has suggested .<br />
<br />
Post the code?  It should work.  I know I have done it in the past.<br />

<br />
The Code works on other tables (table which is not having reference to other table ) but not on ITEM master table.<br />
i agree to shah_bs, there is no data maintained in reference tables hence this error.<br />
Now i tried inserting reference tables first., this is working.. But i want to get the list of reference table to this item master and accordingly which table has to be inserted first.. Ordering of tables.<br />
<br />
as of now i am inserting, <br />
item group - tiitm002<br />
tcmcs023<br />
tcmcs011<br />
tcmcs018... etc<br />
<br />
at last i will insert tiitm001 record. But how do i find the exact list of referring table ? Item master has more than 150 fields. also, after finding the list of tables, how to i decide which table insertion has to be made first ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st August 2010, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not at the work computer right now, so I do not have the exact session code - but there is a Print Table Definition for Current Package VRC session that will print all the tables that tiitm001 refers to - choose the option that will print all the field information.<br />
<br />
As to the sequence of inserting the REFERRED TO table records, all the referred to table records need to be inserted first, obviously. In addition, if the REFERRED TO table is itself referring to another table, then THAT table's record need to be inserted before the REFERRED TO table record is inserted. And so on. <br />
<br />
I do not think the sequence of inserting the REFERRED TO table records matter, as long as they are all inserted before the Item Master record is inserted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">23rd August 2010, 04:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel compelled to add some (belated) thoughts.<br />
<br />
I do not know why you are making a copy of the item master - I am sure there are good business needs.<br />
<br />
But remember that the Item Master (at least in BAAN IV c3) has fields like On Hand, On Order, Allocated, Cumulative Issues, etc which can be different in different companies. So, you have to consider making these zero in the target company, assuming that you are going to do independent transactions in that company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is an business need, my company needs item master data alone to be in sync with two different companies. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">24th August 2010, 07:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally all reference tables records must be existing in other company . U can share reference tables  with another company if overall functionality is not hampered.<br />
<br />
Logical tables is ttaad4120m000 . <br />
<br />
U need also to take care off what shah_bs told .<br />
<br />
Regarding text copy , use text functions instead of just copy of text numbers.</div></div><hr />
