   Baan crashed and we dont have the recent object dump(that contains customized reports, menus etc). Is there anyway we could salvage the reports in this scenario? I need to salvage couple of reports that were created recently and there is no backup of it... With the current scenario is there any hope of retrieving those reports??<br />
<br />
Anyone??<br />

<br />
afaik most information concerning report layouts etc. is kept in some tools tables of company 000 (ttadv330-ttadv335)- so you could perhaps find something there, assuming that you have at least a backup of your tables.<br />
Report scripts however reside in $BSE/application/MODULE/rxxxxx - if you don't have a backup of these directories ... :-(<br />
<br />
But what the heck happened? &quot;Baan crashed&quot; meaning .....?<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">7th May 2007, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with norwim. If you dont have regular backup of baan applicaiton directory, I am sorry there is no chance to recover your reports and menu.May be you can get your some scripts from Baan/tmp folder on your client. Baan editor opens your scripts on that folder. You may get something from this. But recover is not possible for your case. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">7th May 2007, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm,<br />
<br />
how can you agree with me and state something completely different?<br />
I was pointing out that WITHOUT a backup of $BSE an existing backup of the company 000 tables however will contain information about the layout, the fields used etc. - only report scripts will be lost in this case. If there is no backup of $BSE/application, I wouldn't expect $BSE_TMP to have been saved.<br />
 <br />
At least we agreed on wishing sukesh good luck :-)<br />

So let me just quote what i wrote in that thread..<br />
<br />
&quot;On restarting our Baan server after it hung while creating sequential dump of the live company, the baan database was marked suspect. The drive where the mdf file is on has an excess of 19GB free while the drive where the backup file(7Gb) is being created has almost 85gb free and so it wasnt due to disk space problem..I rememeber once seeing a Suspect Database case on Baanboard but i couldnt find it anymore......&quot; <br />
....and so it goes..<br />
<br />
Dbcc Checkdb gave out a lot of allocation and consistency errors on some of the tables..and the best way forward was to retrieve the sequential dump of a day earlier. Unfortunately this doesnt create a dump of the objects which we had changed recently...<br />
The server is up and running. SQL Server is working. Operating system is fine...Just one database got corrupted, if i could safely assume so...<br />
<br />
Now that you know the story...anything i could do to retrieve the reports?<br />
I tried copying and pasting objects of a particular report starting oxxxx and uxxxx(both in objects folder) and rxxxx (in report folder) to a newly created report of the same name and package. However on compiling those objects were overwritten and so i dont think copying and pasting would work...<br />

<br />
I read your posting about the crashed DB, but not being familiar with microsoft sql DB, I couldn't give any helpful tip.<br />
<br />
You said that you recreated your data using sequential files one day old.<br />
What about company 000? Sounds like you used an older version to rebuild this. If your modifaction of the reports weren't done  exactly on the day missing, everything should be fine.<br />
<br />
Report name, layout, fields etc. should be found in company 000 in the tables mentioned above. <br />
<br />
What is the status of a &quot;missing&quot; report? Can you access it with &quot;Maintain reports&quot; or doesn't it show up there? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">7th May 2007, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally we would have taken the sequential dump, along with the toolsdata(ttcon61export) and object dump(ttiex1280m000). With this if we reinstall the application server, i could have my live co. up and running. The only minus point is that someone has to create and link database users with the Baan user. This time around we were caught offguard when the object dump that we had was older.<br />
<br />
We restored the data on a different server running one of our sister companies data..Package combination of both the co were different and so the restoration went well with the only drawback that couple of reports were not reflecting the recent changes. The reports are accessible but they are old.. Some of the standard reports were customized to suit our needs and there has been some recent customization done...<br />
<br />
I hope the picture is clear...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">7th May 2007, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I think I understood now.<br />
I only use object dumps to transport SW from one system to another, I don't think I ever saw this used for backup purposes. To get up running quickly after a crash you only need a backup of company 000 plus the $BSE plus the tables of your other companies. For the future I would definetly advise you to work on your backup strategy, ttcon61export and ttiex1280m000 are used to port systems.<br />
I hope that you haven't erased the defective DB. The data you need is contained in the tools tables describing reports. If you can't start the DB so that you can create seq. dumps of these tables I am afraid your reports have gone. <br />
Normaly there should be a way to at least create sequential dumps of single tables in ms sql .... the DB is marked suspect, not corrupt - what would be the reason of having different states if you can't access the whole DB anyway.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

   We havent done anything to the server where the Baan database crashed. We have sequential dump of the live company as well as 000. <br />
Now could you please let me know the steps in a sequential order to bring back the live company by using the 000 sequential dump and live co dump.<br />
<br />
Right now we are on SP 19 and using bck(AFS). The only doubt i have after reading your post is do we copy the entire BSE Folder back into the new installation as it is after we installed baan and restored both the 000 and live co dumps?<br />
<br />
If yes, wont there be problems with certain services like Licensing, shared memory etc?<br />
<br />
The database right now is in emergency mode and therefore i can access the tables using sql enterprise manager. <br />
<br />

<br />
please bear in mind that I hardly worked on windows servers. <br />
But as your live server is offline now anyway, I would try to set this one up again. To achieve this, you only have to rebuild the ms sql database with the sequential dumps. $BSE should be ok anyway. <br />
1) Make sure that you can go back to the present situation by backing up defective live system.<br />
2) Use ms sql tools to drop all tables so that DB is not marked suspect or corrupt any longer.<br />
3) use bdbpost to read in the sequential dump(s) of company 000<br />
You should now be able to log in, all users, printers etc. and your beloved reports should be there - but of course no data in other companies.<br />
4) when work is done on the other server and users have gone home, create seq. dump of live data (NOT company 000), read these into original system and tomorrow everything should be back to normal. (Run a create table for all companies to create empty tables where necessary)<br />

  A suspect database doesnt show any tables inside it and hence wont allow you to drop any tables or any object inside it. Tried this in emergency mode and it rejected the drop command citing the database to be read-only and so no editing or deleting. We have decided to go ahead with a different approach to retrieve our reports and objects. The plan is..<br />
1) Reinstall Baan from scratch<br />
2) Apply service packs till the same level as the old installation before it crashed.<br />
3) Restore sequential dump of 000<br />
4) Overwrite the application folder in BSE with the old application folder...<br />
<br />
Since the 000 company would have the last minute details of the objects, it would be complimented by the old application folder, enough to let us export the objects...That is the goal<br />
<br />
Will this work? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">8th May 2007, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sukesh,<br />
<br />
okay, so you can't use the DB any more.<br />
<br />
Can you simply set up the DB? Absolutely no need to install Baan, let alone servicepacks ---- you have all this. What you lack ist the MS-SQL instance.<br />
If you can reinstall this (with the correct name, users and passwords), then you don't need to bother about the rest. Reloading the 000 data will be sufficient then. (Plus the other companies then, of course)<br />
If you are already considering to reinstall Baan, you have a manual or guideline for this .... have a look at it and only do the steps to install the DB.<br />
<br />
Don't have the document here and it's a very long time since i installed a M$ system - but I hope you get my idea<br />
<br />
thumbs up!<br />

Perhaps you are referring to the old installation? In my last post i was talking about a fresh installation(after formatting and setting up the OS)..<br />

<br />
sure,  I was refering to my suggestion to repair the (now) idle live system, mainly because the $BSE is already there and you save a lot of time this way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">8th May 2007, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">As of yesterday evening, the installation that had problems was reformatted and a fresh copy of Baan installed. At the time of writing this, the service packs 1-18 batch installer program is running after which SP 19 will be installed. <br />
The next step i could decide whether i test with restoring the 000 company and overwriting the current application(//BSE/Application) folder with its older counterpart (in an effort to export the object dump) <br />
or <br />
Restore the production company data along with the import object(older copy) and toolsdata and do the necessary customization of the report all over again.<br />
<br />
I am not sure whether the first step would work because i have never tried it even if theoretically it should work...If it doesnt work, then i would have to re-do the entire installation process all over again and then go with the second option...<br />
<br />
What do you think??<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">8th May 2007, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Shame really -<br />
<br />
what I would do now was to backup the system when all service packs have been installed - and then copy $BSE and bdbpost company 000. <br />
If this goes wrong for any reason (which I doubt), you only have to reload the backup in order to proceed the other way instead of installing yet again.<br />
<br />
Still: thumbs up<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">9th May 2007, 09:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Time was really a factor and so i chose the second option without trying the first. If by any chance anything goes wrong after the installation or even during the next few weeks, i would have to face the users as wells as some of the peers wrath(been very understanding this week...dont want to push it)...so took the tried and tested route...<br />
<br />
Within today and by tomorrow afternoon i would have to bring up the server to its previous stage minus the data(production co data). This will inlude the creation of users both on the server and in the database and then linking them, importing of the objects and tools data and some other baan related checks. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input. Later on i would really like to try the procedure you suggested. If it works, it would really save a lot of time...<br />

since the crash happened more than a week ago, I can understand that you don't want to risk any more delay. Wishing you all the luck that your box will be up and good soon.<br />
