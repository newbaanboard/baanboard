<br />
I am seeing some strange thing with my multi-occurnce maintain session, I am using baan IV b2, I have to make sure sure that if there are any changes made on 3rd and 4th field then i have to make to 5th field to yes. snapshot of the session attached, I have written code for this in when.field.changes, but when we use &quot;Extend field&quot; options on this field, only sometimes the when.field.change get triggered and update the 5th field to yes.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me why is it happening?<br />
<br />
below is the field validation on one email field<br />
<br />
field.iscom118.emi1:<br />
before.input:<br />
	old.email1 = iscom118.emi1<br />
	<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
	if strip$(old.email1) &lt;&gt; strip$(iscom118.emi1) then<br />
		iscom118.chpd = tcyesno.yes<br />
		display(&quot;iscom118.chpd&quot;)<br />
	else<br />
		iscom118.chpd = tcyesno.no<br />
		display(&quot;iscom118.chpd&quot;)<br />
	endif<br />
	<br />
check.input:<br />
	if not before.update.check and strip$(iscom118.emi1) &lt;&gt; strip$(old.email1) then<br />
		iscom118.chpd = tcyesno.yes<br />
		display(&quot;iscom118.chpd&quot;)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Someone can correct me if I am wrong, but the when.field.changes should only get activated when something changes in the field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sameer.don</div><div class="date">23rd June 2011, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;when.field.change&quot; will be triggered every time the value input in the field differes from its original value (i.e. value before input)<br />
<br />
Hence in your code  there is no use of statement:<br />
    if strip$(old.email1) &lt;&gt; strip$(iscom118.emi1) then<br />
<br />
Every time you reach the even of when.field.change, this statement will always be true.<br />
<br />
I think this code will never change the value of field 5 to &quot;NO&quot;<br />
Either try using the same code (written in when.field.change) in after.input section,<br />
OR<br />
Get the value of variable old.email1 from table:<br />
<br />
field.iscom118.emi1:<br />
before.input:<br />
       select iscom118.emi1:old.email1<br />
       from   iscom118<br />
       where ...&lt;compare index1&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this might help you.</div></div><hr />

I was asking about the extend field at multi-occurrence session, only when we use extend sometimes the flag get changed to Yes. i have attached the snapshot of extend field options. have a look.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your input, your point is right i have corrected it now. I wanted to know the is there any restrictions on the usage of Extend field in the Multi occurrence maintain session.</div></div><hr />

Have to do some more poking around.  I did notice on the sessions I have looked at they all have this enabled.  My first thought is if you make a change in the field make sure you hit the tab key.</div></div><hr />

Redundant check in when.field.changes is already removed. Following can be  situations .<br />
1. Field order could be wrong . Field being changed (iscom118.chpd) should be subseqent to input field iscom118.emi1 . <br />
<br />
2. before input/display of iscom118.chpd has some other code changing it or some other code in overall code changes it to other or program never reaches the field being changed.e.g User changes the record occurrence by up/down arrow key immediately after field change . <br />
<br />
3. Ideally  changes to other field in current record should be done through a function in a pattern like do.occ(actual.occ,functionname) . This w</div></div><hr />
