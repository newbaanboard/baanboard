<br />
Currently we have a single text group &quot;text&quot; that is used.<br />
Our requirement is that, for the General Item data(tcibd0501m000), we want to give only the ability to read the Item text but not modify it.<br />
However the user will have write access to other fields of tcibd001(item Master).<br />
<br />
Is this possible to do?<br />
<br />
thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

Hello,<br />
define the rights for that textgroup for the user(s) to read/only.<br />
<br />

Since they only have one text group, what if this same user needs access to something like purchasing text?  Or maybe abby13 meant only one text group for this table - in which your suggestion would work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok Mark,<br />
your right, if only one text group is present for all texts.<br />
So the table field authorisation might work.<br />

Thanks Mark and Bernd for the replies.<br />
<br />
We have tried table field authorization.<br />
we created a new role and subrole and in that sub role we have read authorization for tcibd001.txta<br />
but that does not seem to work. are there any further steps required?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Hello abby13,<br />
seems the proper way is to define a new textgroup (e.g. itemtext) and write a updatesession (if DEV is available).<br />
<br />
1.) define a new textgroup<br />
2.) Search textnumbers in tcibd001 in field tcibd001.txta<br />
3.) Search the text found text in texttable<br />
4.) Update textgroupfield in texttable.<br />
5.) Set textgroupauthorization for users<br />
<br />
Hope, this will give you a idea to solve youre problem.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
