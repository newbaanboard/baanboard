<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">12th February 2003, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for a way to know when financial and logistical sessions/process are beign executed to tell how long they run an if they completed prior to our back up going off each night.  Have some unexplainable items that I think are occuring due to this problem.  I have asked our IT dept about this and they are not able to answer my question.  I am not a tools person since I work in the accounting department my understanding of the tools area is limited.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Doug</div></div><hr />

there are different ways to monitor / review / interrupt.<br />
<br />
It may be a good idea to set up the process asa job and review time of the job execution over a period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example the GRINYA sessions.  We want to run the selection session first then run the Financial report and then the the checklist.  The financial report is based off of the selection interim table.<br />
<br />
These are in the A/P module.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I understood your question correctly, you are looking for a way to record the programs running on your computer at a certain time. You are especially interested in the question whether certain Baan programs terminated before the backup was started.<br />
<br />
If your server is a Unix-System, this is no problem.<br />
Even on a Windows-Server this should be possible.<br />
<br />
Note, however, that the &quot;monitoring&quot; I have in mind here is far away from exact measuring, it could tell you the programs running in 10 min intervals or so - no use for tuning or suchlike.<br />
But to answer the question whether a baan-program terminated within such an interval isn't difficult at all.<br />
<br />
One has to <br />
a) identify bshell processes running<br />
b) grep and evaluate their &quot;bshcmd6.x&quot;-output<br />

<br />
Have your IT department turn History on for the users that normally run the sessions.  This will create an entry in the file<br />
called TIME.HIS showing every session ran by these users at what date/time started and ended.   I believe you company's IT department should know what to do and look at.  I am on a Unix box here, so I am not sure if the file's location is the same for NT.<br />
On our box it is at ${BSE}/lib/TIME.HIS<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

Our BaaN IV is on Windows 2k Server. Does Time.his not get populated in Win server? We have an empty file in $BSE/lib directory.<br />
How to we set to start populating it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th May 2004, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">To start populating history on a user, go to maintain user and miscellaneous tab.  There should be a check box for history.  Set this and do a convert to run time.  The user will probably need to logout and back in to get this to take effect.  Then this should start populating the TIME.HIS file.  Never tried this myself.<br />
