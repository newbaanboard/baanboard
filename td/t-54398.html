<br />
I think that somebody could help me...I have I report in my Baan V installation, I have done a dump and i have installed it in my Baan LN installation, the session that uses this report works ok and the report is shown ok. I have seen in the table ttadv330 and the report is there but the problem is that in the session Reports ( ttadv3530m000 ) I canÂ´t see the report...Why is it happenning? Am I doing something wrong? Is this a problem if I want to generate a dump in LN to distribute it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

Then when I navigate or refresh, the report list gets updated. Not sure if yours is the same issue.</div></div><hr />

there will be 2 files in the report folder one starting with o and other with u.<br />
may be on the user interface side.. There is some issues that most of us <br />
are facing in viewing the report..</div></div><hr />
