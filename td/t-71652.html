Looking for someone to nudge me in the right direction here.<br />
<br />
Is LN capable of printing detail layouts horizontally? If so, what resources are available where I can look up how to set this up?<br />
<br />
Thanks much for any help!<br />

<br />
lattr.multicol R/W Indicates whether or not multiple columns are used when more than one layout fits on a line. Possible values are:<br />
<br />
MULTICOL_NONE    <br />
<br />
Normal output; no columns are used.<br />
<br />
MULTICOL_ORDER_HORIZONTAL <br />
<br />
Output is arranged in multiple columns, ordered horizontally. For example:<br />
<br />
rec_1    rec_2    rec_3<br />
<br />
rec_4    rec_5    rec_6<br />
<br />
MULTICOL_ORDER_VERTICAL<br />
<br />
Output is arranged in multiple columns, ordered vertically (per page). For example:<br />
<br />
rec_1    rec_3    rec_5<br />
<br />
rec_2    rec_4    rec_6<br />
 <br />

<br />
In my report layouts there is an option for &quot;Horizontal order&quot;, which I selected and re-compiled, but it made no difference. I resized the layout to be small enough that it could potentially repeat horizontally, but it doesn't seem to be making a difference. Is there another setting that has to be used in conjunction with this one to make horizontal order work?<br />
<br />

Made some progress. I actually got it to print the layouts horizontally at one point. However, after making some tweaks the position of the fields in the layout itself now it won't print. When running the report it just gets stuck on &quot;Processing&quot; and the PDF is never produced. No matter what I change I can't get it to print out again.<br />
<br />
Now, if I swap over to &quot;Vertical order&quot; then it *does* work again. Anyone have any idea why that would be the case? It works on vertical order, but not horizontal order?</div></div><hr />
