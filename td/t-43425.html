What is the significant of Additional Files, while creating a PATCH and PMC? May I use Additional Files feature (components) to bundle LN HELP files (XML document) in a solution? If LN HELP files get updated due to a fix then how the distribution of HELP files (along with the distribution of  solution) are been handled?<br />
<br />
I have noticed that all files that you want to use in Additional Files, should be prefixed by package and Module name, Any specific reason?<br />

Additional File<br />
A generic component, such as an XML schema file, a GIF image, and so on. From SSA ERP 6.0a on, additional files are stored in a specific package, module, and package VRC.<br />
<br />
Yes you can use Additional Files in a PMC solution, patch, dump etc. They are based on package-module-VRC combination.<br />
<br />
Application help is now handled with the Webtop's webhelp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">25th October 2007, 09:22</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Additional Files&quot; are software components, just like sessions or messages. You can add, modify, delete them with ttadv2570m000. You can use them to transfer files from one environment to another by PMC. The steps are then:<br />
1. Create an additional file. Use the import functionality of the session mentioned above to register your file as additional file. You have to provide a package and module.<br />
2. Link the additional file to a PMC solution.<br />
3. Export the solution.<br />
4. Scan and install the solution in the other environment.<br />
Now you have the file in the other environment, but maybe not with the name and in the directory where you want to have it. It is in $BSE/application/&lt;package&gt;&lt;VRC&gt;/b&lt;package&gt;&lt;module&gt;/b&lt;module&gt;&lt;yourfilename&gt;. You have to write some scripting yourself to get the file where you want to have it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your input. <br />
I had tried this and had found that you will have to follow the naming convention like prefix with package and module in file, hence had post this question. <br />
<br />
In such a case, if I am putting an XML help file (say purchaseorder.xml) then it doesn't get accepted in Additional files. Hence, I couldn't see much of the use of the same to send LN Help with the same.<br />
<br />
The another Q i had was, HOW LN HELP gets distributed along with the solution?<br />

If you are referring to the Application help it should be handled via Webtop.<br />
You can add Text to the PMC Solution and that will be automatically included in the pmc dump file and available in the target system after you import it.</div></div><hr />
