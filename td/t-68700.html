<br />
currently we have a standard session whina1210m000, which performs the inventory valuation and gives us a report by warehouse and Item code. we have a requirement to print the report warehouse/Item/ Lot wise.<br />
<br />
Can any body advise and give some idea, how can I get the report by Lot.<br />
The standard DLL used is whinadll1210. The Lot range will be given in session form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th March 2016, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the lot on the report?  If so then (at least in 4c4) I can set the sort fields on the report to warehouse, item, then lot.  Now if lot is not on the report that is a whole different story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For print the report warehouse/Item/ Lot wise, You need to do certain things<br />
<br />
1) You need to copy the Standard Script to your Local VRC. Copy the standard Report to a different name and to your local VRC.<br />
2) Is the Lot Number currently getting printed on the Standard Report<br />
If No<br />
a) you need to select the Lot Number in the query for Report field selection in the 4GL program script<br />
b) Declare the Lot Number as an extern variable <br />
c) In the specified report you need to declare Lot number as an Input field <br />
d) And put a sort option on Lot Number (Either Ascending or Descending, depending on what you want)<br />
<br />
If Yes<br />
a)Just add the sort filter to the Lot Number in the Report Input field Session. Add ascending or Descending according to your choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanhp</div><div class="date">8th March 2016, 07:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a Lot Ajesh. for your quick reply and valuable time for posting your suggestions. The bottle neck is where to put the Lot in the query, the standard DLL used has 20000 lines of code. Its very difficult to find the point where to add this query for lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">8th March 2016, 07:16</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do the following<br />
<br />
1) Copy the standard Script/Dll to your local VRC, If Possible<br />
2) Put everything on Debug<br />
3) Check for the clues like rprt_send, or brp.ready in the code<br />
4) Ascertain that the Report field variables have been indeed sent through the DLL. Once that is done then<br />
5) Put the Lot number field in that particular selection.<br />
<br />

I always loved Debugging. ;)</div></div><hr />

I know since we do not have source code I posted one, but I think Gunther(would have to search) posted a better solution in the Code and Utilities forum.</div></div><hr />
