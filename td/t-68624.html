<br />
Does any one suggest how can we save the reports generated by JOB sessions to a FTP folder.<br />
<br />
JOB session accepts device/output format parameter, but does not have any field for providing location to save Output File to FTP folder.<br />
<br />
Please Suggest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th February 2016, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">On UNIX we save the reports using the output file name with a device of ASCIF.  This puts the file where we want it.  Now on some special home grown sessions we put them in a directory that is shared across servers. Not sure if that is what you are looking for or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
some ques based on comment:<br />
<br />
Where does the ASCIF saves file?<br />
What is the output file extension?<br />
Where can we define the path to save file?<br />
What is the difference between ASCIF and ASCIT?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th February 2016, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) When I run a report and give it the ascif device name, I then put the full path in the output file.  So for example if I just put in a file name it will save it in my unix home directory.  Or I can put in the full path like /apps/baan4/report/mark_h and it will save it that directory.<br />
(2) I can give it any extension I want - but it will be just a plain text file.  So for above I could use mark_h.txt.  Typically we do not give them extensions since we are using unix for our application dir.<br />
(3) On the device data when you pick a device there is a box below for the output file.  That is where you give the path and file name.<br />
(4) If you system is setup the same as ours - then ascif creates a new file for the output file and ascit will append to the output file if it exists, otherwise ascit will create the file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This info was real helpful, Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
A last que: <br />
<br />
How we define Output path if we provide/execute report in job session using brp.open(&quot;report&quot;, &quot;device&quot;, 0)? (0 does not trigger device window)<br />
<br />
M trying my way, if you knows will be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all Info.:)</div></div><hr />

I just would like to point out a problem. Your baan server is a high-available system, right? So, if you write to files on your local discs, all is fine. If you write to NFS Shares and so on, batch processing might run into various problems some day. Keep that in mind!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">19th February 2016, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to define the output path you need to create a Device in Device Data with Device type as Append to File or Rewrite File and then you need to define the specified path in the Device Data. As Mark suggested you can fill the &quot;device&quot; as &quot;ASCIF&quot; in the script and then the path specified in the ASCIF will contain the file after printing.<br />
<br />
You may also want to copy the ASCIF into a new Device and define the path that you require so that after printing it will go to that specified path.</div></div><hr />

A big LOL on me :p, did checked spooling functions/variables multiple times, but did not checked &quot;spool.fileout&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was looking for changing output path runtime and this helped me.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot Mark, Ajesh, Gunther.<br />
