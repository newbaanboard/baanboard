      I need help regarding the session tdpur4120m000 (Maintain Receipt). Our Implementation partner has added additional form (form 3) in this session. While maintaining a receipt, when we goto zoom of form 3 and select zoom from special menu, it displays some additional sessions. I am attaching the screen dump for the reference.<br />
<br />
      Can anybody guide me, on how it was done. If i get info on how i can add my own session to zoom list of particular session, I will be very greatfull to all of you.<br />
<br />
Thanking in advance,<br />

There are a couple of ways this can be done.  First go to that form - then look at the choice field on the form.  It should have zoom to menu and it may have the menu name also.  Then all you have to do is goto the menu name and add your session.  IF it does not have the name then you will need to look in the code for the name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am facing a discrepancy while zooming from session tdpur4120m000 - form 1 - special ,in two companies(i.e 110 &amp; 140) . The discrepancy is as below,<br />
<br />
In company 110 the zoom to menu is showing some sessions where as in company 140 it is showing completely different sessions.<br />
<br />
The choice field on the form. is having zoom to menu but it does not have any menu name name.<br />
 <br />
Since tdpur4120m000 is a standard session, I can not access the script where the menu name might have been specified.<br />
<br />
Pl. guide me to solve the above issue wherein the complete menu (available to company 110) can be made available to company 140.<br />
<br />
Your prompt reply will be highly appreciated.<br />

(1) Validate both companies are set-up the same.<br />
(2) Validate the SAME OBJECTS for the session are the same in both companies.<br />
(3) Make sure you are receiving the same type of data.  I am not sure if the session handles menus based off of the type of purchase order (subcontract, MRO, etc.)<br />
(4) Find the menu that is being activate - you can use the print where used on some of the session in the zoom.  Displaying which menus they are in.<br />
(5) Compare the menus to each session.  If the menus line up then it is probably sometype of setup issue.   At that point there might not be anything to do but contact baan.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />
