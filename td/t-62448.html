 I am new to this, so please have patience. I am trying to enable the attachment option from the edit menu. It is available on every session.<br />
I am trying to attach files for difrent lines in a list window session.<br />
<br />
I have searched the forum but I did not find anything that worked for me. I tried with ODM but I did not understand how that works. I followed the steps from this post http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=57019 but the button is still disabled.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
