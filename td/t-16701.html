<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bvallepalli</div><div class="date">4th October 2004, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">When I run my compose/post/print of Invoices, posting takes too much of time. For instance, if I run a billing request with 5 invoices, it takes almost 6 minutes just to post the invoices, which is not acceptable for month end invoicing. I ran a trace and found out that 6/7 th of total time is consumed by ottstp_stddll and the function call that uses most of the CPU time is stdlib.bms.long. <br />
<br />
I am wondering what this function has to do? Is this related to display of messages (progress) etc? We are on Baan 5.c, SP10 with SQL data base. This happens only in our Italian localization VRC. I have no customizations to any of the dlls/scripts.<br />
<br />
I even tried with compression on/off (while posting) and I got the same results.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any inputs/leads.</div></div><hr />
