<br />
We are creating a customized session (In BaaN V) which is responsible to reduce Order quantity from session cprrp1110s000 (Planned Order Details). After updating the quantity usin dal we are calling a dll cprmpdll6100.plan.one.order(...) to re-plan the order. This dll is taking too long time to re-plan an order. We need to to re-plan at least 2500 order on daily basis &amp; we have a very little time frame to run our session in job mode.<br />
We are planning to write our own function instead of calling dll cprmpdll6100. Since we are just updating the order quantity in planned production order, my query is..<br />
&quot;In order to update planned production order quantity, what are all the tables that we need to update?&quot;<br />
<br />
As per my current analysis we need to update below tables for sure...<br />
<br />
Table               Description<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
cprrp100	    Planned Orders<br />
cprrp110	    Planned Order Lines 	 	 <br />
cprrp010	    Planned Inventory Movements by Item<br />
<br />
Are there any other tables that we need to update?<br />
<br />
Quick reply would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
