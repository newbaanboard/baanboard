<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertP</div><div class="date">19th June 2012, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">It used to be fairly easy to disable forms.  Very important - by that I mean, disable access to the form (by grey out of it's text, so really, disabling it)<br />
<br />
So, what I'm trying to do is enable/disable form 2 (group 2) depending on whether user has selected a record that meets certain requirements.  Naturally home base is form 1 (group 1)<br />
<br />
How is this possible using DFE?<br />
<br />
At the moment I've worked around it in  &quot;before.group&quot; of form 2 (group2):<br />
if  not blaa.blaa then<br />
      to.group(1)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
I'd much rather see the form disabled altogther. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Never done it myself and I think the only time I did something like this I used the to.form command like you did.  Of course your using 5 or LN so there might be other commands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertP</div><div class="date">20th June 2012, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark, but the workaround is messy.  Takes a second or 2 for the process to finish.  I recall it being s easy to disable/enable forms &quot;in the good old days&quot;<br />
<br />
Why in your opinion have all these options been removed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th June 2012, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know if the options have been removed - I only know the to.form method.  I do wonder though if you could disable commands to go to the next form or group. Something like next.frm, prev.frm, etc - disable those until the right conditions are met. Not sure of the disable.commands since it is not in 4c4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">27th June 2012, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Use 'disable.group' to make a form (by group) read only or disabled.  Two arguments, first is the group, second (optional) is the mode (&quot;DISABLE&quot; or &quot;READONLY&quot;).  You can get the group associated with the form from the DFE.  You may have to disable multiple groups if on a single form. <br />
<br />
You can also use 'group.invisible' to competely hide the group, including labels, fields, and sub-groups.  It has a single argument for the group number.  This one isn't as flexible as the 'disable group' since it must be called early in the session (before.program or after.form.read).<br />
<br />
You can enable a disabled group by calling 'enable.group'.</div></div><hr />
