<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alf@melmac</div><div class="date">3rd April 2008, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi *ALL,<br />
<br />
we have a Baan5.0c environment with lang 1-4 installed. Actually we need to add reports in other languages like swedish (9), norwegian (8) and hungary (m). Works okay and adding labels and messages in these languages was stupid, but at the end okay athe reports were okay. Users now use such reports and all is working well.<br />
But in log.bshell I found hundreds messages like:<br />
<br />
2008-04-03[18:17:08(UTC-01:00)]:E:bsp: Errno 0 bdb_errno 111 (No record found)<br />
2008-04-03[18:17:08(UTC-01:00)]:E:bsp: Log_mesg: Language 9 error in domain 't<br />
taad.monm'<br />
<br />
They have no impact, but pollute the log.bshell totally.<br />
<br />
Of course I thought to add these manually in the dtt.pd file, but a Create RTDD for Tools will redo my changes in the Runtime-file right away.<br />
So: Is there any domain-table-dumps for that langauges for Baan5.0c available that I can add ? <br />
Or you in general have a better idea to come over (but do not tell me please to make a basic-installation in these langauges ...)<br />
<br />
Thanks for a hint. Not a big issue, but maybe someone has a solution out of the box.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
alf; actually at melmac´s 2nd home: Hisings Backa (Gothenburg) - Sweden</div></div><hr />

<br />
the error messages are coming because some enum descriptions are missing for the new language<br />
you can add these in table ttadv402 via general table maintenance. Copy from language 2 to the target language. ttaad.monm are the month name, there is also the day name and the short version of these two. They are used by the print date/time<br />
<br />

<br />
I also had that problem some time ago. My solution was a workaround, but who cares? I edited the file $BSE/tools/dd/dtt.pd/dttp.pd. Its an ASCII file that is read when you login. When you search for ttaad.danm, you might see<br />
[code]<br />
:NAME:ttaad.danm<br />
:TYPE:e1234<br />
:BSET:7<br />
:001sunday~Zondag~Sunday~Sonntag~Dimanche<br />
...<br />
[code]<br />
So, obviously the line TYPE means we have languages 1-4, and the line 001 meany the enum sunday is Zondag in language 1, Sunday in language 2 and so on.<br />
<br />
What I did: change TYPE to e.g. e12345 to add a new language 5, and change lines 001 to 007; add a tilde and then the day name in that language.<br />
<br />
Save the file, login to baan, should be okay now (for this domain; you get the idea).<br />
<br />
But keep in mind, that the solution of pconde normally is better, but I strongly believe that you need a convert to runtime after writing to the database so that you generate the above file.<br />

There is a session for copying language dependent SW component. So, you can use this session for copying missing components from english to one of languages and after that create RTDD. If you copied tools domain you have to run Create RTDD for tools and check field &quot;Also dump data definitions&quot;. Of course be carefull when running RTDD, users must leave application before you start this session</div></div><hr />

did you logoff / logon to baan (because the data dictionary must be read again)? I think your file looks okay!<br />

<br />
I m facing the same problem too. I m getting a domain error msg &quot;Language s error in domain 'tdsls.hdst'. But i could not find this domain in $BSE/tools/dd/dtt.pd/dtt.pd file and one more thing is that my system only have language type 2 but why the error msg showed language s? :confused:<br />
My event viewer was full of this type of error.<br />
<br />
Help......:(<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can find this domain in file $BSE/../dict/ddpack_comb/dtd.pd/dtd.pd file.<br />
<br />
Check your domains, do you have this domain in any language (I think this domain is not standard domain)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">layswan</div><div class="date">24th August 2011, 11:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Ya, u r right that i could find the dtd.pd file from the server and the tdsls.hdst domain already exist in the file as below<br />
D<br />
:NAME:tdsls.hdst<br />
:TYPE:e2<br />
:BSET:10<br />
:002suspended~Suspended<br />
:005free~Free<br />

:040blocked~Blocked<br />
:045released~Released<br />
:050not.applicable~Not Applicable<br />
:PLEN:25<br />
D<br />
<br />
But still have the same error msg. :confused:<br />
<br />
I already check the domain, it is a standard domain but use in customization session and my system only have one type of language that is type 2 (English).<br />
<br />
Please refer to the attachment for the standard domain and language type.<br />
<br />
Please advice! :(<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">24th August 2011, 12:11</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I thought that you are talking about Baan IV (add ERP LN to your profile) and in Baan IV this domain is not standard.<br />
You have to check your session, why this session expects domain in non-existing language.<br />
As workaround you can define s language, but better idea is to check customized session.</div></div><hr />

Do u have any idea on where to check the language in the customization session? :confused:<br />
