<br />
one more question !<br />
<br />
on my site i have one interface (4gl program) which reads an ascii file in fixed format and makes inventory transfer or production receipt depending on the type of record read.<br />
<br />
but commit is made after completion of production receipt and inventory transfer combination for one record<br />
<br />
for example ,<br />
<br />
i make production receipt for one item X in warehouse 100<br />
record is inserted in table tdinv100 but not commited.<br />
<br />
now i want to transfer the same quantity from 100 warehouse to 110 warehouse for same item <br />
<br />
for that purpose i select max(tdinv100.sern) from tdinv100<br />
and add 1 to it to get next sern <br />
<br />
this works fine when there is production receipt for the same item in the same warehouse on the same date <br />
<br />
if there is no such record in tdinv100 for the same date then this select doesnt work it just throws me out of that function and terminates program abruptly<br />
<br />
i think it has something to do with max aggregate function which will work only on data which is in table and not on the data which is in buffer <br />
<br />
will as set with 1 rows work with buffer and data both ?<br />
<br />
i want to clarify this point</div></div><hr />

If the select does not read into the buffer, adding the &quot;as set..&quot; will not change that situation</div></div><hr />
