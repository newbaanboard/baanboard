<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">20th March 2008, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All,<br />
I have a question about printing bar codes through Baan.<br />
I wrote an AFS session to create a production order, then print the route sheets and other documentation.<br />
The AFS session works fine and the bar code printing works fine when you print to a report.<br />
But because we have users at different locations, we want to print to a file, so they can print it themselves when they retrieve it from a directory folder.<br />
The problem is when the route sheet with barcodes prints to an ASCII file, the barcode formatting is lost.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to get around this barcode formatting problem?<br />
We could possibly print to a PDF if that would keep the barcode formatting, but I'm not sure how to do that in BaanIV.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />

Then when we put it in batch each site gets processed separately so each line in the batch has the appropriate printers.<br />
<br />
The other way was buy setting up a cross reference table for a key value with the appropriate default printers.  So for example when user runs <br />
I am not sure if this is feasible or not - what we did was create cross reference table for printers that gets pulled up for certain sessions based off a key value.  For example if a user runs one of the outbound processes it takes the warehouse the user selects, reads the tables and defaults the printers(yes printers - one for report, one for tags) based off the warehouse.  I do not know if that is feasible for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I forgot to mention that the AFS session will be running in a Baan job, so there is no user intervention. The 'generic' admin account is the owner of the baan job. <br />
Printing to the default printer of the admin account is not feasible either, because we have many users in different locations that need their documents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th March 2008, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - that is what we do, but in the baan job we have multiple runs of the session - 1 per site or warehouse.  The session itself pulls up the print information based off the session input - input fields on the form.  So for example on generate picks - we run it by warehouse.  So when the session sees the warehouse X it pulls up all the printers involved and then runs the generate to printer 1 and pick tags to printer 2.  Then the next line in the job is for warehouse Y, then it runs generate to a different printer 1 and a different pick tag printer.  Of course we could run this for a wide open warehouse range, but then we would be where you are - how to send what where.  <br />
<br />
In reality what I am asking is can you break up the batch so each site gets a different run through the session?</div></div><hr />
