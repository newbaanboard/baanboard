<br />
I'm repeatedly getting an error  &quot;Currency of warehouse XXXXX not found&quot; when attempting to activate the menu option &quot;Process Order Lines&quot; in session whinh5500m000 (&quot;Cycle-Counting/Adjustment Orders&quot;), in my test-company 777.<br />
<br />
The order header and order lines have all been correctly created, and I've tried it for several new orders against different items - it's just this last step which fails. According to our finance guys, we also get the error from time to time in the main live company, and they have no idea as to what might be causing this.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any experience of this, or could anybody point me in the right direction to find out?<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />
Robert</div></div><hr />

Did you follow the quick guide Copying Companies in Baan ERP?  See solution #3934.  When you dump from prod to test, you need to either remove the tg tables before import to test, or replace the company number in them, there's a couple of tables that hold the prod company number.  These tg tables don't get corrected in the tfgld9000 series for Correct Company number.  Maybe they have fixed that by now.  <br />
<br />
Also, I seem to remember something about the tcemm relationship that may not be set up 100% right, may also cause this error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahhhh!  - this would explain the error which immediately follows the one I quoted: namely &quot;Cannot change to company 100&quot;!<br />
<br />
This is because, as SOX-audited developer, I am not permitted to do anything in the live environment (company 100) and it would appear that, as you suggest, there are tables in my dev environment which contain company information from before the import.<br />
<br />
We now have a long weekend, and I'm just leaving, so I'll look into this on Monday.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Also more on the other way I have seen this come up, maybe their problem in production, if some warehouse does not have the right logistical company attached they may get this.</div></div><hr />
