<br />
when a user does Ctrl find and BaaN does not find the exact record, it goes to the very next record. This causes some problems or confusions with our users. Is there a way to warn the user that Baan did not find the extact record requested?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th October 2003, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You could probably put in some code to check what was entered against what was found.  Then flash up a warning.  I would probably just get the users use to verifying the data on the screen and using the next record and next view keys.  It took our users a while to stop complaining about this.<br />

I thought that maybe was there something more feasible...<br />

Thanks again.<br />

<br />
Some background may help.  The read is done by index, and if you do not fill in the full index, there is sometimes a residual value in there, So... if you want to find <br />
Sales Order=1 <br />
Position=10<br />
Sequence 1<br />
<br />
and you only put in<br />
Sales Order = 1<br />
Position = 10<br />
<br />
it will most likely have the current highlighted record's sequence number in hand, probably higher than 1.  When it does not find an exact match, it will go to the next higher record.<br />
Another problem exists when all the fields of the index being searched on are not on the form.  In this case, those fields will not appear on the find either, so there is no way the user can insure the full key is entered, so results are as you found, not predictable.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story, if they can put in the full key, it will help to find the right record, but not always.</div></div><hr />
