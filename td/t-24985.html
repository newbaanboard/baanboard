<br />
I am trying to print the text tdpur041.txta into my report layout.<br />
<br />
I have added the field, untick the domain and changed the length to 80.<br />
<br />
I read somewhere that was all i need to do. But I still cannot get the text printed.<br />
<br />
Has anyone any ideas?<br />

<br />
Is tdpur041.txta defined as an input field within the report ?<br />
<br />
This is a little tricky to explain but if the value is blank within the layout then you may really need to check whether the report within that layout is referencing table tdpur041.<br />
<br />
If not you may need to put something some simple sql within the report script for that layout.<br />
<br />
Let me know how you get on.<br />

<br />
Just check the print condition = 1 is there or not and check the text is present in data or not , otherwise text should print on the report. Whatever u have dont that is right. One more things u have to check that do u have that text group permission or no.<br />
<br />

If you see the value (text) is not updated, it probably means that the field is not selected in the program script. You will then have to add the selection query in your report script.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are not able to resolve your problem with above solution, just try declaring one variable with same domain as tdsls041.txta and assign tdsls041.txta's value to it and add this field in your report input field and layout instead of tdsls041.txta with the required length you want it to print in report.<br />
<br />
This might sound silly, but i had same problem and i got it solved by this work around.<br />

<br />
You are right. After i assign to a variable, tdpur041.txta can be printed.<br />
Why? Guess we do not know and we will never know.<br />
<br />
Great and Thanks,</div></div><hr />
