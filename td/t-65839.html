I am new to this, but I have some degree of Baan programming experience. I want to run a report that display data on one huge giant (touch based) screen and keeps refreshing the data on the screen after every 5 seconds. <br />
<br />
Any idea how it can be accomplished.<br />

You can display your data on a Webpage and set a refresh rate which will look for any new data updates at every refresh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand what you are saying, but how can we achieve it. We are on baan4c4 doesn't use webtop, so where do we define the refresh rate.<br />

<br />
There can be various ways to achieve that which depends on how you implement it. One way is to create some ASCII file from Baan which will be updated automatically when there is some change in the data. For this you can use a Job to create the file by calling the program. Now, you can create a Webpage which reads this ASCII file and presents the data in whatever form you want. <br />
<br />
And there are methods in JavaScript to call the read function at some defined rate. That''s it. This is a simple method, if you want to get more complex ones, you can use .NET based calls which will directly query your database to get the results. <br />
<br />
As I said, there are various ways. And I guess Baan 4 can handle this and yes I assume you know a little of HTML.</div></div><hr />
