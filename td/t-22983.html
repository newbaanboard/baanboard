I have to develope a &quot;query by user&quot; session. According to the input data the user entries, a dynamic sql is built. Now the problem: the query result must be displayed not on a report, but on a type-2 form of a new session where a record can be selected and some choice user must be implemented. The first session (input data for the query) has no main table, the query is built and then another session is activeted: I could parse, exec and fetch the query and save the data on a temporary table in the before.program of the second session script. This table is, of course, the main table of this second session. What do you think?  Can someone suggest something better?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I am real sure of all the requirements, but I have some like this that they are actually 1 session.  For example If the main key is order, then when they do add.set(I think that is the right event) I then go and build the temporary table for them.  Usually I use user-id(or application lock or something like that) so mutliple users do not step on each others data or try to process the same stuff.<br />
