I have a scanner  which scans bar code and displays it on the screen.<br />
I need to capture that data in Baan session online .<br />
(for eg  i scan the item code and as soon as i scan it that item code should get displayed on my baan form as input )<br />
I know i have to use ddc and talk to com port (the port on which the scanner is plugged in ) , for which i need to write a c program but i dont know how to go about it .<br />
has Any one done such sort of thing which is online and not batch reading .<br />
Any other ideas or input welcomed ....<br />
A sample source will make ways for great things to happen .<br />

In this case whatever(I mean barcode) it scan  it appear on the screen.<br />
If you are talking about wireless handheld terminal,you can telnet the Baan session .<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
focus to the input field on your form and scan your barcodes. it will appear  in the input field.  <br />
using check.input for this field you can do what you want with your scanned values.<br />

<br />
What do u mean by focus on the field?<br />
are u saying set.focus() and let the cursor sits on the field then scan the data in? and automatically the item will appear on the field?<br />
<br />
Please clarify.<br />
<br />
thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

Scan your Barcodedata to an input field (e.g. Itemcode) and in check.input you can verify the data with your db.<br />
Afterwards display(&quot;field&quot;) and refresh() shows the data.<br />

<br />
I think you should stick to Richards answer first ..... not that any other answer was wrong .... *g*<br />
<br />
Your question was: how can I access the data that the scanner reads.<br />
<br />
Richards answer was: if your barcode reader is attached to your keyboard, you are already there .... the scanned data is transmitted to your program as if it had been typed in via keyboard. <br />
<br />
Usually you can setup the scanner (by scanning in prepared barcodes or adjust some dip-switches) to change his behaviour (if you have a very rare barcoding or you can't live with the standard settings), but in 95% the default settings are perfect. One handy setting is for instance that the scanner adds a 'CR' at the end of the data. In your program this will be as if the user typed in all the numbers and then pressed &lt;ENTER&gt; .... most likely what you will need. <br />
<br />
All the other issues (set a focus to a field, display the data, refresh the screen etc.) occur in the same context if there is no scanner involved and the data is typed in on a keyboard.<br />

<br />
Sorry for my lack of understanding. This is my first time handling barcodes.<br />
<br />
Let say i want to maintain receipt using barcodes.<br />
So I use the normal Maintain Receipt session?<br />
<br />
Then, I can scan in the purchase order number, then packing slip quantity, <br />
tab the next field to show the date?<br />
<br />
Then when it goes to the next screen on location, i can scan in the location<br />
and the quantity again?<br />
<br />
Will this help my users in their efficiency?<br />
<br />
Is this the right way to use scanners and barcodes?<br />
<br />
Hope you can explain further on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have u solved ur problem? , so many post already made. I can share my experience with u . I have implement barcode on finish good and control total <br />
Production. We have done  ROC, final inventory posting to baan through AFS.<br />
Event we print the barcode from BaaN only. So need not to worry for barcode.<br />
<br />
To scan the barcode u have to make a maintain session and just plug the scanner into ur workstation. there is no need do programming for that. only u have to do the change the set  up the scanner. Bydefault scanner is set by &quot;Enter&quot; Key you have to change it to &quot;Tab&quot; key. For this u have to follow the scanner manual. There are few steps to change the setup. You have to scan the few barcode from manual then it will change the setup automatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">5th July 2005, 16:07</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a wedge bar code reader (or something similar) attached to a PC, then the advice you have received to date is right on.  Use it as part of the regular (or a slightly customized) Maintain Receipts session.<br />
<br />
One of your more recent questions was whether this was the best way to use a scanner and bar coding for efficiency.  That depends on how your company does receiving, but for a lot of companies, the answer would probably be no.  A lot of our clients -- and many other companies as well -- use handheld devices (e.g., Intermec, Unitech, Teklogix, Symbol) that have bar code scanners in them in conjunction with DDC, OpenWorld, etc. to perform the maintain receipts functionality without being tied to a PC and Baan session.  In many cases, there is a lot less input involved for the person doing the receiving, and the handheld device can give them the freedom to move around without being tethered to a machine.  And it's not just Maintain Receipts.  There's shipping, production, and on and on.<br />
<br />
Bar coding is a great first step, but there are more efficiencies waiting to be exploited...</div></div><hr />
