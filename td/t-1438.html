You say you try to connect a SQL query to a Baan  session. What do you mean with a SQL query? Is this a query created with easy SQL?<br />

Instead of using Execute Query (ttadv3280m000), we want to create new session for calling the Query personally, and we want to give authorization for that new session to different users.<br />

Unless anyone has any better ideas, what I have done in the past to make Queries into sessions is to create a new session.   If you are unfamiliar with basic session building post back and I can go into more detail.   You can generate a standard session based on the main table you are using in your query.  Then, replace the generated session report with the report from your query.  Replace the generated main select statement in the session script with the select from the SQL Query.  Keep all the print commands, selectdo and endselect statements where they are.  Make sure the form has all the variables you need to query, and add them if needed.   Add any additional tables you use in your select to the declaration section.  You will have to tweek the query to work with the form fields, but that should be the only hassle.<br />

Let me know if you need more detail.<br />

Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st March 2002, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">You could create your own session(function server) that calls ttadv3180m000, and executes a query. You could do several things with you own session, like maybe let them zoom to the query they want and execute it.  Or you could create a series of check boxes for the various queries.  But even using this session in a function server fashion you have to have permissions to ttadv31800m000. Just a couple more ideas.  <br />

That documentation was done by Lisa, I am not sure how often she visits the board today or if she has the same type documentation for Ln.  As it is I am on 4c4 for and I find it easier to generate a session and then just modify the report and script to do what I need.  Not sure how that is on LN. Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">29th November 2007, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">What we have done in the past is to add the query to a menu. To the end users it acts like a session and they do not know they are really just running a query.</div></div><hr />
