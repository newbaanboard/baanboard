<br />
This is what I am doing:  I have an ASCII input file that contains an item and description.  I am reading it into my script and selecting from tiitm001 where the items are equal.  The goal is to write the description from the file to <br />
tiitm001.txtp (AKA The Purchase Text).  We have text group &quot;text&quot; defined in the system, align.item is the item read in and buf.dsca is the description.  Then I want to copy the text I created in the English lang to Spanish lang.<br />
<br />
This what my code looks like:<br />
<br />
db.retry.point()<br />
select	tiitm001.*<br />
from	tiitm001 for update<br />
where	tiitm001._index1 = {:align.item}<br />
order by tiitm001._index1<br />
selectdo<br />
	ret.num = text.write(&quot;tiitm001.txtp&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;ITEMLOAD&quot;, <br />
                                         &quot;ITM001.TXTP&quot;, buf.item, &quot;&quot;, &quot;text&quot;,<br />
                                         &quot;3&quot;, buf.dsca)<br />
	ret.num = text.copy.language(tiitm001.txtp, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;5&quot;)<br />
	db.update(ttiitm001, db.retry)<br />
endselect<br />
commit.transaction()<br />
<br />
<br />
When I run this I get tiitm001.txtp has a value other than zero but my ret.num = 0 which from what I have read means no lines were created since the return value should reflect how many lines were written.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what I am doing wrong???<br />
<br />
Thanks:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th March 2007, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">write.return = text.write(some.field, &quot;2&quot;, kw1, kw2, kw3, kw4, &quot;purchase&quot;, &quot;&quot;, temp.file1)<br />
<br />
This is from a program I know works - I can not remember the problem I had with eopt, but I ended up making it &quot;&quot;.  Is your buf.dsca a file name or an array?  In my case kw1 thru kw4 are set with a text read from another text group.<br />
<br />
Never used the text.copy.language function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraDiehl</div><div class="date">30th March 2007, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I changed the eopt arguement to contain &quot;&quot; and still get the same results.  I get an assigned text number that gets placed into tiitm001.txtp (ex: 10), but when I look out in table tttxt010 it's not getting inserted.<br />
<br />
To answer your question my buf.dsca is an array of 256 so basically my data that is coming in looks like this:<br />
<br />
255-37-0418|This is a long description for item 255-37-0418<br />
<br />
So I read the 255-37-0418 into align.item and the buf.dsca gets the rest minus the |.<br />
<br />
The rest of the arguements, Kkw1 - kw4, I was understanding those are the KeyWords that you use for a search hence the reason why I have the values I have.<br />
<br />
My only other thought is that the parm &quot;tgroup&quot; is defined as string 8 and I found issues many of times with BaaN you have to set up the sting to contain all 8 characters, rather if right or left justify so I wonder if this is the same case?</div></div><hr />

This option is the name of the file that contains the text for the new field.</div></div><hr />
