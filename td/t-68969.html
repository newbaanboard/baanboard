<br />
We are developing an AFS to the standard Generate Project Structure session tipcs2220m000. However, we noticed that during processing some of the messages which are scripted in the Constraints of Generic Items in  PCF module ( via session tipcf2110m000) , are popping up in a message window, <br />
These are NOT ENUM , but just warning messages with only OK button. <br />
<br />
What we need to achieve is to suppress the same via AFS. <br />
The process started during this message display is ottstpmess, which we are trying to KILL via handle.subproc  , however it does not seem to work. <br />
<br />
<br />
Please see attached and advise. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

My first thought was something needs to be updated - session, API libraries or something. Messages, especially just warning messages, should not pop.<br />
<br />
The other thing is to write a little code to find the process id and then go kill it.  There is some code I posted in the AFS forum that shows how to do that.  What I am not sure of is if the background session will continue.<br />
<br />
Do you have source code?</div></div><hr />
