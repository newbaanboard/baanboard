<br />
Is it  possible to get the next record while I'm in the current record? <br />
<br />
This is the sample of the sequence of the data.<br />
<br />
A, B, C, D<br />
<br />
This is the normal generation of data.<br />
<br />
Line 1     A<br />
Line 2     B<br />
Line 3     C<br />
Line 4     D<br />
<br />
This is what I want to do.<br />
<br />
Line 1     A     B<br />
Line 2     B     C<br />
Line 3     C     D<br />
Line 4     D<br />
<br />
I've tried the after layout manipulation but is there any other way like in query?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot pals,</div></div><hr />

The second thing is in the report script when you are printing A go re-read the tables and get record B with more selects.  <br />
<br />
Not really sure you could read the temp file out there twice - I know there is some methods of reading the file, re-writing it.  I know I did this for sorting, and someone else (Cherokee maybe) posted another or better solution for I thinking adding fields.  Not sure how relevant those are to this situation.</div></div><hr />

This is what I want to do.Need to merge the rows where 2 column data is identical. Below Line 1 and 2 have same data only last column quantity is different . I need to merge that and make one row.<br />

If you are just totaling then  then all the fields before the last column of qty have to be sorted items on the report.  Then you should be able to use the after field layout to print a total of the quantity or something like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the fast reply pals. <br />
<br />
Mark I will try your second advice, to manipulate in the report script. I can't manipulate the session script because it is a standard that's why I'm trying to solve my issue in the report script. But anyways I will try your advice.<br />
<br />
bdittmar I will also try the multi columns as you suggested, I haven't tried this before but wish me luck. :)<br />
<br />
I'll be back for the results.<br />
<br />
Thanks pals,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks pals it working fine now. Instead of using the detail as my layout I tried to use the grouping. I created an after field grouped by items so all the records next to it will read first before going to next line. What I mean records is in Sales Order as you know sometimes there are sequences with the same line etc. So by grouping I can manipulate all the records with in the same group before going to the next line.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot pals.<br />
Leonarchs  :) :o :p :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am new to LN Reporting . Kindly share the code solution , you used to successfully group the data in after.field.<br />
It would be of great help to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amator</div><div class="date">17th January 2017, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi shradha.d,<br />
<br />
These steps is my own way of grouping but maybe there is some way of grouping.<br />
<br />
Grouping is created in the layout. For example I want to group the &quot;details&quot; or the population of data by order number, normally we use the detail layout but for grouping you need to create another one. As I want to group it by order number then I will change the sort mode of for example the tdlsls401.orno to ascending (change the sort mode in input fields) after this I will create a layout that corresponds to this. The layout will be After.field tdsls401.orno. Now you can code inside here what you want to display and grouped by Order Number.<br />
<br />
Sample script:<br />
<br />
<br />
after.tdsls401.orno.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
|some codes here to display what you want and the out will be |order/grouped by Order Number <br />
<br />
after.layout:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this will help you,<br />
