- when I open a program with scite, writing originally with Ultraedit, the tabs are not respected.<br />
- when I write a program with scite and I compile it in debugger form. The debugger screen doenÂ´t respect the tabs I write.<br />
<br />
There is any way to solve this 2 things.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th August 2005, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know how ultraedit handles tabs - spaces or true tabs.  I just know that when we bring up a script in scite sometimes I have to roll through and fix all of the tabs.  In scite I have 8 as the indent and tab setting.  I also have the &quot;use tabs&quot; button checked.  Not sure about baan 5, but in debug mode everything looks okay to me.  Again there are times when I will run into a script where spaces were used instead of a tab.  I have seen these get out of alignment.  Also make sure you have that blank line at the bottom of the script - I have seen the debugger do some weird stuff when that is not there.<br />
<br />
Another tip is to make sure that there are no weird characters in your script - using vi I have found some scripts with ^M's at the back of lines.  Scite works fine with the scripts but debugger does not.  I found that scripts FTP'ed up does this if you do not have the correct setting on the ftp software.  I typically will jump into vi to see these type problems.  Again this is not caused by scite, but it does mess with the debugger screen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

I'm using it along with vim because it handles more colour syntax's than vim (like Coldfusion MX)</div></div><hr />
