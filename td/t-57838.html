The person needs not only this session but permissions to the report also.  Look at the session, see which package and module and make sure they have access to it.</div></div><hr />

Also check the package combination of the user. It might so happen that the report is present in VRC lower than the VRC to which the package combination of the user is linked to.<br />

<br />
But i gave the session ttadv3280m000 session for the key to execute the query, but it is throwing 'report not present'. <br />

What do you mean by not having 'tools'?  They at least have to have ttadv3280m000 and probably the module ttstp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Add the user in ttadv0140m000 session by giving the VRC as same as the VRC in which we created the reoprt.<br />
Ex: Assume that, report is created in pkg - tc module -sql report - xxx in B61V_a_liv VRC. then add user in ttadv0140m000 with VRC B61V_a_liv. <br />
<br />
