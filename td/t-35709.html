<br />
can anybody explain the function of the field &quot;lseq&quot; in tdpur401 of Baan5?<br />
<br />
In what a relationship is it to the field sqnb of the same table?</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats`s what I found in LN.<br />
<br />
This field is filled with the sequence number of the newly created purchase order line detail in which the backorder is copied when the active backorder is confirmed.<br />
<br />

When there is a backorder on that line, then the first line for that position (pono) will have seqn = 0, the first backorder-line will be seqn 10, the second backorder will be seqn 20 etc. In this case, the first record will have lseq 1, indicating there is a next record for backorder to it with seqn 10, the second line will have lseq = 2, indicating that another backorder line is existing with seqn 20...<br />
<br />
Hope this clearifies a bit...?<br />

<br />
thanks for your support. I agree with you. lseq increases with with every confirmed backorder. Normaly at the last sequence of a pone lseq = 0.<br />
<br />
Now we have some orderpositions from which more than one sequence has and entry with lseq = 0. I think that may come from the use of session tdpur4501m300 and whinh3121s000 (Correction)<br />
<br />
This should be a normale case:<br />
orno: 1<br />
pono:1<br />
sqnb:0<br />
lseq:1<br />
<br />
orno:1<br />
pono:1<br />
sqnb:1<br />
lseq:2<br />
<br />
orno:1<br />
pono:1<br />
sqnb:2<br />
lseq:3<br />
<br />
orno:1<br />
pono:1<br />
sqnb:3<br />
lseq:0<br />
<br />
After us of tdpur4501m300 (which deletes the last sequence) and then make a correction of an amount, with whinh3121s000  (which add's sqnb 3 again) we have something like this:<br />
<br />
orno: 1<br />
pono:1<br />
sqnb:0<br />
lseq:3   &lt;--??<br />
<br />
orno:1<br />
pono:1<br />
sqnb:1<br />
lseq:2<br />
<br />
orno:1<br />
pono:1<br />
sqnb:2<br />
lseq:0     &lt;--??<br />
<br />
orno:1<br />
pono:1<br />
sqnb:3<br />
lseq:0<br />
<br />
You see: the both last records have: &quot;lseq = 0&quot; and even worse: the first record got: &quot;lseq = 3&quot;<br />
<br />
Hard to explain. But I hope you understand what I mean.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Understand what you mean, seems strange to me too.. Is this the case only for one order, or do you have more/many orders with this pattern..? If you have a support contract, maybe log a case for some functional explanation...<br />

<br />
thank, you. We have a support contract, but the people who are responsible for the contacts to Baan are not that happy with the support ;-) specially for that problem. It is also not desired to install solution after solution... however...<br />
<br />
We will analyse this problem (or feature) in future a little deeper. Therefore my question for a person with a good knowledge about the function of this &quot;lseq&quot;-Field.<br />
Of course, if we get no results we will contact Baan, but first we try without ;-)<br />
<br />
And.. just forgott, we have such records also on production system, but a really small amount.<br />
I think our system generates such records in case of deleteing records with the session tdpur4501m300.<br />
<br />
kind regards<br />
