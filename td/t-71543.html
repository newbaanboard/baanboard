In some areas of the application there is a requirement to add easy and for free Customer Defined Fields. This fields solve the business requirements of (a group of) customers, but their need is not generic enough for deployment in the standard. Free Customer Defined Fields could help a customer to store his specific data requirements without having to customize the system. The information in the CDFs are, when possible, carried forward through the business process. For instance when customer specific data is stored on the requisition header it should be carried forward when the requisition is turned into a purchase order and finally into an invoice.<br />
<br />

But you can order the data on the CDF with setting a filter.<br />

Note that the information about restrictions on CDFs is outdated.</div></div><hr />
