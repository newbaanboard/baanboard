<br />
I have created technical documentation in session Maintain Reports (ttadv3130m000) against a given report (eg. tdpur440301000).<br />
<br />
When I copy this report (eg. tdpur440301999) I get the error message:<br />
<br />
         &quot;No authorization to copy documentation&quot;<br />
<br />
The report is actually copied, and compiles without errors, but the technical documentation is missing from the cloned report. <br />
<br />
I am the creator of the original technical documentation and a Superuser, so I can't see any obvious permissions/authorizations problems that might be triggering this.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Version B40_c4 SP10<br />
<br />
<br />
It will be good if you fill your profile with the BaaN/OS/Database Info.<br />
<br />
You need to have the text group authorization template defined.<br />
<br />
Also the text group authorization setting has to be defined for a normal user on the Authorization Tab and also the default text group in the User Data session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David A. Green</div><div class="date">19th March 2003, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response.<br />
<br />
However, the solution you propose involves a BaaN 5.2 session (ttams1122m000). I am at B40_c4. So far as I know, text group authorization templates don't exist at B40-c4.<br />
<br />
Is there a workaround for my version of BaaN?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
(Will update my BaaNBoard profile as suggested.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Baan IV also there is a session where in you can specify the Text Group Authorizations. It is under Text Management.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David A. Green</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can set up text group authorizations in BaaN, but as a superuser there is no need to do so for myself: indeed, session tttxt1111m000: Maintain Text Group Authorizations specifically prevents you from assigning authorizations to a superuser.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is that I have authority to create technical documentation, but when I copy the report I get a &quot;No Authorization&quot; error message which prevents the documentation from being copied. To my mind this is clearly wrong. I've never had this problem in V40_C4 SP9. I can get round it by re-creating the technical documentation in the cloned report, but I shouldn't have to do this.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I need to log a call with BaaN support?</div></div><hr />

I am having the same problem just using the TEXT.COPY command now.  It is returning 'No Permission' (-1), but I too am a superuser.   Are we missing something here or has something happened to the text.copy command?  You can't even enter an authorization if you are a superuser.<br />
I am working in Baan IVc4, with SP11 newly installed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Doh!<br />
Nothing wrong with TEXT.COPY, except maybe unclear error returns :)<br />
My problem was not having a Default Text Group assigned to my user (Maintain Default Text Group by User).  Generating a permission error was misleading.  David, maybe that's your problem as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David A. Green</div><div class="date">28th March 2003, 12:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion.<br />
<br />
Last week I set up a Default Text Group against my user, but the problem persists.<br />
<br />
I will log the call with BaaN support and let you know the outcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">28th March 2003, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Check if the default text group settings, which you are using has the all company or specific company settings defined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David A. Green</div><div class="date">31st March 2003, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. However, I'm on B40_c4 and your fix involves maintaining text group templates using a B5 session. The equivalent session at B40_c4 (tttxt1113m000) doesn't allow the option to specify all or individual companies.</div></div><hr />
