<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">3rd December 2012, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a customized print session containing a customized form, session script, and three reports.  I copied the session, form, and three reports to a different VRC and the form is not behaving properly.  I dumped the form, and successfully compiled the session script and all three reports.<br />
<br />
The labels display, but the six input fields on the form do not.  If I 'Tab' the cursor focus of the session does not even appear to 'see' thes fields.<br />
<br />
I deleted the form and copied it from the original VRC.  Same behavior.<br />
<br />
I then deleted the form and created the form from scratch.  Same issue.<br />
<br />
I have never experienced anything like this.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what to try next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">4th December 2012, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">There are also two 'display' fields on the form.  If I remove those, then then six 'input' fields will display.  As soon as I add one of the display fields, the six input fields will not display.  I do not see any code in the session script that would change the ability to input into the field based on other field values.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">4th December 2012, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">The fields will display, but data cannot be entered into them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th December 2012, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">What are the session and script types?  Is modify turned on for the form in question?  Almost sounds like something is not aligned with the form and the script, but just speculating at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">4th December 2012, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">sometimes troubleshooting this kind of problem takes time. what i do normally is select a standard session that has the same behavior and just copy them to a new session,rename,modify. this way i don't have to worry about form types and scripts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">5th December 2012, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">It took me quite a while to pull it apart piece by piece, but it must have been some sort of characteristic between the session and the form type.  I had rebuilt it a few times and there was even a time when I started the session and a blank Baan session screen appeared, but no options (not menu bar -File, Edit, etc. nor menu button bar) were 'active'.  After that I rebuilt the Maintain Session session data and rebuilt the Maintain Forms session data and everything works....whew...<br />

Thank you both for your replies.  I appreciate the suggestions!  Enjoy the upcoming holiday season.</div></div><hr />
