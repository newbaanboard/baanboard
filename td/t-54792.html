Two session lvmhn1114m000 and lvmhn1113m000<br />
After opening lvmhn1114m000 session i enter some field in which index is<br />
lvmhn114.gpno, lvmhn114.date, lvmhn114.suno<br />
<br />
1. Afterfilling all fields there is one button on the same session which calls another session after clicking on the button  this session opens  lvmhn1113m000.  In this session I want the same data what i entered in previous session i.e. lvmhn114.gpno, lvmhn114.date,  lvmhn114.suno. My second session is of TYPE 3 and First Session is of TYPE 1 (lvmhn1114m000).<br />
<br />
2. If data is available in 2nd session i.e. lvmhn1113m000 then users should not be able to delete the data from 1st session i.e lvmhn1114m000. If they want to delete then first he should delete data from 2nd session then after he can delete the data from 1st session.<br />
<br />
3. If any user is updating the data in second session for say Gate Pass No. 1 then at that time no other users should update the same record.<br />
<br />
plzzzzzzz  help me i m trying it from so many days but not able to solve all three problem. If any one can help me out. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. In session  lvmhn1114m000 export the three index fields using export().<br />
2. In session  lvmhn1113m000  import the three index fields using import().<br />
3. Use query.extension in session  lvmhn1113m000 in before.program section<br />
    (This will restrict the records).<br />
4. In session lvmhn1114m000 before deletion you can checek whether all records in lvmhn113 are deleted.<br />
<br />
Bye.</div></div><hr />
