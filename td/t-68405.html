<br />
THIS IS PERTAINING TO BAAN IV.<br />
<br />
I am required to write a report to fetch details of open orders (Pending purchase orders). for which I have written following condition:<br />
<br />
and     ((tdpur041.dqua = 0 and tdpur041.bqua = 0) or (tdpur041.bqua &gt; 0)) <br />
<br />
Still some of the orders lines which are not present in tdinv150 (planned inventory transactions) are also coming.<br />
<br />
Can anybody guide me what is the logic of open orders ?<br />
<br />
Also, In purchase order session tdpur4101m000, Baan IV displays order status, which is not a table field. Can we determine the order status by calling some standard dll or is there any way to determine purchase order status ?<br />
<br />
Please guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th November 2015, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">My best suggestion is to take the orders that you do not expect on the report and look at the tdpur041 record and receipts.  See if the receipt is hung or inspection is hung.  I have seen the tables get out of sync and I seem to recall something about receipts that are in process causing an issue.</div></div><hr />
