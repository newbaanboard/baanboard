As I know the form it self is not an object! But in the main window there are some other objects. May I ask what are you trying to do?<br />

So they will have an object ID. How to get it is my question.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanDeveloper</div><div class="date">28th June 2007, 02:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello - thank you for the reply - but the function current.mwindow() returns the object ID of the main window only. And when this is passed to the change.object() function only the outer window is affected. This is why I need a way to get the the oject ID of the individual forms, which are most likely child windows. That is the key. If I could get those object ID's (for Form-1, Form-2, etc...) then I could use the same change.object() function to change the size. Still looking for ideas on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I told you, there is nothing called &quot;Form object&quot;. There are tabs, gwindows and other stuff that can be subobjects to main window. Check this link for the list of obects:<br />

In you reply, you say there are tab, gwindows ....&quot;. As you suggested, I looked as the list of objects from the link you supplied me. I see a gwindow in the list and I am very familiar with it. But I do not see the &quot;tab&quot; that you mentioned? Is this only a partial list? Can you elaborate more on the &quot;tab&quot; object. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">29th June 2007, 08:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure,<br />
<br />
It is called DsCtabFrame (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_user_interface_objects_dsctabframe). It was mentioned in that list.<br />

I hope it helps,<br />
