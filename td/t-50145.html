<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an existing session that the users now want to display in a different sort order.  The index exists that they need and I have made it a valid sort option on the form.  They can click on Order and change to this index.  The problem is they want this to be the default sort order.  When I go the the Change Key form it says the key that is set as 1 will be the start option.  I have set this as the first option but it is not the start option when the session is run.  Does anybody know why this is?  Is there a way around it?  <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know that is how you change the sort option.  You pick the indexes allowed and then pick which one is first.  Is this session in shared memory or something?  Maybe a create runtime data dictionary is needed on the session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting - just tried it on a test system with tipgc5120m00b and it does not want to change off the primary index.  I deleted user defaults, convert(and created) rdd, log off and back in, all with no effect on how the session starts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting - if I change the sort order to 2,3,1,4,5 (see the attached) the session starts with index 2.  Yet if I look at the order I still see one as being checked - second image.  Evidently I do not know how this works - and here I thought I did. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">It does work - if you see the DESCRIPTION of the sort order it does show by Supplier, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">You are 100% correct it did work!  My mind must be on my vacation next week - 2 more days and then 9 days without thinking about this place.  Please excuse my senile lapse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I deleted the defaults and converted/created rdd and it still isn't working.  It reorders the options, but still has the primary key as the start up option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">3rd April 2008, 00:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The Change Order is meaningful mostly in Form Type 1 or Form Type 2. If you have Form Type 3, with say 2 view fields, then the Change Order is meaningful only as long as the 2 view fields remain the same in the other indexes.</div></div><hr />
