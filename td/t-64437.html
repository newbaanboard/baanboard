<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">20th August 2013, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks frank. this will be my first time on bods. any pointers or more details are appreciated. i have programmed bde's through application studio (eclipse). is it the one you're referring? i also have training on BI. can you expand a little bit with a few samples/docs? i also hope to have my hand on ion-training soon. thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">21st August 2013, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Benito, Developing a BOD for LN is a bit more complex than creating a BDE. So I would advice following a course. The ION training will not cover this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frank.finke</div><div class="date">22nd August 2013, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Benito, I think an ION training is prerequisite for learning develop Bods. <br />
But BOD development itself is to complex for a &quot;workshop&quot; in a forum like this.<br />
<br />
The tool i use for BOD (and BDE) development is not the Application Studio but the Business Studio. It is also a eclipse addon.<br />
<br />
As an entry you could first try to develop a BOD for a simple table like the &quot;titles&quot; (tcmcs019).<br />
Then you should use the BOD in ION for example in a Workflow.<br />
<br />
If you have concrete questions during this, i am sure, you will get help. But it is not the place to give you a course for bod development, that is normally a training over a whole week for the beginning.<br />
