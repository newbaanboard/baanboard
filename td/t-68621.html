You can check this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=13280). Will give you some hints on how you can tackle the creation of the dump core files though have never faced this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">10th February 2016, 05:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Please Check Your bshell Log, I once faced a Core Dump Issue when there were too many transactions going for commit. It might have a Clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th February 2016, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a couple of function servers I used to have that would dump after so many records.  These sessions deleted hundreds or thousands of records.  After so many runs it would abort and on occasion core dump.  Not sure that is the case here - but with SP and upgrades I do not recall having this issue anymore.<br />
<br />
I think the first thing you need to do is maybe make sure all the sessions close after each transaction.  You might also want to try a pause(or suspend) before starting a new transactions.  I know those two things have helped some of my sessions in the past.  Think of the pause as giving the chance for the session to complete one transaction, before you start the next.</div></div><hr />
