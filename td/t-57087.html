<br />
We have problems when we develop session&amp;program script.<br />
We have form field (3 fields for input, is not table field) in session type 3 (multi occurence form with view). these field are &quot;wh.to&quot;, &quot;lokasi.to&quot; and &quot;verification&quot;. we wish, if we run this session, the cursor move to &quot;wh.to&quot; field and after we input for this field, we wish cursor move to &quot;lokasi.to&quot; field directly and after we input in this field (&quot;wh.to&quot;), we want cursor move to &quot;verification&quot; field. and the last after we input in &quot;verification&quot; field, we want run a function.<br />
to move cursor directly, we made script with to.field() function and field event secsion.But, everytime we run this session, cursor didn't move to &quot;wh.to&quot; field, and after we input in this field, the cursor didn't move to &quot;lokasi.to&quot; field directly. and after we put value for &quot;verification&quot; field, the function was not run.for detail, see attachment.<br />
<br />
Please help me to solve it, thanks<br />

Did you set the form field order correctly?  What mode does the session start with find,modify, etc?  It should be possible, but everything needs to be in the correct sections.  At least I assume 5 is the same as 4c4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we use this function to move cursor to destination field that we want, we can override field order in form editor with this function.<br />
is it wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th October 2009, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the help to.field can only be used in after.input, after.display, after.field.  Maybe in the after.display for batch number.  I do not really know baan 5, so I do not know what the default mode is - you made need to start it in a different mode(like modifiy).</div></div><hr />

In this case, we made script, after input data on &quot;wh.to&quot; field we use function it to move it directly to &quot;lokasi.to&quot; field. but it is not run for these 3 fields, &quot;wh.to&quot;, &quot;lokasi.to&quot; and &quot;verification.to&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does Baan 5 suport the Tools Interface Version (TIV) concept? In LN, sometimes, you have to change the tiv number of the script to a lower number to assure backwards compatibility. There is more information in help about supported tiv numbers, at least for LN...<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!</div></div><hr />

We ever open session ttaad0500m000,but we don't know about this session. please tell me, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rberti</div><div class="date">29th October 2009, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I just saw that TIV concept is only avaliable on LN...<br />

Take a look at the topic down:<br />
<br />
<br />
SSA ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide<br />
<br />
 <br />
Tools Interface Version (TIV)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The Tools Interface Version (TIV) is a concept supported by the SSA ERP LN Enterprise Server to guarantee backwards compatibility. By setting a TIV number to each object the behaviour can be different for incompatible features executed with different versions of the porting set or SSA Enterprise Engine. The TIV number is a property of the program and library scripts, and can be defined in session &quot;Program Scripts / Libraries (ttadv2530m000)&quot;. The bshell also have its own TIV number.<br />
<br />
Supported TIV numbers<br />
The supported TIV numbers related to porting set versions are listed below.<br />
<br />
TIV Description <br />
0 - 999  Supported TIV levels for porting set 7.5a and 7.6a  <br />
1000 Initial TIV level for porting set 7.5a  <br />
1001 Ftp functions added for portingset 7.5x <br />
1010 Initial TIV level for porting set 7.6a  <br />
1011 Ftp functions added for portingset 7.6x <br />
1012 Functions for Outbound Publishing <br />
1020 New functions in Bundle 2 <br />
<br />
<br />
IÂ´ve had trouble once with some functions that didn't work within the tiv version I was, and there is also some posts about it in the forum.<br />
