Hello,<br />
i advise to attend a AA/AC/AD (Administration/Customization/Development) course at a local Infor Education Partner.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mnmhema</div><div class="date">12th April 2012, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">So there is no other way to learn it without attending course?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th April 2012, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you can try reading the baan help, downloading documents from infor and working with those.  None of which would be better than a class.  You can also try using ttadv2290m000 to generate some reporting sessions - but that will only give you the basic reporting session.  Some of this is not very intuitive.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
maybe on own background and skills there will be a way to do it by autodidactic methods.<br />
There is no Book expect the online developmentguide.<br />
<br />
Good knowledge about the Businessprocesses and Tablestructures is a must.<br />
<br />
Your profile says BaaN IV ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mnmhema</div><div class="date">12th April 2012, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. It is BaaN IV.<br />
Where can I find the course conducting places? Actually I would like to know about any places in Denmark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
attached a Curriculum Infor Baan IV - Tools from a official education center in Germany.<br />
<br />
Ask your local Infor contact for a education partner in Denmark, please.<br />
<br />
Have a look at : http://www.infor.com/services/education/emea/<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">13th April 2012, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is to hire an experienced tools consultant. If you know how to program he/she should be able to get you up and running in about 2 days. Of course you will have questions afterwards but that can probably handled by email of via a remote assistant tool.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">13th April 2012, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">One more way is to print tools documentation through ttadv7450m000 and morph it into a book which u can read and try at more ease . And not to forget is to  take help from this board  on problems u  face .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mnmhema</div><div class="date">14th April 2012, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I cannot find this session, ttadv7450m000. Can you tell me how I can find it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdittmar</div><div class="date">14th April 2012, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
at your BaaN IV Client choose :<br />
<br />
- Application<br />
<br />
- Run Program<br />
<br />
- Type in : ttadv7450m000 (Print user documentation)<br />
<br />
<br />
! Be sure to choose NO physical printer. Maybe it produces tons of paper :rolleyes:<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mnmhema</div><div class="date">17th April 2012, 09:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to Print User Documentation to a word document. The document contains only headings, otherwise there are just empty pages. Please help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">17th April 2012, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have inforxtrem-support-access? If you don't have access, go to www.inforxtreme.com and create a new account (this may take some time, till Infor activates your account.)<br />
<br />
With an active account you can access the documents and solutions provided by Infor.<br />
In Solution 22924522 you can find offline versions of the developer's guide to Infor ERP LN 6.1 (&quot;progguide&quot;).  There are differences to Baan 4 but you can use the basics and the function references.<br />
<br />
There's also an document giving examples how to program certain thinks. It's called &quot;Design Principles&quot;.  It's IMHO an &quot;How-To&quot;-collection, with lots of code-examples.<br />
<br />
In inforxtreme you can also access documentation of various products. There's an &quot;Infor ERP Enterprise Development Tools (LN) - Developer's Guide&quot; (U8883J US) available. Again it's LN-based but LN is based on Baan4, so it may help, too.<br />
<br />
