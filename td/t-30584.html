<br />
I have a problem in a Baan report:<br />
<br />
I have created a report and added it to a standard Baan session, as I can not modify the standard Baan session. This report is written to create a ASCII file, which is supposed to have a different file name (depending on the date it is run on) and it will be run in a job.<br />
<br />
The first thing i tried was to have the file name generated inside the report script and the predefined report variable spool.fileout will be replaced with the file name, this did not work.(this was in the before.report section)<br />
<br />
then the next one i tried was to have the same login to generate the file name in the report (in after.report section) and call a shell program inside the report to rename the file but it did not work (as the file was not there in the directory when the after.report section was executed.<br />
<br />
Please suggest if you know of any solutions.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dorleta</div><div class="date">30th January 2007, 14:02</div></div><div class="posttext">perhaps you can update the ttaad300.path in the before.program section of your report, but is not a smart solution.<br />
<br />
It vould be better a new device with a command asocciated for changing the file name.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
put the changing of spool.fileout in the &quot;before.program&quot; section of the reportscript, this maybe work.<br />
But you're able to write an ascii-file with seq.* also in reportscript.<br />
<br />
