Is the app on the baan server? If so then maybe the run.prog would work.  Not sure how else you could get it to work in batch mode.<br />

On our last mrp system we used files between the servers.  Our MRP system would generate a file, ftp in to a server.  The server had a job that would wake up every so often to process the file. We did this both ways, but since going to baan we no longer do this.<br />

Sorry I am no help.<br />

<br />
Try this: install samba server on unix and map unix box on the nt server. When the application on nt server has to start, have the jobmanager create a file on unix directory, the nt scheduler can than have a look a the semaphore file that is now created and start up the taks.<br />
