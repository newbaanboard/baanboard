<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lotius81</div><div class="date">14th November 2016, 21:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all,<br />
<br />
LN newcomer here. I'm putting together a report for production management. It sorts by planned start date, and also uses an after.field based on planned start date to show a subtotal (&quot;Total&quot; aggregate function) of planned production for a given date.<br />
<br />
The issue I'm running into is that every single line shows the subtotal. My guess is that because planned start date is stored as both date and time, that it is seeing the different times within a date and thinking it needs to show the subtotal every time. Is there a way (function or otherwise) in my after.field to strip down the planned start date and time field to only contain the mm-dd-yyy information so that this subtotals correctly? Or am I looking in the wrong direction?<br />
<br />
Much thanks,<br />
Rich</div></div><hr />

There are a bunch of threads on converting UTC date to a date.  This is just one such thread http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=55205&amp;highlight=UTC+Dates. From the threads I saw I would probably change the input field to the report to date field, then in the session script convert the UTC date to date using sprintf, then pass that to the report to be used.  Not a LN user so wait for one of them for more suggestions.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
use sprintf$() function like :<br />
<br />
string date.without.time(10)<br />
date.without.time = sprintf$(&quot;%D(%02m-%02d-%04Y)&quot;, tisfc001.prdt)<br />
<br />
<br />
Should give a string as mm-dd-yyyy<br />
<br />
For sorting a format like yyyymmdd is:<br />
<br />
date.without.time = sprintf$(&quot;%D(%04Y%02m%02d)&quot;, tisfc001.prdt)<br />
<br />
or<br />
tc.year, tc.week, tc.month<br />
<br />
year = val(sprintf$(&quot;%u(%04Y)&quot;,tisfc001.prdt))<br />
week = val(sprintf$(&quot;%u(%02W)&quot;,tisfc001.prdt))<br />
month = val(sprintf$(&quot;%u(%02m)&quot;,tisfc001.prdt))<br />
<br />

<br />
If have access to the program script, please check the following: year, weak, month and so on must be declared as &quot;extern&quot; so that they can be accessed by the report script (and they must be Input fields in your report, but that must be true to get them sorted).<br />
<br />
If you don't have acces to the program script, you still can do that. Have a look at my pretty old thread [URL=&quot;http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9090&amp;highlight=Advanced+Report&quot;]. This will enable you to set year, weak, month and so on as input fields (and sort by them) even if they can't be set by your program script -- it's up to you to set them in your Report script just before the sorting starts.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">18th November 2016, 08:16</div></div><div class="posttext">The Report writer takes all the records from the Program Script, sorts the records according to the input field and then displays the record to the OP. It doesnt take all the records and then sorts it while the layouts are getting displayed simultaneously. It doesnt work that way..<br />
<br />
What you could do is define a field like report.sort and declare it as a boolean. declare your after.field.report.sort, and the sub totals in that Layout. While in the detail section extract the date field from UTC and compare it with previous value, and if it is changed, change the value of the report.sort to true and then your Sub Totals will get displayed.<br />
<br />
Only thing is that you will need to supress the conditions where this after.field will get displayed where you dont want it. You would need to find that out.<br />
<br />
Also, the other thing would be when you would compare it with previous value sometimes you would get the same value even though it is a different record. This happens between the complex data interchange between PS and RW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lotius81</div><div class="date">18th November 2016, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Progress! :cool: I'm able to define an input field, set its value in the report script, and sort by it. I did that by using the function from Gunther's post. Now, in theory I should be able to make an after.field for my sorted input field and do the Total aggregate on that, right? And that should trigger my subtotal line. <br />
<br />
What's happening, though, is the very first line is a subtotal line with a subtotal value of 0 (picture attached). My input sort fields sequence is tisfc010.mcno (machine), then k.of.data.sfc010, and then new.concat.date (new date in format of yyyymmdd). Seems to be sorting correctly. Then I have an after.field layout for new.concat.date where the Total aggregate should give me a total of planned production for that date. I assume it gets triggered when new.concat.date changes, but apparently that isn't how it works.<br />
<br />
Following Gunther's advice at the bottom of my report script I have:<br />
<br />
#undef  r.write.seq.file()<br />
<br />
function extern r.write.seq.file()<br />
{<br />
    new.concat.date = val(sprintf$(&quot;%u(%04Y%02m%02d)&quot;,tisfc010.prdt))<br />
    ORIGINAL.FUNCTION()<br />
}<br />
<br />
and the appropriate declarations at the top per his link to his older post. That's where the 3rd sequence part of my sorted input gets assigned. I'm possibly doing something wrong in the layouts listing.<br />
<br />
And just as an FYI I appreciate the help you guys are offering up. It's helping me learn a lot very quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making more progress (pictured). I wasn't able to use the Total aggregate function, so I'm manually accumulating into a variable on each row until I hit the after.field. I put in OLDDATE: and NEWDATE: to try and see what values are being looked at in each row.<br />
<br />
One of my primary trip-ups in this whole process is understanding the flow of when certain variables are being assigned, processed, etc. Is there a flowchart, good documentation (I feel like I've looked everywhere) or something so I can get a better handle on what is happening when?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lotius81</div><div class="date">23rd November 2016, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Certainly. For starters I used gunther's advice for replacing the r.write.seq.file() function. This was so I could use my new.concat.date variable as a sorted input. Set them appropriately in the before.program section.<br />
<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
    domain tcmcs.long            old.concat.date<br />
    extern domain tcmcs.long     new.concat.date<br />
    extern domain tcbool         report.sort<br />
<br />
    #define ORIGINAL.FUNCTION()     originally.generated.r.write.seq.file()<br />
    #define r.write.seq.file()      ORIGINAL.FUNCTION()<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
functions:<br />
#undef  r.write.seq.file()<br />
function extern r.write.seq.file()<br />
{<br />
    new.concat.date = val(sprintf$(&quot;%u(%04Y%02m%02d)&quot;,tisfc010.prdt))<br />
    ORIGINAL.FUNCTION()<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
I used the after.receive.data section to determine when to trigger my subtotal line. Finding the after.receive.data section in the documentation was a big help. old.concat.date is initially set to 0 in the before.program section, so I used that in the if statement to suppress the first empty subtotal that was printing (since the first record's date and 0 are always different, it triggered a subtotal line immediately. a simple &quot;and old.concat.date &lt;&gt; 0&quot; fixed that). In my detail section, I manually accumulate the number that will be displayed in the subtotal line instead of using the aggregate, so I also zero it out here if the subtotal line boolean is true in order to start over.<br />
<br />
<br />
after.receive.data:<br />
    if new.concat.date &lt;&gt; old.concat.date and old.concat.date &lt;&gt; 0 then<br />
        report.sort = 1<br />
    else<br />
        report.sort = 0<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
    if report.sort = 1 then<br />
        subtotal = 0<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
detail.4:<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
    subtotal = subtotal + tisfc010.qpli<br />
<br />
    | some additional query code here...<br />
<br />
<br />
After the detail layout prints I use the after.layout to set the old.concat.date variable equal to the new (current record) date for use on the next iteration.<br />
<br />
<br />
after.layout:<br />
    old.concat.date = new.concat.date<br />
<br />
<br />
In my layouts, my after.field triggers on the new.concat.date input field created earlier. The output expression is &quot;report.sort = 1&quot;. And presto. It sorts based on date only and not time!</div></div><hr />
