<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ysovva</div><div class="date">2nd June 2011, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally I am trying  to run a  report session from the print option of some session. The report session was created with &quot;dynamic form&quot; and has 3 groups appearing as different forms. <br />
All I wanted to do is to run the report session with group.invisible() function depending on the selected session in report choice in the main session. I did not find any solution for choice.&lt;session&gt; so I created the menu that calls in all 3 records of it to a 3GL script and depends on the procesinfo$ variable to run from 3GL to the report session with special instruction. The new problem: the variable procesinfo$ has no value in 3GL. Perhaps I am missing the &lt;bic_interface&gt; functionality , but it already contains a &quot;main&quot; function declaration, so I can't use itâ€¦  Can anybody advice?</div></div><hr />
