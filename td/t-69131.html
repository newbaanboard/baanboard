<br />
<br />
We are trying to set up EDI processing for our customer in ERPLN 10.4 environment. The customer is sending us the requirement in EDI file EANCOM D.96A â€“ 008 standard format (attached with the incident). <br />
<br />
We looked into the ERPLN system to map this file using EDI conversion setup, but we are not sure if LN could handle the file in its original format. Does ERPLN need to have the file converted to some other format before this can be imported through LN EDI? If so, where can I find some sample format that needs to be used?<br />
<br />
Please look into this and suggest any help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jatin</div></div><hr />

ERPLN is using an own internal EDI format called BEMIS (Baan Electronic Message Interchange System). <br />
Conversion of the internal standard to an external EDI standard (like VDA, EDIFACT,etc.) and vice  versa must be performed by an external EDI Translator.<br />
<br />
For a first starting point to use Baan/ERPLN EDI please refer to http://edi.baan.com/<br />
Here you will find a lot of ducuments<br />

<br />
Thanks for your response on this. I found documents that give good insight on the file setup for Orders IN / OUT.<br />
<br />
Is it possible, if you have a sample file for Incoming ORD001 that I could refer and you could share that with me.<br />
<br />
I just need to understand the format difference based on Conversion setups that was imported through 'default.edi' file.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
normally don't have a problem to share an example file here but in that case make not sense because we don't use the standard ERPLN EDI formats.<br />
<br />
Coming from our BaanIV EDI history we are using our own EDI conversion set-ups (similar to the BaanIV EDI formats) with a lower number of levels and a different structure in the EDI conversion definitions.<br />
Maybe someone else which is using the standard EDI set-up can share an example here.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jatin_sanghi</div><div class="date">2nd August 2016, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Benito / Juergen,<br />
<br />
With the sample file shared, I have had some level of success. I tried my set with reduced fields and was able to have data populated in 'saved messages'.<br />
<br />
Will try further to go all the way.<br />
<br />
Thanks Again,<br />

<br />
I'm doing well and thanks for asking.. :)<br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure out how could we handle the conversion of item codes in the incoming ORD001 file from EAN code to our internal item codes. I do not see any conversion tables for item codes, but there is something called Item Code IDs. How could they be used for conversion purposes?<br />
<br />
Please suggest.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jatin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jatin_sanghi</div><div class="date">3rd August 2016, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I got it...it has to be handled using the item code system and then linking BP items to ERPLN items in alternative items.</div></div><hr />
