<br />
I'm having trouble with a multi-occurence screen.<br />
At the end of each row there is a yes/no box which creates or deletes a record in another table.<br />
With a lot of select for update 's I've minimalized the 206 fatal errors, but because I can't get the record to REALLY save when I switch to a new occurence the last input value of the yes/no field is remembered.<br />
So when you hit the Save-button all the values for all occurences are correct, except the yes/no field doesn't 'refresh' with each occurence. If I ended with a 'Yes' al the No's I selected will be turned into a Yes when I hit the save button...<br />
<br />
So I am trying to find some kind of function which saves my record after each occurence and not just at the end of the screen or when I hit save and save all occurences on screen.<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

       execute(update.db)<br />

somewhere in your script - possibly in the after.choice section of the standard option choice.modify.set<br />

<br />
because your yesno field is not part of the maintable, you have to store it in your own array, that you can check later for your actions. There is a predefined variable 'actual.occ' for this.<br />
<br />
Here is an example:<br />
Lets say you have 10 occurences in the form.<br />
<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
extern domain tcyesno   inp.yesno          <br />
           domain tcyesno  inp.yesno2(10)  <br />
<br />
field.inp.yesno:<br />
after.field:<br />
    inp.yesno2(actual.occ) = inp.yesno<br />
<br />
main.table.io:<br />
before.rewrite:<br />
    if  inp.yesno2(actual.occ) = tcyesno.yes then<br />
|       do something ...<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
This code is of course not complete, but I hope you can see what I mean.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow I read the last post wrong....<br />
No db.retry.points or commit transactions... I'll have to look into that thnx ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
But the array thing might just do the trick, so I'll ask eric_s to change that for me :)<br />
And if he doesn't I'll change it in 3 weeks when I get back from a well deserved holliday :cool: <br />
<br />
Anyways thanx in advance and I'll let you know if it works!</div></div><hr />

2bad, but hey at least it works now ;)</div></div><hr />
