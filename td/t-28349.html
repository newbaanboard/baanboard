<br />
  I am trying to read a barcode file in ascii format and upload it in the table <br />
for that m using the script i have attached , the program runs gives a message file updated successfully but the data is not getting updated in the table .<br />
<br />
Please go through the script and guide me .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you do not need the select statement in the get.update.tisfc021() funtion.  I would run it in debug mode(check variables) and make sure that there are not duplicate values on the index for tisfc021.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 22:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, Like Mark said - it's that Select statement.  You will not get to the selectdo part unless there is a record to select, and you will then get a duplicate if you try the db.insert, and you skip dups, so you would never get an error.<br />
<br />
Did you mean to put a db.update instead?  The correct format to Insert OR Update is:<br />
<br />
<br />
select for update (as usual)<br />
selectdo<br />
         assign changed variables<br />
         db.update<br />
selectempty<br />
         assign all table fields<br />
         db.insert<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Committing after each record is OK (or if you have a lot of updates you could use a count and commit every 50 records is the standard)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanx for ur replies , i forgot to mention that i tried to debug the script but it was not giving ne error cause its not calling the function get.update.tisfc021()<br />
as its not entering the while loop at all , as the file.ptr value is not meeting the condition <br />
<br />
Please guide me<br />
<br />

<br />
thanx mark , i tried ur suggestions , it worked fine , but the problem now is if i use seq.open() , it works fine , reads the file from the server , but since i want it to read the file from client , i used seq.open.local() , but here its not reading the file atall , its opening but not reading <br />
<br />
please comment<br />

You might be able to try a search using seq.open.local - it seems to me my problem was eol characters between the client and unix servers.  It was just easier to use the below method - the file_err routine basically says &quot;Problem opening file&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
function domain tcbool open_file()<br />
{<br />

<br />
| Open PC file to make sure it exists.<br />
        inputfile = seq.open.local(input.file,&quot;r&quot;,0)<br />
        if(inputfile&lt;0) then<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NirajKakodkar</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi mark ,<br />
<br />
Now i used client2server function and copy the file from client to server and read the file from server using seq.open and not opening the local file directly <br />
<br />
This works fine , but it is like an extra overhead , extra traffic on the network <br />
<br />
so i tried to research a lil more on seq.open.local <br />
<br />
  <br />
  fp = seq.open.local(fname, &quot;r&quot;,0)<br />
  if fp &lt; 1 then <br />
	mess(&quot;zmadms0036&quot;, 1, fname)		|* File Opening Error: %1$s<br />
	return(-1)<br />
  endif<br />
  if fp &gt;= 1 then<br />
	 |while  not seq.gets(buffer, 250, fp)<br />
         while seq.read.local(buffer , fpl , fp) &gt;= 0 <br />
	db.retry.point()<br />
err=string.scan(buffer,&quot;%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s&quot;,slno,grwt,pano,doscan,prtno,slvwt,timscan)<br />
<br />
 here i found that earlier in seq.open when we use seq.gets it reads line by line of the file but here in case of seq.read.local , the entire content of the file is stored in buffer , and in next iteration buffer gets blank and only one record could be updated in the table<br />
<br />
Could you suggest something<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several threads about seq.read.local - this is just onethread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=27650&amp;highlight=seq.read.local) of many.  The only thing I can suggest is that you read 1 character at a time (building your buffer) until you hit CR/LF character.  Then process that record, and do the same for the next record.  Personally I think that unless your file is MB's in size there is not enough overhead to cause a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NirajKakodkar</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 07:05</div></div><div class="posttext">hi ,<br />
I forgot to mention that i tried<br />
 using while seq.read.local and then using a condition<br />
if (buffer&lt;&gt;&quot;\0&quot;) to check for next line but then it stores entire content in the buffer and \r \0 is ignored i  guess<br />
<br />
can we use something like seq.gets with seq.read.local , i tried using seq.gets but didnt worked<br />
<br />
Ne suggestion<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">But did you set your buffer length to one?  From the example you still have 250 in the record.<br />
<br />
string buffer(1)     | 1 Character buffer<br />
string record(250) | Hold 1 complete record<br />
fp = seq.open.local(fname, &quot;r&quot;,0)<br />
if fp &lt; 1 then <br />
	mess(&quot;zmadms0036&quot;, 1, fname) |* File Opening Error: %1$s<br />
	return(-1)<br />
endif<br />
if fp &gt;= 1 then<br />
while seq.read.local(buffer , 1 , fp) &gt;= 0 <br />
	if buffer = cr or lf then<br />
		process.record()<br />
		record = &quot;&quot;<br />
	else<br />
		record = record &amp; buffer<br />
	endif<br />
endwhile<br />
<br />
function process record()<br />
{<br />
	err=string.scan(buffer,&quot;%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s&quot;,slno,grwt,pano,doscan,prtno,slvwt,timscan)<br />
	.....<br />
}<br />
<br />
Above is something like I was talking about. I am not sure exactly what buffer would look like when you hit the CR/LF, but this was what I was talking about</div></div><hr />
