a userexit does't work against / with session. It works with table<br />
<br />
So userexit for tdpur4100m900 works on table tdpur400.<br />
Named : tdpur400ue<br />

User Exit DLL Overview<br />
Overview<br />
<br />
A User Exit DLL (UEDLL) is a DLL that will reside outside the standard software. It will have the same name as a standard DAL with the extension 'ue' (for 'user exit'). E.g. 'whinh200ue' for table whinh200. Customers can implement a UEDLL in order to be able to define extra business logic before and after the standard 'before' and 'after' handling of saves and deletes, by means of specific hooks that will be executed by the 4GL engine and/or DAL Engine. In this way it is possible to e.g. conditionally publish data changes to the outside world.<br />
<br />
Interaction with 4GL Engine / DAL Engine<br />
<br />
When present, the User Exit DLL for a certain table will be loaded by the 4GL engine/DAL Engine by the time the DAL for this particular table will be loaded. In situations where no DAL is present this will be the moment at which a DAL would be loaded if it existed. This means that there is no need to have a DAL in order to make use of the UEDLL.<br />
<br />
Preconditions<br />
<br />
A DLL becomes a UEDLL when it meets the following conditions:<br />
<br />
Its name is consisting of the table code with 'ue' as suffix, like whinh200ue<br />
It includes bic_dal, as follows: #include &lt;bic_dal&gt;<br />
Restrictions<br />
<br />
A UEDLL is treated like a regular DAL. This means all kind of DAL related functionality can be used, like:<br />
<br />
Function with.old.object.values.do()<br />
Function with.object.set.do()<br />
Pre-defined variable subdal<br />
Note however that the following restrictions apply:<br />
<br />
Business methods cannot be implemented in a UEDLL Instead the business logic should be programmed in another (separate) general DLL.<br />
It is strongly discouraged to define other external functions in a UEDLL and link the UEDLL directly to other scripts. Instead, use a normal general DLL. (This also applies to regular DALs).<br />
User Exit Hooks<br />
<br />
A UEDLL script can contain the following hooks:<br />
<br />
ue.before.before.save.object()<br />
ue.after.before.save.object()<br />
ue.before.after.save.object()<br />
ue.after.after.save.object()<br />
ue.before.before.destroy.object()<br />
ue.after.before.destroy.object()<br />
ue.before.after.destroy.object()<br />
ue.after.after.destroy.object()<br />
