<br />
Your table seems to be in a different package combination. So, you need to run the CRDD for the package combination where your table belongs.<br />
<br />
Also, you need to select Reconfigure tables as well while running the CRDD for table.<br />
<br />
Once CRDD is ran, you need to log out and log back in. Then, you can run create table and your table will be created.<br />
<br />
I suggest you go through some Admin training session or some documentation before approaching to CRDD as its a critical process and might cause data loss if something goes wrong. Always have a backup before running it if you are not sure about the process.</div></div><hr />
