<br />
How can I ignore records in a report script? Based on some conditions I would like to skip the current record and get the next one from the session script.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
after.receive.data:<br />
  if ( tppdm600.cprj = &quot;ABCDEF&quot; ) then<br />
    | this record should not taken into account in this report<br />
    ...receive next data...<br />
  endif<br />
<br />
Is this possible is some or another way?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Douwe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">4th October 2002, 14:27</div></div><div class="posttext">One method is to process the record, but let it pass through without printing it on the report.  For example:<br />
<br />
<br />
|********************* DETAIL.10.LAYOUT<br />
detail.10:<br />
before.layout:<br />
if ( tppdm600.cprj = &quot;ABCDEF&quot; ) then<br />
lattr.print = false<br />
else<br />
| process record as usual...<br />
endif<br />
<br />
A second method is by not even sending that record to the report script.  Put this into the selectdo clause of your select statement.<br />
<br />
if ( tppdm600.cprj = &quot;ABCDEF&quot; ) then<br />
| do nothing<br />
else<br />
| process record as usual...<br />
rprt_send()<br />
endif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for your response. Unfortunately I've no access to the programscript, so the second method is not an option.<br />
<br />
The first one (excluding the record from processing) is a lot of work in my case, because there are many places in the reportscript where I should do this. That's why I am looking for a way to just ignore the current record and read the next one.<br />
<br />
With kindly regards, Douwe.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for helping me. I've been studying the code of Marks solution. It really is a nice workaround! But in my case isn't the code below a solution? Or am I overlooking something?<br />
<br />
<br />
after.receive.data:<br />
  while ( tppdm600.cprj = &quot;ABCDEF&quot; ) <br />

<br />
I tried, but the last record is causing some problems. If the last record should be skipped then the program enters a endless loop. So I changed the code a bit:<br />
<br />
after.receive.data:<br />
  while ( ( tppdm600.cprj = &quot;ABCDEF&quot; ) and ( e = 0 ) )<br />
    | this record should not taken into account in this report<br />
    r.read.seq.file()<br />
  endwhile<br />
<br />
But with the code above the last record is always printed, even if it shouldn't. What can I do to notify the report that there are no more records to process?<br />
<br />
    ...<br />
  endwhile<br />
  if ( e &lt;&gt; 0 ) then<br />
    | no more records to process<br />
    | don't even process the last record read<br />
    ... finish off the report without printing the last record<br />
  endif<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
With kindly regards, Douwe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doornbos</div><div class="date">10th October 2002, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I implemented the workaround provided by Mark.<br />
<br />
<br />
after.receive.data<br />
  if (first = 0) then<br />
    r.o = seq.open(r.datafile$ &amp; &quot;.tmp&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)<br />
    r.reccount = 0<br />
    while (e = 0)<br />
      if ( tppdm600.cprj &lt;&gt; &quot;ABCDEF&quot; ) then<br />
        l = seq.puts(r.recbuf$, r.o)<br />
        r.reccount = r.reccount + 1<br />
      endif<br />
      r.read.seq.file()<br />
    endwhile<br />
    l = seq.flush(r.o)<br />
    l = seq.close(r.o)<br />
    l = seq.close(r.lfn)<br />
    r.lfn = seq.open(r.datafile$ &amp; &quot;.tmp&quot;, &quot;a+&quot;)<br />
    first = 1<br />
  endif<br />
<br />
<br />
This seems to work. One final question: How important is r.reccount? I write r.recbuf$ containing the 'old' r.reccount in stead of seq.puts with a concat of all (in my case appr. 50) fields. Should I expect some side affects because of this, which I did not notice until now?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th October 2002, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I can not remember what the r.reccount was used for - I will go test this in a report I am working on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th October 2002, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not think you have any problems with r.reccount.  It looks like it is only used in the r.write.seq.file.<br />
<br />
Also I notices that when e became -1 it went to the r.afters() section. So maybe this would have worked using your code:<br />
<br />
after.receive.data:<br />
    while ( tppdm600.cprj = &quot;ABCDEF&quot; )<br />
         if e=0 then<br />
            r.read.seq.file()<br />
         else<br />
            r.afters()<br />
         endif<br />
    endwhile<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course this is just a guess, but I am curious.<br />

<br />
The r.afters() call is resulting in some fatal errors. So I stick to the 'replace datafile' solution which is working ok.<br />
<br />
Fatal error: r.sorttab index 0 buiten dimensie [1] 4<br />
<br />
Another question was bubbling up: If I'm right the number of fields in a datafile record is checked. When adding a new sort field, how did you keep the number of fields in the datafile the same?<br />
<br />
Eddie and Mark, thank you for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th October 2002, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">What we did was add tipgc001.cplb to the input fields.  The report then expected the correct number of fields and this field was always empty.<br />
Actually we added it as a sort field, but it doesn't do anything until we populate it and sort it in the script.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doornbos</div><div class="date">25th October 2002, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, it's me again,<br />
<br />
I need a function to abort the printing process. When there are no records left after the filtering, the report still prints the last record read from the old datafile. So I would like to add someting like<br />
<br />
if ( r.reccount = 0 ) then<br />
  | abort printing<br />
  ....<br />
endif<br />
<br />
I tried the end() function but that doesn't work. The headers of the report are still printed then. Setting lattr.enddata to true doesn't work either (it's a readonly var after all). <br />
<br />
Anybody any idea how to abort the printing process from a report script.<br />
<br />
With kindly regard,<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
   stopprint = false<br />
<br />
After.receive.data:<br />
  if r.reccount = 0 then<br />
     stopprint = true<br />
     ...exit this routine....<br />
  endif<br />
<br />
heading.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
   if stopprint then<br />

<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
   if stopprint then<br />
     lattr.print = false<br />
   endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Or you could stopprint in the output expression of the layouts.  Just some thoughts.<br />
