<br />
I have 2 similar tables.    The table definations of these 2 tables are the same.  One table is a transaction table, while the other is a archive.<br />
<br />
I want a display session which will first find a record in the transaction table, if the record is not found in this table, it should search for the record in the archive table.  I don't want to use form fields instead of table fields as there are around 30 fields on the form.<br />
<br />
What I was thinking of was if the record is not found in the transaction table, zoom to a different session which will be based on the archive table.  But the problem in this is that the next, previous options will not work properly.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">14th May 2004, 22:52</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestion is to make a report :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
The sessions are run by a main table, no getting around that.  It will look up the records from that table, you can filter as you like, but how will it know 'if it doesn't exist'......<br />
<br />
That logic may be more straightforward for a report.<br />
<br />
One possible solution is to create a 'dummy' table with the same definition as these 2.  Make that the main table for the session.  During the before program section, fill that table using your logic, then they can browse as needed.  Clear the table on exit or clear it before you refill it each time.<br />
Other hurdles would remain, what if multiple users come in - you could set an application lock..or put fields on the dummy table to identify who is in.<br />
<br />
Or do a report...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible to display data from 2 tables in a display session. <br />
<br />
In the form use the fields from table 1 only. <br />
<br />
In the script, for the section &quot;init.form&quot;. select data from table 1 and in selectempty write another select from table2 and then in the selectdo of the sub query assign each field in table1 (that is defined in the form) the value that is selected from table2. <br />
<br />
Write the same for &quot;choice.next.set&quot; and for &quot;choice.prev.set&quot; and this should serve the purpose.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of help to you. In case of any clarification let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />

Use a timestamp - possibly including even the milliseconds if seconds are not unique enough - as unique key.<br />

Good luck!<br />

thanx for the replies.<br />
I think I will go with John's suggestion.</div></div><hr />

I have a similar problem where the user want to see the data from the main table, but also see detail information from a secondary table.

because standard program returns only the number of records from 1 company<br />
and main.table.io will be done only as per number of records in 1 company.<br />
<br />
Earlier in this forum it has been concluded use of compnr in query.extension will<br />
not work because Baan stores indices company wise.<br />
<br />
As suggested the report will be an apprpriate choice for this purpose</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sachin03</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hitesh,<br />
The 2 tables which I am refering to are from the same company having similar table defination.  They are not same table from different companies.</div></div><hr />

Baan standard program will work with only the main table defined and main.table.io read sections will be as per the main table .</div></div><hr />

Hitesh, I have the Gemini install CDs but not the help manuals. But I heard that the new tools supports multi-main table. Maybe it is possible to display data from 2 different tables in a single session. I am not sure for now. I will update the thread when I have more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janneman</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 22:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Gemini has indeed multi main table functionality, but Shasin seems to work on B40_c which hasn't. Also was mentioned into the main question that the second table was a archive table. Further on into the discussion it was mentioned that the archive table was into the same company as the first table is.<br />
I asume, that the archive table will not be used for update (it is archived), thus read only should be sufficient. In that case with some customization the second table can be read into the selectempty of the main-table like mentioned by John and the fields should be grayed-out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">5th June 2004, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Prashanth/ Janneman<br />
Even in Baan IV  one can have information from multiple tables if there<br />
is clearly defined join. (e.g. tfgld4511s000 brings information from<br />
3 big tables albeit only for  fewrecords only).<br />
<br />
In Baan V too, DAL has nice query.extends to accomplish this objective.<br />
<br />
Now taking a very  hypothetical example  with index values of 2 tables with 3 records (what sachin requires)<br />
<br />
Table 1 index values (Main)	<br />
A	<br />
B	<br />
Q	<br />
<br />
Table 2 index values (Archieve)<br />
B<br />
E<br />
R<br />
<br />
Now sachin's requirement is to display only 5 records from these 2 tables<br />
containing 6 records in the following order . Sachin, correct the it if wrong.<br />
<br />
A<br />
B (Not to display B twice)<br />
E<br />
Q<br />
R<br />
<br />
Janneman, Can u give some code with sections details to display the fields these way. Can u display the non-indexed 6 records in a multi-occ form without using form-fields.<br />
<br />
Prashanth, When u update the forum after ur Gemini tests , following matters will be interesting to know.<br />
<br />
1. How &amp; when the combined records are indexed and displayed.Will there be composite combined index for both tables.<br />
2. Will that eliminate duplicate record (like B above)<br />
3. Is this specific to same table in different company or <br />
applicable to Sachin's situation.<br />
4. sundries like validations , index order descriptions etc</div></div><hr />

I got the Gemini instance working. There are many tools changes, have to go through a lot of documentation...  :) <br />
<br />
Here is some info I found -<br />
To use a Multi Main Table session<br />
A Multi Main Table (MMT)  session is a combination of multiple sessions,<br />
each of which has a unique main table.<br />
MMT sessions are especially designed to present data with a typical parentchild<br />
structure, for example:<br />
.. Sales order and the related sales order lines<br />
.. Financial business partner group and the related ledger accounts and<br />
control accounts<br />
.. Work order and the related work order activity lines, work order material<br />
resources, work order other resources, work order measurements, and<br />
work order hours accounting<br />
Although this data is distributed among several main-tables in the system,<br />
the data can all be presented and edited from a single parent/child session.<br />
This enables users to enter data quickly and to maintain a good overview in<br />
their work.<br />
A typical parent-child session has two areas:<br />
.. The upper part contains information and functionality about the parent<br />
.. The lower part contains one or more lists that show data about the various<br />
types of children<br />
1-12 | To get started<br />
Both parent data and child data can be edited inside the session, which<br />
makes the sessions extremely powerful for data entry. In addition, a<br />
parent/child session also offers the user a complete overview of all the<br />
important data related to the object. The following figure shows an example<br />
of a parent/child session:<br />
Figure 1-3 Sample parent-child MMT: Service Order - Lines (tssoc2100m100)<br />
For detailed information on MMT sessions, refer to Multi Main Table<br />
sessions in the SSA Enterprise Server online help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw the screen dump and it's quite better than the interactive sessions of Baan IV.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A Multi Main Table (MMT) session is a combination of multiple sessions,<br />
each of which has a unique main table.<br />
<br />
<br />
As earlier discussed , the basic main table logic still remains the same . 1 main table per 1 session.<br />
<br />
However this is something very good development for developers as well as users because UI is very good and development time will be much faster.</div></div><hr />

Here is a better example of MMT. This is the details session of the standard session - Table Definitions- ttadv4520m000.</div></div><hr />
