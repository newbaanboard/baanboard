Just pass the tdcpp001.textn to the report and put it in a layout.  Baan will take of pulling the text for the report.<br />

<br />
i went into tttxt010 and searched for the text no. 6589 which was there in my customized table, but could not find the details for my record. why that so ???<br />

<br />
As Mark hinted, if you simply include your text-field in the report, the Baan Text-Manager does the job in the background of &quot;reconstituting&quot; the text and figuring line-breaks etc. for the report. <br />

<br />
As u told u tried it , by taking table field of text data type on report &amp; it worked.<br />
<br />
As u said that it is stored in sequence 1, 2 , 3 depening upon line no., so if i want to print only first 2 lines , then i will have to take first 2 lines in to 2 variable and then print it in report . RIGHT ??<br />
<br />
but where is this text stored ... the data which i typed in text window ? just wanted to know out of curiosity.<br />

<br />
Yes - if you wanted only the first two lines you could use text.to.buf to put it into an array variable.  Then just print the first two lines. <br />

<br />
if you want only to print the first two lines for a text in a report, you can set the maximum number of text lines to the value 2 in &quot;Maintain Report Fields&quot;. <br />

<br />
Thanks for all the help, well i found the mistake which i was doing , i was searching the text in wrong co. , i thought since it's a tools table then it must be only present in 000 co., but later i figured out that it was in 230 co. that's my test co.<br />
<br />
Also i was able to achieve printing 2 lines only by doing it at Report Input Field Value.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks all of u for this timely info.<br />
