<br />
Anyway, lets stick, what your HR person wants. I think the most trivial would be to store the pdf's either on a file share or in something like sharepoint. Then yiu just need a simple session in Baan, which open the IO or any other explorer/tool to display the file.<br />
<br />
I did this years ago and it worked like a charm.</div></div><hr />

I dont want to put the files on shared location. I want to keep the files on BaaN Server which is unix based. Let me explain the senario again..<br />
<br />
There is a person who calls the candidates and a person who sees all the resumes available in the records and post some reply to call the candidate or not.<br />
<br />
Person - 1 Enters the details of the candidates in baan and upload the resume and that my session will make a link to the records with the uploaded file.<br />
<br />
Person -2 : Here he can see all the records recorded by Person-1 and by selecting the records he wants to see resume of the selected candidate.<br />
<br />
If Person-1 will load the resume to other location than he has to entere link of each candidate in baan records which me create problem of accurecy.<br />
