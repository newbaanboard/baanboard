But, from the backend he can create the document (by the name of that script), and can open for view/edit from BaaN.<br />
I think that is what you wanted to know!!</div></div><hr />

If they already have source for that script, then they should either delete the source or you should replace it with the new source.  Otherwise, if someone did a compile later on, it could work and overwrite the object you delivered with something that is out of date.</div></div><hr />
