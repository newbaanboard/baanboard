<br />
I made similar report with columns: opening balance - purchase - prod issue - prod receipt - sales - misc - closing balance. The report comes out real fast on our system with 1000+ items and 1 year of operational data. I'd suggest you do the summary by using SELECT sum(field) rather than summing manually under the SELECTDO. To make sure you're summing the correct thing use the WHERE clause to better narrow down the selection and please use index as much as you can in the WHERE clause. This technique works well for us<br />

hp, sorry for referring you as Carol several times. I confused you with another user called hpcarol. Both of your user names start with hp. I changed all your name in my posting to hp. Sorry :p</div></div><hr />
