<br />
In the session Maintain Tables, there is a button &lt;Indexes&gt;. Using that, you can create your new index.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dwestrick</div><div class="date">23rd January 2002, 22:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I realize I can &quot;enter&quot; an index there, but what do I do to make it take effect?  Do I need to convert to data dictionary again, or what?  I keep getting errors when trying to access a table I've tried to add a new index to.....</div></div><hr />

You must convert your change to runtime.    If it is the first time creating the table you use create runtime.  You then have to exit Baan and come back.  You should see your change in General Table Maintenance then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, of course, you would have to issue a 'Convert to Runtime DD' from the Application drop-down. After that completes, EXIT the BSHELL and restart the BSHELL. Only then you should be able to use the new index.<br />
<br />
When you do the 'Convert to Runtime DD', ensure that you have checked 'Reconfigure Table' flag, because that is what 'establishes' the new index.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dwestrick</div><div class="date">24th January 2002, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The first error I actually get right now is when trying to reconfigure the table (in Convert to Runtime DD) - drop original table error 113, and it doesn't complete....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">24th January 2002, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Error 113  means table is locked.   You mentioned that it is an existing table.   People can't be accessing that table when you convert.  Depending on what table - if it has references to others etc, everyone should be off the system when you run your convert to run time.  This includes any locks you placed earlier in your processes, so you should exit and come back in to run the convert on a clean shell, with everyone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dwestrick</div><div class="date">24th January 2002, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally managed to get this task accomplished!  I think my problem was that I was trying to convert to runtime dd and reconfigure the table from within Maintain Table Definitions...  As soon as I got out of that session and tried it, it worked like a charm!<br />

Thanks everyone for your help! :)</div></div><hr />
