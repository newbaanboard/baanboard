I have made a query and in the script added some more data.<br />
Based on the added data I would like to set the order of lines/group by...<br />
Can I make this somehow ? I tried mathings, but the &quot;group by&quot; is preferably stated from the query.<br />
Thanks for help</div></div><hr />

Or<br />
 <br />
2)  recall your report from the report script and send the detail data and Extra data  to and and kill the 1st report <br />
<br />
lets say ... your report is 'A.rpt' , copy it to A.rpt_1 ( not sure if you need create a copy , might as well work with same report , you can try that out)<br />
<br />
when you run the easy SQL ---&gt; A.rpt  opens up and the report scripts run <br />
<br />
open the A.rpt_1 with help of brp fuctions and send the detail data and extra data from  A.rpt to  A.rpt_1<br />
<br />
and kill A.rpt on  after.program of A.rpt's report script<br />
<br />
FloW:<br />
<br />
Easysql --&gt; report + extra data --&gt; report 2</div></div><hr />
