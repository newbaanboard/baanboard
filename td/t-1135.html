to the last Library I had &quot;opened&quot; using my login.<br />
<br />
How is this done? <br />
<br />
Here is the my other question ... <br />
Today when I started &quot;Maintain Libraries&quot; (ttadv2131m000), it defaulted to a DLL I had never worked on. <br />
Does that indicate that somebody has been using my login ?<br />
If yes, how do I confirm that?<br />
<br />
Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">22nd February 2002, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">This information is stored in the user defaults table (ttadv990 company 0).  It by user, company (0 for tools), and session.  For ttadv2131m000 (and some other similar sessions), it appears that there are several sequence numbers (so multiple rows) that define PVRC, library, etc. that is being maintained.<br />
<br />
As to your second question, I can't say for certain.  It sure appears that your login was used, however.</div></div><hr />

This would probably cause it to default to the first DLL in alphabetical order.  Is that the one you got?</div></div><hr />

How do I check it in UNIX?<br />
My UNIX admin was able to give me the list of logins.<br />
But these were the times I had used telnet/reflection.<br />
And not ... the times I had used BW Client to connect to Baan.<br />
I guess the UNIX admin was able to give me only the times<br />
I had logged on to the server and not the times I had executed Baan.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
p.s. My admins here are not &quot;Baan&quot; experts</div></div><hr />
