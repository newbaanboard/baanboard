<br />
When I use function wait.and.activate() the calling process (parent) is not put in waiting, yet continues executing. Anyone an idea on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">1st August 2006, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just quickly played around with this a bit. I found that the process group of the called process is a NEW process group = child's pid, instead of it being the same group as the parent. Also when trying using set.prgrp() after wait.and.activate() (before that I have no pid for the child) for the child's process, the result is negative, tried this in both parend and child process. Also variable background (therefor) stays 0 in child process.<br />
<br />
I did see in the manual that the parent will only sleep when child is in same process group as parent. However, it is also mentioned in the manual that &quot;by default&quot; the child is always activated within the same process group as the parent..<br />
<br />
Looks like a bug in Baan 5(.0B)...? Will log a case by support as well. Will post any relevant updates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried using zoom.to$() or more appropriate start.session(). the latter has the option of specifying start mode for the new session which is MODAL in your case.<br />
Im not sure about availability of start.session in baan 5, but its available in ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Let us know your findings.<br />

<br />
It looks like a bug in BaaN 5 :(</div></div><hr />

I have tried start.session(), and the same problem.<br />

Yes it is<br />

George, in Baan 5.0B you are actually not meant to use zoom.to$ anymore (although the function is still available). This function is used for backward compatibility only. Instead you should use function start.session(). I have however tried zoom.to$ as well, and both processes are started in different groups, not in same!<br />
<br />
I have just a guess: it may have to do with the different session/form types. The parent session is a single-occ, and the child is a multi-occ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I tried (in baan 5b) was a 3GL script that zooms to a &quot;Modal Window with a menu&quot; session and the form was &quot;multi-occ + main&quot;. However, when I tried this code in LN it didn't work. I needed to use start.session().<br />
<br />
Edit: When you use start.sesion the first parametter must be &quot;MODAL&quot;<br />
<br />
MODAL The parent session is blocked until the child session exits, in case of a multi-occurrence the session will be started as a zoom session.<br />
