<br />
We are running BaaN IV c4 as our backend and Baan e-sales with e-configuration as the customerÂ’s front end (shop). This all works fine for years now, but we still have one problem. In the shop the pricing for standard items works very well, but there is no pricing for configurable (generic) items. So the customers can not see how much the configuration is. We do have all the configuration in the backend system (PCF) and we want to know if it is possible to calculate the price for generic items outside from the baan backend. Is there a standard procedure to get the price from the backend? Or a dll, boi, java appl.? Maybe some one knows how to do that.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help!<br />

<br />
There is an add-on software that allows both configuration and price calculation of generic items outside of Baan. <br />
<br />
All the features, options, constraints, price rules, etc. of the generic items are extracted and made available outside of Baan.  <br />
<br />
The software is used in production at Baan customers in North-America and Scandinavia for the purpose of quoting generic items outside of Baan.<br />
<br />
More information can be found in the attached PDF-file.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
