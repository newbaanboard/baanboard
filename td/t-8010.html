<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">5th September 2003, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
 I have carefully read the two threads. But this does not solve my problem. <br />
<br />
 I have succeded in printing a company logo on the report, using a font creation program, just like you have mentioned. So I know this procedure.<br />
<br />
 We developed a special package for Human Resources Department. For every employee a picture is saved in a certain path. In Baan you can see the picture of every employee by clicking on a button (which executes appl.start(...)) . Everything works fine.<br />
<br />
 We also want to print the picture (.jpg, for ex) on the report. The font creation program is too difficult to use since there is a large number of pictures to be converted to font - 500. The employees come and go quite often so I do not like this solution.<br />
<br />
 I thought about opening the report with a device which opens the report with MSWord. I want Baan to send MSWord the &quot;command&quot; to open a certain picture in a path and insert it in the report. <br />
<br />
 I did not succed. I tried :<br />
HYPERLINK &quot;picture&quot; &quot;\\servername\pictures\picture.jpg&quot;<br />
INSERTPICTURE &quot;\\servername\pictures\picture.jpg&quot;<br />
<br />
but I did not succed. The real name of the file picture.jpg depend on the code of the employee. For example, employee 2522 has a picture 2252.jpg in a certain path. (the path is in a parameter table). So the full path to the file can easily be concaternated in a string.<br />
<br />
 If I knew Visual Basic I think it would have been easier for me....<br />
<br />
 What should I do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
However u can use Baan reporting to write the output fields to a file , transfer the file to client and invoke your exe in after program section of the report. Your exe (may be in VB / VFP etc) should print the image easily.<br />
<br />
U may use brp.open function and output the same to an ascii file.<br />
<br />
We have done this successfully for our  product designs directly coming from Baan along with other online information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other alternative would be to use ttstpconv option and view the report in a IE or any Internet Browser.<br />
<br />
<br />
html The output of Baan is created as a html file on the server. The file can be loaded in a web browser to see it.Example:argument: htmlpath: /tmp/baan.outThe html file /tmp/baan.out is created and left on the server.Example:argument: html\/tmp/test %spath: /tmp/baan.outThe html file /tmp/baan.out is created on the server and processed by the script /tmp/test as the first argument. Together with the html conversion you can also define one of the following or all:-g&lt;picturefile&gt;-c&lt;name&gt;-f&lt;fontsize of HTML&gt;The picturefile will be included at the top of the HTML output. The name is a word that will be displayed additionaly on top of the report and fontsize is the size you define in the &lt;font size=&gt; tag of html. All these parameters are optional and can be used in combinations.<br />
<br />
<br />
or you can generate the report in HTML format and write a small program to some tweaking of the HTML file to show the pictures.</div></div><hr />

I added a field to a report layout and in the report script I assigned a value to that variable:<br />
<br />
poza= &quot;&lt;a href=&quot; &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp;&quot;http://www.cinemagia.ro&quot;&amp;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; &quot;&gt;&quot; &amp; &quot;&lt;img src=&quot; &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; &quot;\\intel\users\Stefan\dance.gif&quot; &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp;  &quot;alt=&quot; &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; &quot;www.cinemagia.ro&quot; &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp;&quot;&gt;&quot; &amp; &quot;&lt;/A&gt;&quot;<br />

 Internet Explorer will convert this text to an image with a link.... It works fine.<br />

 Thank you once again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">13th March 2006, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I am wondering if this solution has an application for me.<br />
<br />
We have an invoice layout where the logo is pre-printed.  It is becoming necessary to vary the logo based on division.  For example, if the customer is a member of a new division, a different logo is expected on the invoice.<br />
<br />
In lieu of the user changing the paper in paper tray, is it feasible to apply some program logic to recognize the new division, and output a different logo in the report layout?<br />
<br />
Also, I'd appreciate any comments about the difficulty of achieving this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th March 2006, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - I used the &quot;difficult&quot; way that ~Vamsi posted in the code and utilities forum.  It works and if I needed to I could create a different logo overlay file for each of our sites.  Then depending on which site was printing I could print the different logos using different lp commands.  I am happy I only have to worry about 1 logo.  So it could apply to your situation, just remember it is difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">15th March 2006, 01:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Which method do you plan to use?<br />
<br />
If you use the truetype font method. Very easy. You create a font called logos and assign different logos to different characters. You will then have an expression in the report that will output different characters based on your requirements.<br />
<br />
Downside? You will need to install the font on every computer that needs to use the report. Also you will have to set the registry settings appropriately.</div></div><hr />
