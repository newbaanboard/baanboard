<br />
I exported Baan IV  Customized Session to Baan Vc.<br />
<br />
Could able to see and worked with all the sessions etc.  but when I give some message like &quot;session name&quot; on the check.input on the field event and compilled, it got compilled but when I run the session and keen in the data in the particular field the message is not poped up.<br />
<br />
when I open the source the changes which I made was there, but the session object is not reading or taking the latest source. <br />
<br />
Am I skipping some steps in Baan V or the source are open in View mode only.<br />
<br />
what is the method of opening it in Edit mode.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you checked, whether to object was loaded into the shared memory. If so, delete the object from shared memory and try once more...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jothilingam</div><div class="date">27th September 2004, 08:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah!  The shared Memory was checked, I unchecked and run convert to run time dd, logout and log in, but still remains same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I once had the same problem. I modified a script, compiled it, but Baan didn't create a new object. I then just deleted the object in the VRC structure and recompiled. That worked fine.<br />
<br />
 :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maxime</div><div class="date">28th September 2004, 06:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Please check if the Table Definition is in sync with the Baan IV version. If it is the same, please check if you have written an DAL on the table. If you have a DAL for the field then the Check.input will not fire.<br />
<br />
Maxime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">28th September 2004, 06:58</div></div><div class="posttext">malutz has a good idea, have you tried deleting the object and re-compiling?<br />
<br />
If so, there are a couple of things you can try (and/or check)...<br />
<br />
a) When you edit/view script, it automatically opens in edit mode, if your VRC matches that of the script you are editing. The fact that the code is still in the script, indicates that the script was opened in edit mode and thus, you have changed and saved it successfully...<br />
<br />
b) Try compiling the script in debug mode and then running the object. If you are using the latest object, then the debug window will appear when you run it. This will narrow down, whether the object is correct or not (and you should be able to see your script in the debug window).<br />
<br />
c) Beware of directly copying Baan IV script to Baan 5. Some events do not work as expected. For example, check.input sub sections (on fields) may not work if there is a DAL for the table, and there is a table.field.check property hook in the DAL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jothilingam</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Maxime, There is no dal been created for the tables which I imported from BaanIV.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Ruskin, <br />
<br />
a) I took the back of the object and deleted from the vrc at windows level, then I run convert, create run time dd for tool and the nornal one (create run time dd).  then I tried opening the session it gave me an error &quot;cannot create location&quot;.  So again replace the object and run the same.now the error is not appering.<br />
<br />
b). I strongly having doubt on std_gen.exe and bic.exe which are used for compiling and debugging, becasuse system is not detecting the latest source.  reason being in baan4 these exe are std_gen6.2 and bic6.2 and in BaanV the version are diffirent std_gen7.1 and bic7.1.  So I guess baan V exe are not understanding the latest cod due to version diffirence.<br />
<br />
c) even deleted the dd and rebuild it again. but not use, the existing session and data remain same. but editing is not detected.<br />

<br />
can you provide the output of &quot;ttstpsessinfo&quot;? As well as some information about the VRC-Structure.<br />
<br />
Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Also make sure SCM is not turned on, new in Baan V.  If SCM is on, I have found, if you change your script at the regular VRC level and compile - it looks like it works but does not ever update.   If SCM is on you need to check out the script, compile it, then check it back in.  You can check easily in Maintain Program Scripts - highlight your script and choose 'Check Out' in the Specific drop down.  If it lets you do it, SCM is on, if not it will tell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Lisa, Jothilingam is on Windows so no SCM there.<br />
<br />
I think he is having multi-package VRC authorization issues.<br />
<br />
For example -<br />
<br />
Package Combination B52amlg; VRC: B52U-a-mlg<br />
Package Combination B52amlgd; VRC: B52U-a-mlgd<br />
<br />
mlgd is derived from mlg.<br />
<br />
If you are logged into the environment with Package Combination B52amlg and having full package VRC authorizations then you can make changes to the script in MLGD VRC and compile successfully. But when you execute the session the object (MLG) is picked based on the current Package Combination you are logged in. Then you wouldnt see the changes you made in MLGD VRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jothilingam</div><div class="date">2nd October 2004, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Mr. NP Rao<br />
<br />
I also had the same doubt, <br />
<br />
For example: some B50cc5lrt1 (B50cclrt)vrc is been derived from update vrc.<br />
Is was existing initically. But problem was existing in this level also.<br />
<br />
Later I devired one more package comb(B50clrt1) and vrc (B50cc5test) from B50cc5lrt1 (B50cclrt) and deleted the s/w components in B50cclrt1.  But I took complete export dump that vrc and imported in the latest vrc B50cc5test and run all the formalites. but after doing all the above said still the problem exist.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">2nd October 2004, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">You never mentioned which package combination you are working in. I think if you change your package combination to the last one in the VRC tree it will pick objects.<br />
<br />
Also, check for any Orphan objects in the OS. If you did a global compile then you would have objects on the OS when you dont have any scripts in that VRC.<br />
<br />
You can the debug options of the Bshell (http://www.baanboard.com/twiki/bin/view/Infouser/BaanConnectivity) , and specifically -dbgobj and -dbgfdev to see which object file is picked up.<br />
<br />
Also refer to the thread - Debugger  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7724&amp;highlight=object)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jothilingam</div><div class="date">9th October 2004, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for every one.<br />
<br />
After reinstallation the programs scrits were working fine.  I thinks the previous problems all were due to deriving of Pack. Combinations and VRCs not only there was an virus also.  Now got solved.<br />
<br />

<br />
There is no DAL concept in BaanIV. DAL was introduced from BaanERP 5.0.<br />
