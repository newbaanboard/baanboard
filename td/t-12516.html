<br />
I'm wondering if anyone can help me:<br />
I start up a MS Word document from a Baan report.<br />
I do it like this:  I print to a file (ASCIF) and fill in on the argument line:  'RTF:&quot;N:\Letter.doc&quot; '. This works great, Word automaticly starts up and opens the document, but now I want to use another letter from a different Baan report.<br />
Is it possible to replace 'Letter.doc' with a variable (Perhaps like %s of something like that) and where and how do I declare that variable?? Or do I have to create a new device for each document ? At this time I don't have that many documents, but there will be more...<br />
I know about the B2Win programs, but I am curious if this also can work (with a variable)<br />

<br />
just put %s instead of your filename. If the users prints to the device he can provide his own filename.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This option doesn't work for me. When I use the %s, and allow the user to modify the outputname, a message is returned that the user has no permission to create the file.<br />
I forgot to mention that in 'N:\Letter.doc', the 'N' is my drive on a WINNT4.0 Share. the user has full rights there, but my guess is that %s and the output filename, are being (or tried to be) written on my UNIX system, that won't do.<br />
<br />
:o Here's my problem:<br />
<br />
I want to print a report in Word, because my boss wants me to to use an own report with own margins, own fonts etc. That, I can do in Word.<br />
In my reportscript I create an ASCII file and with a server2client command I can copy this file from UNIX to a share om my WINNT share (The local PC has a route to this share for drive &quot;N:&quot; )<br />
When I put 'RTF: &quot;N:\Letter.doc&quot; ' as my argument, Word starts up with my Letter.doc and automaticly starts to merge with my ASCII file which I copied to here in my script. The Macro I use in Word is for this letter only, so it won't affect my normal use wih Word.<br />
Now I want to have a new report from another session in Baan, obviously with another name. Now I can create another Device with argument: 'RTF: &quot;N:\Letter2.doc&quot; ' but then I would have to create more and more devices as the list of customized reports grows. The user has to browse through an immense list of devices, things my users and I don't want to do.<br />
Therefore I want to name my report in the script (variable) and use this variable in my argument, so I can use one device for more letters.<br />
<br />
Another option is to use a blank letter with a macro witch filters out what letter to use (depends on company for the header or the name of the letter...) Therfore I need to put the companynumber in my ASCII file and also a name of the letter. <br />
I'v recently posted a thread how to get my  Companynumber in variable (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12451)  this is going okay, I get my companynumber in Word.<br />
For using these fields in the Word macro I have posted to another forum for Visual Basic questions  (Visual Basic Forum (http://www.visualbasicforum.com/)).<br />
<br />
There, that's my case, maybe this lightens things up and helps you to understand what I mean with my problem. I don't know if this thing with my variable can be achieved in Baan, but who knows ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanlover</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Create a device called WORD with the details given below<br />
<br />
Device  : WORD<br />
Device Type : Rewrite File<br />
4Gl Program : ttstpconv<br />
arg : rtf:winword.exe<br />
path : {$BSE}/tmp/test.doc<br />
page length : 66<br />
<br />
Select the device word while printing the data and continue, it will open the o/p in word doc and then u can save the same with a different name in the local client pc. Here every time u select WORD device, it overwrites the existing file test.doc in tmp folder and can be saved in the local pc with a diff name.<br />
Hope it will help you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pgrootenhuis</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 14:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, that won't do because I've got existing Word documents on my local PC (actually my WINNT network drive).<br />
Renaming the Test.doc won't help, because there will be too many actions for the user.<br />
My existing documents contain Word Macro's which automaticly start to merge my ASCII file. My Letter.doc works fine now, including the merge to a new document without me interferring, so: in Baan I print my report to Word, then my complete enddocumet with x-number of pages comes out (merged).<br />
The problem is that I want to control from my reportscript or my argument which Worddocument (with own macro's and layout) has to be opened. That is not the case when I create one Temp.doc (no macro's) and manually have to store it elsewhere (local or WINNT drive) and add and activate macro's for merge (select the mergesource, define fields etc.)<br />
But thanks anyway!<br />

<br />
why do you go over the print session? can't you start word directly from your script?<br />
<br />
Like<br />
1. you copy the file you mentioned to the NT Share<br />
2. you start word from the script with the file you need (app_start).<br />
3. print the dokument from word.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This works even better! Now I can choose my letterxxx.doc from the script and print to the standard word-device...<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot, this had been puzzling me for several months now.<br />
