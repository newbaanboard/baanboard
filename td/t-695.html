were reported. Two of them were derived from the first, which<br />
was &quot;Error: 'r.todayl$' not declared&quot;. I removed the date field<br />
from the generated report and all errors disappeared with it.<br />
A friend of mine told me that such errors were unpredictable<br />
but I just don't feel satisfied with such an answer. Anyone<br />
can give me a hint about what could be happening ?<br />

If I remember well you need to update some include files. Did you already check the BGS site?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">3rd January 2002, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">You probably updated the repdll library lately and because of new functionality you must also update the bic_global and bic_repgen (under $BSE/include6.1).<br />
See the solution 116210 on BGS for the updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">3rd January 2002, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks both for your advice. I'll find which libraries were updated<br />
and will check BGS for solution 116210 as suggested after this.<br />
<br />
Read you soon.<br />
