<br />
Does any one have any documentation for mapping BaanIVc4 into the Open Applications Group Interoperability Standard (OAGIS)?  I know that Infor is already moving to implement this with their products, but we have a smaller project that needs to be completed before they release their implementation.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Were you able to get this done, we have a similar requirements, I was hoping get some insights from your project. Please respond. Thanks</div></div><hr />

I spent about 24 hours mapping the Baan Purchase order into OAGIS.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, our work in implementing this stalled out due lack of interest in our company and while our corporate overlords implemented the OAGIS standard with another subsidiary.  Their project is now complete.  I expect that their attention will be brought back to us, especially since they now have multiple Baan based companies to bring onto their electronic purchasing system.<br />
<br />
I've attached the document I prepared for the implementation.  Hope it helps.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Ben</div></div><hr />
