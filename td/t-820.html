<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeyaseelan</div><div class="date">18th January 2002, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hai,<br />
As of now there is no way to send a document as an xml object other than Openworld. But using BCK  u can conect to the Baan App server and then write an xml program to capture the data as an XML object.<br />
I have integrated BaaN with an Java based e-procurement system using BOI through BaaN Connection Kit. I have written my own xml data transfer program same like OW.<br />
If u need any help let me know.<br />
Thanks.<br />

It is possible to create XML messages out of Baan without using OpenWorld. <br />
Of course you can do it by using self made reports (just write the XML tags around the data). <br />
Another possibility is to use the EDI module and create &quot;pseudo XML&quot; messages (not quite XML because you have to filter out the record separator) in the same way.<br />
<br />
Last possibility I know is to use the Seagate Info 7.5 integration:<br />
In that case ttstpconv is used (by defining a specific device) to create an XML version of the normal report which is sent to a port and server where (normally) Seagate Info is installed.<br />
The following is then required:<br />
- BAAN IVc Service Pack 7 must be installed.<br />
- The reporting solution is available in PMC solutions 110334 and 110323.<br />
- Porting set 6.1c06.01 or later must be installed. For more information on the installation of porting set 6.1c, refer to the Integration Guide for Seagate Info 7.5 (U7561A US).<br />
<br />
As far as I know BaanIV has no possibility to read and process an XML message. But it is possible to transform an XML message to a flat ASCII file using a XSLT stylesheet. That ASCII file can be processed in Baan using the funtionality of the Exchange or EDI Module.<br />
<br />
If you do have installed e-Collaboration/iBaan B2B Server, the XML messages can be stored, handeld and/or transformed by it.<br />
(see http://www.baan.com/downloadlibrary/komatsucs.pdf).<br />
<br />
Kind regards, <br />
