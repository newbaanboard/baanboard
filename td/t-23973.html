The only way we tested was using a citrix client on the remote device to log into a PC with the Baan client.  Since I do not know a whole lot a PDA's not sure if this help.  I know the hand held devices we were looking would work with this, but working in Baan was not very easy(scrolling to get to fields, etc.).  We never looked much farther than that.</div></div><hr />
