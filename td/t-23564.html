<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">30th March 2005, 06:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a report run based on certain conditions in the &quot;background&quot; and is supposed to print on an actual printer. This is in addition to the same report running in the regular mode (foreground).This works Well and Good as long as the preview option is not selected.  If the preview option is selected, I have the following issues, <br />
1. The background report shows up in preview in addition to the regular report. I need to suppress this.<br />
<br />
2. Due to 1, The background report does not print to a printer unless the user selects to print on that in addition to the regular report.This will be an extra step for the user.<br />
<br />
I tried to use the spool.preview = false for spool id of the background but was not successful.may need to recheck usage. Any other variables to capture preview option selection?<br />
<br />
If the report contents are the same, possible a rewrite file might do.<br />
How to trigger any action at all once the preview is already out ( out of Baan code control?).This is in Baan 5.<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">31st March 2005, 23:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Could not find anything on spool.preview.  I was just wondering if this is a predefined variable?  How do you open your reports?  Just wondering if you do it differently in background mode to where you could check this variable, if yes then change the background device to a temporary file.<br />
<br />
I do something like this in one report:<br />
<br />
<br />
choice.print.data:<br />
on.choice:<br />
	if rprt_open() then<br />
		read.main.table()<br />
	else<br />
		choice.again()<br />
	endif<br />
	rprt_close()<br />
	<br />
zoom.from.tppro62031:<br />
on.entry:<br />
            spool.device = &quot;ASCIF&quot;<br />
	spool.fileout = creat.tmp.file$(bse.tmp.dir$())<br />
	rprt.id = brp.open(&quot;rsomereport&quot;, spool.device, 0)<br />
	get.some.records()<br />
	execute(end.program)<br />
<br />
<br />
The above is just a sample of what I do in one report, just wondering if you could do something like this by checking if background.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I had actually fixed it a little earlier.<br />
  Spool.preview does work (atleast in Baan 5 ). You may want to search a couple of other threads on the board here. In my case , my variable for trapping and resetting this was mixed up. Once I fixed it , it was simple.<br />
brp and spool options have been used for handling the  2 reports.</div></div><hr />
