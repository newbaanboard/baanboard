<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">7th August 2019, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a BECS configured to an LN server.<br />
The config file is a test.bwc file.<br />
In the Command input of that config file, if I put -- -set NO_WORKTOP=1 then it runs fine.<br />
Now I want to run that BECS via cmd but I cannot send the options in.<br />
I tried<br />
<br />
test.bwc -- -set NO_WORK_TOP=1<br />
<br />
but it just runs normally. The option is not working because there is an error as if the command is not there. If I put the command in the config and just run<br />
<br />
test.bwc<br />
<br />
then it works but that is not I want to do.<br />
I actually want to be able to run the BECS with options. So that I can run a particular session with dynamic inputs to that session.<br />
In the end, I want to achieve something like this http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showpost.php?p=166387&amp;postcount=9 and, if possible, find a way to output back to the cmd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">7th August 2019, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it working by calling bw.exe before the .bwc.<br />
<br />
bw.exe test.bwc -- -set NO_WORKTOP=1<br />
<br />
The only question now is that how can the session output back to the cmd?<br />
Any suggestion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th August 2019, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">So the BWC launches a session which generates output?  Not familiar with worktop, but couldn't you just write a file on the server and download to somewhere on the client.  I was assuming the cmd was a command file not just a command line.</div></div><hr />
