<br />
I have a UEdll set up so that when I copy a record to a 'new' record I blank out the text assignment to '0' so that I don't assign the old text to a new record.<br />
<br />
In theory this works fine and my new record has a text value of 0<br />
<br />
In reality, the new record that displays on the screen still shows the previous text values until you move off the record, then back on.<br />
<br />
Makes it confusing to see text on the form until you move off, then back onto the record.<br />
<br />
I am sure there is a way via script or DFE setting to make this refresh but I am not having any luck finding anything.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ?  This is an actual txt field and not a string. I can set my strings to &quot;&quot; to compensate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
UE won't trigger when you use Duplicate button as there is no DB transaction involved until you hit save on duplicated record.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to create DAL for the main table? Or its already in place? (I am assuming you are customizing standard session)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">26th February 2015, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">This is correct. Upon hitting save, all my other values change via the UEDLL but my text box still shows old data.<br />
<br />
I can create a DAL, maybe move my scripting over to a DAL instead. This is a good thought. Originally all this scripting was part of Items-General and no DAL option there but my custom session, yes.<br />
<br />
I have no real in depth experience with the power of DAL  :)  Only created one, with limited functionality so I will try that route out.<br />
<br />
I suspect some type of refresh is available upon a save or something ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
One more way - <br />
<br />
Say your field name is tcibd001.txta<br />
<br />
Now, in your UE, you are assigning tcibd001.txta = 0 in before.before.save in DAL_NEW.<br />
<br />
So, once the record is copied and saved, just do a refresh and the field will be blanked out. <br />
<br />
AFAIK, you won't be able to control your form behavior even with DAL. So, the above mentioned way is one way without the source code.<br />
<br />
Other ways are- Duplicating the session and write AFS to call standard in your script or Creating wrapper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">26th February 2015, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is where I'm doing the change, in before.before.<br />
<br />
the code didn't seem to matter in DFE....  <br />
<br />
(cxitm101.esct.e &gt; 0)?cxitm101.esct.e:&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, hitting refresh does do just that, defreshes nicely  <br />
<br />
It may just be a fact of life of hitting refresh.  <br />
<br />
I will play around ( I think I'll need a DAL for some extended functionality anyways)  and post if I find something other than 'hitting refresh'  :) ..</div></div><hr />
