<br />
I have a report that calculates the line weight for certain orders.  The user wants me to have the total order weight in the before.field layout.  Now I can easily put it in the after.field, using the total aggregate function, but the user does not want it there.  How would I get it in the before.field section.  <br />
<br />
Would I need to write a function for this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">If it has to be in the before.field layout, then I would think you would have to do the calculation right there in the report script for that layout or do it in the program script and send it as an input variable to the report.  You will have to duplicate much of the SQL call(s) that was used to generate the data in the first place.  Unfortunately, this makes things much more difficult for you than simply putting it in the after.field layout.  Good luck :) .</div></div><hr />

can u give me a sample script to have a total in the before.field?<br />
<br />
Ex in detail<br />
Netweight=10  |Variable netweight<br />
               20<br />
               30<br />
<br />
then the total of Average Netweight must in the before.field<br />
the total must me 60..<br />
<br />
Ill use the Effectivity Unit to connect my Receipt and SO for the Average NetWeight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd October 2009, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">What Ed was saying was that whatever query you used in the session script to get the individual numbers for netweight you need to copy those into the report script in the before field before.layout section.  So you copy the query into the report script and if possible just do a sum on netweight and if you can't do a sum for whatever reason just add-up the individual values.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">2nd October 2009, 20:23</div></div><div class="posttext">U can print aggregate values in before field if u calculate aggregate values using in-memory data transformation in program script  (as illustrated in performance dll  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=28569)) and import the array result of aggregates in report before.field , this will be the fastest most way to do this without duplicating any code/logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">markerpln</div><div class="date">3rd October 2009, 07:01</div></div><div class="posttext">how to i used the aggregate values i before.field in layout?il use a variable in my Netweight then what should i input in aggregate values in my variable in layout?? can u give me a samplescript in how to compute the total qty of my Netweight??my netweight variable in script is in the detail.1: and in my layout my variable is in the detail.1 also.. Then the total of my detail.1 must in my before.field.whinh312.effn..that before.field is my header..and the total in my layout must be in the before.field.whinh312.effn..can u give me a sample of script to compute my netweight in before.field.whinh312.effn??I Also use a Query session to run the script.<br />

*the value of my netweight is just adding my all details,it cant refresh to 0 values for compute the next page of my before.whinh312.1:&lt;== layout.<br />
the val(NW) is the line in the text..ill use already the text.to.buff to get the value in my text then ill pass it to variable NW.<br />

*My problem is the value of my netweight is wrong..<br />
<br />
ex. of my Layout<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">3rd October 2009, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately i dont have time to write a sample code for this. I can give some steps .<br />
<br />
1. Aggregation has to be done in program script in memory array variable as per the dll aforesaid (using concatenation of  sort fields as key string). and <br />
2. In report script before.field u have to import the array element and print the same . In before field all sort field values are current and u can use this to retrieve the index value of the array for aggregate field.</div></div><hr />
