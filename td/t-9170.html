I have written a function and basically it checks to see a room is already being used between 2 dates.<br />
<br />
I have got it to work by using just a single date, but I want it to actually look for whether there are records between the start date field and the end date field.<br />
<br />
Here is the function...<br />
****************************************<br />
function check.room.available()<br />
{<br />
	select tssma931.roomn<br />
	where tssma931.roomn = :tssma931.roomn and tssma931.stdt = :tssma931.stdt or tssma931.endt = :tssma931.stdt<br />
	selectdo<br />
		message(&quot;Room Unavailable, please choose another room&quot;)<br />
		input.again()<br />
	endselect<br />
}<br />
*******************************************<br />
roomn = the room nunber<br />
stdt = start date<br />
endt = end date<br />
<br />
So basically someone picks the room number and enters a start and end date.  The function looks for entries where that room number is booked for a date range that conflicts with the range just entered.<br />
<br />
I tried using ...<br />
********************************************<br />
where tssma931.roomn = :tssma931.roomn and tssma931.stdt in :tssma931.stdt to tssma931.endt or tssma931.endt in tssma931.stdt to :tssma931.endt<br />
********************************************<br />
<br />
This failed as Baan did not understand &quot;in&quot; or &quot;to&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

I think you are trying to do something like this:<br />
<br />
where	tssma931.roomn = :tssma931.roomn<br />
and	(tssma931.stdt inrange   :tssma931.stdt and :tssma931.endt<br />
or	tssma931.endt inrange  :tssma931.stdt and :tssma931.endt)<br />
<br />
<br />
However, this misses the case where another event starts before the one in question starts and ends after this one ends.<br />
<br />
So, you might try this instead:<br />
<br />
where	tssma931.roomn = :tssma931.roomn<br />
and	tssma931.stdt &lt; :tssma931.endt<br />
and	tssma931.endt &gt; :tssma931.stdt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdbailey</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">You may want to try a different approach as you want to ensure that not only are the start and end dates free, but the dates between them as well.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is as follows:<br />
<br />
     To check for all possibilities of overlapping dates (including a date range that is completely inside another), you would have to check each day in the range specified for being within a prebooked period for that room.  This would require a loop to check each day, thus avoiding all overlap.  It takes a bit longer to process, but should do what you are looking for.  I have not checked the syntax (just a quick type-in) so you may have to make some minor syntactical modifications (I can't remember off the top of my head if you can do a date.to.num() in a &quot;for&quot; statement).  The suggested code approach is below.  I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
function check.room.available()<br />
{<br />
domain  tclong  errflag<br />
domain  tclong  i<br />
<br />
select<br />
     *<br />
from<br />
     tssma931<br />
where<br />
     tssma931.roomn = :roomn<br />
selectdo<br />
     errflag = 0<br />
<br />
     for i = date.to.num(stdt) to date.to.num(endt)<br />
          if i inrange :tssma931.stdt and :tssma931.endt then<br />
               errflag = 1<br />
               break<br />
          endif<br />
     endfor<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
if errflag = 1 then<br />
     message(&quot;Room Unavailable, please choose another room&quot;)<br />
     input.again()<br />
endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
Coding explanation:<br />
<br />
The assumption is made that stdt, endt and roomn are the field names from the input screen.<br />
<br />
An error flag is set up to check the error condition has been met.  If so, a &quot;break&quot; is issued to avoid additional cpu usage (wasted time as the room is already known to be booked).  The error flag is then checked to verify the room is available.<br />
<br />
The &quot;for&quot; loop would process each date between (and including) the start and end dates by converting them to a number first (to allow the &quot;for&quot; loop to count correctly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_developer</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 06:48</div></div><div class="posttext">the way I see it there are four conditions:<br />
1. start date falls in a booked period or<br />
2. end date falls in a booked period or<br />
3. the entire period is booked or<br />
4. a booked period falls entirely in the new period<br />
<br />
|*** for readability<br />
l.stdt = tssma931.stdt<br />
l.endt = tssma931.endt<br />
<br />
|*** assuming start date &lt;= end date<br />
select	tssma931.*<br />
from		tssma931<br />
where		(tssma931.stdt &lt;= :l.stdt and<br />
		 tssma931.endt &gt;= :l.stdt)		or	|1.<br />
		(tssma931.stdt &lt;= :l.endt and<br />
		 tssma931.endt &gt;= :l.endt)		or	|2.<br />
		(tssma931.stdt &lt;= :l.stdt and<br />
		 tssma931.endt &gt;= :l.endt)		or	|3.<br />
		(tssma931.stdt &gt;= :l.stdt and<br />
		 tssma931.endt &lt;= :l.endt)			|4.<br />
selectdo<br />
	|*** the room cannot be booked for this period <br />
endselect<br />
<br />
That should do it.<br />
<br />

I chose to leave out the equal signs because I don't think having one meeting start at the same time another ends should result in an error condition.<br />
<br />
Food for thought...</div></div><hr />

Once again spot on m8!<br />
<br />
I have used both of the examples you provided into 1 function and it works a treat.<br />
<br />
Cheers m8y:D</div></div><hr />
