One of our clients wants Crystal reports to be implemented.<br />
Can any one tell me how to get started with this?<br />
<br />
According to my knowledge, i ll have to install Crystal Report software on my machine and then integrate it with baan server.<br />
Please correct me if I am wrong.<br />
<br />
Does it support Windows XP and VISTA?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

Why not checkout ready tailored solutions for BAAN systems - http://icapella.com/solutions_data_baan.asp</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">27th August 2008, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Crystal Reports XI R2 supports XP, I don't know about Vista, but if it doesn't there is probably a service pack.  Yes, you have to install it on a client, and then connect it to Baan.  Crystal (now part of SAP) have stopped developing the Integration Kit for Baan and their own dedicated Baan database driver.  However, you can use Crystal on the underlying database through normal ODBC/ADO etc database access.  It is not quite as convenient as the dedicated driver, but it works...</div></div><hr />
