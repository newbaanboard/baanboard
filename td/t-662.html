<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">20th December 2001, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Baanboard teammates. I'm developing a pair of sessions aimed<br />
to trespass orders from a company to offers in a new one. Those<br />
sessions should recalculate price searching for it from supplier,<br />
from article or from the order itself if the price was not found<br />
previously.<br />
<br />
I've studied carefully the original session maintain order lines and<br />
I've included all functions called in the before.program section<br />
used to retrieve data and later called tdpur4102.get.currency<br />
and tdpur4102.find.default.price.and.discount in function read.<br />
main.table. Have any of you worked with tdpur4102.find.def...<br />
previously ? If so, could you please tell me what info does it<br />
need to work properly ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

In addition to the two arguments to the function call itself (read.contracts and give.mess), it expects that you have already selected the appropriate data (or filled the appropriate fields with values) for some fields from tables tdpur040 (e.g., corg) and tdpur041 (e.g., item, cntr, opol).  If the item on the PO line is customized, then tipcs021 data should be filled.  Otherwise, tiitm001 data should be populated.  <br />

During my first checkings everything seemed to run smoothly, although I'm still waiting for the final user approval. I'm currently working on the sales version.<br />
What other tables do you think I'd need ?<br />
<br />
Read you soon.<br />

Upon first glance, it looks like the sales requirements are similar to purchasing.  Use tdsls040, tdsls041, tiitm001, and tipcs021.  If that doesn't get you there, let me know.  I'll look a bit closer.</div></div><hr />

been luckier even if you can't help me.<br />
<br />
I did all the arranged changes but tdsls041.cups turns into<br />
an empty string just as tdsls041.find.default.price.and... is<br />
executed. I'm investigating all possible causes. I'll keep you<br />
informed of further advances.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">26th December 2001, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm. It seems tdsls4102.determine.cups.cvps() assigns<br />
item.cuni value to tdsls041.cups. Being item.cuni = &quot;&quot;<br />
tdsls041.cups gets an empty string value. Where<br />
does item.cuni gets its value ? Where is it declared ?<br />
<br />
Struggling with it.<br />

The value of itm.cuni is set to tipcs021.cuni if the item is a customized item, or to tiitm001.cuni if the item is a standard item.</div></div><hr />
