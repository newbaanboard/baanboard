<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We have BOL report that someone customized several years ago but it has never lined up with our preprinted BOL form.  I'm trying to get everything aligned correctly and it's the first time I've tried to modify a report.  I got the header and the details printing where I want them but no matter what I do, I can't get the footer to print in the correct position.  I want it to print at the exact bottom of the page.  It's 7 lines long.  I want the 7th line to print at the last line of the paper or at most one line up from the bottom.  It's a standard 8.5X11 page, printed on a dot matrix printer.  Another clue.  If I set the report size to 66 which I believe it should be, the footer prints on the second page.  I have to put it to 60 to get it on the correct page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">What I would do, to start with, is to temporary customise the footer layout to print the line number attr.lineno, on the last footer line. The I see what line no it is. The the pagelength for the report = this value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Has the function &quot;skip to(spool.pg.length - [x]) been used in the reportscript?<br />
<br />
Using this function you can start the footer at the desired position calculated from the bottom of the page. The calculation uses the setted page length to calculated the correct position ( see form 2 of maintain reports ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">but I'm really new to this and I'm not sure how to do what you're suggesting.  I've seen the skip.to command suggested here and that does seem like what I need, but I'm not sure how to use it.  So far, I've only edited the report with the Baan client interface and that doesn't seem to offer a skip to functionality.  I can open the script but this is all I get.  It doesn't look like everything that prints in the report since I don't see the footer so I'm not even sure if it is the correct script.  If it is, where would I put the skip.to function?<br />
