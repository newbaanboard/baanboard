<br />
Created a new type 3 session.<br />
Has several fields, some are enum, some alphanumeric and some numeric (float).<br />
<br />
When I use the query by form screen to select just a few records, it works ok for the alpha and enum fields but, for the numeric ones it does not work.<br />
(example: fieldx &gt; 0 or fieldx &gt; 0.0 does not work).<br />
<br />
This happens in the field tab and also on the sort tab. You can not sort the screen by a numeric field. <br />
<br />
Has anyone heard of this before?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Fred</div></div><hr />

<br />
The numeric fields I was using were calculated online, and the query by form session was confused by it.<br />
<br />
If you only use normal DB fields on the session, it works ok.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
