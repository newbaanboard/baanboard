<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd March 2006, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">One option is to add the session into the command line of the bwc file. Of course that means changing all client bwc files.  Not a good option, but it would work.</div></div><hr />

It is better to use a server based solution if you want the session activated for all users. If you like the session for just you then you can add the session code into your BWC file.<br />

<br />
Changing the bwc file may work as this pc will be assigned to a operator on the floor, so please let me know what should be the command line text for executing a specific session immediately a user logs into baan.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

This is a pretty interesting solutio, but when you add the session in the command line, it opens the session, but doesnt open the menu browser. Is that the intended functionality?<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to have the menu browser open as well?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd March 2006, 00:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me you can set a start up session in ttaad2106m000 and ttaad2105m000 to initiate a startup group.  I think I used to start a session everytime I logged into test.  I was just playing around one day and found this.  I can not remember how I set it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Mark is right. The session he mentions needs to be used in following sequence [this is according to BAAN IV c3]:<br />
<br />
1, Maintain Session Group [ttaad2107m000] - this creates the 'handle' so to speak, to which you can attach the sessions by using the next session<br />
<br />
2, Maintain Startup Sessions [ttaad2106m000] - This establishes the list of session you want to start up.<br />
<br />
3, Maintain User Settings [ttaad2105m000] - Here, you link up the user(s) with the Session Group created in first step. Then convert to Runtime DD.<br />
<br />
Now, it can get VERY tedious if you have to do this for several tens or hundreds of users.</div></div><hr />
