<br />
I'm a bit rusty with Exchange and never used it much before, so I need some advice.  I want to scan through a table, and where I find say value a in a field, change it to value b.  I normally use SQL to handle such changes but I don't have access at this site.  Can this be done just using the import module of Exchange or do I have to export the data, edit it and then import?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danny Leolux</div><div class="date">5th January 2005, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Exchange is a very good tool to use for conversion like the example you mentioned. The easiest way (for a non programmer) is to make an standard export and import schedule (both based on DD).<br />
<br />
After you performed the export, open the file with an editor of choice (vi for unix or excel for Windows I would recommend). Change the field value and import the changed data with Exchange Import.<br />
<br />
If you have some knowlegde of programming you can also do the conversion with the Exchange schedule. You can do this on Exporting the data or on Importing the data. You have to create an condition script where you can change the value based on a selection.<br />
<br />
If this is a one time conversion I would recommend the first option because it involves no programming. If you need this for frequent use you can attempt to write your own condition script.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

2. just dump the table, edit it (get ridge of line you don't update) and import it again (not during office hourse since it can lock the table!)<br />
3. use any report and use e.g. in the before.program an update statement.<br />

Don't know if it's available in Baan IV but on V there are Conversion Tables available in the exchange module.<br />
These tables do the trick even without programming condition scripts.<br />
