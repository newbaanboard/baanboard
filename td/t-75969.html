I do not see what you are trying and where you did it. But I am not familiar with &quot;Workflow&quot; concept. BOD extension I have done, in the extension modeller, where did you add the calculated field?</div></div><hr />

I tried adding calculated field through extension ,but I'm confused to how to call that calculated field in LN_DA_PurchaseOrder Workflow. So i tried calling custom workflow in LN_DA_PurchaseOrder Workflow. If its possible can you explain the procedure to call calculated field from extension to workflow.</div></div><hr />

In step 3 after deploying, it shows a error saying &quot;Serious error&quot;. Then  if i check any tables related to that model they are encrypted and also if i try to submit PO for Approvals it wont go through workflow rather it directly shows PO is approved</div></div><hr />
