<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">28th October 2011, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I narrate the condition. <br />
I make a display session. Just display item, Lot, order(include purchase order and production order), Lot Qty on Hand. The user require the record which 'Lot Qty on Hand' is zero would not display in form.<br />
<br />
'Lot Qty on Hand', tdltc001.stoc was defined double type. So I wrote like this:<br />
before.program:<br />
    query.extension = &quot;tdltc001.stoc &gt; 0.00001&quot;<br />
But it doesn't work. I thought the fault would be the decimal digits. And then I wrote this script:<br />
<br />
field.tiitm001.cuni:<br />
before.display:<br />
        select  tdltc001.clot, tdltc001.olot, tdltc001.orno, tdltc001.item,<br />
                tdltc001.cprj, tdltc001.cntr, tdltc001.ardt, tdltc001.quam, tdltc001.stoc<br />
        from    tdltc001<br />
        where   tdltc001.olot = tdltc.olot.prod<br />
        and     tdltc001.orno = (:order)<br />
        order by tdltc001.olot, tdltc001.orno, tdltc001.ardt desc, tdltc001.clot desc<br />
        selectdo<br />
            if double.cmp(tdltc001.stoc, 0.0, 0.00001) = 0 then<br />
            endif        selectempty<br />
        endselect<br />
In the IF statement, I can find out the zero record. But how can I do to eliminate these in display form? In the other word, can I eliminate the zero record in SELECT statement. I tried to add this code:<br />
        and     tdltc001.stoc &gt; 0.00001<br />
It did not take effect.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Hitesh Shah that if the main table is tdltc001, the query.extension should work, however maybe you should move the assignment statement to init.form.<br />
If tdltc001 is main table, then doing queries on that same table in field sections never will skip records and will also disturb the standard program if you don't use the on.main.table function around it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">31st October 2011, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all your replies. I had solved this problem. Maybe it was my ignorance.<br />
before.program:<br />
    ...<br />
    query.extension = &quot;tdltc001.stoc &gt; 0.00001&quot;<br />
    on case order.type<br />
       case tckoor.act.sfc:<br />
            query.extension = &quot;tdltc001.orno = :order and tdltc001.olot = tdltc.olot.prod&quot;<br />
            break<br />
       case tckoor.act.sls:<br />
            query.extension = &quot;tdltc001.item = :input.item&quot;<br />
            break<br />
    endcase<br />
But combine like this, it would work. I did not know it should be only one query extension for one table in before program.<br />
    ...<br />
    query.extension = &quot;tdltc001.orno = :order and tdltc001.olot = tdltc.olot.prod and tdltc001.stoc &gt; 0&quot;<br />
    ...<br />
    query.extension = &quot;tdltc001.item = :input.item and tdltc001.stoc &gt; 0&quot;</div></div><hr />
