<br />
The problem is as follows:<br />
<br />
- Our company is multi-national, and so there are foriegn nationals coming to work and undergo training here at our factory in the US.<br />
- These persons are set up with whatever restricted access to the specific sessions in BAAN that they are permitted to use when they are working here, using a specific role under the DEM environment.<br />
- The problem is, however, that many of these sessions have access to other sessions using the &lt;Application&gt; drop-down menu. And these other sessions may not be the ones that should be allowed for use by the foriegn national. The DEM system does not exclude them from the authorization to use, once the main session is authorized.<br />
<br />
- My problem is: what would be a good approach to prevent the &lt;Application&gt; drop-down menu from firing. I know that I will have to customize each main session to do this, but should this be done by role or by individual login ID?<br />
<br />
<br />
Will appreciate any views on the approach to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th November 2007, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not write a session which runs and deletes the restrictions for some group of sessions?  For example you could create a session for non-us users, list all the sessions, then delete the user permissions.  It just becomes part of the dem process. Then you could copy from user to user.  Just a thought.<br />
<br />
The one thing we did was disable run program.  Then I wrote a session which simulates that, but it checks a users dem to make sure the session is actually spelled out on the dem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While generating user authorisation thru dem there is a check box which indicate that Sub level authorisation to be given to the user or not.<br />
<br />
In your case you can remove the all authorisation and regenerate the authorisation and untick the check box for sub level authorisation. In this case only main level authorisation will be given to the user.<br />
<br />
Hope this will solve your problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st November 2007, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, I am thinking your suggestion will remove access to U.S. personell also. I have not dug deep into how the DEM generates the authorization, so I am going to look and see if it is possible to run the deletions by individual users or roles. Still, not very foolproof - the penalties from an audit about access control are not cheap. I was thinking of something sturdy which does not depend on a external step in the DEM process. [By the way, all this is because of the ITAR regulations ... if you are wondering.][Also, we disable &lt;Run Program&gt; for ANY Normal User - so at least that path is blocked.]<br />
<br />
Let me explain some more.<br />
<br />
Take Maintain Item Data for example.<br />
<br />
Right now, it has several sessions in the zoom menu.<br />
<br />
Now, suppose a customization is requested where it is required to add, say, Maintain Production BOM or even Display Production BOM to the zoom menu. Now this is o.k. for (some of) the U.S. personell, but not o.k. for the foreign personell. It is difficult to remember that some sessions are not permitted for non-US people when doing a customization.<br />
<br />
Ajay, I hope this explains somewhat why I cannot use your suggestion.</div></div><hr />

I was recommending that it be run by user-id.  What we also found was that additional sessions (not just those a zoom) were being added to the users session.  Since we do not own source we never could found out why some of these sessions were being added - or how the users could access them.  What I recommend above was what I recommend to my company, but they decided we did not need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st November 2007, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Ajay - I was looking at the Generate User Dialog session [tgbrg4250s000] and I do not see the check box you mention. However, I think I might be able to use following feature: &quot;Enter Session Authorization&quot; - the help on this check box field says :  (if checked Yes) &quot;Session 'Maintain Session Authorizations by Session (ttaad2131m000)' is used to define the session authorizations per user on the basis of the process model. This means that a user can only activate or execute those sessions for which he or she has an authorization on the basis of the process model&quot;. <br />
<br />
Mark: Looks like this is almost similar to what you had in mind. <br />
<br />
Thank you for all the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd November 2007, 02:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm - I don't know much about process models, but I wonder what would happen to all the zoom sessions if they are not specified on the process model.  I don't know a whole lot about the actual DEM creation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">27th November 2007, 03:16</div></div><div class="posttext">So, to somewhat conclude this ... here's how we finally decided to do this:<br />
<br />
- First, for the specific user, give the module authorizations. In our case, we gave module authorizations for 'tc', 'td', 'tf', 'ti', 'tp'. The reason for this is that the next step will automatically exclude the sessions of that package when we &lt;Copy from DD&gt;<br />
- Next, exclude all the sessions using Maintain Authorizations by Session. This was done using &lt;Copy from DD&gt; <br />
- Next, from the exclude list so created, delete the sessions and sub-sessions for which access is to be [b]permitted.<br />
- Convert to runtime DD.<br />
<br />
Thereafter, Generate User Dialog for that user. This approach gives that specific user access to exactly the sessions intended.<br />
<br />
[For some reasons, even though the manual says it works, the 'inclusion' aspect of Maintain Authorizations by Session do not work - the Generate User Dialog would allow access to a number of sessions not even defined in that user's Business Object. Therefore the 'exclusion' approach. Sure would like to know why the 'inclusion' logic does not work...]<br />
<br />
Mark: this hopefully answers your question about the zoom  sessions - if it is desired to give access to a zoomed-to session, remove it from the exclusion list, and access is granted. The default with the above approach is no access to a session [just how we want it.]<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the set-up about exclusions is permanent (until modified), so it is a one-time setup per user.<br />
<br />
With this approach, if, for example, a customization is done that adds a session to the &lt;Application&gt; drop-down that is not to be permitted for that specific user, then it is not a problem, because that user will get a 'not authorized' message. We found this approach a bit more fool-proof than remembering at each customization whether we are 'leaking' somewhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried creating this session? It looks like every change you do in authorization table needs to be logged in ttaad400 so you can convert to runtime. If not, this will not convert to runtime.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Why not write a session which runs and deletes the restrictions for some group of sessions?  For example you could create a session for non-us users, list all the sessions, then delete the user permissions.  It just becomes part of the dem process. Then you could copy from user to user.</div></div><hr />
