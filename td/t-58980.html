<br />
I'm working on LN 6.1 FP3. <br />
<br />
Something strange happens to me, because I have a table with three fields, the first two being the main index table, but in a certain company in the same VRC allows me to enter duplicate values (incorrect) and in the other companies it respects the constraint of index (correct). <br />
<br />
Does anyone can tell me whats going on?<br />
<br />
Thank's</div></div><hr />

<br />
U can check Indices of table in table definition.<br />
<br />
In session ttadv4520m100, go to second satelite session(second tab) check if duplicate checkbox is checked or not. If it is checked then duplicate values allowed for that index, other wise not.<br />
<br />
Also note that you are allowed to check duplicate only if it is not first(primary) index.<br />
<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you, I know all you told me, but my question is because Mark explained me configuration by company.<br />
<br />
Mark, Do I understand fine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th August 2010, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - the answer is the same.  If this company shares VRC with other companies then the issue maybe something different.  Without understanding your setup it is hard to say. My assumption was each company had its own VRC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, all companies own the same VRC, but only in one company occurs this.</div></div><hr />

My best guess is something is corrupt in that one company.  In baan iv I would have the admin first for a create rdd on the table, then re-organize the table repairing reference counts.  Not sure about baan 5.</div></div><hr />

Missed that in the first post.  I would have thought some of the basics would still be the same.</div></div><hr />
