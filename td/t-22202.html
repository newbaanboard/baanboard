How can I say that when a user tabs past this domain, it cannot be left blank. I do not want to make this a mandatory input field in the table def. How can I appy this to the domain.<br />
<br />
Reason: This field can be by passed if a flag in the customer del. address says that a pronumber = no. When the flag is set to yes, the session allows me to tab to the pronumber field, and tab past it with no entry. <br />
By making it mandatory in the table def, if i had the the pronumber flag set to no, the current session still requires a pronumber, eventhough it does not allow me to select the field.<br />
<br />
I do not have source code for the session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use a wrapper tool (RMCgen (my company), QKEY (Fullscope) or the freeware 'rush' on these boards) to add the validation/field control you want to the Baan script, even without source.</div></div><hr />

With one of these products you can put a check.input section on the field and make sure it is filled.  The first solution I thought of.<br />

I know you could set up a range, but I do not see anyway to skip that check when the flag is set to no.  I have never setup a range so I do not know a whole lot about them. The only way I can think of to do what you are asking, is to use one of the methods that Lisa or I mentioned.<br />

<br />
True domain works with the program.  As Mark said one can do with domain range . But this will always require that flag to be declared extern and available when domain checks are carried out  (like  field entry, table updation and import from sequential dump). <br />
<br />
e.g <br />
<br />
pronum=2 ? strip($$) in  &quot;..*&quot; : strip($$) in &quot;.*&quot;<br />
|2 for tcyesno.no<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But definitely u will agree variable or table field pronum will not  always be available when domain checks are carried (as described earlier).  So the alternative approaches to this may be explored.</div></div><hr />
