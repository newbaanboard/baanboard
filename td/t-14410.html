At this time i am using the same hight for both footers but what i realy want is the first footer to be 4 lines and de second footer to be 10 lines.<br />
If i do so the second footer starts printing on the same position as the first footer, and it should start 6 lines higher.<br />
<br />
Anybody has any ideas ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure what exactly you want to do. But have you tried skip.to function.<br />
<br />
if not try with this:<br />
<br />
before.layout:<br />
skip.to(spool.pg.length - n)<br />
<br />
where n = your starting line number for footer layout.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your fast reply!<br />
<br />
I have 2 footerlayouts<br />
footer 1, 4 lines, outputexpression &quot;not end.orco&quot;<br />
footer 2, 10 lines, outputexpression &quot;end.orco&quot;<br />
<br />
If i use these footers the second footer is started on the same line as the first footer so it doesn't fit on the page.<br />
<br />
If i make the first footer also 10 lines, the report prints perfect, but i want to use these 6 lines.<br />
<br />
Correct me if i'm wrong but if i recall right i can't use a &quot;skip to&quot; in a footer section ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that Baan has some limitations regarding variable footer sizes.  If you have it select different footers based on a variable such as lattr.pageno, Baan will handle that just fine.  But if you base the footer size on a variable that changes values in the middle of the page so to speak, then Baan can have a problem with that, depending on when the variable changes.<br />
<br />
Here's the Baan help on the report footer margin (Form 2 of Maintain Reports):<br />
The number of lines allocated for the footer. If this value is -1, the footer margin is calculated by the report writer. When you have a number of different footer layouts of different sizes which are executed on conditions at runtime, it is difficult for the report writer to calculate the footer margin. So in such a case you have to specify a number of lines for this margin. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this does little to fix the problem in your situation.</div></div><hr />
