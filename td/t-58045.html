<br />
I am writing a session to dynamically copy texts from one company to another based on tables in a file and/or form selection. <br />
<br />
I have come across a function text.copy.between.companies() in the help file (see below). I tried to use it, but no results. I always get return value 0, and no text is created nor updated.<br />
<br />
long text.copy.between.companies( string text_field_to(17), string text_field_from(17), long source_company, long target_company, string kw1(17), string kw2(17), string kw3(17), string kw4(17), string tgroup(8), string edit_opt(15) )<br />
Description<br />
<br />
This copies the entire text of a specified text field, for all languages, from one company to another.<br />
Arguments<br />
<br />
text_field_to The name of the new text field. See Text fields: overview. This returns the text number for the new text field. <br />
text_field_from The name of the text field that must be copied. See Text fields: overview. <br />
source_company This specifies the source company. <br />
target_company This specifies the destination company. <br />
kw1 to kw4 Use these arguments to specify key words for the new text. If you specify one or more of these arguments as an empty string, the corresponding key word(s) are copied from the original text. It is possible, for example, to specify two new key words and to copy the other two from the original text. <br />
tgroup This specifies the name of the text group to which the new text must be assigned. If you specify an empty string here, the text is assigned to the user&quot;s default group. <br />
edit_opt This specifies the type of window in which the text must be displayed. <br />
<br />
Return values<br />
<br />
&gt;0 success; returns the number of lines copied <br />
-1 error <br />
<br />
<br />
I have tried with and without commit.transaction(), with or without selection for update, no results.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know this function and can tell me if it works and how to use it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />

Hello eli,<br />
<br />
found this hint on BaaNboard :<br />
<br />
#include &lt;bic_text&gt;<br />

Thanks for your reply. Obviously I included the bic_text, otherwise my script wouldn't even compile.<br />
<br />
I already got it working meanwhile. I had entered as the first two arguments for the function (new text and orig.text) the text fields, but it had to be the text numbers. Also a db.update of the update table is necessary followed by a commit.transaction(). The commit is also for the tttxt tables. Those will not be updated with the new text number until a commit.<br />

    tdsls040.txta = 0<br />

The 'text_field_from' and 'text_field_to' fields are strings that contain the name of the fields involved in the copy.  One or both may be the name of a table field (extern by default) and/or the name of a local long variable that must be declared as extern.  Failure to use extern long variables when other than table fields will result in the returned text number as zero.</div></div><hr />
