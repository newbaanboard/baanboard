             How do I read a flat file from a shared network drive?<br />
             Basically ... How do I give the path?<br />
<br />
             We are using Baan IV c3 on UNIX.<br />
<br />
             I have a file located on a network drive (shared).<br />
             When I use the following command, it returns -2.<br />
              ret = seq.open(&quot;\\Sj-mnair\Data\51.txt&quot;,&quot;r&quot;)<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Regards,<br />
M&amp;M</div></div><hr />

Look at an earlier posting:<br />

<br />
If you need for this to work with jobs then consider Samba or mounting a NFS drive. You will have to work with your M$ network/unix admins on this.<br />
<br />
And if you don't need the job option then simply use functions in the ottdllbw library like seq.open.local (or is it seq.local.open).</div></div><hr />

<br />
k:\\somepath\\somepath1\\filename<br />
<br />
At least when I enter k:\excel\data.csv in debug it comes out k:\\excel\\data.csv. If doing in a job see Vamsi's reply. The only thing I can see that you are missing is a drive.  Maybe the below will work - of course you have to point it to the right drive.  Not sure if the all of the \'s are necessary.<br />
<br />
ret = seq.open(&quot;c:\\Sj-mnair\\Data\\51.txt&quot;,&quot;r&quot;) <br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck!!</div></div><hr />
