<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gheryosti</div><div class="date">24th May 2008, 03:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
we are trying to develop some reports in the new reporting studio environment. <br />
We have just solved the biggests problems such as install and configure all the necessary client and server side tools.<br />
Now the task is to create a session to print a report &quot;Query Based&quot; inside WebTop, exactly as it's mentioned in the Developer Guide. <br />
Following the steps described by Infor we are now able to print the report and obtain a printed page on WebTop, but the report leaks all the fields we had queried with a SQL statement in the project inside Reporting Studio.<br />
On the client side (Rerporting Studio) we are able to see all the results in the preview as if it's working, but in the moment we jump on the WebTop session based printing, report is only printed with static elements, such as labels, title and so on. It seems query is not executed, but jdbc works good and every other settings was tested (i mean parameter printing session and so on).<br />
What the hell we must do?! Please help us if you now anything interesting about it, we need this feature, some urgent project must be made...<br />
Thanks a lot!<br />
Bye!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruce21</div><div class="date">26th July 2008, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You can download ERP LN Studio 8.4.2 from the infor-subscribenet. This includes besides the studio also the report-viewer. <br />
For programming you can have a look at the newest &quot;developers guide for enterprise server&quot;-document. <br />
<br />
hope that helps</div></div><hr />
