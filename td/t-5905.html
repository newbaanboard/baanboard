<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trchandra</div><div class="date">22nd July 2002, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
    I am trying to get list of items with some wildcards in sql query.  My requirement is get all items starting with &quot;XB-????&quot;.  The question marks can be anything, but the resultset should have items of length 7 characters (staring with XB- and anything in question marks).  Can someone help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd July 2002, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used tiitm001.item like &quot;PLM7...... .*&quot;<br />
to find all items starting with PLM7, had any 6 additional characters, then a space and any remaining characters.  So try &quot;XB-.... .*&quot;.  I have only done this using EZ-sql, not a Baan Script.  Also the space .* was needed to get the rest of the part number. In my case I new it would be spaces since we do not use the space in part numbers.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
You have to explore the possiblity using the &quot;like&quot; operator and use and &quot;selectbind/wherebind&quot; options.<br />
<br />
You might like to refer to the script tsmdm0280, if you have the source scripts.</div></div><hr />

     The .... pattern works but it is getting other items which are of pattern XB-ABC.  Infact I am also trying in Easy SQL with following select<br />
<br />
select	tisfc001.pdno, tisfc001.mitm<br />
from	tisfc001<br />
where	tisfc001.pdno like &quot;4640.*&quot;<br />
and	tisfc001.mitm like &quot;         XB-.... *&quot; <br />
and	tisfc001.osta = 1<br />
<br />
<br />
The result is having all items with 4 or less characters after &quot;XB-&quot;, but I am looking at exact 4 characters<br />
<br />
:-(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">22nd July 2002, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Try using:   LIKE &quot;XB-[^ ][^ ][^ ][^ ].*&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The '.' represent any single character.  By using '[^ ]', this takes any character but a space.  You can look at the Baan Programmers Manual for more info on LIKE expressions:  http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_expressions_runtime_expr_compile</div></div><hr />

   I tried your pattern, but I am getting &quot;No Data with in Selection&quot;.  As of now, I coded in the 3GL script and checking number of character after &quot;XB-&quot; and skipping unmatched records.<br />
<br />

Ed's solution should work. Make sure there is a space after the caret &quot;^ &quot;. The non-elegant more effective solution (Lisa / Ed and I were involved in a similar discussion - browse the forum to find that thread) isinrange {&quot;XB-    &quot;} and {&quot;XB-ZZZZ&quot;}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 00:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I see you have leading spaces in your previous listing.  Did you put those in when you tried my code? I.e., LIKE &quot;      XB-[^ ][^ ][^ ][^ ].*&quot;  I didn't notice them when I first posted.  I tried my solution in both EasySQL and in a program script on IVc4, albeit without leading spaces, and it worked.  I also tested in a Vc program script (which I suspect is where you are running it because of the leading spaces), and it worked fine.</div></div><hr />

I think Vamsi's idea is good, but if can try this -<br />
<br />
This might not be the best of all the solution...<br />
<br />
<br />
long	found<br />
domain	tcitem	temp.item<br />

temp.item = &quot;XB-.... *&quot; <br />

    I put the space after &quot;^ &quot; in the first place, still it did not work.<br />
    Here is the code<br />

    <br />
select	tisfc001.pdno, tisfc001.mitm<br />

      I tried giving inrange, but I got bhsell error message saying that &quot;Type mismatch with combined and non-combined&quot;.  Here is the code<br />

:). Debug the error. I posted it for a index. You are using a field. If you want to do what you are doing, then remove the braces.</div></div><hr />

     It was my stupidity, I didnt even notice why I am using { for field.  I modified the query but still it is showing all lines<br />

select	tisfc001.pdno, tisfc001.mitm<br />
from	tisfc001<br />
where	tisfc001.pdno like &quot;4640.*&quot;<br />

Ravi is on 5c. In BaanERP, the item field is 47 characters long. Baan also introduced the concept of segmentation. With this the usual practice is to reserve the first 9 characters for the project segment. So in case of non-project items, the first 9 characters should be spaces.<br />
<br />
Ravi,<br />

Please post the complete query and the resulting dataset. Also indicate which rows you dispute and why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trchandra</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 03:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys,<br />
    Sorry for the confusion.  As Vamsi mentioned we are on Baan Vc and I need 9 spaces to take care of project segment. Here is the complete problem.<br />
  <br />
    I need to select production orders which are created for end items with certain pattern for which I need to add a operation.  The pattern for select is XB-XXXX.  That means I should select production orders with main item satisfying above pattern.  If I have following items <br />
<br />
QB-1324-01<br />
QB-235<br />
QB-1353<br />
QB-2353-003<br />
QB-2521<br />
QB-2135<br />
...<br />
...<br />
<br />
I should get only<br />
<br />
QB-1353<br />
QB-2521<br />
QB-2135<br />
<br />
   But when I tried all suggested patterns in the SQL, I was getting other items as well.  When I tried the latest suggestion from Mark, I got &quot;no data with in selection&quot;.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
select	tisfc001.pdno, tisfc001.mitm<br />
from	tisfc001<br />
where	tisfc001.pdno like &quot;4640.*&quot;<br />
and	tisfc001.mitm like &quot;         QB-[^ ][^ ][^ ][^ ]&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

    Thanks for great solution.  Everything is in &quot;.&quot;.  According to regular expressions &quot;.&quot; means any character and when &quot;*&quot; is followed it means multiple occurances of any character that comes in &quot;.&quot;.<br />
<br />
   THerefore when we tried &quot;         XB-[^ ][^ ][^ ][^ ].*&quot;, the query was bringing everything that comes after these four characters.  Now Vamsi suggested to put &quot; &quot; (space) instead of &quot;.&quot; in the above expression.  <br />
<br />
   THe final code is ...<br />
<br />
<br />
select	tisfc001.pdno, tisfc001.mitm<br />
from	tisfc001<br />
where	tisfc001.pdno like &quot;4640.*&quot;<br />
and	tisfc001.mitm like &quot;         XB-[^ ][^ ][^ ][^ ] *&quot;<br />

one question, with embedded SQL, are you allow to use variable with &quot;LIKE&quot;?<br />
<br />
It gives me an error, I also did use &quot;:&quot; <br />
<br />
select	tpptc101.cspc:element, tpptc101.cprj:cprj<br />
from	tpptc101<br />

<br />
child is my variable, I also tried :child, still gives me error --&gt; syntax error.<br />
