<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">janez256</div><div class="date">6th June 2011, 12:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I have few problem with &quot;Infor ERP LN plugin for MS SSRS&quot;. I use version 2011-05-30.<br />
<br />
First I was try install on machine with SQL &amp; RS 2008 R2 installed. Installation was successfull finished, but i had later problem with BIDS.<br />
<br />
Bids hasn't recognize proprerly Infor's driver. <br />
All the times i get following error:<br />
&quot;Unable to connect to data source 'da name'.The selected data extension INFORERPLN is not installed or cannot be loaded.  Verify that the selected data extension is installed on the client for local reports and on the report server for published reports.&quot;<br />
<br />
And also had datasource type name &quot;INFORERPLN&quot; instand &quot;Infor ERP LN Reporting Services&quot;.  <br />
<br />
When I open Infor's assembies with one special tool a realized that it is acctually referenced with RS 2008 instand 2008 R2.<br />
<br />
After all that I try to install on another machine with old SQL &amp; RS 2008 installed.<br />
<br />
Instalation was warning me that on this machine are not Reporting Services (hmm...), but i countiniue installation.<br />
<br />
I open new report project in bids and finally connection with Infor's data sorce works :).  <br />
<br />
But then I try to run &quot;ERL LN Report Configurator&quot;, whic is Infor's addon in BIDS. But when I want add languages to report i get following error:<br />
&quot;The execution of one ore more checked actions failed:<br />
Method not found:<br />
Microsoft.ReportingServices.RdlObjectModel.Report<br />
Microsoft.ReportingServices.RdlObjectModel.Report.Load(Byte[])&quot;<br />
<br />
When i investigated I realized that method<br />
Microsoft.Reporting.Services.RdlObjectModel.Report.Load(Byte[])<br />
is only part of BIDS version 2008 R2 and not also BIDS version 2008 have<br />
(assembly: Microsoft.ReportingServices.Designer.Controls.dll).<br />
<br />
It loks that few features works wind 2008 version and few features forks 2008 R2.<br />
But why? I need completly forked version on one maschine whic have only one instance of reporting services....<br />
<br />
This is a big problem for me. I need to found solution how use Reporting services with Infor. So any help is welcome.<br />
<br />
How can I put in order Infor ERP LN plugin for MS SSRS? <br />
Whic version of Reporting cervices is actually Infor supported?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />

You should also run the installer on the system where BIDS is installed. It will install the Infor DLL in the Private Assemblies directory of VS 2008.</div></div><hr />
