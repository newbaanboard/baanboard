<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rtylerdunn</div><div class="date">23rd June 2016, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">My work requires creating invoices for customers and involves doing the same steps over and over (and over ...)  What is the best way to automate this type of work?  Is it possible to write a script in BaaN or Excel that would call up the proper screens and Input data in the right places so that I can focus less on the busy work?  Our IT Group can write Automation in BaaN but it takes months for even simple Automation.  I would like to find a simpler way to use the existing screens, fields, menus etc but to automate the busy work.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I move to the tools forum - but you can search the AFS/DDC/OLE: Function servers for excel and different options that you can do for automation.  We wrote baan sessions for this type automation.  But if you do not want to wait for IT - you can do a lot with EXCEL.  We do not do any of that - well just some macros to format output reports.</div></div><hr />

Just create a Job , set when it has to run and the session attached to it will run in the background at that specified time.</div></div><hr />
