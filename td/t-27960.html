I want to use one of the  oracle table along with Baan Tables to do a processing in BAAN. As told before this oracle table is not in baan standards (not a tfcmg/tfgld table). How can I read the data from this table. Is it possiable to create any synonyms in BAAN in order to use this oracle table in BAAN ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd August 2006, 23:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We had problems doing this so we just did an export and import to a Baan table.  Not sure you will have the same problem.  What we tried was setting up a table in baan, then the Oracle DBA created a view(or something) and pointed it to the other table.  The problem we encountered was an error with creating or modifying other tables.  It always erred out on the view.  So we changed to exporting and importing.</div></div><hr />

Also how to create the view in BaaN in order to look for the data from oracle table?</div></div><hr />

<br />
possibly this works:<br />
<br />
create a table in baan with fields and domains matching your external table.<br />
(you could compare a nearly matching table in baan and on oracle level, what oracle types matching the baan type.<br />
<br />
<br />
(e.g. tc.mcs.string // tc.mcs.long -&gt; no to special domains).<br />
<br />
Create the table with baan. (Maintains table -&gt; Add Fields, Index etc.)<br />
<br />
Be aware to add 2 fields to your existing oracle table not seen in baan -&gt; Referencecounter and Update Referenccounter (default value 0).<br />
<br />
Delete the table with oracle methods.<br />
<br />
Rename your existing oracle table to the technical name of the baan table e.g. baan.ttisfc991100. (Or make a oracle view).<br />
<br />
Now try to make a simple select statement from within a baan script.<br />
<br />

Yes - all that was all we did(read records).  The Oracle DBA actually went into Oracle and pointed the table to the other location.  I really can not tell you what actual changes he made in Oracle to the table. It almost sounds a lot like Kozure recommended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also keep in mind that baan users char() not varchar()<br />
if you have varchar's it will mess baan right up. <br />
<br />
also all baan fields are &quot;not null&quot; in the database, so any string<br />
fields need to have &quot;&lt;space&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;null&quot;<br />
