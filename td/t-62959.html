I am trying to setup archiving for production order. I did all the initial set up given in the BaaN IV archiving document but I am getting error while opening session - ticst0250m000. and the error says - Dynamic Link Failure in tccom.dll0025.archive.default.company. We do not have source code here in our company so I am not able to debug it. Any thought on the root cause of it or how to debug the same to find the root cause?<br />

Thanks,<br />

Look to see if you have the script and object present for tccomdll0025.  Depending on service pack, you may have a mismatch in scripts/dlls used in the archiving process.  (pre-Infor)/Baan changed the scripts involved with archiving between sp 13 and sp 15 and added/changed a few DLLs to make the process a bit more flexible - like not having to archive general data every time.<br />
<br />
Before starting archiving, I would go onto the Infor support site to investigate/load archiving-related solutions if possible.</div></div><hr />
