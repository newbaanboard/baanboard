<br />
I was wondering if there is any global variable that hold the code of the job that started a session. I know we can use job.process to validate that the session was started by a job, but if it was, is there a variable or any other way to figure out which job started the session? Thanks.<br />
<br />
This is with BaanIV c 4</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th June 2009, 19:29</div></div><div class="posttext">ttaad512.cjob should give the value of the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sgoupil</div><div class="date">30th June 2009, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">But it does not help me. I don't want to know what was run, I want to be able to capture in my code which job started my session.<br />
<br />
Weirdly there is a few variables, like job.report which give the report that the job will start and a few other ones like that, but nothing for the job code!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">30th June 2009, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">So, if you can explain why you need to know what job code started your session within your session, maybe it will help people to come up with a different solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steveauckly</div><div class="date">30th June 2009, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">you should be able to use:<br />
<br />
if job.process then<br />
	import(&quot;ttaad501.cjob&quot;,curr.job)<br />
endif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sgoupil</div><div class="date">2nd July 2009, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Case closed.<br />
<br />
Suggestion from steveauckly solved my problem, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">3rd July 2009, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">May be original problem is solved . But for the benefit of others , one can also get the <br />
current job with value of ttaad512.cjob current through out the program at hand (with <br />
no need to import) . <br />
<br />
Also if one needs the job code in a report run in job session one needs to import ttaad512.cjob.<br />
<br />
In summary there are multiple alternatives for people to get the job  and one can adopt <br />
what one is comfortable with .</div></div><hr />
