<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">I.Benini</div><div class="date">12th April 2006, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
here is the problem: how can I print item pictures (jpeg files) in the SLS invoice report? I am aware that in the Board the question has already been discussed, but I can't find the right solution. I mean I have to print a picture whenever an item line is printed (not only the company logo). Can somebody help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one possible way (not for faint hearted!) is to export invoice data as XML and use Crystal Reports to generate the final report by merging pictures stored in a MS Access Database. <br />
<br />
Pure phantasy? Not really! some time ago I did a quick proof of concept implementation. See attached pdf file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">I.Benini</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just seen the attached file: it's exactly what I have to do!Unfortunately I can't use Crystal Reports (or at least it is not installed by the BaaN customer) so what can I do to merge the BaaN report and the pictures? Why do you convert the report to XML? Can you give me more detailed information?<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Create a new report from the old.  Embed whatever html code you need - like &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;image1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;367&quot; height=&quot;266&quot;&gt;.  Then maybe take this file and create a pdf.  Just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sachin03</div><div class="date">14th April 2006, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option could be to convert the SLS Invoice report to HTML format.  Store all the images on a shared drive (to which all users have access).  You can also store the images with file names as the item code, so that u don't have to hard code the values, u can use the item code to get the image name as well.<br />
Then in the report, include the image from this drive.  always use a web browser to open your report.  this way, the report will include the images &amp; the user can print that through the web browser.<br />
<br />
We tried this with a couple of reports &amp; it worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bamnsour</div><div class="date">14th April 2006, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">One way to do this is to take the report output to Ms-Word using a utility like B2Win or directly using ttstpconv with RTF format. Once in Ms-Word, you can write a macro in Visual Basic to include the Pictures in the document you just created.<br />
<br />
For PDF, some txt2pdf tools allow you to add pictures easily to text. <br />
<br />
In both cases, you can automate printing from within your script<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
