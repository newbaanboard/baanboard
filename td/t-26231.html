Anyone please help me?<br />
<br />
There is a session,Print Shipment (whinh4430m000) for printing but without main table.<br />
<br />
Objective: To have a sort by item group.<br />
I have add a new input field (item group, tcibd001.citg) as Ascending and insert it in before.field in the report, but it did not work?<br />
<br />
As I know , only those field from a main table indicated by the session can be used as &quot;sorting&quot;.<br />
Am I correct? <br />
How to solve it then?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you have done seems to be right<br />
<br />
Objective: To have a sort by item group.<br />
I have add a new input field (item group, tcibd001.citg) as Ascending and insert it in before.field in the report, but it did not work?<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you just ellaborate what is the problem, What exactly &quot;does not work&quot; means ? --- Whats the output / error ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beginer</div><div class="date">1st February 2006, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">As I see the layout in BaaN V....<br />
whinh430.shpm,431.pono are defined as presorted in Input Fields.<br />
<br />
So,in that case u need to put the Sorting Seqn by Item Group as 1 then <br />
whinh430.shpm as 2 ( Ascending/Descending ) and whinh431.pono as 3 ( Ascending/ Descending).<br />
<br />
Do not use Presorted for whinh430.shpm,whinh431.pono</div></div><hr />
