I have included the code below attempting to have the session automatically go to the next set of records after the last field is keyed on the form. It does advance to the next set but the second record's field is highlighted for input instead of the first records. Can anyone help? Thanks.<br />

They were attempting to do the same as you are, but could not get the Standard program to work properly.  I believe that is where you are running into your problem.<br />

After several attempts to correct the problem that they (Baan) created the dropped the project or so it seems.  This happened about 3 years ago.</div></div><hr />
