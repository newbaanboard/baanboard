I would like to have a copy of a few.<br />
<br />
I need them to evaluate so that I can develop a few complex forms my self.<br />
<br />
Especially the split form in sessions like Sales order lines (tdsls4102s000), Maintain Production order (tisfc0101m000).<br />
<br />
<br />
I am working on developing a Maintain form for a customized table. This table is basically storing the production plan. <br />
<br />
The fields are Item code, Planned Quantity, Date. I would like to develope a multi occurrance columnar maintain session as follows<br />
<br />
ItemCode  Item Description  Planned Qty  Date.<br />
<br />
Here the ItemDescription would be displayed from Item master but not stored in the customized table. And it would be a display field.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Vineet</div></div><hr />

If any body is ready to share any custom made session which has similar functionality, that too would be helpful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">6th May 2004, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">From what you posted, though, you can get using the session generator.   Generate a maintenance session, Form type 2, and if your table is defined with the fields in that order, and the Item has a reference to the standard item table, the result by default will be as you requested.  The item description will come as display.  Make sure to check the option for program script when generating, then you can add to that script if you need.  <br />
<br />
It's not a split screen, but does the job you described.  If you want help on split screens, you can research the wait.and.activate (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_processes_overview_and_synopsis) and related commands, but that is more advanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I created a new table defination and table with the item field referring to item master. Later I created a maintain form using the Session Generator with options as mentioned by you.<br />
<br />
Now when I am inserting a record and saving it I am getting the following error as shown in the attached file.<br />
<br />
What is causing this ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume you didn't convert the tiitm001 table definition to runtime. If you create a reference from a new table to an existing table, the existing table should be converted to runtime too. Check your $BSE/dict/dd&lt;pc&gt;/dtiitm/dtiitm001 file whether it points to your table in a REFC line. If not, convert is necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">This may not be necessary based on the way you set your reference.<br />
<br />
are you able to open your table thru GTM without any errors?<br />
<br />
What is your your reference and update / delete criteria for the<br />
field in the new table.<br />
<br />
Also, are you trying to enter a valid item in the new session.Try zooming.<br />
<br />
If you are able to save a record, reading description via a simple select on your script could be an easier option.The same line of code could also validate your item from item master.<br />
<br />
one final thought.post the table field properties and the code generated for the session.the problem could be in these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Jaap; most probably converting to runtime dd for tiitm001 will resove the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vineetu1</div><div class="date">10th May 2004, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear All,<br />
<br />
Thanks..., converting to runtime for tiitm001 did the trick.<br />
<br />
But in the is same session I want to limit the users to enter only manufacturing items. How do I achieve this.<br />
<br />
I tried this by the following session script but it does not work.<br />
<br />
field.tdsil105.item:<br />
<br />
check.input:<br />
	select 	tdsil105.item,tiitm001.item,tiitm001.kitm<br />
	from	tdsil105, tiitm001<br />
	where	tdsil105.item refers to tiitm001<br />
	selectdo<br />
|*****		if tiitm001.kitm &lt;&gt; tckitm.manufacture then<br />
		if tiitm001.kitm &lt;&gt; ltoe(2) then<br />
<br />
		message(&quot;Only Manufactured item allowed&quot;)<br />
<br />
|*** this did not work***<br />
|**** set.input.error(&quot;Only MANUFACTURED items allowed&quot;)<br />
<br />
			input.again()<br />
		endif<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
In the above tried with other subsections like &quot;on.input&quot;,  <br />
&quot;before.checks&quot;, &quot;after.input&quot;, &quot;after.field&quot;  ..etc.<br />
<br />
Also there seems to be some problem in comparing the enum field.<br />
<br />
Pls suggest.<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">10th May 2004, 13:55</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the following code:<br />
<br />
<br />
select ....<br />
...<br />
selectdo<br />
        if tiitm001.kitm &lt;&gt; tckitm.manufacture then<br />
                  message(&quot;Only manufactured items are allowed&quot;)<br />
                  set.input.error(&quot;&quot;)<br />
        endif<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason that you cannot use the enum is probably that you didn't include the tc-package in your package combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">10th May 2004, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">11th May 2004, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Vineet,<br />
<br />
I would recommend you to attend a Baan 4GL Basic Programming Training. I cannot imagine that anyone on this board would like to spend his/her time on these types of questions. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Jaap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">11th May 2004, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, sorry, of course in the rush I made a mistake, and indeed like Jaap suggested, I meant: <br />
<br />
message(&quot;Only manufactured items are allowed&quot;)<br />
set.input.error(&quot;&quot;)<br />
<br />
Second: Jaap, I do not find that comment of yours very friendly. I do not think it is up to you to decide whether people are willing to assist a 'newbie' Baan-tools guy. If you are not willing to put the efforts in assisting those kind of &quot;starters-questions&quot; then that is your fullest right, but there is no need yet to start offending others (if you really mean to give helpful, constructive advice, you shall consider doing that next time in a soft, friendly way, and in a private message rather than a public post on the board).<br />
<br />
Vineetu, let me try and help you a step in the right direction:<br />
<br />
- the message about you writing a function within function, can be due to various reasons, though the idea is that you wrote a function inside another open function. That is not possible, since a function is a seperate peace of code called by the program. <br />
<br />
It is often however caused only by a small mistake, like for instance forgetting to close a function &lt;}&gt; or similar things. If you post your code, it might be easier to help you on this one.<br />
<br />
- As for your display session: filtering in a display session is done by adding query extensions. I see you are in BaanIV? Then you would have to use something like: <br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
query.extension = &quot;tiitm001.kitm = tckitm.manufacture&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th May 2004, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreement with En.  All questions are welcome no matter how simple or hard they are.  The board is voluntary so when something does not pique your interest just ignore it.  Some times I like to find simple questions on the board - these sometimes generate the most reponses and are ones even I can answer.    I do recommend reading the  FAQ (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/misc.php?s=&amp;action=faq)  - for everyone.  <br />
<br />
So Vineet do not let the above post discourage you.   Ask your questions and we will give what answers we know.  Just be patient because like it says the board is voluntary, and it may take a few days before you get an answer.<br />

Is there any link available on this board which gives all the details / help for using the query.extension and related commands.<br />

I have been using the query option available with all the sessions but had never used it in program script. <br />
