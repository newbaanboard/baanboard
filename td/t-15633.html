<br />
I am new to Baan customization and am working on a report of material transfer. I want to put a checkpoint in that when the field for Transit Warehouse is not equal to blank only then the data shud be printed.<br />
<br />
Please tell that what shud i write in place of BLANK (below line) as check point<br />
<br />
tdrpl100.twar &lt;&gt; BLANK <br />
<br />
I have tried that with the option as 0, &quot; &quot;, &quot;   &quot; but didn't get the required output. Also tell me why these has not worked. :confused: <br />

Did u try &quot;   &quot; (3 spaces)  . Alternatively u may use function isspace() for that purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bansalajay</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 10:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hitesh, Thanks for the early reply,<br />
<br />
I have tried that by providing the three characters to it but it didn't work out. And one you have written regarding the use of function isspace().<br />
<br />
I don't know about it, can you please send me the details for the same and help for its usage.<br />
<br />
Ajay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">In the output expression, write following code<br />
<br />
strip$(tdrpl100.twar) &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
not isspace(tdrpl100.twar)<br />
<br />
It should work . Further compile ur report in debugger mode , set the break point andsee what is the value of the tdrpl100.twar (if the above does not work).</div></div><hr />
