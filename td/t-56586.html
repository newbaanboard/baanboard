To my opinion it is not really important, you should check if the original invoice has been printed. In that case you can consider the invoice as printed and sent to the customer. Al invoices printed afterwards are copies in that case, you can state this on the invoice by marking it with a label f.i. &quot;INVOICE COPY&quot;.  The status ( final printed etc ) is stored in the Baan database.</div></div><hr />

I think it is very hard to store in database. As we can select one invoice or a batch of invoice to print out,if system  indeed need to calculate,it must store the details,one invoice by one invoice to store the times in a table. What's more,in a batch of invoices, some are the first time reprint, some are the second time,some are third time...,how to print them out is also a question to be considered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">25th August 2009, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not mean to store it in the database. You should use the standard indeed. In most Baan tables an invoice status is stated, not the number of times an invoice is printed. Basicly, to my opinion, the number of times an invoice has been printed isn't interesting at all as an invoice is of the type original invoice (first print) of copy (all others printed). Based on the invoice status, which changes from f.i. proforma to final when printed and the invoice date you could maybe perform some kind of check. F.i. is the status is final  and the invoice date &gt; today....print the label &quot;COPY&quot; on your invoice.  So the message is check which fields you have available to perform some kind of check on original of copy. The number of copy itself is not relevant as every print after the original invoice is a copy.  Good luck,<br />
