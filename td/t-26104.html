<br />
I am on LN and I am facing a problem recently.<br />
<br />
In cisli2405m000 reprint invoice, I select print by invoice.<br />
<br />
Then i enter the invoice number range, from SLS 20000001 to 20000009.<br />
I expect it to print the invoices in order of the numbers 1 to 9<br />
but it is not printing in sequence. It prints 4 first then, 3 then 6 etc etc.<br />
I dont understand which sorting it is using, it is not sorted by business partner or address. How come LN dont sort by invoice numbers?<br />
<br />
How do I change the sorting here without the source code? I tried to put cisli205.ityp and cisli205.idoc in the input field and sort by Ascending. But it still don't work. Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

Hi Kingsto88,<br />
had the same behaviour on Baan 5.0c. I found out it is sorted first on postal code (tccom130.pstc in Baan 5) and secondary (if pstc is the same) on adress code (tccom130.cadr).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
