<br />
We have a problem for printing our payment conditions on back side of the invoice.<br />
The payment-conditions are loaded on our canon-copier, we need to sent a command into the report, so the right payment condition is printed.<br />
Therefore, we need to sent &lt;esc&gt;&amp;f0Y&lt;esc&gt;&amp;n6W&lt;esc&gt;mfo5 to the temp-file for defining the payment condition and sent &lt;esc&gt;&amp;f2x for printing it.<br />
In the temp-files I can find ^[ as &lt;esc&gt;-character coming from the print-driver, but when putting this into a field on the report or program script(with vi) and sending it to the printer, the ^[ is removed and the report prints the command instead of the payment-condition.We also use editplus for maintainting the report-scripts and program-scripts. How can we enter this in<br />
editplus so the result is ^[ in the temp-file to the printer?<br />
<br />
Kind regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th July 2007, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in a report you can use chr$(27) - or in a program script.  When using vi what you do is hit i for insert, ctrl-v(quote next character), then the escape key.  If using in program or report script I would use chr$(27).  If editing a plain text file in vi then I might use the ctrl-v method.<br />
<br />
I guess I do not understand what you are trying to accomplish.  You could put the escape sequence in a user defined font on the print driver, then use that font on the report for that field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simpson</div><div class="date">20th July 2007, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Mark,<br />
I know in vi I can use ctrl-v and pressing &lt;esc&gt;. I tried it but the result is not correct. I try to give more details.<br />
We would like to print automaticly our payment conditions on the back side of each invoice-page coming from BaanERP. Therefore, a file with the payment condition is loaded into our canon-copier. By adding a special command into a field on the report, the payment condition is printed on the report(printing to the printer creates a temporary file on /opt/baant/bse/tmp).<br />
The correct command we need to sent to the copier for this is:<br />
&lt;esc&gt;&amp;f0Y&lt;esc&gt;&amp;n6W&lt;esc&gt;&amp;mfo5<br />
mfo5 is the name of the file loaded on the copier<br />
When I put this command into a variable on the report(with vi in the report script I set payment.cond = &quot;^[&amp;f0Y etc...), when sending it to the printer<br />
by print report,  the output is not correct(the command is printed(without    ^[&amp;) instead of the payment condition loaded in the copier. When I check the<br />
tmp-file on the unix system, I see that the escape-character is missing.<br />
How can I make it possible to sent the correct escape code to the copier?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">20th July 2007, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Because you are on unix you can put the ESC-seq as a user defined var in the printer driver<br />
<br />
i.e. like <br />
<br />
...<br />
usr11=\E,<br />
...<br />
<br />
is the sequence for ESC. After this yu can use the pc$-vars inside your code for inserting this definitions in normal program vars. Just remember: usr11 is not pc$11. It a little tricky to figure out which pc$ var corresponds to which usr-var of the driver (you have to add 6 if I remember correctly. So pc$(17) is usr11). You can find all you need for this in the online-help. Look for pc$.  <br />
Longer strings like &quot;usr4=\E&amp;f1S\E&amp;a-450V\E*c600v2700h2P\E&amp;f1S,&quot; are also possible. This one puts a white filed on the printer (did work up to LJ 4000 printers. We needed it to masquerade a part of a barcode).<br />
<br />
The colon &quot;,&quot; at the end is important!<br />
