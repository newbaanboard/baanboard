<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th June 2006, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">My first thought when I read this is for you to set up a user font in your print driver.  The user font would turn on the character set for this character, print the character and turn it off the character set.  So on your report for this field would select your user defined font.  Never tried this, but sounds feasible.<br />
<br />
Addition:  You could also use the report script to print the escape codes for the printer to set the character set, etc.  Using spool variables.</div></div><hr />

In our system , I couldn't find the value. But they can be writen characters by using chr$() . for example for '@'   equals  chr$(64).  You can insert it on layout like report variable.<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

I did not think chr$(228) would work, but it could - I did a quick test on a report I was working on and it gave me somthing different than sigma.</div></div><hr />
