<br />
What does baan store in the record buffers (rcd.tppmmxxx) which is a string buffer? Does it store the actual values of all the fields in the table record or does it just store a pointer to the memory location where all the field data is stored?<br />
<br />
Another question: if we have two different record buffers for the same table, is it possible to compare these record buffers and check if they have the same values or not? <br />
<br />
What I am trying to do is in Baan Vb, whenever we run &quot;Generate Outbound Advice&quot; for an order, a record is inserted in the outbound history table even though nothing has been adviced for the outbound line. I am trying to see if there is any simple way to make sure that the outbound order line is indeed changed (atleast one field is modified) before inserting a line in the history table. I was wondering if we can use the record buffers to check this.<br />
<br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Praveen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
NULL characters in strings (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_3gl_features_null_characters_in_strings) <br />
<br />
There is one exception to this rule. When the left or right side in an assignment is a record buffer (rcd. &lt;table name&gt;), all bytes in the buffer will be copied. For example:<br />
<br />
table		tttadv999<br />
strbuf = rcd.ttadv999		| NULL characters are copied<br />
rcd.ttadv999 = strbuf		| NULL characters are copied<br />
strbuf2 = strbuf			   	| NULL characters are NOT copied<br />
In all other cases, if NULL characters are meaningful, use copy.mem(). This copies NULL characters as well as ordinary characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another question: if we have two different record buffers for the same table, is it possible to compare these record buffers and check if they have the same values or not?<br />
<br />
You can use cmp.mem() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_memory_operations_cmp_mem) and copy.mem() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_memory_operations_copy_mem) <br />
<br />
I am trying to see if there is any simple way to make sure that the outbound order line is indeed changed (atleast one field is modified)<br />
<br />
You can refer to the usage of update.occ() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_form_and_form_field_operations_update_occ) and before.save.object() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_dal_before_save_object) <br />
<br />
Use this to update referenced tables after a record has been added or updated. The mode argument is set by the 4GL engine. The possible values are: <br />
<br />
DAL_NEW indicates a new record<br />
DAL_UPDATE indicates a record being updated</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found another tools function - changed() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_variables_checking_changes_changed)<br />
<br />
There is also a predefined variable -<br />
<br />
long attr.changed 4R<br />
 Indicates if the current field has changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, refer to the link - Validation for input (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1791&amp;highlight=changed)</div></div><hr />

If the status is not advised then simply return from the After.save.object of the dal of whinh220.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
