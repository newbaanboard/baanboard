<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">19th July 2012, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a report that should print on 8.5W X 5.5 and I was planning to use Bwprint because the layout includes color and barcodes.<br />
<br />
When I run the program and preview the report, bwprint always displays the output in portrait 8.5W X 11.  Interactively, I can select 5.5 X 8.5 paper size and select landscape.  What I cannot figure out is how to automate the output and eliminate the need to change the settings interactively.<br />
<br />
I have created a new device W30.  Device &quot;W&quot; is used for most output using bwprint.  I may not have set up the new paper type correctly so I have attached a document with images of the settings.<br />
<br />
The report is being generated using command:<br />
<br />
stpapi.set.report(&quot;tisfc0408m000&quot;, &quot;rtisfc040807000&quot;, &quot;W30&quot;, error )<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for assistance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">19th July 2012, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">i would experiment changing the Paper height on maintain Fonts by paper type. from what i see 66 is the full paper height (11). i have done this before on direct printing on a zebra label printer and i always got the correct size without anymore user input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">19th July 2012, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I changed the paper height to 30 and there is no change in the output.  When you do direct printing to zebra label printer, is the device a windows device or a direct device?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">19th July 2012, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">this was some time ago but i'm pretty sure it was a windows device. i also used bwprint to format the fonts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">20th July 2012, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Joy, I have done exactly what you have done for a 4 X 1 1/2 label on a zebra printer. You need to play around with the fonts by paper type until it fits. For my label I have a font width of 48 and height of 10 for middle size font.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">20th July 2012, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Gary.  You have reiterated the same response from Benito.  I have changed the page length from 30 to 10 just to see if it causes change.  And no change :-(  I changed all the widths to 10 and still no change to the output.<br />
<br />
I'm running on SP19 which was installed late 2005, so I researched some patches to bwprint and opened a case with BaaN.  They are researching this.  Maybe they have a solution.</div></div><hr />
