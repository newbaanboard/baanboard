I am selecting some data from baan and sending to a flat file. is there a utility where I can sort the data of the flat file and read the through seq.read() and send it again based on my requirements.<br />
<br />
we are on BaanERP running on windows NT.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chilloutdude</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">can you give sample program for sort????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">The Baan sort I believe has the same options as its *ix cousin. Here is a link to a man page of sort if you don't have access to an unix box:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 22:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I also found baan execute-able on our unix installation, <br />
<br />
$BSE/bin/sort6.2 <br />
<br />
I think it works the same as the unix sort, I never used it yet.<br />
<br />
&gt;sort6.2 ---<br />
Usage: sort [-qe error-file] [-funbirdcmt'x'] [+beg_pos[-fnbird]] [-end_pos]] [-<br />
{o|qo} outfile] [file] ...<br />
<br />
<br />
those are the baan specific sort options, I think it might be available and work in the baan windows installation too.</div></div><hr />

Here is another example of coding where run.baan.prog and sort is used. Follow this link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1908).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to just do a simple example of sort on a IVc3 unix system.  Here is the code I used:<br />
<br />
<br />
prn.cntr = run.baan.prog(&quot;sort&quot;, &quot;/usr2/baan/ivc/bse/tmp/test.in -o /usr2/baan/ivc/bse/tmp/test.out&quot;, RP_WAIT)<br />
<br />
<br />
Each time I run this, the return value is 1 and no file is created.  Am I specifying something wrong, or are there settings I need to check?  Sort works fine in the shell, so I'm a bit perplexed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the sort.in file being created in the script?  Could it still be open? Make sure the sort.in file is closed.  The format looks correct and when I run the baan sort6.1 with a format like yours it works.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">It wasn't an issue with the file being open -- good idea.  I think it may be a permission issue.  I was running this using BW with a &quot;-- -set USER=&quot; option.  The id in the USER option is not a valid unix user, although the user listed in the &quot;connect as&quot; section is.  Anyway, when I removed the USER option, it worked.<br />
<br />
On another related note, I also tried running sort through Baan using the -k construct, since my man pages indicate the + and - constructs are obsolete.  Well, -k works in the unix sort, but not in the version (sort6.1) activated by run.baan.prog.<br />

Fun, fun, fun...:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you like to use the Unix sort program instead of the BaaN Sort program...<br />
<br />
you have to use the command, shell() instead of run.baan.prog()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Ed,<br />
<br />
I thought about permissions but blew it off because it looked like it was in the BSE$/tmp directory. But I based this on our system and that was a bad assumption on my part. <br />
<br />
Glad you got it working - but I would not have expected the -- -set USER to cause a problem.  We use the same UNIX logon for both test and production, but different Baan logons for all companies other the production. So when I logon to the test company I have to use the -- -set USER option.  I would actually expect the problem to be at the UNIX level, possibly how the file was created.  When we create files (using Baan) in the $BSE/tmp directory they have rw for both user and group - so in theory I can sort other users files.<br />
But I have been wrong before and I guess it would really depend on how a system was setup(umasks,user groups, etc.).<br />
