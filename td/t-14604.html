<br />
I have a following problem and I spent hours trying to solve it but nothing :(<br />
<br />
In Program Script on the first record of the main sql loop I calculate a value (sum of records that have a certain variable empty) that is correct when I compare it with what should I get. This is supposed to be printed out in report script in a after.field layout. There is a detail layout but it is only used for calling a function that tahes the sum which is passed to the report as a string and to convert it to a double. Problem is that when I debug this report and stop on detail to see if it picked up the sum I see it didn't and am very puzzled since the very first record and the very first call to brp.ready in program script was done after I calculated the sum and it is not empty. Why isn't this value in report script?!?!<br />
<br />
All other values, sums are passed ok and I get a value but only for this first nothing?!?<br />
<br />
I tried stepping when in program script I hit brp.ready and I got through the following functions:<br />
<br />
r.init.pool()<br />
r.reset.other(long level)<br />
r.reset.details(long level)<br />
r.write.seq.file()<br />
<br />
here I notice that the sum I calculated is not shown in the corresponding variable until after r.write.seq.file() function. But in this way debugger never stops on breakpoints I have set on the detail layout and these after.field layouts that are supposed to have that sum when printed?!<br />
<br />
I have no idea what could be wrong...<br />
<br />
also some input.fields are in sort mode...<br />
<br />
any help is greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

This way the first sent record could be somewhere else when u check in before.layout of detail line .<br />
<br />
The report sorts as per the sort fields given by you in the report. Just check to find out the correct detail line where your computed figure is available .<br />
<br />
So value calculated in the program script is present in the report but not necessarily the first line .</div></div><hr />
