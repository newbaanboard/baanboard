<br />
can you check if your array variable is declared as based and if you have allocated memory or not in your program script.</div></div><hr />

Solution #114416: Incomplete domains caused Create Runtime Datadictionary to generate an error <br />
<br />
Version(s): B40_b, B40_c, B50_b, 7.1_a <br />
<br />
Issue: When incomplete domains (domains defined as enum, but without enum constants) were present, the dumping of domains (for exemple by session Create Runtime Data Dictionary) resulted in error messages like &quot;Fatal error: bis_alloc_mem: sym, i=0&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maggrietjie</div><div class="date">7th January 2002, 12:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply.  My variables are declared as based and I am allocating memory in my script.  Could it be that I am using two different arrays in one program?  If this is the case would it work if I free the memory from the first array after I've used it?  Any suggestions on when I should free it?  I do not think the solution proposed are relevant to this case, but thanks anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know the solution in itself is probably not relevant but I thought the issue description might give you some indication:<br />
<br />
When incomplete domains (domains defined as enum, but without enum constants) were present...<br />
However as you are confirming that your array declarations are correct, the root cause of your problem must be something else.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't be of more help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem was, that the application did not abort when the error occurred - it continued running. So, debugging was a bit more difficult.<br />
<br />
I found the error when doing an alloc.mem on a string - where the length variable was 0. The alloc.mem then creates this message, the program continues - and you could get (or even not get) an abort later on.<br />
<br />
Maybe that is your problem too?<br />
<br />
Take care<br />
