<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th June 2005, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - does anyone out there using ERPln and the Dynamic Forms Editor have any experience / suggestions for how to handle the following problem?<br />
<br />
When I create a new Dynamic Form, I want subgroups to NOT appear on new tabs, but to instead appear in the normal order, inside of Boxes.  I was able to do this once a while ago, but I cannot do it now with another session (Same version of the DFE.EXE).  My groups keep appearing as tabs instead of boxed within the regular.   I am attaching screen shots (Zipped up Word Document) of what I THINK is the relivant information for the Session that works and the session that does not work.  I have unchecked the option for Sub Groups appear on New Page (Detail), but still, they do.  I can't find any setup difference with the one that works and the one that does not, the only difference I see is that the one that does not work is just the Detail session, no overview.  Could that make a difference in how the Detail session displays WRT Tabs/Group Boxes..?  I wouldn't think so...<br />
<br />
Can anyone say what I am missing?  Or...is there possibly a bug with my version of the DFE?  I am using a version sent to me by Baan support:  Version 7.3a.28.  If you use the DFE for ERP ln (dfe.exe) and do not have this problem, I would like to know what version you are using.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The latest SSA_ERP_LN_6.1/Gemini DFE Version is 7.6a.4.<br />
<br />
You have to enable the 2nd and 3rd options for new page tabs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have a Support Link to download that version?  The only one I can find on the support site is for 5.0b, 5.0c or 5.2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th June 2005, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, I now have the latest DFE - 7.6a.4 and BW version:  7.6a.01.3.<br />
<br />
No help there :(, they come out the same, but I finally I had a look at a standard form - my old DFE was giving an error when I tried before.  It looks like what they are doing is making a main Group for the heading, and you can attach sub groups to that group with sub group boxes, but as soon as the Main Group gets too big for 1 form, the sub-groups pop out into their own tabs.  Did I SAY to do that??? NO!!  When I remove enough fields that it fits on 1 form, the boxes stay.  That explains why I got the 1 session to work, there was only 1 form.<br />
<br />
So, basically I need to create 1 group for each form if I want to use boxes.  Can anyone show otherwise?  Seems like the DFE should handle that, I mean, not very dynamic if I have to say what goes on each form.   Oh well, work around found.  Thanks a LOT NP for your suggestions and version numbers, I'm sure that really old version was a bad idea anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">9th June 2005, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tip Vamsi, I was conserned about that.  The form just gets a lot bigger, even to the point of running off to the right of my screen, but the fields do not get redistributed, the boxes stay in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">9th June 2005, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Whew :). Now the trick is to make sure that you design at the same resolution as your client's lowest configuration. Or specify in your design that the work you did can be tested at x*y resolution or better.</div></div><hr />
