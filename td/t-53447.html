I was wondering if anyone out there has been able to call a SQL Reporting Services report from within a Baan Session, passing parameters as well.  My report requires Project and Item to run.  I was thinking about putting a Zoom to field on the Customized Item Data form that would simple zoom out a run a Baan program script that would feed call the report and pass Project and Item and open it in PDF format.  I know Reporting Services has an rs.exe utility that I can use but I will need to write a script to feed it some info like Format = PDF.  I'm thinking I should just be able to call the rs utility from a shell command in my script.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?<br />

We do that running some URL's for reports, but nothing really that fancy.  Not sure if that helps or not.</div></div><hr />

I've added a field to the Maintain Customized Item session that is just 1 char with a zoom to a custom session.  The custom session has no forms and is using a 3GL type script.  In my script I simply have the function main() with my app_start line in it.  That's it.  This session will then call my .rss script that runs the SQL reporting services report.  Sound like a plan?<br />
