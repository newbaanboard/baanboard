I have developed a customized, multi-occurence session to look at summarized data by year.  Rather than using fixed column headings for the years (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, etc.), I created form fields and then populate these fields in the program script.  When I start this session manually, everything looks good.  However, when I start this session from another session using start.synchronized.child(), these column heading fields do not display, even though the label which I used for the column which describes the type of data records does display.  I verified that the form fields are being populated via debug mode.  I believe that the problem is with the start.synchronized.child() or possibly the fact that the session that I am try to start this session from is a synchronized dialog session.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had this type problem before and how did you resolve this?<br />

Thanks in advance for your help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The session script which displays the data is psmi9502mn000.bc and the session script which contains the start.synchronized.child() is pcom4110sn010.bc.<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />
