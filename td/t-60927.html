I have a few questions which might help me to corretly set this up.<br />
1. When the mail is sent through emessage connector, what's the sender's name, subject and content of the email. <br />
2. What mailbox does emessage connector use for sending the email ?<br />
3. How can I configure my own sender's name (email id), subject and content ?<br />

Hello Mr.Punit,<br />
<br />
*There are two ways to send emails using eMsg connector. One using SMTP in non interactive mode and other through Outlook adapter. When you use SMTP connector, you can specify in your code, what should be the from id and &quot;from name&quot; and it does not use any local mail profile.<br />
*If you use Outlook adapter in your code, your local mail profile will be used and the system will automatically use the default mail account of outlook as Sender. Also mails you send using outlook will appear in Sent Items folder of your local mail profile.<br />
<br />
I am attaching script of my session. In my program script, I have used SMTP connector in non-interactive mode. Hope it helps.<br />

I've configured two devices for outlook and smtp. However while using the outlook device I get a mail from system administrator <br />
&quot;Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients. <br />
None of your e-mail accounts could send to this recipient.&quot;<br />
I have also defined both the sender and recipient in the address book session.<br />
For SMTP I created a scriprt from the one provided by you. While debugging I did not get any errors but the mail was not sent. Is there any additional configuration required on the ERP server for this ? Do I need to setup a new mailbox ? Infor told me to use the ERP server name as the &lt;mail from&gt; domain in the Provider parameters, but you have defined your company domain and it's working for you !</div></div><hr />

Hi Mr.Punit,<br />
<br />
As you would have seen in my code, I am not fetching recipient from address book defined in ERPLn, but I use the e-mail id defined in addresses session, and this address in-turn is linked to business partner.<br />
<br />
Also, we have a proxy mail server, which does not require any authentication and I use SMTP service of this server. There is no extra configuration done apart from this.<br />

Thanks for all your inputs. Infor has validated the application setup for emessage connector, there is some issue with the mail server blocking these mails. <br />
<br />
I'm attaching the screenhots of the setup for future reference.</div></div><hr />

Hello Punit,<br />
<br />
One possible cause (which I faced initially in our setup too) might be your mail server is treating the e-mails generated through eMsg connector as SPAMs. There must be some feature in you mail system where you can specify IP address of the ERPLn application server which is generating mails, which in-turn will allow messages from particular IP address and will not consider as SPAMs.<br />
