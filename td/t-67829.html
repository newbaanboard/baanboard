One DLL (A) function is calling the function in other DLL (B), so i want to capture the name of the function present in DLL (A) that made the call to function in DLL (B) in script of DLL (B). I am already using variable (prog.name$) to capture the session code, but i want to capture the function name present in DLL(A). IS there a predefined variable for this? I dont have source code for DLL (A), only have it for DLL (B).<br />

No inbuilt function as Jaap rightly said but you can always take a bshell trace and check the program flow. It will give you the list of calls made during program execution with all the details required. And if you have a specific requirement, you can post the actual reason behind this, may be someone can have a work around for you.</div></div><hr />
