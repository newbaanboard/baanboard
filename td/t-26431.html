<br />
I have a small problem. The Before.zoom section is not working. I tried as follows:<br />
<br />
field.tcibd001.item:<br />
before.zoom:<br />
if (condition = true) then<br />
       attr.zoomsession$ = &quot;session1&quot;<br />
       attr.zoomreturn$ = &quot;fieldX&quot;		<br />
else<br />
	attr.zoomsession$ = &quot;session2&quot;<br />
	attr.zoomreturn$ = &quot;fieldX&quot;		<br />
endif<br />
<br />
what could be the reason?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

What exactly happens does it always zoom to the same session or does the session not zoom at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the section &quot;before.zoom:&quot; is never called, it always zoom to the session which is set at the form field level. I want to call the different sessions based on the condition.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
If I not provide the session at the form field level then I got the folowing message when try to zoom to session:<br />
<br />
&quot;No zoomsession defined&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark, actually the section &quot;before.zoom&quot; is not executed, I checked it in the debug. If this section is get called then problem will resolved.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
I just pulled up a before zoom coded in Baan Vc, and it seems to be working ok.  I have a normal 'input' field on the form, with a Session zoom defined, and in the script/debug I do hit the before zoom section.<br />
<br />
Some thoughts:  <br />
- Make sure it's an 'input' field.   <br />
- Make sure the debugger is coming up at all, and it does not say 'Not the most recent source code' or similar message<br />
- Are there any before input things going on that would prevent the zoom?  Does the zoom work in general?<br />
<br />
I guess it could be a tools issue, but I never had a problem or had to do anything special...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lisa:<br />
This field is an input field<br />
Yes, the debugger is comming up and I step the code in section &quot;Before.program&quot; and there is not such message 'Not the most recent source code' or similar message<br />
There is no &quot;before input&quot; things.<br />
<br />
Mark:<br />
Where I should &quot;turn off automatic zoom&quot; ?<br />
<br />
I am surprise because the similar logic is working at other place.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I just saw the post by Lisa and Baan V is probably different that Baan IV.  The automatic zoom meant that when you moved into the field on the form it automatically launched the zoom when you came into the field.  <br />
<br />
One thing I have had to do before when modifying forms was to re-create RTDD on the form and script.  Not sure if you do this in V or what.</div></div><hr />

I have exactly the same problem with this domain and only this domain. All others work. Probably got something to do with the item segmentation in Baan 5. I will research more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">16th August 2007, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it has to do with item segmentation.<br />
use:<br />
field.tpppc211.item.segment.1:<br />
before.zoom:</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you want to call session as zoom other than that you defined in filed level you can use att.zoomcode = 0 in before.zoom event.</div></div><hr />
