When I scan some of the latest posts here we can still see some active members-of-old and many youngsters asking questions.<br />
<br />
And there is still something to learn. But when I search for posts on new technology like Extensions (which is quite powerfull to replace &quot;old style Own-programming code&quot;) there are not so many posts.<br />
<br />
So are you old programming guru's away from Baan? Or stuck with the old-school development? Or actually also (like myself) moving towards Extensions?</div></div><hr />

I won't go into politics, but we ended up converting to Oracle EBS.  I wish we had converted to LN and then I am sure I would be asking lots of questions.  Now I am just toughing it out until I retire in a couple of years.</div></div><hr />

We find it hard to find assistance even in Infor when it comes to adapting to the new platforms and technology. Would like to be more of an advocate to the new feature rich direction, but it has a steep learning curve and appears not to be mature. Lacks tooling and coherence. - or I miss some crucial information...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">4th October 2021, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We migrated from LN 10.2 onto LN 10.7 and started using extensions, trying to avoid standard source code modifications as much as possible. We'll, extensions are quite powerfull, but sometimes you still do miss something.<br />
But you'll be more restricted if you start using extensions AND LN in the cloud. We're on premise, so we're still good to use DLLs and functions as we want to.<br />
<br />
Extension still use the good old 3GL/4GL syntax. So it's still good old &quot;baan&quot; coding most of the time. I wished we've already had extensions, when LN was introduced.<br />
<br />
We did find training on extensions before we started migrating (ITC Hannover/Germany).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VishalMistry</div><div class="date">5th October 2021, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to share my thoughts on LN Extension...<br />
<br />
If you are a Classic tools developer and want to dive into new technology development like LN Studio / LN Extensions. It is very difficult to find resources on internet.<br />
<br />
If you are lucky enough, you may get little help from Infor support guys. Even I had a very difficult time learning about Extensions. I logged few incidents and was lucky enough to get help from Infor Technical guys.<br />
<br />
I would request you to refer to Extension Development Guide which may clear your fundamental and also get you started.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">5th October 2021, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">... If you are a Classic tools developer  you also need to be aware that although written in 4GL things are basically different (like the lack of derivation structure, working with activities and not the least using the Public Interfaces (like a new intermediate interface abstraction layer). At first I started to use the standard provided AddValue function that later appeared to be a define. Then I wrote a number of own defines to be able to use &quot;LN tablefieldnames from tools&quot; as XML Identifiers. And even later yet (when debugging) I saw that all those defines refer to one DLL call. ... It is very difficult to find resources on internet. Even here on our own BaanBoard. But it may be a good idea to help one another once more in the &quot;WonderWorld of Baan&quot; when taking those next steps along with Infor.<br />
<br />
... you may get little help from Infor support guys. Even I had a very difficult time learning about Extensions. ... As if there are no programmers left...I would request you to refer to Extension Development Guide which may clear your fundamental and also get you started. It is helpful, but for me it did not bridge the gap between &quot;what I know&quot; and &quot;what I need to know&quot;. Like &quot;Unlike 4GL where you can call DLL functions, in the Extension layer ...&quot; and &quot;If your need a Public Interface for a non standard function call, this is the way to go&quot;. I must say that JaapJD does a good job here!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">5th October 2021, 21:11</div></div><div class="posttext">... started using extensions, trying to avoid standard source code modifications as much as possible.Courageous! Chapeau<br />
...But you'll be more restricted if you start using extensions AND LN in the cloud. We're on premise, so we're still good to use DLLs and functions as we want to.So are we. We added extensions for new functionality only. All old customized and completely new software was just ported.<br />
We did find training on extensions before we started migrating (ITC Hannover/Germany).Which training did you take?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">6th October 2021, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Which training did you take?<br />
We asked for a specific training on how to use extensions. Ah, and I did mix up things (sorry).<br />
<br />
This specific training, was not provided by ITC, but by an developer of our LN partner, who already used extensions for some time. (Had some Mingle training from ITC around the same time. But we ended up not using Mingle.)<br />
<br />
We where using our own LN 10.7 installation in the training to get things started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">6th October 2021, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">There something I'd like to mention: LN is still evolving<br />
When we started using extensions in LN the when.field.changes hook was not available in maintenance sessions. Infor added this hook with a tools solution.<br />
We also requested some process extensions from Infor. I did not expect this to happen, but Infor implemented those real fast. (Some of the process extensions already existed in the cloud version and had to be backported to LN 10.7.)<br />
Those added extensions are added by application solutions, not tools solutions. So it may be helpful to update your installed LN during the development, to get the latest updates on extensions.<br />
<br />
Process extension are a new way of filtering processed data. I started with suppressing purchase order positions during printing to get a hand on how it will work. I think this is the only “big” new thing.<br />
I have not used report extensions, there may be some other “big” new things like modifying the xml-data file (I think you can modify the selected data on its way to the report object).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">6th October 2021, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Reports indeed appears to be a totally different story now (at last), haven't touched it yet, since we also use a 3rd party document formatter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">6th October 2021, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We're still using windows server printer (so it's still bwprint.exe on the print server). As far as I can tell, the new report designer and report extensions will require pdf as output. So this is still no option for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">6th October 2021, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding is that it outputs to tmp PDF - if you are using a printer device, it will use the ES reporting service/cloud transfer service/whatever they call it now to send the PDF to the printer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">19th October 2021, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Talking of which... I wonder what your take is in this poll (http://www.baanboard.com/node/5291).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VishalMistry</div><div class="date">21st October 2021, 06:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Extensibility in Infor LN 10.7 is really promising. The only problem is very slow adoption to higher version of LN from legacy systems.<br />
<br />
One another reason is little to no training material availability on LN. Usually structured training (functional + technical) is available on chargeable basis, which would be challenging for most of the technical and functional consultants. <br />
<br />
Once it picks up pace, there is no denying Baanboard would flourish with questions on Infor LN 10.5 and 10.7.<br />
<br />
But as of now, there is a long way to go.<br />
