<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ken bohnenkamp</div><div class="date">30th September 2005, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 tables that are very similar. I would like to assign the fields of one table equal to the fields of the other table. I know I can set each field as follows:<br />
aracp010.field1 = aracp014.field1<br />
<br />
but is there a simple command in baan that will set all the fields rather than assiging each field individually. I have over 30 fields in the tables. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th September 2005, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">How similiar?  Is something like the first 20 fields the same?  If it is something like that then you might be able to use the record buffers(rcd.taracp010 = rcd.taracp014).  this would set the first x number of fields the same.  Then all other fields must be set - don't skip one.  If only the first couple of fields are the same then just set them manually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">30th September 2005, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with mark_h . additionally If there are  relations between these fields of tables. <br />
You should select these fields in SQL  and use REFERS TO . For example Table_A.field1 relates TABLE_B.field1  <br />
  SELECT TABLEA.fileds<br />
  from TABLE_A,TABLE_B  <br />
  where TABLE_A.field1 REFERS TO TABLE_B<br />
  selectdo <br />
   **********************************<br />
  endselect <br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />

I have developed a library that would copy a record from one table to another but was basically going from a source company to a target company where it's using the same table.  Now with little modifications you could have it go from table A to table B as long as table A and B are the same; if they are not the same then this will not work.  I am including the source code for the library as well as the source from the script.  The base of the logic is to copy an item and BOM record from company A to company B.</div></div><hr />
