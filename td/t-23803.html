<br />
on the occurances records, I have fields from another table B in addition to those from A. One of those fields is a date field. I was wondering if there is a Good way to order / reorder records by this date field (just the occurances records).Any kind of dynamic reorder / dyanamic index?<br />
<br />
Addition of this field in the the table A is an option but would like to avoid if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are you linking table B to table A?  Would it not have the same index as A, since you have a 1 to 1 relationship it seems like?  (Maybe an example with your table indexes and relationship would help if I am mis understanding that).  One suggestion, can you just make the main table B instead?  And change all the view fields on the form to B instead of A. You can then use the sort from B....I may be missing or assuming critical issues, show us your table structures..  You could update table A based on updates to Table B if you need this to be a maintain...that could get messy as well, but it sounds like you just want the display.<br />
<br />
Or..make a report that sorts like that and add a button to print it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am still weighing the options of moving the date field over to the other table, changing the session's main table ( this I had tried already but becomes more complex once the  updates are considered-  btw this is not a strictly display session). Thanks</div></div><hr />
