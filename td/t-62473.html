<br />
I have a requirement wherein I need to open a customized session to print customized format of GRN at the time of posting quantity on Production Order. <br />
<br />
Currently when we perform the report order complete, after successful posting system opens by default the standard report of storage list. What I want is I need to export the GRN number generated during quantity posting to the customized session and then print the customized GRN...<br />
<br />
I understand by exploring this can be done through UE Dll, I am not sure how to go about it and if we can do this using UE DLL. <br />
<br />
Basically in other words I am trying to acheive 2 things. <br />
<br />
1. To be able to pass value from standard session to customized session on a particular triggered transaction, in this case, On successful production order posting I need to pass the GRN number to customized session. <br />
<br />
2. To be able to write code to call customized session after successful posting of production order quantity. <br />
<br />
Request some guidance on confirming how I can fulfill my objective...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if this exactly fulfills your requirements, but one thing you can try if you don't have source code, is to have your custom report print after the standard report of storage list that you referred to.<br />
<br />
You can do this by copying the report to your current VRC and then modifying the &quot;after report&quot; section of the report script  to export the GRN number and then call your custom session.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Hello,<br />
yes, the user exit is the right place to do it.<br />
<br />
You have to choose the right hook and to use proper triggers like Production order must be in state released and documents must be printed a.s.o.<br />
<br />
The following things i do in tisfc001ue :<br />
<br />
|* User exit handels all additional functionality like:<br />
|* 1.) 	Generate and assign MAC adresses for equipment with Ethernet<br />
|* 2.) 	Check if businesspartner and item has own Serialnumbers. If true<br />
|*		assign ID-Number to customers Serialnumber<br />
|* 3.)	Check if enough customer serialnumbers exists<br />
|* 4.)	Check if customer has orderd iPLC functionality.<br />
|*		Generate and assign iPLC CRC-Code for ID-Number<br />
|* 5.)	Check, if tester data is need and generate testerrecord for<br />
|*		ID table dhexc100<br />
|* 6.)	Generate labelfiles for SENTINEL Printpack<br />
|* 7.)     Check LABELS printed<br />
|* 8.)     Print a assembly plan<br />
<br />
Code snip example :<br />
<br />
function print.id.assignment()<br />
{<br />
|BD20120210 A assignment sheet for customer ID's should be printed<br />
<br />
	curr.printer = spool.device<br />
	before.zoom:<br />
	export(&quot;curr.printer&quot;, curr.printer)<br />
	<br />
	get.var(pid, &quot;prog.name$&quot;, sessioncode)<br />
	<br />
	if sessioncode = &quot;tisfc0204m000&quot; then<br />
		start.session(0, &quot;dhltc0410m1bd&quot;, &quot;zoom.pdno&quot;, &quot;&quot;)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
But never use a retry point or commit in UE !!!!<br />
<br />
