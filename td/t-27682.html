<br />
I am getting a return of zero from seq.open.local.  Does this mean the file did not open?  I have read some conflicting information about which value to trap when an error occurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">25th July 2006, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Joy,<br />
If the return value is 0 then the file was not opened. There is some error. Somethings that you may want to check are - <br />
- Make sure you are providing the complete path + the filename of the file you are trying to open. <br />
- Make sure you have read/write access to the folder and file.<br />
<br />
Also note that seq.open.local() is used if you are trying to open a file on the Client system and not on the Baan server. If not then you need to use seq.open().<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">25th July 2006, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my code:<br />
<br />
	file.name = &quot;D:\BaanData\OrderData.txt&quot;<br />
	fp = seq.open.local(file.name, &quot;a&quot;, false)<br />
	if fp &gt;= 0 then<br />
		e = seq.write.local(&quot;TEST&quot;, len(&quot;TEST&quot;), fp)<br />
		seq.close.local(fp)<br />
	else<br />
		choice.again()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
When I execute above code, the value of fp is zero and I get an error when seq.write.local() is executed.<br />
<br />
When I change code from append mode to write mode as follows:<br />
                   fp = seq.open.local(file.name, &quot;w&quot;, false)<br />
The value of fp is greater than zero and the seq.write.local line is executed and a new file is written.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what else I can do to debug this process? :confused:</div></div><hr />

Reading the description you should not get a 0 returned, you should get an error code (negative number) or a file pointer, positive number.  Try declaring your own return value as a long and using that instead of 'e'..?</div></div><hr />

<br />
as &quot;w&quot; does work and &quot;a&quot; doesn't ... <br />
what happens if you first do &quot;w&quot;, seq.close and then &quot;a&quot;? <br />
In other words .... does the append mode need an existing file and exits with zero if the file does not exist? From my understanding it shouldn't, but it should be worth a try.<br />

<br />
I noticed that:<br />
<br />
When I used &quot;w&quot; fp &gt; 0 (1567)<br />
When I used &quot;a&quot; fp = 0 then when I tried to write I got &quot;Fatal error : object 0 in process...&quot; <br />
Even if I opened two different files using seq.open.local in append mode both returned 0. It should return a file pointer, and two different files must not have the same pointer! Return values <br />
&gt;=0 Success. File pointer is returned.<br />
This is weird (buggy)!<br />
<br />
A workaround will be to copy this file (D:\BaanData\OrderData.txt) to the server using client2server(), open it for append using the regular seq.open() and then copy it back to the client using server2client().<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

They reported that the parameter &quot;a&quot; does nothing.  The function has been deprecated and state the preferred method for modifying client files is to use the function client2server(), to copy the file to the server and then change it with the normal seq.*() functions.  Then use server2client() function to put the modified file back on the client.</div></div><hr />

WebTop Programming Rules<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The WebTop speaks a different &quot;language&quot; (protocol) with the 4GL Engine than BW does. The reason for this is that Web-based clients (like WebTop) use a different network topology than fat clients (like BW). The network connection between the BW client and the SSA Enterprise Server allows the 4GL Engine to initiate requests to the BW client in order to draw things on the screen (see picture). <br />
<br />
A Web-based network topology does not allow the server to initiate requests to the client (browser). The HTTP protocol does not allow this (see picture). <br />
<br />
Because of this restriction the WebTop uses a different protocol with the 4GL Engine. <br />
<br />
Since not all API's (especially low-level BW API's) are suitable to fit into this protocol, some API's will be deprecated. <br />
