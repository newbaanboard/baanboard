<br />
I switched of &quot;Export based on Sessions&quot; and &quot;Compared with VRC&quot;<br />
<br />
In the component TABS I opened always the whole Range until &quot;ZZZZ..ZZ&quot;<br />
<br />
After EXport I checked the &quot;dump.l&quot;. <br />
<br />
Here I found unfortunately a lot of entries, which doesn't belong to the selected &quot;Customization Projects&quot;. <br />
<br />
Is there any possiblity to chosse settings, that realy only components of the selected &quot;Customization Projects&quot; will be exported??<br />

Checking that box will only export the customization parts themselves.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, there is a library to allow you to do this -- with a little work.  We have written our own as have a number of other people including Gordon Fasbender.  Check out this link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1533&amp;highlight=customization+parts) for some more information.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

From what I observed in the BaaN-5 series its is advisable not to use the option of &quot;Export based on Sessions&quot; as it exports many components which we are not interested in.<br />
<br />
but, unfortunately, Baan doesn't nicely export all of the components associated with a customization part/project from this session. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ed, just wondering if this option doesnt work well, why didnt someone log a case with BaaN Support yet ? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">19th February 2003, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it works as Baan intended -- exporting the customization parts themselves.  I just don't think that is the way that users like us would like it to work (or think it would work based on the naming).  After all, who really wants to export the customization parts -- we want the components associated with them.<br />

Fun, fun, fun...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jph_tours</div><div class="date">25th February 2003, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">why don't you use the ttiex4500m000 session to create a new patch. (baan V)<br />
It is then possible to copy all components from a cutomization part to this patch (see specific menu of ttadv1176m000 : copy from project to patch code)<br />
<br />
You can maitain the list of components using session ttiex4110m000 and export.<br />
<br />
To import the patch use session ttiex1284m000 (import patch).<br />
<br />
This method exports only components of one cutomization part  and only those of the VRC given to the patch code.</div></div><hr />
