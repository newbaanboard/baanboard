<br />
is it possible to create a display session that displays records of particular table from more than one company at the same time.<br />
<br />
e.g. I have three companies (500,501,502). I want to display records of whinh312 (warehouse receipts) from all these three companies in a single display session.<br />

The initial page/load will often work but issues occur when scrolling since the form expects a link between form occurrences and a single main table.  The current pointer gets messed up when navigating records that are loaded from multiple tables (by company).<br />
<br />
If it is an important requirement for the users, you can pull it off using a customized table and session that first loads records from each company in range (before program) with a company field added and a timestamp/user field that links records to the current session.  Records are removed when the session exits or when the timestamp is over a day or two old from any user (abnormal exit).  The custom table would only contain fields that you want to display.  You can use the company number to zoom to the correct company for details if needed.</div></div><hr />

Is there a business requirement than &quot;user/customer asked it&quot;?<br />
<br />
It is easier to create a report.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can set the company number as a view-field in a multi-occ session and fire a rebuild.query() when the company-field-value changes [next/preview/first/last view]</div></div><hr />

Already done through report. But in some cases, user prefer certain info on screen instead of firing report. I just thought if it would be possible.<br />

Thanks<br />
