The Page and the Paper Width both are 80. The font is A4 (Large 10 CPI).<br />

The second Issue is that the french characters appear as underscore when printed from BaaN.<br />

Anybody with some insight?</div></div><hr />

I mean is the client doing a lp to print a report from disc? Plus is this windows printing or unix printing?  Last but not least has she tried from the GUI interface?  This could even be language related, but not sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
looks you mean textfields in report.<br />
<br />
1 st. textfield in layout is limited to 80 (76) characters ?<br />
2 nd. textwindow &lt;= 80 characters are used ?<br />
<br />
many reasons can cause this problem.<br />
<br />
