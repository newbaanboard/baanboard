<br />
For the last two days we are facing a performance problem in the SQL server. I have attached the output from the sysprocesses file for ur information.<br />
<br />
The problem is that we are getting a lot of PAGEIOLATCH_EX and PAGEIOLATCH_SH in the lastwait column and server is running terribly slow. Also it show that the cpu usae is 100% in the windows NT task manager, but in the sysprocesses output it is showing cpu usage 0. We r confused as to how to interpret the situation.<br />
<br />
Can anybody give some suggessitions on the problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
