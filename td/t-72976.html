<br />
Can you please share some details - <br />
<br />
1. Is this a standard program/custom program?<br />
2. Screenshot of the error screen?<br />
3. You TIV and LN Version?<br />
<br />
That will help people understand the problem better.<br />
<br />
May be you need to add keyword @trusted to your function using the function.<br />
<br />

get.resource$()<br />
Context<br />
This function is implemented in the porting set and can be used in all script types. <br />
<br />
This function is marked as 'untrusted' and can therefore only be used in trusted objects. More about trusted and not trusted objects can be found in the section about managed execution.. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Managed Execution<br />
Trusting object files<br />
In a traditional installation all sessions essentially run under the same authorization. This changes drastically in e.g. a multi-tenant environment, where the landlord has a very different authorization compared to the tenants. Tenants may under no circumstance be able to execute a session which might influence another tenant. <br />
<br />
Therefore a differentation is made between trusted and non-trusted object files. A trusted object file may still do everything, just like in a traditional installation. A non-trusted object, however, is limited in the functions it may execute. Some bshell functions are not allowed in non-trusted objects (such as 'shell'), nor are calls to functions in trusted objects allowed (unless these are explicitly allowed by adding the '@trusted' keyword). Typical examples of trusted objects are the applications as provided by Infor. Typical examples of non-trusted objects are objects compiled by the user, based upon user generated sources, such as reports.</div></div><hr />

But I assume you are at least on LN 10.5.<br />

You cannot use function get.resource$() in a cloud environment. The same applies to an on-prem environment in which you set the Extensions Ready for Cloud flag in session ttext0100m000 for your current package combination.</div></div><hr />

That will not help, because it would completely defeat the purpose of the trusted/untrusted concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vh3baan</div><div class="date">25th June 2020, 12:45</div></div><div class="posttext">This is probably due to the &quot;Extension Redy for Cloud&quot; parameter. If it is to be turned on then a higher poringset is needed.</div></div><hr />
