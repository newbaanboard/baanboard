To get the make components for a sub-component you only need one query.<br />
<br />
<br />
        select tibom010.mitm,tibom010.sitm,tiitm001.dsca<br />
        from tibom010, tiitm001<br />
        where tibom010.sitm = :tdpsc001.item<br />
        and tibom010.sitm refers to tiitm001.item<br />
        and tiitm001.kitm =2<br />
        and tibom010.exdt =0    <br />
        selectdo        <br />
        endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
This would return ALL make items for a purchase part. But because of the selectdo/endselect you would only get the last make item.  Are you sure you want to do this in the script?  I would expect some kind of spool commands in the select do to print results.<br />
<br />
I do not understand the other queries at all.  The second query sets subass to tibom010.mitm, but the query is on tiitm001.  In this case the subass will be set to the LAST make item from the first query.  Then you turn around and find the make item on the tibom010 again.  This would find all components of the make item, but it would only set it for the last sub-items.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are passing a purchase item to the report and want to print all of the assemblies that this item is used on?  If true then you could use the query above(with spool commands) to print all of the assemblies. Just not sure what you are trying to do.<br />

<br />
You have to change the WHERE clause in the last query, ie line 4 from the bottom, to:<br />
<br />
where tibom010.sitm=:subass<br />
<br />
and you should get the right answer.<br />
<br />
By the way, to speed up query you might want to use table indices. Particularly the index2 of table tibom010 because it contains tibom010.sitm<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">30th October 2002, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Paul, that worked. How can I print a summary. I have in the past just deleted the detail layout and added the after field, but that is not working this time. Any ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 03:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Itannous,<br />
<br />
You can print after.field kind of summary without putting any detail section if the number you want to summarise has been passed from program script to report engine. Say your prog script already send the purchase amount per PO line to report engine, then you can omit detail section and summarise purchase amount per PO just using after.field<br />
<br />
However, if you need to calculate something based on data thrown by program script and summarise this calculated data, you'd have to have detail section. For example, prog script send purchase amount per PO line in purchase currency only and you need the purchase amount in Thailand Baht. Then you'd need to convert it in detail section before summarising in after.field section. Of course you can use lattr.print=false after calculation in detail section, so the calc will still be performed but the detail section won't show up. This way, you can still have summary report of numbers that need additional calc<br />

Oh, I see you are trying to make a report that shows the demand forecast of sub assemblies and finished goods that needs a certain item as base component. I think it would be better then if you customise the report of the session tibom1413m000, Print where used BOM components (multi level). In this session, Baan will already find out for you what sub assemblies and finished goods that needs the item as component. You then would just have to find the demand forecast for every sub assembly and FG that Baan finds. Much easier, ay?<br />

Wow, now this is a tough case. I'm assuming you don't have dev license and are currently using SQL query then to find the item list and other data before throwing them to report engine. Am I right?<br />
<br />
If you wanna keep the SQL query, one alternative is to use arrays on your report script. That is, array of sub assembly, array of sub assy demand forecast, array of FG, and array of FG demand forecast. But this is gonna be quite a complicated programming.<br />
Would it be possible at all to move part of your query from your report script to your SQL query? For example, could you move the query for sub assy from report script to SQL query. That would eradicate the need for sub assy and sub assy demand forecast arrays.<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering, do you have a base component used in 2 different sub assy, and later these 2 are assembled into one FG. If you do, this indeed is going to complicate things even more because you have to prevent this FG from appearing twice<br />
<br />
One last thing, do you find the rough material requirements by critical item report unusable for your case? Just checking :)<br />
<br />
Surely having development license would help a lot since you can just push all the sub assy and FG query right to prog script. Anybody else has another method :) ?<br />

Looks like Itannous does have a development license or I don't think he would be able to write a report script (although I don't know this for fact).  I believe the best course of action would be to write another session to meet the needs of this report.  This is not a very hard thing to do.  The hard part is already done because the current report script could be used as the program script for the new session (as you suggest) and probably even simplified.  That would be my advice anyway, as I don't have source either and have come across similar problems trying to use a standard session to print a more complicated report than was originally written for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have created the session script to gather the initial data and also included the report script below.<br />
<br />
We did not want to set up these as critical items because we need to run this for various items and do not want it to effect our mrp/mps run. <br />
The sub assembly is used once in a f.g. item. But it can be used in many f.goods.<br />

Well, it's great then! All you have to do is<br />
<br />
- Move the double query on tibom010 from report script to selectdo of your prog script. This will make prog script look for all sub assy and FG you want before sending to report engine<br />
<br />
- Move the second query on tibom010 (finding FG) inside the first query on tibom010 (finding sub assy). This will make sure you find every combination of sub assy and FG used by the component<br />
<br />
- Move the rprt_send inside the second query to tibom010 (finding FG). Hence you will be sending every time new combination of sub assy and FG is found (this is what you want, right?)<br />
<br />
- As a result, every time a particular detail section, say detail.1, is printed, it will be on new component-sub assy-FG combo. You can then just leave demand forecast calc of the FG in the report script of that detail section.<br />
<br />
After all of this, you'll have something very similar to rough material requirements by critical item that Baan provides. Are you sure you don't want to use that instead? Pls let know how it work out. Thanks :)<br />

I've just started to look at your main select. You selected the sub assy already in there. I saw that you already include tibom010 in the main select. Then all you have to do is have one select inside the main select to find the FG, not double select. BTW, you made sure that all your BOMs are 2 levels only (base comp-&gt;sub assy-&gt;FG), right? Also, you made sure that only base component will be passed to the main select, right? I don't know the table structure of the customised PSC module, hence I don't know whether these checks have been performed<br />
<br />
Also pls remove the additional tiitm001 query on base component's inventory unit in selectdo of main select. You can perform this right in the main select since you already include tiitm001 of base component there.<br />
<br />
It's now getting a bit too complicated, don't you think? What do you think about giving OmeLuuk's suggestion a try,  ie get the source code of tibom1413m000 and start from there?<br />
