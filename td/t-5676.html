And, what you suggest to me to use? <br />
<br />
(I have more users which make new .xls files and transfer them with FTP to Baan server for using them as &quot;Drawing&quot; in EDM package) <br />
<br />
I want to give them possibility to say which local file they want to transfer (without my intervention - and without possibility to make a mistake using FTP) <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
;- )<br />
<br />
For transfer of files I use FTP-script which you can find on baanborard.com list:<br />
keyword -  &quot;automated&quot; ftp transfer'</div></div><hr />

<br />
Follow this link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1910) for a sample program that allows the user to select a file on the client.<br />
<br />
So you could do this two ways:<br />
<br />
(1) Just ask the user which file, user client2server to copy it up to the server.<br />
<br />
(2) Use the sample program, allow the user to select the file, and then use client2server.<br />
<br />
You should be able to find samples of the client2server by searching both this forum and the code and utilities forum.  If not I am sure someone can post the forum.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
