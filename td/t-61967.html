I want to get default value for some fields in new record without customizing any scripts/libraries and just changing the form. So, there is only option, is to use some value in initial value(Form Field). The problem is, that the value must be selected or/and calculated from other table/script/library. I know only few functions can be used in this field, such as: 'fmax(), utc() etc.<br />
May be someone know some way to use functions from includes/libriries/scripts in this field in order to get the necessary value.<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />

The link is to the version ~vamsi posted.  Next search the tools forum - this is just one thread that talks about form functionality (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=22873&amp;highlight=form).  There are a lot of other threads on using the form to different things - just not sure they will do what you are requesting.  Then again their might be something for LN I am not aware of.</div></div><hr />
