<br />
I'm facing the problems of the scanning and hope can get the helps or advice from you:<br />
<br />
1.) I did generated the barcode from LN system and printed out on barcode label. Felt weird of some barcode able to scan, some were not able to scan. <br />
<br />
1st_Barcode:= bc$(10,1,&quot;123456-ABC1234567890-ABCD*712A&quot;) |-- 30 chars<br />
<br />
2nd_Barcode:= bc$(10,1,&quot;11-03-2011-00001-PA-01-0188-88&quot;) |-- 30 chars<br />
<br />
3rd_Barcode= bc$(10,1,&quot;3D10-101152-13 (KMC-060602-02)&quot;) |-- 30 chars<br />
<br />
1st_Barcode: =&gt; Able to scan<br />
2nd_Barcode: =&gt; Cannot scan<br />
3rd_Barcode =&gt; Cannot scan<br />
(font spacing character width = 4.9)<br />
<br />
:confused:** Different set of character will affect the scanning???<br />
<br />
After this, I test and changed 1st_Barcode: to font spacing character with=5.0, [B]failed to scan! :eek:<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) The successfully to scan of 1st_Barcode: is only can read up to max 29 characters from 30 characters given to the barcode? I did testing on others character set with 30 charaters to barcode, all only can read till 29th  characters, the 30th (last char) unable to get!!! Why???<br />
<br />
:confused:** Does LN Sytem barcode of type Code-128 &amp; EAN-128 have the limitation of number of characters reading? Anyone encountered  this problem before?<br />
<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Grace</div></div><hr />

<br />
define a variable in your program script of your print session with 30 character length, fill the variable with your characters and set this variable as input field of your report. Insert the variable into your report layout as form field, set the font to Small (17.1 cpi) and the value of Barcode field to 11.<br />
<br />
I've tested, the scanner can read the barcode!<br />
<br />
