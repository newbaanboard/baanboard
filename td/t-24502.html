<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EisenBaaNer</div><div class="date">8th July 2005, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there<br />
<br />
I have to develop some sessions in Baan IV.<br />
I have to display some data sets and when the user click in one row the script have to identify on which displayfield the user has clicked.<br />
By this way I want to let the program decide which subsession have to opened by clicking in a dataset.<br />
<br />
Normaly i would use an input field. So i can use the event &quot;before.input&quot;. but in a display field will this event ignored. But the layout of an input field suggests the user, that she or he can manipulate data.<br />
<br />
Is there a workaround to solve this dilemma?<br />
<br />
Thanx a lot</div></div><hr />

That way you can use the before.input like you stated.  The only option I think you have to have on the form is &quot;modify&quot; - you do not have to allow them to save/update the data.  I think your users will soon learn that by clicking in a field activates a sub-session and does not allow them to make any changes in the form.  I use this in one session to make them generate a new project number.  The minute they click insert the project field is hit, it auto zooms to a sub-session, they enter data on the sub-session, click continue, returns to the calling program and I fill in the new project number.  This way they never get to free form type in a new project number.</div></div><hr />
