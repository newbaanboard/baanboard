<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gous99</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, here is my problem,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to use this dll (ottstpapihand) to create Purchase Orders/Lines.<br />
<br />
Everything go smooth except for one thing. There is a few field that do not get updated. They stay blank or 0 or keep the default.<br />
<br />
If I create a new Purchase Order manually, I can change those fields and the session lets me, so how come I can't replicate the same with calls to this dll, and only for those fields?<br />
<br />
Here are the fields:<br />
<br />
tdpur040.cdec     Keeps the default value<br />
tdpur040.cpay     Stays blank<br />
tdpur040.cfrw     Stays blank<br />
tdpur040.ccty     Keeps the default value<br />
tdpur040.ccur     Keeps the default value<br />
tdpur040.ccor     Stays blank<br />
tdpur040.ccon     Stays at 0<br />
<br />
Here is my call to feed these fields. Also, when inserting, they're is no error message. All the values are valid values.<br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4101m000&quot;, &quot;tdpur040.ccur&quot;, hold.ccur)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4101m000&quot;, &quot;tdpur040.cfrw&quot;, hold.cfrw)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4101m000&quot;, &quot;tdpur040.cpay&quot;, hold.cpay)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4101m000&quot;, &quot;tdpur040.cdec&quot;, hold.cdec)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4101m000&quot;, &quot;tdpur040.ccty&quot;, hold.ccty)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4101m000&quot;, &quot;tdpur040.ccon&quot;, str$(hold.buyr))<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4101m000&quot;, &quot;tdpur040.ccor&quot;, hold.ccor)</div></div><hr />

Posting all the assigments in order may help.  One thing you need to do is keep the assignments in the same order you would enter them in the Baan session.  Some field entry will retrieve and set the defaults for following fields, and if you call them after your value is set, your value will be over written.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gfasbender</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that field event processing embedded in sessions, such as after.update, can affect put() calls. For example, if you put() the fields you've described before the supplier field, and the supplier field has an after.update section that initializes those fields, then your updates are overridden. <br />
<br />
You may have to add a second update process for specific fields to your api script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Gordon is correct - I have had to put some fields twice to get them updated. Also in one case I had to actually go update the table using a select for update session.  Never did figure that one out, but the select for update solved my problem.<br />

Yap, Gordon and Mark, you're both right. What I have to do for it to work for those specific fields is, insert the other fields, save the record, then put these fields, and update the record. This way, it does work.<br />
<br />
But as Mark said, even with this, the Buyer field does not keep the value, so I have to do a direct update in the table, which is not good. This way it does not get saved in the PO history table, of course I can insert it there as well, but how many tables would I have to update like this!!!!<br />
<br />
Anyway, I opened a case at Baan Support, they transfered it to the Netherlands, if they give me a solution, I will come back and share it.</div></div><hr />
