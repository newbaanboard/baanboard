<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbdave</div><div class="date">12th July 2013, 11:55</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use baan profiler which will give you the functions taking time during a process</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th July 2013, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Or use some of the trace options to see which query might be causing the slowness.  Of course &quot;too slow&quot; needs to be defined - is it too slow all the time or some of the time?</div></div><hr />

1. you have the source code<br />

This is what I had to do to make a difference in performance: Comment out the following code referencing tiitm100 table<br />

     and     timrp021.cmba refers to tiitm001 path tiitm100.item |#B4.0_b.n</div></div><hr />

We facing slow only some time.<br />

Hi Shah,<br />
We are using session tdinv3260m000<br />
<br />
This assumes:<br />
1. you have the source code<br />
2. you do not have to use the Containerized Items functionality<br />
3. you are referring to the session timrp1260m000<br />
<br />
This is what I had to do to make a difference in performance: Comment out the following code referencing tiitm100 table</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th July 2013, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I would try to get baseline values and snap shots of everything go on with the system when performance is good. Then I would get baseline values for when it is bad - on the system.  I do not know what all options you have of capturing that information.  You can also just try traces on the session when slow and not slow.  The problem is just doing the session might not show what is causing the slowness if it is system related.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">17th July 2013, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">tdinv3260m000: The same change was made in this session - comment out the reference via tiitm100.<br />
<br />
I forgot to add that, of course, you have to replace the commented code with appropriate link back to the tiitm001 table. <br />
<br />
In case of tdinv3260m000, it would be:<br />
<br />
tiitm310.item refers to tiitm001<br />
<br />
<br />
The same primary assumption apply: that you have no need to use the Containerized Items functionality.</div></div><hr />
