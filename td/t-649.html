You have to find in the documentation of your printer the escape sequence that's specifies the font you want to use. Then you have to update in $BSE/lib/printinf the printer driver for your printer.<br />
<br />
If you experience problems please let us know.<br />

Our OS is UNIX. Can I have the printinf file you have defined.<br />
Pl. send it to makamarun@hotmail.com or to this thread here<br />

Thanks for the reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">20th December 2001, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">To help new people to understand this thread, maybe this is usefull:<br />
<br />
The printer drivers used by Baan are plain text files with the printing codes (=escape codes) defined on them.<br />
These files are located under:<br />
$BSE/lib/printinf/&lt;first_letter_of_printer_brand&gt;/&lt;printer_driver&gt;<br />
<br />
So, for example, your HP printer driver for and HP Laserjet 4 is  located in<br />
$BSE/lib/printinf/h/hp_lj4  (normal mode)<br />
$BSE/lib/printinf/h/hp_lj4_lndsc  (landscape mode)<br />
<br />
Now, notice that the escape sequences that control font size, font type, form feed, etc., are printer dependent. If your printer mentions compatability with PCLx or other, then you probably can use an existing driver that already supports that, otherwise you will need to manually add those codes to your driver.<br />
Suggestion: look for an existing compatible driver, copy it and work on it untill your printing is what you need. If nothing seems to work, you may have to get in touch with some companies that develop printer drivers (last resort, costs $$$).</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your information. I would like to know where exactly do I have to specify that when in my reports if I am selecting User Defined Font1 it should print bigger. i.e where do I map these User Defined Font1 = twice bigger as normal, <br />
User Defined Font2 = thrice bigger as normal<br />
<br />
Does BaaN has any session to map these information?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you define your report fields you can define which font to use for that field.  So for example when you define user font 1 as double the size, then you can go to the report, select the field you want, and then select user defined font 1. <br />
<br />
This is after you can your driver file that is in the printinf directory.  I might be able to dig out an example when I return to work.  Just let me know if you need one.<br />

Yes it will be helpful for me if you were able to dig out one for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MakamArun</div><div class="date">28th December 2001, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark <br />
I will try this out and come back to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkorst</div><div class="date">28th December 2001, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">One other option that you can try and use is changing the font with BWPrint.<br />
<br />
If you run the report, sending the output to a printer (preview won't work to display), the print preview check box should be available to you on the Device selection screen.   If you check the box, the report will come up in preview mode.<br />
<br />
Put your cursor over the field that is defined with the user font, and RIGHT click.  You should get a menu that has fonts, then change font whatever user font number is assigned to that field.   You can then assign any font on the PC (client).<br />
<br />
This will assign that font to the user font for that PC only.  Anytime a report is run from that PC with a field that uses that user font number, the assigned font will be used.   Draw back is you have to do this on all PC's that will run that report.   This also works for assigning barcode fonts, micro code fonts, and logos (if the logo is loaded as a font).<br />
<br />
Just a thought.............<br />

<br />
Changing pfont1 in printinf file as well as changing fonts in preview of bwprint my desired result was achieved.<br />
<br />
I found changing pfont1in preview of bwprint is more felxible than changing in printinf file. The funda is define your report fields as User Defined font1 and in bwprint preview right click on the same data field and go to fonts menu and do the necessary changes and save. So what ever form fields defined as User Defined Font1 is changed to the new set fonts !!! (it is necessary that one has to right click on the same field where the report field is User Defined Font1) .<br />
These changes made are stored in the registry of the local PC so the next time you print the same report will, have the changes on. <br />
<br />
Thanks all for helping me out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd June 2009, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">In this thread it is this easy.<br />
<br />
(1) See post above by Victor Cleto and post by me for example<br />
(2) Edit the print driver<br />
(3) Pick which user defined font you are going to use(in my example pfont1 was used)<br />
(4) Put the correct escape sequence or print code into the print driver.<br />
(5) Save the print driver<br />
(6) Go to the report, select the defined user font.<br />
(7) Compile report<br />
<br />
Report now has the new font you defined.  Of course I do not know about bwprint - I know this works with our UNIX printing.  I also can not help on the escape sequence you will need to look that up for your printer.  I would also make sure the printer has the appropriate font and can support Arial.<br />
<br />
So if using bwprint go to the other thread and try the steps.  I do not use bwprint so I can not help there.  But if you try that then explain what steps you have tried and where you ran into issues.  The more information you give on the problem the better someone can assist.</div></div><hr />
