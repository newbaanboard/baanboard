<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I changed Index 1 on one of my custom tables.  All is well.  I now have trouble with a session that was created with the original index.  <br />
<br />
When I run the session alone - I can find any record I want, and the data is sorted on the new key.  When I zoom to the session from another, and use query.extension to select the correct customer number (from other session input), it fails.<br />
<br />
Any hints?  I know I don't have a lot of info here.  I can't imagine that I would have to regenerate the session - would I?<br />

What happens when you zoom to this session (in debug mode) from the other session?  I am curious if the other session has everything set correctly for the new index.  Running it in debug might provide a little more info for the more knowledgable experts than me.<br />

<br />
Have you checked your selects (refered to that table) in the second session you mentioned?<br />
<br />
Maybe you have to compile again session script.<br />
<br />
Let us Know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">9th March 2002, 02:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I was getting a reference error on the item group table, tcmcs023.  On three fields of my key--citg, ctyp and comp, I have the table referenced to the appropriate master tables.<br />
<br />
Like I said, when I enter the session without the customer number input - it was fine.  I'm using the reference tables to display the correct descriptions on my form for item group, product type and company (at least in this session).<br />
<br />
So...I removed the descriptions from the form...then FINE!<br />
<br />
I would think I had a table problem, but it displays fine without the input.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help...I tend to get dangerously creative sometimes.  Yes, it's custom.  I really just needed to know if changing index1 should affect sessions - and I think the answer is no.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I figured it out - I had actually moved my table def from my PROD system to my TEST system, so I created RDD on my 'td' table in TEST.<br />
<br />
I needed to run a create RDD on all the linked tables (tcmcs023, tcmcs015, tccom010, tccom000) in TEST.<br />
<br />
Can someone verify that this is correct?  <br />
<br />
1) Change table def  - run convert RDD wide open and it will pick up all the linked table changes.<br />
<br />
2) Import table def - run create RDD on new table AND all linked tables.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience everyone!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me that I used to be able to just run Create Runtime Data Dictionary on the imported table and it would take care of the references in the linked table(s) as well.  However, as of late, my experience is similar to yours -- you must use CRDD for all of the referenced tables as well.  I could be wrong, but I never remember it being such a big hassle before.</div></div><hr />

Just noticed this while I was checking Ed's post. Changing index1 can cause sessions to go &quot;kablooey&quot; (my own technical term), but not always.  We ran into this when Baan sent us a patch and index1 changed on one of the tables.  One of our custimizations started returning the wrong records.<br />
<br />
I also never run create RDD wide open, just my preference. I never want to convert something someone else may be working on.<br />
<br />
Glad you found your fix!<br />
