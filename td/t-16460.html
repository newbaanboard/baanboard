Are the forms multi-occurance?  I guess I just can not picture a form that could not hold 4 fields.  I think more info is needed so others can reply.<br />

The Item field is 32 char long.  With the description at full length, the generator can't fit a darn thing else on there.<br />
<br />
It think what happend here is the fields just rolled over to the second form on generate.  To get just 1 form you have a bit of form maintenance to do,  there are a couple ways to do that.  <br />
<br />
On form 1 you can:<br />
<br />
1.  Resize the form (&lt;ESC&gt;-S, drag out to the right some, &lt;ESC&gt;-S again).  Then you can fit your field on the first form by inserting the field.  You can only resize so far out, and keep in mind people with lower screen resolutions don't appreciate really long forms.<br />
<br />
2.  If you find there are large description or quantity fields on Form 1 that you can safely reduce the display size of, you can do that to fit your extra field on it, and not have to resize the form.   To change the display of the field you do not need to change the domain it's stored as.  You can do this on Maintain Form Fields (double click on the fields in Maintain Forms).  You will see a  &quot;Link/Max Disp.Len&quot; field.  Uncheck the Link (to unlink the display from the domain default) and put in the length you want.  For numeric/quantity fields use Link/Dis.Form and put in the new format with a smaller length.<br />
<br />
If you need help on specifics of doing that let us know.  Once your field is on form 1 you can remove form 2 from the session.</div></div><hr />
