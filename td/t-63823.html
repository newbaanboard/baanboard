<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanjim</div><div class="date">15th March 2013, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
We have a strange problem when we try to create an main/sub report structure.<br />
We copied the standard report session tisfc0408m000 to create a specific session with only 2 reports linked and less data on it (1 header on the first, and 1 detail on the second).<br />
The idea is to have 1 product order (main) and x operations (sub).<br />
The problem is that the generation of the XML files gives only 1 xml (and so, no main_xml file) if we delete some standard inputfields on the first report! Note that these inputfield are not on our layouts because we don't need them...<br />
I tried to let them and the result is ok! (we have the main xml and the sub).<br />
Do you have an Idea? what is the link between the presence of some input fields and the generation of the good structure XML based on a main and a sub file???<br />
Thank you for your help :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">18th March 2013, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no link between input fields and the creation of main and sub file. The main file will be created if there are multiple production orders in the range for which a document must be printed or there is only one production order, but with multiple documents. So if you print only one document for one production order, the main file is not created. You have to build your sub report in such a way that is can also be rendered stand alone.</div></div><hr />

Thank you.<br />
With a larger selection it works!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanjim</div><div class="date">19th March 2013, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">There's another problem:<br />
In the same exemple:<br />
We want to print a report based on project data (tppdm600) as main part of MS-report. and other data from specific tables linked to the project.<br />
We designed a editing session with 3 reports like this:<br />
Report 1 =&gt; based on tppdm600 data<br />
Report 2 =&gt; based on specific table 1 linked to tppdm600<br />
Report 3 =&gt; based on specific table 2 linked to tppdm600<br />
When we print in D66 or printer it's ok: We have each project linked to his specific datas.<br />
But when we export in XML format, the report 2 data for the 1rst record is missing!  and so in the XML (main.xml file) the structure is like this:<br />
Data 1<br />
Data 3   (Data 2 is missing 1st time!)<br />
Data 1<br />
Data 2   (Ok)<br />
Data 3<br />
...<br />
and so on...<br />
<br />
We checked our script it seems to be ok (like tisfc0408 one).<br />
The input fields in our reports too.<br />
Note that, the second XML file generated is 100% ok.<br />
Thank you for your help again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">19th March 2013, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you also attach the second XML file, so the one without &quot;_main&quot;? If there is confidential data in it, I don't mind if you remove those elements.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">19th March 2013, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to verify... If your (pseudo)code is:<br />
<br />
spool.open<br />
for all selected projects<br />
   brp.open(report1)<br />
   ... send data<br />
   brp.close<br />
   brp.open(report2)<br />
   ... send data<br />
   brp.close<br />
   brp.open(report3)<br />
   ... send data<br />
   brp.close<br />
endfor<br />
spool.close<br />
<br />
it should work. If not... I would recommend to log an incident in InforXtreme.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanjim</div><div class="date">21st March 2013, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer our last request we have found a work around for the problem of XML_main that was not<br />
well design by adding inputs fields on the first report. Now it is ok.<br />
We have now a new problem :<br />
I have designed a main report with sub reports (similary to session tisfc0408m000) but at execution only<br />
the first report is displayed the others subreports are not shown). I join the Ms report project ans the XML files<br />
to see if there is a design problem. No error message is displayed at design nether at execution.<br />
<br />
Other question : is there an option or a possibilty with the SSRS device in baan to force the writing of the output<br />
 in an .xls file without openning Excel automatically. with the -EXCEL option<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help</div></div><hr />

            &lt;/TablixRowHierarchy&gt;<br />
<br />
I assume the last visibility condition is on a level too high. So, the whole report part is only rendered for the first report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st March 2013, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">For the 2nd question: Yes. You can create a device and specify in the argument  &quot;-server &lt;your SSRS server&gt; -format Excel -path &quot;&lt;a filename with possible holders to make it unique&gt;&quot;. See the Infor Enterprise Server Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services Administration Guide (U9656E), downloadable from InforXtreme.</div></div><hr />

We have another problem when trying to create an xls file automaticaly (without screen display).<br />

We tryied to print tisfc0408m000 reports (standard). And we have the same problems. It seems not work in standard to...</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
We printed standard report tdsls1401m000 (Quotation printing) and for this kind of reports (simple report) it works (We specified a -path with a XLS file).<br />
The same try with standard report tisfc0408m000 (Production order) doesn't work and gives the same message (cf. attached file in my previous message and the attached file in this message).<br />
Do you think SSRS/Infor doesn't work if report is a main/sub report? Does Infor communicates about this problem?<br />
Thank you, <br />
:cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
We also have the similar issue, our output is sent directly to SSRS Excel without any issues, but when I select SSRS_EXCEL device in JOB Management for a job that executes weekly once and the report output needs to be placed in a folder, now when I select my SSRS_EXCEL device it says &quot;Device not allowed because this device does not support direct printing&quot;. So can someone help in getting some clues on how to add this device to job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">24th November 2015, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">What did you specify in the Argument field of the device?</div></div><hr />
