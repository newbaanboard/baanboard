I am conecting to BaaN through VB with <br />
  Set BaanObj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application.test1&quot;)<br />
<br />
This uses the default bwc properties. ( test1.bwc in this case ) <br />
<br />
How can I set the properies like host name , password, portnumber , BSE etc at the runtime of VB application. ?<br />
<br />
What are the properties and methods of Baan4.application Class. ?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
But you can create a bwc file without saving the password and use the following vb code in order to execute BW:<br />
<br />
Sub Main()<br />
Dim BWpath As String, BWCpath As String<br />
Dim FullPath As String, pass As String<br />
<br />
pass = &quot;baan&quot; ' your password<br />
BWpath = &quot;C:\Program Files\Baan\bin\bw.exe &quot; '  the path of you bw<br />
BWCpath = &quot;C:\Program Files\Baan\lib\user\nt.bwc&quot; 'the path of wour bwc file<br />
<br />
FullPath = BWpath + Chr(34) + BWCpath + Chr(34)<br />
retval = Shell(FullPath, vbNormalFocus) ' executing bw.exe<br />
<br />
SendKeys pass + vbCrLf, 1 ' sending the password!<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope it helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you can do is set up multiple BWC for each configuration. It is a headache, but that's about the only way to go with Baan4.Application class.<br />
<br />
Actually I have the same question with you regarding the properties and methods of Baan4.Application class. I wonder if anybody in this board knows which document explains that in detail. It'd be very kind also if someone has this document and post it as sticky post in the OLE forum of this board (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=59). Thanks, guys<br />

You may be able to read and write records into the file like the BSE, etc.  The problem is the password and the encryption. Personally I always like the idea of having the user enter the password at run time and then just leaving the connection open until they leave the app.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 05:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, just found out that with very lovely IDE like what VB has, you can just type in the object name of the Baan4.Application class and all its properties and methods will be revealed. I haven't been coding around very much, but I must say that MS did a very good job with VB IDE. You can even repair your script while you are in the midst of debugging your script. Any other IDE as good as VB's (I might be starting a long argument here)?<br />
