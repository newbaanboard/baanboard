1) you are crossposting<br />
<br />
2) someone already did the googling for you<br />
<br />
3) the link mentioned does contain the complete data to create a formula for converting seconds to a date<br />
<br />
Because the Koran (Sura 10:5) establishes the use of lunar months for Muslims - that is, a calendar based on the phases of the moon - the Islamic year does not correspond with the Gregorian calendar, which is based on a solar year; as an astronomical lunar month contains 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 3 seconds, a year composed of 12 such lunar months contains 354 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes and 36 seconds - which is approximately 11 days shorter than the solar year.<br />
<br />
<br />
The months of the Muslim year, by convention, have 29 and 30 days alternately. This means that the Hijra - or, more exactly, the Hizri-year contains exactly 354 days. The 8 hours, 48 minutes and 36 seconds difference (11/30 of a day) between this figure and the astronomical lunar year adds up to 11 days in every cycle of 30 years. These 11 days are inserted into the calendar by establishing leap years. Every period of 30 years, therefore, has 11 leap years of 355 days instead of 354. These are normally the 2nd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 26th, and 29th years of the 30-year cycle. The &quot;leap day&quot; which is added to these years is always assigned to the end of the month of Dhu al-Hijja, the month of the Hajj - the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca - and last month of the year. In just the same way, the Gregorian calendar adds an extra day to February every four years.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4) I strongly doubt that the localisations lack an inbuilt function for data conversion <br />

       I have fianlly managed to get some function to do the date conversion using some googling and then a little play around for converting from JSP to Baan. Please refer the attached file for it.<br />
       I have tested it from my side. But I would stilll suggest you to test the output for the functions before using.<br />
