I would recommend starting with one of Baan's BOM programs. Use this to see how bills are exploded, modify to loop through a series of input parts.  The inventory piece could be done in the script, but I would put it in the report.  That way you could total all the sub-components for the input items, then check how much is on hand and what your shortages are.  Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
How about you write an initial technical design and someone could review it for you. Usually requests for help in writing something from A-Z would go unanswered. Show us your effort and we could fix any problems. This may not be true if the problem is so unique that it sparks interest in someone.<br />
<br />
Mark, this was the first report I developed three years ago in the U.S. I do not have the code for it though :(.</div></div><hr />
