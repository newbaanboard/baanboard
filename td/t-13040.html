<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bvallepalli</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">My requirement is to generate a PDF document from a Baan report and Insert the company logo into the pdf document and auto e-Mail this report to supplier/Requestor. <br />
<br />
This process should run without any human intervention in addition to printing the report as per user choice. I could achieve the following results.<br />
<br />
1. Convert Baan generated report to Postscript file.<br />
2. Convert the post script file to PDF.<br />
3. Auto e-Mail the document.<br />
<br />
(Thanks to Baanboard)<br />
<br />
The only problem I am facing is the Ghost script some how doesn't like the company logo image. <br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to achieve this? If required I can get the report as HTML file and convert this to PDF. I found that all the shareware programs which convert HTML to PDF skip the images.<br />
<br />
I am on Baan 5.c and Windows 2000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 23:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done a similar thing using the following method:-<br />
<br />
1. Print Baan report to file<br />
2. Use windows scripting host (vb script) to automate the generation of a PDF using PDFlib (from www.pdflib.com).<br />
3. Copy the pdf to the client pc using bw client<br />
4. Generate a vb script that will send the email using &quot;outlook redemption&quot; (search google)<br />
5. Copy vb script to client pc using bw client<br />
6. Start vb script on client (using bw client), the vb script creates an outlook mail message and attaches the PDF and emails it.<br />
<br />
Quite fiddley to setup but very flexible.  It can also be made platform neutral since most of the grunt work is done on the server and PDFlib is available on many platforms.<br />

1.) Copy the report to client PC<br />
2.) Use visual basic or word macro to add the logo from file (bmp or jpeg...), and make some text reordening.<br />
3.) Use some tool to conver document to pdf<br />
4.) send via email, we have Lotus Notes so i had to do ssome more VB programing to avtomate job.</div></div><hr />
