<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">8th March 2005, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">My client has used the &quot;refers to&quot; functionality throughout their customized code where more often than not, a reference between the two tables does not acutally exist in the data dictionary.  The code seems to be working (should it?), and aren't we sacrificing quite a bit of performance using this code style?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">10th March 2005, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure exactly how 'refers to' is compiled. It's one of those things I try to stay away from simply because the resulting driver code is unpredictable (to me anyway).<br />
It can be used to join two tables that have no defined relationship, and from what I've seen it resorts to a 'best guess' approach in such cases. <br />
So no, it shouldn't work but yes, it does most of the time. It's almost intelligent compiling. &quot;No, this isn't what the Idiot Programmer from Hell told me to do, but it's what he _meant_!&quot;<br />
&quot;OK HAL, now just open the frickin' door!&quot;<br />
<br />
There is a good chance that performance is degrading from this. You will have to collect some facts and figures on that first though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_mike</div><div class="date">11th March 2005, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually use this if the select statement is a little ambiguous or if there is a danger of picking up a non-unique record in the select, or maybe the 2 tables you are reading have the same field but not reference each other eg. tiitm001.cuno and tiitm900.cuno customised table and you want to match the records. In my experience it doesnt slow down the program code when in operation.<br />

Oracle will probably have no problem converting it to an efficient request, but something like TBase may bog without a Baan table reference in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">14th March 2005, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree with Lisa that it probably depends on the database and driver used.  My client is using Informix .  It would be interesting to find out if others have made the same observation with using Informix.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your all our feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">15th March 2005, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Using a REFERS TO should only be done when a relation exists between the 2 mentioned tables. It doesn't matter what database you are using: the Baan database driver is the one that makes the final database query and no database SQL has the REFERS TO statement, so the driver needs to translate this.<br />
<br />
If there is a relationship between the tables (from table A to the primary index of table B) the performance is never a problem (regarding this relationship) but when there is no direct relationship, the Baan database driver tries to find a way via alternative tables to the other table. So the following code:<br />
<br />
A refers to B<br />
can result in:<br />
<br />
    A refers to C<br />
and C refers to D<br />
and D refers to E<br />
and E refers to B<br />
The use of REFERS TO has my preference when:<br />
-	the join is an outer join<br />
-	index 1 of table B has multiple fields<br />
<br />
So in very short: the REFERS TO can be used safely when table A has a direct relation to index 1 of table B. In all other ways it should not be used.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
