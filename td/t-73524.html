Authorization Workflows giving me some hard here, need little help.<br />
There are two scenarios.<br />
1. We have an authorization workflow on JV, using a custom session i am creating a journal voucher using DAL which is created successfully. Is there any function to Submit it to Workflow also??<br />
<br />
2. We are creating Adjustment Orders using a custom program DAL2, when there was no workflow order was created successfully. As soon as we activated the Authorization workflow, i started getting error 221 in DAL2 of the program and no adjustment order is getting created now.<br />
