<br />
starting a maintain session I found suddently some strange values in some fields. Took me a while to find out, that they seems to come from ttadv990. So I tried ttstpdeldflt do delete this records. It looks as they realy disappeared. But after a newly start of the mentioned session, the records a here again, the fields are still filled with strange values.<br />
<br />
Is there something what writes this table out of somewhere stored values?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd June 2006, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know you have to do a save defaults on a session before the ttadv990 table is populated.  Of course I do not think I even allow save defaults on a maintain session.  Do you have the source code to check to see what the session is doing?  Have you tried just turning off the save and get defaults options?</div></div><hr />

Is this a standard or a customized session..? If the latter, maybe you post us your code..</div></div><hr />
