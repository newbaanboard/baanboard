We did something with WebTop using Filter Servlet that will intercept the http request and add some information to it before it was received by the web server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sant123</div><div class="date">7th September 2004, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, Shaboo thanks for your reply, we have written some jsp pages and we would like to use the zoom session from webtop from our jsp pages, for example invoke item master display zoom from part number on our jsp pages.<br />
<br />
Is it possible at all.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">7th September 2004, 01:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is possible as for sure we tested such functionality for Baan 5.0c. The only problem that I see here is that BaanIV has a session type 'sub-session' and not sure if we can do that as I haven't worked with that.<br />
<br />
WebTop has an option called 'Silent Login', in which you can build a http request with the login information and further you can also add startup session with the start up key. So for example, with this you can start Maintian Item session and that session will start with the specific item that you would have passed to it in your request. I hope this option works in BaanIV as it works in Baan5.0c for sure.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to find the documentation or example of that, but send me a pm with your email and I will try to send you an example as soon as I find one.</div></div><hr />
