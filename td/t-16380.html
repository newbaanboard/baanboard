<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">26th August 2004, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a new table with three fields:<br />
<br />
code (tcmcslong)<br />
dsca (tcdsca)<br />
txtn (tctxtn)<br />
<br />
I then went to the 'Generate Sessions' session (ttadv2290m000) and created a session.  When I try to add text to my first record, I get the following error in the BW Messages screen:<br />
<br />
Fatal error : Illegal value for size argument(0) for sym ''<br />
Fatal error : Can not continue in tcobg0602m000 in DLL: ottstpstandard()<br />
<br />
Anybody have any idea why this is happening?  I was unable to find a related link.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th August 2004, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering - did it add the text field to the session?  You should see a texts button on form 1 of the session.  This runs ttadv2113s000 and shows the texts available for the session.  I am not sure if the generate session does that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">26th August 2004, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">There were check boxes to show if text existed.  I changed them to a tgyeno domain (I still got my error before I did that) so the user would see 'Yes' or 'No' on the session.<br />
<br />
Is there a log I could check?  I looked in the log.bshell and didn't see anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th August 2004, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">The only other thing I can think of is there a default text group for the field?  The session I generated worked first try.  Never had a problem with it.  Not sure what else to look at.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">26th August 2004, 23:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Where do you set the default text group for the field?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">27th August 2004, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I have completely removed the session, form, session script, table and table definition.  Recreated everything and then made sure that the text sessions you mentioned were populated.  I still get that same error.<br />
<br />
I'm stumped...<br />
<br />
But thanks for you suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th August 2004, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">My first thought is that you may need a new tools patch - maybe a update ottstpstandard.  But then I would expect you to have problems with other text fields.  I just did a quick test on one of my new tables for finance - I generated the session and it worked just fine, even without the default text group.  Not sure where the disconnect is - you can try putting it in debug mode and seeing what happens in the text manager event.  Just not sure what to check.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">27th August 2004, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently working with Baan Support regarding the problem.  They believe that based on previous cases, this error can result from more or less one of three things:<br />
<br />
1)  The standard program (ottstpstandard referred to in the error message) is out of date with respect to some other component of Baan.<br />
2)  There is a problem with a European language set up that uses multibyte text<br />
3)  There is something wrong with a domain being used by the tables involved.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll keep this post updated with our results.  Mark - Thanks for all of your suggestions and your time involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">1st September 2004, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently our ottstpstandard object is dated September 2002.  Baan Support is suggesting we update it to the newest version.</div></div><hr />
