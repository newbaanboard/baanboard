We have many item numbers which have been transacted and require to have part of the number cut off 0001-000-A000001 should be A000001 Any suggestions other than creating new items and transfering inventory.</div></div><hr />

We opted to just create new parts and do transfers.  One of the reasons we did this was so that all of our printed paper work would match what really took place.  Actually I would advocate creating new parts and transferring the inventory, but that is just my opinion.<br />

<br />
As Mark said I'm almost sure there is not an utility to do this task. Probably or you'll have to build your own or do everything manually.<br />
<br />
You told about just create new items and transfer the stock, ok, it's easy, but do you need to keep the links between these new items and orders, invoices, etc. made with the previous items codes or it's not relevant ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isimeon</div><div class="date">8th October 2002, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I developed a similar script to change the supplier codes. It is not an easy work. You must consider many references, total by item, total by item and periods, purchase and sales statistics, etc. Sequence of the changes in tables is very important. <br />
<br />
Another way is to export data in delimited files, manipulate them with external program and import them back to system.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />
