   1. Iam Customizing my sales order acknowledgement report by report designer in LN10.6. I want to add one horizontal line after each detail. For example if have three lines in my sales order after each line it has to print one horizontal line. When i add the horizonatal line in report designer  it's coming twice in report. <br />
  2. I added footer to be printed in bottom of every page. But in last page it's not printing in bottom. Instead it's printing in middle where there is no more data there to print. But i want it to print at bottom.<br />
 Can anyone tell what condition i have to add to solve above two problems.Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

Not sure about the footer - I never really used them much and never really worried where they printed.</div></div><hr />
