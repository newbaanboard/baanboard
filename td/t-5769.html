<br />
Our OS is NT and Mail server is Microsoft Exchange.  We want to automatically broadcast some baan reports thru email to specific users. The baan report will be send every morning (or as scheduled) without manual intervention.<br />
<br />
Can we able to do this without buying a third party product?<br />
<br />
Thanks.:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
you should be able to achieve this with a vbs-script (then started with AT).<br />
What I would do (as I loathe NT and VB(S)) is the following:<br />
create an AT job on NT to automatically ftp <br />
(ftp -s:FILEWITHFTPCOMMANDS) <br />
the report in question to a unix/linux box and mail it from here *grin*.<br />
Another hint: Use ttstpconv with option HTML to create the mail-body, otherwise it will look awful (thanks again to the friendly people here who gave this advice to me)<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

How can I be able to use blat? I have printed documents regarding this blat but honestly I can't still make it run.  Do you have detail instruction to use it? <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Tip <br />
if you don't have any unix machines in your network and you are on NT4 server then you may not be running any internal DNS services or the network settings on your baan server may not be setup to resolve using DNS  if this is the case then add an entry in your file c:\winnt\drivers\etc\hosts <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carice</div><div class="date">22nd July 2002, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you work with Outlook?<br />
<br />
I have post some code in 'code and utilities' to mail whatever you with baan. You can even put drafts in special folders (folder reminders, ...) or send directly , ... . It's not so much code and it works very nice. It's a good base to start with a flexible way for mailing purposes.<br />
First try to implement this with a simple session (from, to, subject field) and continue button. If this works you can mail from baan. Afterwards i will give you a clue how to let it work with any reports (even without an inputsession, if you can access the necessary data).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">therese</div><div class="date">25th July 2002, 03:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi carice,<br />
<br />
Yes, I am working with outlook.<br />
<br />
I have read your script on Code and Utilities.  I am working with this automatic email for a week and I am hoping you can help me work this stuff. <br />
<br />
I have some questions/clarifications below.<br />
<br />
1.  The first thing I will do is to create a session (Is it maintain?) and a new table with the fields you have mentioned on your post.  Then create a button &lt;send email&gt;.To make this button work, I have to use your baan script.  Am I right?<br />
<br />
2.   Do I need to install a VB for the VB program on your post?  OR I'll just do it in a text file then put it in the system directory(?).  In what specific windows directory I will put the text file?<br />
<br />
3.  I want baan report to be send as attachement.  How can I be able to do this using your script?<br />
<br />
4. In the TO field, is it possible to have multiple recipient?  What will be the input format.  I mean what separator can be used if we will send the email to multiple recipient.  (e.g. email address1,email adrress2)<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carice</div><div class="date">25th July 2002, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">1. First of all , you have to create a new maintain session, that's right. You don't have to create a new table (you can if you want store all the data in a table but that's not necessary because if you send there will be a copy in your outlook send box); try to make it work first with an easy program. <br />
In the maintain session you put some formfields in it. You can use (but you can program more, these where the fields that i needed) : <br />
<br />
extern domain tcmcs.s256	frmFrom<br />
extern domain tcmcs.s256	frmTo<br />
extern domain tcmcs.s256	frmSubject<br />
extern domain tcmcs.s256	frmBody<br />
extern domain tcmcs.s256	frmCat<br />
extern domain tcmcs.s256	frmBCC<br />
extern domain tcmcs.s256	frmCC<br />
extern domain tcmcs.s256	frmAtt<br />
extern domain tcmcs.s256	frmAction<br />
<br />
but here again , first make it easy; start with frmTo and frmSubject and frmAction; so you can see if it works. <br />
This frmAction must be filled with  <br />
<br />
&quot;move&quot; (will move a non send mail to a new folder, named Outbox Baan under folder outbox, from there on you can verify the mail and send it)<br />
or &quot;copy&quot; (set mail in Outbox folder)<br />
or &quot;save&quot; (will keep the mail as a draft in the draft folder)<br />
or &quot;send&quot; (will send the mail directly)<br />
This frmAction doesn't need to be a formfield, you can fill it in your script.<br />
<br />
Yes, there will be a button &lt;send_email&gt; and when you pushed it, it will do this function. This is the baanscript mentionned in the thread.<br />
So you just have to create a maintain, a few formfields, and a button.<br />
<br />
2. After the baanscript, there are TWO more scripts left.<br />
The second is a vbs-script, the last is  the script of the VB-DLL. This vbs-script is just like a textfile, you don't have to compiled it, ... . You just copy the code to a text-file and name this textfile 'outlook.vbs'. This vbs-script must be accesible from your pc by baan; therefor i just copied it in the system directory, so that this script is always accesible(this PATH is always know). (I know that this can be better, but i don't have the time to do it; i thought that it would be better to put this vbs-script on the server and when the baan-session runs, it will copy the script local, use it and delete it local again ; because now you have to copy this vbs-script to every pc that will use the session and when you work like mention above, you don't have to do this; also a good solution is that you set the vbs-script on the server and in the baanscript you just give the whole path). <br />
But first of all keep it simple and copy it to your system directory, to let it work.<br />
The third thing is the VB-DLL. Therefor you need VB, if you want to modify the script. I will send you the DLL, so you don't have to install VB as long as you don't won't to modify the script.<br />
<br />
3. If everything works (with fields to ,subject and action), you can use more formfields like frmBody, frmCC, frmAtt.<br />
To mail attachments, create a new formfield and name it frmAtt, you can put the filename (with path)in it and this file will be send with your mail. There is a way to send mails directly with this program (so without a maintain session but just by creating a new device). But first (here i come again) let it work first with a maintain session.<br />
<br />
4. Yes it's possible, you can just put in the emailadresses like you do now in outlook; here the seperator is ';'.  You can just put in the names like you do if you normal send a email (here we use the loginnames and not the whole emailadresses).<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help you.<br />
<br />
Let me know if it works<br />

- i think that i have copy the dll in the baan directory (lib or bin; look where the dll's are in).<br />

- can you install VB on your pc? It will be very simple if you create a dll in vb yourself; you have the code. If it  's installed on your pc , you have all the necessary dll's and ocx's needed.<br />

I would imagine that you could modify it to be called after you push the report through ghostscript to be sent to mulitple users.  I haven't gone that far with it yet, but you may be able to.<br />

I had this problem with BLAT as well.<br />
The issue is that your mail server (EXCHANGE in our case) was configured to not allow relaying \ forwarding of email to external receipents.<br />
<br />
There are two solutions:<br />
a) Change configuration settings in Exchange<br />
<br />
b) Set up an Exchange distribution list with internal and external people in the list, and then just email to the distribution list.<br />
<br />
The distribution list is nice, because it means that you do not have to edit a text file to change who receives the e-mail.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />

There are many ways. One solution is to use some email shareware. I use  a email sharewar that send an HTML body as an email. This works really cool. You have to see it to believe it. One of the email we send it shipment notification to our customers when goods are shipped. And I use this program to send email. It has hyperlinked to the carrier websites which is used for shipping. In fact I have developed a whole  alert system based on this shareware. <br />
<br />
I would defiently recommed this, insteas of an Baan postrscript etc. You can generate a an HTML tagged report from Baan and just use such programs to send it.<br />

I am trying to find out a way on how to send an email to multiple recipients <br />
<br />
Like what is indicated here<br />
4. In the TO field, is it possible to have multiple recipient? What will be the input format. I mean what separator can be used if we will send the email to multiple recipient. (e.g. email address1,email adrress2)<br />
<br />
I've used <br />
<br />
  email1@email.com ;  email2@email.com  and it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Can you please point me to the right direction?</div></div><hr />
