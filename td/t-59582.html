Hello Becks22,<br />
<br />
We have developed a similar application for mobile device, We have done a normal openworld integration.<br />
<br />
Simply create a DLL/BOI DLL and integrate it using openworldserver either generating java/c# proxies using BOI compiler and setup an wireless acess point for the mobile device to communicate with your BaaN server.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NirajKakodkar</div><div class="date">25th November 2010, 06:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We too have integrated the mobile application with Baan4 as well as other version of BaaN, but for integration you need to integrate it using Openworld connector, there are other ways to integrate as well like you can connect to the db at backend, can use OLE or can use other third party connectors, there is one opensource connector too which I had used sometime ago can't recollect the name, but the best you can use is Openworld connector supported and provided by Infor.<br />
<br />
Regarding documentation, you can find the documentation about openworld in the media itself, or you can check on Infor website.<br />
