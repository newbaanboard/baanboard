<br />
There is an item in this report for a particular company which does not print the description. The description comes out blank. I can see it on the screen. The description is 30 characters of length and is well within its length. If I paste this description to any other item it will print but any description for this item in question will not print. It is not a printer issue.<br />
Any ideas what might be the problem?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

you can see it when you select the device as screen on the<br />
same report or you see the description for the same item anywhere else?(in the Item master?).If this is the case,I would look at the print condition for the field and layout and in the<br />
script.<br />
Look under report layout fields and under &quot;print condition&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you see the description on the same report when you print it<br />
to screen and not on paper,it is puzzling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please check the sales order line for this. Please check whether you have set that Standard Description=No there. Standard description=no will prevent the item description from being printed. Please make sure standard description=yes so that the item description will be printed on all documents for this sales order line.<br />

<br />
Thank you for the responses. I have still not found the reason for the missing description. When you say 'signal code' blocking what do you mean? I am not sure how it needs to be set up in Baan for the item, can you elaborate. Being new to Baan I am still understading it. Print condition is 1 so that is fine.  The item description will print for any other item but not for this item in question. I can see it on the screen in the report but when you print, it is blank. Item master has the item description. <br />
Any more thoughts what might be the problem? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Paul P was referring to field tdsls041.sdsc (Form 2 of Maintain Sales Order Lines), Std. Description = No.  You didn't mention whether you had checked this and made sure it is Yes.<br />
<br />
Signal codes can be attached to items in maintain item data and used to make a message appear when you enter an item and also block an item from issue and/or requisition.  I don't think this can be the cause of your prolem as it would have prevented the item from being entered in the sales order in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">2nd November 2002, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Try these 2 quick tests.<br />
1.since you say that you are able to see the item description<br />
  in the item master,Print the standard report in Baan for<br />
 that Item.i.e.,Print item data and select that item.<br />
 check if the description shows up and&quot;MAKE SURE IT IS THE<br />
SAME AS YOU ARE ABLE TO SEE ON THE SCREEN&quot; in the report you have a problem with now.<br />
 If it is,then try putting tiitm001.dsca in thereport input fields<br />
 and in the detial layout in the report.It will tell you if it already exists.<br />
2.Try inserting tdsls041.dsca in the report input fields and put the<br />
 same in the detail layout.Another point would be to check if there<br />
 is any script attached to the layout.<br />
 if there is a report script present,make sure table tdsls041 is<br />
 declared.<br />
One final thought,report script in some cases will truncate some portion of the layout based on the number of lines allowed or <br />
particular conditions.If you are able to see on screen the same<br />
description for the same part number(item) and not on paper,this <br />
is the most likely fact.<br />
If you could run a SQL query for the table tdsls041,tiitm001with just a few fields including tiitm001.dsca and tdsls041.dsca<br />
your doubts will be cleared to a Good extent.<br />
Good luck<br />
few fields and</div></div><hr />
