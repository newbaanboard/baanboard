(2001). I was wondering if there was any update, such as a pdf driver, so that we can generate a pdf file directly from Baan.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 03:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the feedback. It was very much appreciated. I liked the thumbnail jpg<br />
<br />
I am however wanting a solution that does not require a purchase of distiller for every client machine. That makes the solution too expensive.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to route the printout to a single intelligent machine (a pseudo device) and let that device (a windows machine) create the distiller output, and then have the pseudo device redirect the output to the target client's email inbox?<br />

It's not free, but very cheap and it works perfectly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reminder. I have it installed on my pc (I am licensed), but I require a pdf tool that us unix based. I need to generate the pdf on unix and then ship the pdf file out to users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We are looking for such a solution also. Please tell me if you found one. <br />
Our actual idea is to print a Postscript file and pipe it to a script (this part actualy works without programming, just with a new baan printer device). From this script you can send your output to ghostscript. I.e. to a linux environment and send it back from there by mail to your user. I will keep you online until we have completed the system (I hope within the next two weeks).<br />

It seams like it could help you.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi PinHigh,<br />
<br />
thank you for for the hint.<br />
Yes, I know the thread. But we want to stay on unix/the server without any client communication except the resulting pdf-file. And without programming in baan if possible (a simple printer device is more flexible). Actually we are using ghostscript for printing pdf from windows. So after the harmlessly question from a user &quot;can I print pdf from baan?&quot; and the imprudently answer &quot;yes, use the windows printer and print it to the pdf-device&quot; very quick the idea started to do this directly on the server. We have many locations and the backends are between 64kb up to 512kb... . Normaly we do all printing on the server (with barcode modules in the printers) because bwprint is no opportunity to us. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The thread pointed by PinHigh does provide for creating a PDF on the server. And the only traffic will be the PDF being transferred to the client. I believe Francesco has implemented it successfully.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse this does involve being able to successfully install Ghostscript for your version of Unix (which can be hairy apparently from other people's posts) and compiling *one* Baan script.<br />
<br />
Too complex? Our good friends at Nazdaq can step in and provide you with a fairly inexpensive shrink wrapped solution. Lots of people claim that the prices are too low to quote on the web. Check 'em out at http://www.nazdaq.co.il</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">transforce</div><div class="date">2nd February 2005, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Our Version One software runs on unix servers too. You can create your own lay-outs, use logo's, fonts, create barcodes etc.etc.  Output could be print, mail, fax, xml,sms etc. Electronic archiving is an option. See www.versionone.nl for more info ( dutch and english, no german :o )<br />
