I have little problem, I want to copy layouts of a report from one language to other. Is there any way to copy the layouts instead I design for other languages. I dont want to use the option &quot;Link layout to other language&quot;. Actually problem is the reports has layouts only in language 2, and layouts for other languages are linked to that layout. Now if I add some labels in layout for language 2, these texts are pritned in reports of other languages but in language 2. I want to define the text in different languages accordingly.  <br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

Hello Mahmood,<br />
in Maintain Reports &quot;Zoom&quot; Copy to Other Language (ttadv6201s000)<br />
you can copy the Report Layout fron source language to target language.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have already tried this, it gives message that the report is already exists in (target) language. Should I remove the existing repot in the target language and copy it again?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
In &quot;maintain reports&quot; go to &quot;layouts&quot;<br />
zoom to &quot;special&quot; -menu<br />
choose &quot;Copy from other layout&quot; ttadv3535s000<br />
choose language and report you want to copy layouts from<br />
select layouts you want to copy<br />
choose continue process<br />
<br />
And voila, the layouts from another language (and/or other report) are copied to your current report.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this helps ?<br />
