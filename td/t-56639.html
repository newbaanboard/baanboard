<br />
<br />
i would like to ask about the development process of LN, specifically on the deployment of the cust session.<br />
<br />
the process of deployment from the manual is as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Export components from a software environment to sequential files - Export<br />
Data Dictionary (ttiex1280m000)<br />
2. Only if the source and the target environments are located on different<br />
systems: transfer the sequential files to the target system<br />
3. Import components from the sequential files into the target environment -<br />
Import Data Dictionary (ttiex1285m000)<br />
4. Create the run-time data dictionary for labels- Compile Labels<br />
(ttadv1243m000)<br />
5. Create the run-time data dictionary of the components in the target package<br />
combination- Create Runtime Data Dictionary (ttadv5210m000)<br />
6. Compile the program scripts and library scripts of the copied components<br />
- Compile Program Scripts / Libraries (ttadv2230m000)<br />
7. Compile the reports of the copied components - Compile Reports<br />
(ttadv3240m000)<br />
8. Create the run-time data dictionary of the forms and menus - Create Runtime<br />
Data Dictionary (Forms and Menus) (ttadv5214m000)<br />
9. Install Infor Web Help for the components in the target environment<br />
<br />
now the problem i have is, after i import the DD to the client system, the LN generates so many cust session and thus create many cust libraries and table definition, eventhough i already follows all the procedure.<br />
<br />
i even have to use my dev license to &quot;clean&quot; all the unused cust lib and t.deff because it's causing many problem when the client tried to install a solution.<br />
<br />
Do anyone experienced the same problem?and if there's some link about this procedure i'll be glad to read it.<br />
<br />
BTW, this forum should have sticky features.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">1st September 2009, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Before transfering the dump, check what's in it (look into the dump.l file). If there's anything in it you don't want to copy to the other system, your ranges are wrong in ttiex1280m000. Also make sure that in that session, you have &quot;only components of package itself&quot; switched on and &quot;compare to package VRC&quot; on that VRC where you derived you customization layer from, otherwise it might export also the software objects of the lower levels in the pVRC structure.<br />
<br />
Another way of doing such a transfer is creating a &quot;Patch&quot; (don't have the session number right now), where you can explicitely list the software objects you want to export, or even use PMC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">1st September 2009, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly advise you to use PMC. With that you don't have to recompile again. It has the advantage that you can rollback your change in case something goes terrible wrong. Furthermore its assures that you install your updates in the right order (so that you don't overwrite a newer update by an older one).<br />

<br />
thanks for the suggestion, i've once using patch for deploying report, but when i tried to crebate a component for session, there's no result in the zoom when i search the session, do i need to do some step to make it available?<br />
<br />
and for the PMC, can you please give me some simple example to deploy some session? i already found a manual to deployment with the PMC, but it's only on the webhelp, and the step is very vague.<br />
<br />
meanwhile i'll try to search again in the manual.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Hans and the PMC is faster, better and gives you can option to roll-back.<br />
<br />
Here are the basic steps for deployment:<br />
<br />
Create, Generate Dependencies, Export, Release in the Source Development System - ttpmc1100m000<br />
<br />
Transfer the PMC solution from Development to QA/Production Environment.<br />
<br />
Scan it in QA/Prod with - ttpmc2200s000.<br />
<br />
Check and Install Solutions - ttpmc2101m000.<br />
<br />
Create the run-time data dictionary for labels - Compile Labels (ttadv1243m000)<br />
<br />
Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary full range for the tables/domains in the PMC solution - Create Runtime Data Dictionary (ttadv5215m000).<br />
<br />
Create Runtime Data Dictionary (Forms and Menus) (ttadv5214m000).<br />
<br />
Install Infor Web Help for the components in the target environment - This should be done if you have custom help. The standard help can be installed during the Webtop setup.<br />
<br />
BTW, this forum should have sticky features.<br />
Refer to the PMC setup, Distributor and Recepient Guides for detailed information.</div></div><hr />
