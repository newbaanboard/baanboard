<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rj1234</div><div class="date">18th November 2004, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a maintain session which uses Form 3 Multioccurance in which there is one multioccuring field which is not a database field e.g if I am maintaining records of tdsls040 and i want a string field against it giving reason for blocking the sales order which is not a part of the tdsls040 but after user saves it I have to insert it into one of my customised table i.e Order No and the field value stored against it.The field is an array which uses the predefined variable actual.occ to store the contents of the string entered by the user.The session works fine if user follows the tab sequence for maintaining records.The problem comes when the user clicks randomly anywhere on the form other than in the field.The text field gets overwritten by what is latest typed by the user<br />
e.g <br />
Record 1 has text as &quot;Blocked&quot;<br />
Record 2 has text as &quot;Not yet Blocked&quot;<br />
So now ur actual.occ has become 2<br />
If the cursor is moved anywhere else on the form and brought back to Record 1 i.e not on any field but by just selecting that record it will show as &quot;Not yet Blocked&quot; instead of the value entered by user i.e &quot;Blocked&quot;.this happens because the value of actual.occ variable remains as 2 when actually u have clicked on record 1.<br />
<br />
Is it that we cant use any field in multioccurance if it is not a database field ???<br />

The one question I have is why the form field is an array.  I have used qkey to add fields like this to mutli-occurance forms, but I did not use the field as an array.  What I did was use a field like somefield.cmnt as the multi-occurance field.  Then in one of the before.display fields on the detail line I would go look up the value of the field on another table.<br />
