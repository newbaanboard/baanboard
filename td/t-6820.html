Internally Baan ERP (Baan V) stores all the dates as UTC dates.<br />
Is it the same with Baan IV? or in Baan IV all the dates will be stored as local dates?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">23rd September 2002, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">It converts the date into the number of days, from the beginning, i.e., 01-01-01.</div></div><hr />

So, you mean to say that baanIV uses 'Local Date Format' to store the dates and not UTC format.</div></div><hr />

<br />
morpheus, means that in BaaN-IV, the dates are converted into numbers are stored.<br />
<br />
Most of them use the tools function - http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_date_time_zones_date_num[/WIK] <br />
<br />
Can you please elaborate ?<br />
<br />

Do you mean the time zone set by the user data template?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that the long value will be stored for a date in Baan.<br />
<br />
BaanV internally stores all the dates as UTC dates i.e. number of seconds (long value) since 01-01-1970 T 00:00 ,  <br />
<br />
but what my doubt is, <br />
is it the same in Baan IV too? i.e. even in Baan IV the dates are treated as UTC dates internally or they are stored as local dates (again number !!!) which is number of days since 01-01-0001 <br />
<br />
Hope this time it is clear.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan IV only supports the &quot;date&quot; type (i.e. number of days since 01/01/0001).<br />
Baan V supports both &quot;date&quot; and &quot;utc&quot; types. Here again the &quot;date&quot; type represents the number of days since 01/01/0001. The &quot;utc&quot; type represents the number of seconds since 01/01/1970.<br />
<br />
Your assumption that since Baan V all dates are stored as &quot;utc&quot; internally is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">**SAT**</div><div class="date">24th September 2002, 09:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi FransG, Thanks for the reply..<br />
<br />
But what I read from the BaanV help is that, In BaanV internally the dates are stored as UTC dates.<br />
please see BaanERP help below :<br />
<br />
<br />
Universal Coordinated Time<br />
<br />
BaanERP provides time-zone independent date and time support. The user interface always shows local dates and times. Internally, however, BaanERP stores dates and times in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). It stores both date and time in a single long integer referred to as the UTC long format. This integer represents the number of seconds since 0:00 hour, January 1, 1970 (in UTC). The use of a long integer imposes an upper date limit of 2038.<br />

As Frans, has mentioned -<br />
<br />
Your assumption that since Baan V all dates are stored as &quot;utc&quot; internally is wrong.<br />
<br />
If you refer to the tables like, ttadv505, ttams330-342 (role authorization related templates), the date storage is still based on the number or days. But most the application tables date/time formats have been modified to UTC formats but not the tools tables.<br />
<br />
So I think you need to be clear and explicit about what you are looking for or your requirement is.<br />
<br />
Hoi Frans Gerritsen, nice to hear from you... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garfield ruhr</div><div class="date">24th September 2002, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi *ALL,<br />
<br />
in BaanIV you have the type date and the type time. The type date is still the same in BaanV but the type time is changed to UTC. Time only store the time and not the time combined with a date. UTC in BaanV stored a date/time combination.<br />
<br />
The other issue is the way the time is stored in BaanIV. So is the time stored with the local value in the database or with the UTC or GMT time. Like my experience is till now this is differently handled in the sessions. The jobhandling was changed some time ago from local time to UTC time handling. If you look for the time values in the ttaad5xx tables then you see the time is stored for the timezone 0 (GMT) and all the display is for local time.<br />
<br />
So please keep the 2 different issue in mind. The way of storing data and the transformation of the time.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps and it was hard to understand,<br />

Then how come the BaanERP help is giving wrong information about the dates? Read the below quote<br />

Since, I am no more in the BaaN R &amp; D, I cannot give you the right answer. But my general remark is - that quote is meant for the application tables. There will be a lot of issues for changes to the tools internal tables, upgradations between tools shuttles/service packs/versions, affects the job timings, role authorizations, log changes etc. So it will take sometime, versions to have all utc enabled.<br />
<br />
So, the end user should not be worried of what format the tools tables are using as long as they are working. The tools are BaaN propritory. If the application tables are using the UTC then you have the advantage to have the time zone independent format, which will be useful for the order management, shipping, delivery, planning dates/time etc.</div></div><hr />
