<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mick_m</div><div class="date">6th February 2006, 23:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for suggestions on how to have Baan monitor how long a user has been inactive and after a specified amount of time will display a password form. This will then require the user to enter their password to regain access to their application. This is the same as the lock computer capability in XP but we do not want to use the XP solution as not all users are using it. I have searched the many different timeout threads but couldn't find one that will help me. Thanks.<br />

Open session &quot;Maintain User Data&quot;, go to form 4. You will see some password options which you can use to set idle time for lock-out and password for re-opening, jus tlike in Windows.<br />
You cannot use screensavers though! :) <br />
See attachment, as the forms may be different in different service packs.<br />
