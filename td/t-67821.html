Can you post your code that you use to call it with?  Maybe we will see something wrong with that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th January 2016, 02:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not think baan has ever resolved the issue of multiple reports using AFS.  In 4c4 the best I can do is if I want to reports I usually end up running to different sessions. For example like generate outbound - I will use generate outbound and print only the shortages and then run print outbound to print the outbound I just generated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">12th January 2016, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I chose to run reports started in AFS sessions over standard software (with their own report handling and put.var spool.report etc...) from within a DLL called by the AFS session. Since the DLL runs as a different object I think there is no problem sending to different reports. But there is still something buggy when printing to different output devices...</div></div><hr />
