<br />
While using ctrl+shift+W  (global.copy) option in form-3 multi occurence form, to a different group, records are always skipped...Is there a way to trace this command.<br />
<br />
If we give on.choice, the standard functionality of this choice command will not be done. <br />
<br />
I want to know why the records are skipped.<br />
<br />
The copying data does not violate Primary key values of underlying Main table of the session. <br />
<br />
Could someone reply ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />

<br />
You can try tracing the session and see if the database produced any duplicate errors.    This (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7456&amp;highlight=Session+Trace) thread has a good tracing document attached.<br />
<br />
Good luck, let us know what you find.  If it's a standard session - post up so we can take a look.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was a requirement in the Customized session.<br />
<br />
Well, infact after posting the query, I did some research and found out that one of the check.input validation for a field on the form, was checking for database validity. This was the reason, the records were skipped.<br />
<br />
Actually, even though there are other unique keys on the table, due to check.input validation, records were skipped.<br />
<br />
The lesson is:<br />
<br />
Even when we do global copy, when the records are copied to a new group, all the check.input sections are validated for all the fields...(obviously this is a standard BaaN tools functionality..right?)<br />
<br />
Thanks again  <br />
