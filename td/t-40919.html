<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraDiehl</div><div class="date">23rd August 2007, 23:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anybody know rather if you are able to use the zoom.to function in a library?  I know how to use in a session but not sure if able to do in a library and if are able to do in a library how would you set the 3rd parameter?<br />
<br />
Normal logic if calling from a session is <br />
zoom.to$(&quot;zzbom0110s000&quot;, z.session, &quot;zzbom1110m000&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
<br />
First parm is the session to zoom to and the 3rd is the calling session, my case the 3rd would be the library which is zzribole0201.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Please no suggestions about AFS, we don't have that setup and can't get it due to BaaN doesn't support anymore and we don't have all the needed components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th August 2007, 00:17</div></div><div class="posttext">What version of Baan are you on?  As far as I know AFS is supported on all versions of Baan, but on LN it is better to use the DAL functionality.  And yes it should work - I think I have a library that I can call from Excel that launches a session.  Will have to look for it - I think it uses zoom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th August 2007, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep -uses zoom.<br />
<br />
function extern call.session(const string sessname())<br />
{<br />
	zoom.to$(sessname,Z.SESSION, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
}<br />
<br />
If you get errors you can always come back and ask questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roeland</div><div class="date">21st May 2008, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried this function and the session opens, but I get these errors:<br />
1 : Fatal error : object 0 in process 9 not found<br />
2 : Fatal error : object 0 in process 9 not found<br />
<br />
process 9 is the session I'm opening.<br />
(I tried it with tiitm0101m000)<br />
<br />
Any idea what these errors mean?</div></div><hr />

Can you post your code?<br />

<br />
Can you post your code?<br />
<br />
- George<br />
<br />
Yes. I'm using the same code as mark_h:<br />
<br />
function extern call.session(const string sessname())<br />
{<br />
	zoom.to$(sessname,Z.SESSION, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
}<br />
<br />
Than I call this from an external program and I get the error.<br />
The error happens after the zoom and before opening tiitm0101m000<br />
<br />
Those fatal errors aren't really fatal. Everything keeps working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">21st May 2008, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm.... I have some more questions<br />
<br />
1) Again I have to ask: &quot;Are you sure tiitm0101m000 was process 9&quot;?<br />
2) Can you try the same code from a new script? Just create a new 3GL script for testing with only main() function and inside it write the zoom.to$ command. Do this script also generate the (none) fatal error?<br />
<br />

1) Yes. I tried it again to be sure.<br />
2) It works fine from a 3GL script <br />
<br />
If i start the API when baan is already active I get this problem, but I don't get this problem when baan is not already active.<br />
<br />
I don't understand the difference...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no clue! However, the other thing I would try is to create a new library that contains only this one function and compile it to a new name, then try to start the API again.</div></div><hr />

I have two guesses:<br />
1) That you have an old SP, or an old porting set.<br />
2) Old BW (client) version.<br />

We never installed a SP AND have an old porting set :)</div></div><hr />

Btw: What kind of keyword is const? Didn't see/recognize it before.<br />

Refer to the tools function -  parse_and_exec_function() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_dll_parse_and_exec_function)<br />
Btw: What kind of keyword is const? Didn't see/recognize it before.<br />
Constant arguments (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_3gl_features_function_arguments)</div></div><hr />
