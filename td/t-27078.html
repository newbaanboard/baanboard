You might be able to use disable.field (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=8485&amp;highlight=disable.field) in baan V.  In IV I either take the field off the form(usually something like sequence) or change indexes.</div></div><hr />

Would love to hear differently.. However, maybe Shriram you tell us why you want to do this, is it just to ease input, or does it have a deeper reason..? Maybe we can help you find a different way to accomplish your requirements...</div></div><hr />

Firstly arrange your index of the table. I think it will work .<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shriram</div><div class="date">11th May 2006, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the real issue I have. We have item segmentation implemented. However we are not using the Project segment (first segment). We are using the item segment and a third segment. We could not get rid of the project segmentation since it was recommended to keep it to avoid problems in other baan modules. On the forms that have item field, we have disabled and made the first segment invisible. However on the find commands, we have the first segment being displayed for input which is why we want that segment either to be disabled or made invisible. <br />

What shah_bs posted should work - it will not make it invisible, but in baan 4 in does skip allowing input on the find.  So in the code I think it should go into the field.item.segment.1 (guessing at baan 5 structure).  When you hit find it should automatically go to the next field for input.  Also what happens if you just delete the field from the form?</div></div><hr />

On the session I tested it the field is on the form as input.  Then when I did the find it actually hit the attr.input statement and would not allow me to input it.  I am wondering if the form needs to go back to normal in order for the code to work.  Then you can just set the before field like:<br />
<br />
field.tcibd001.item.segment.1: <br />
before.field:<br />
     attr.input = false<br />
<br />
To prevent any use of the field.</div></div><hr />

The find function works against fields of a main table. So, if the field you are working on is just a program variable, there is nothing you can do programmatically to control the display of the &lt;Find&gt; popup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shriram</div><div class="date">13th May 2006, 00:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually it is table field, but for a segmented field. <br />
tcibd001.item is a segmented field with 3 segments, and tcibd001.item.segment.1 is the first segment. <br />
<br />
I also tried with tcibd001.seak since i wanted to test if this problem only exists with segmented fields. But it doesn't seem to work even for tcibd001.seak. <br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
use before.input like this<br />
<br />
field.tcibd001.item.segment.1:<br />
before.input:<br />
if choice = def.find then<br />
    attr.input = false<br />
else<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shriram</div><div class="date">15th May 2006, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, guys finally this works. Not the cleanest possible way, but it at least does its job.<br />
<br />
field.tcibd001.item.segment.1:<br />
before.field:<br />
	if choice = def.find then <br />
		disable.fields(&quot;tcibd001.item.segment.1&quot;)<br />
		attr.imax = 0<br />
		attr.echo = false<br />
		attr.input = false<br />
		attr.maxlen = 0<br />
		attr.minlen = 0<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
attr.maxlen and attr.imax should be set to 0. Rest of the stuff is just redundant, but would rather keep it. <br />
<br />
However this is how the find screen looks like now.It does allow any input, not does it allow the cursor to be placed there, however do not like the small box to be displayed.  <br />
<br />
Any clues on how to get rid of the small box being displayed. <br />
<br />

Also we cannot use inputfield.invisible in field sections since causes recursive function calls. I already have that function in the before.display.object and before.program section. It hides the field on the form similar to attr.echo = false. However on the FIND Std. form, it does not seem to function. <br />

Also I need only the segment.1 field to be disabled or invisible , so cannot isolate only that segment from the form using form design and hence the programmatic approach. <br />
<br />
I may not aware of some way of only maintaining the second and third segment on the form using form designer. Let me know. <br />
