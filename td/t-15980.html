Have any of you seen this problem before?<br />
Have you found a solution? or a possible cause?<br />
I am really  :confused: <br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">feluchin</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem was that when transfering the files from unix to windows (or windows to unix) the Enter characters were modified (and ^M were added).<br />
Then, when compiling, there werenÂ´t any error in the list... but the object was not created and did not replace the old one.</div></div><hr />

The script compiled and ran, but you could not follow it in debug mode - the &quot;&gt;&quot; prompt when be on one line and you could see it executing another.  Plus there were places where you could step through the code, but could not see anything but &quot;&gt;&quot; prompt.  I had placed a call with Baan to solve this, but by sheer luck I was on PC that I had to use vi to see the script. That was when I saw the ^M's, you will not notice this if you are using the scite editor.<br />

<br />
when transferring from unix to windows/nt/dos, use command ux2dos first,<br />
or vice versa dos2ux.<br />
<br />
that should solve the problem i guess.<br />
