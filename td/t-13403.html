<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">24th October 2003, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello<br />
<br />
Trying to create a display session for the table tdsls032 (sales price lists).<br />
<br />
The request was made to have the expired data not appear in the session.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sales Price List  : ABC  ABC PRICE LIST<br />
Item              : 123456            A PART DESCRIPTION <br />
                                                                   <br />
Quantity   Eff.Date    End Date         Price  Discount  Gross/Net <br />
                                                                   <br />
      49 10-23-2003                      1.00      0.00  Gross     <br />
      50 10-01-2003  10-22-2003          2.00      0.00  Gross     <br />
     249 10-01-2003  10-22-2003          3.00      0.00  Gross     <br />
99999999 10-01-2003  10-22-2003          4.00      0.00  Gross     <br />
99999999 10-23-2003                      5.00      0.00  Gross      <br />
<br />
In this example (sorry - poor alignment) - I would want to have the 2nd, 3rd and 4th lines not appear - because they have an expiry date of less then or equal to today.  If one of the dates was say, 11-01-2003 and today was only 10-24-2003, that line would still show because the item hasn't expired yet.<br />
<br />
Basically to restate the question simply - how do I deactivate an actual.occ line on a display form?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">24th October 2003, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like you need something like skip.io() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_db_operations_skip_io) <br />
<br />
main.table.io:<br />
after.read:<br />
	if &lt;your condition&gt; then<br />
		skip.io()<br />
	endif<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">24th October 2003, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan IV you can use the query.extension std variable to filter, like:<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
query.extension = &quot;tdsls032.exdt = 0&quot;<br />
<br />
but I'm not sure there is the same for Triton 3.x....<br />
In this case you can use:<br />
<br />
main.table.io:<br />
after.read:<br />
           if tdsls032.exdt then<br />
                  skip.io()<br />
           endif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">24th October 2003, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">You may put a simple query.extension in the before.program or<br />
before the the display of the form to filter out the not required data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">24th October 2003, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all, I used:<br />
before.program:                      <br />
query.extension = &quot;tdsls032.tdat = 0&quot;Works beautifully!  Thanks for all your help!<br />
<br />
One more question though - I want to have the expiry date appear, but only if the date is further out then today.<br />
<br />
Meaning if there is no date, show the line.  If there is a date, and it's say 11/01/03, and today is only 10/24/03, I still want that line to appear.  (I'd like to be able to see upcoming expiry dates.)<br />
<br />
I triedbefore.program:                      <br />
today = date.num()                   <br />
query.extension = &quot;((tdsls032.tdat = 0) or (tdsls032.tdat &gt; :today))&quot;But it didn't seem to like that expression very much.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">25th October 2003, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">unless you have declared today and assgned it todays date, the<br />
program does not know &quot;:today&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
read up and use date() or date.num() functions and their usage.<br />
depending on how date is defined in your application one of these<br />
may help without a &quot;today&quot; variable.<br />
<br />
tdsls032.tdat &gt; date.num() may work for you.you may not even need to have the first part of =0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">25th October 2003, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually - I had declared today:<br />
<br />
domain   tcdate   today<br />
<br />
here's the original snippet, including the declarations:<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
   table   ttdsls032<br />
   domain   tcdate   today<br />
<br />
before.program:                      <br />
   today = date.num()                   <br />
   query.extension = &quot;((tdsls032.tdat = 0) or (tdsls032.tdat &gt; :today))&quot;<br />
The problem was actually it should have been declared as type &quot;extern&quot; instead.<br />
<br />
I declared it as extern and that seemed to fix it.<br />
<br />
so the code reads:<br />
declaration:<br />
<br />
table   ttdsls032<br />
extern   domain   tcdate   today<br />
<br />
before.program:                      <br />
   today = date.num()                   <br />
   query.extension = &quot;((tdsls032.tdat = 0) or (tdsls032.tdat &gt; :today))&quot;<br />
Since I need to show upcoming expirations as well as items with no expiry date, I still need to join the query with a &quot;=0&quot; date to see those items.<br />
I probably could have gotten away with calling date.num() without filling a variable, but, it seems to work now so I'll leave it.<br />
Thanks for all your help everyone!</div></div><hr />
