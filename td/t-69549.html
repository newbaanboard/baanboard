Can anyone let me know the difference in following script..<br />
Assuming vrinf502 as customized table <br />
1.<br />
select vrinf502.*<br />
            from vrinf502<br />
            where vrinf502.orno = :whinh225.orno<br />
            and   vrinf502.ppon = :whinh225.pono<br />
            and   vrinf502.ktwt = :whinh225.qadv<br />
            selectdo<br />
                  flag.d2 = true<br />
            endselect<br />
<br />
2. select vrinf502.*<br />
            from vrinf502<br />
            where vrinf502.orno = :whinh225.orno<br />
            and   vrinf502.ppon = :whinh225.pono<br />
            selectdo<br />
               if vrinf502.ktwt = whinh225.qadv then<br />
                  flag.d2 = true<br />
               endif<br />
            endselect</div></div><hr />

On this one I would as add &quot;as set with 1 rows&quot;. No reason to do all that looping.<br />
(2) This query finds all row for the 2 fields, then it checks all of them.  If even one of them as a qadv field that matches the vrinf502.ktwt field then it sets the flag to true.<br />
<br />
In essence the 2 queries do the same thing - set the flag to true if just one time vrinf502.ktwt = whinh225.qadv these match.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
Concern is , first option is not working but 2nd option is working for a single set of record. why???</div></div><hr />

If you add order by clause to both the queries and re-init the flag in selectempty and initialize the flag before the start of query... you should be able to get a consistent result. Run-time scenarios/data-sets cannot be predicted.</div></div><hr />

I would be checking my code if the first option is not working.  I would check all the domains for the table fields and make sure they line up. Not being familiar with the data I can't say for sure what exactly is the reason.  But based off what you posted the first should work.  <br />
<br />
If that second field is a double or something like that then you could be running into a precision issue.  We once had code that said if x=y do this - it worked on the test system when you set x and y to 1.  In production it did not work even with x and y set to 1.  We had to use double.cmp to do the test.</div></div><hr />
