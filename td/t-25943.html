Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />

In the box Bshell environment &quot;Command&quot; you would enter something like<br />
-- -nodebug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">And on the contrary not it can? Because there is 100 user that I don't want them to see the debugger while I see the trace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">What I meant was that you would need to go to each users desktop to set up their bw so they could not see the debugger. As far as I know by default all users see the debugger otherwise.<br />

<br />
You being on UNIX environment.....<br />
I suppose can modify the profile file for achieving the same.<br />
I don't exactly remember which user file u need to modify.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">These is way but not an easy one.<br />
<br />
Check which package combination you use. Open the fd&lt;package combination&gt; file in ${BSE}/lib.<br />
Copy the line that represents your object e.g. otd. Change the first line of these two and insert in front of it your name with curly braces around it. Add a path in front of the normal path. You can place your object compiled in debug mode there.<br />
<br />
Please note that a convert/create runtime will remove your manually added entry.<br />
<br />
Furthermore note that you need to be carefull, you can end up with a 'crashed' environment. I guess you want to test it first in a non production environment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">You can put the debug object and source somewhere else and modify the fd file temporarily. Create an extra entry for p&lt;package&gt; and o&lt;package&gt; preceded by your login between brackets. Example:<br />
{&lt;login&gt;}o&lt;package&gt;:${HOME}/debug:${BSE}/application....<br />
{&lt;login&gt;}p&lt;package&gt;:${HOME}/debug:${BSE.....<br />
<br />
In ${HOME}/debug you have to create a subdirectory with name o&lt;package&gt;&lt;module&gt; and put the object there. The source must be in ${HOME}/debug/p&lt;package&gt;&lt;module&gt;.</div></div><hr />

I noticed you are on UNIX, if you have SCM enabled for the VRC, then you can just check out the script and compile in debugger, which is visible only for your login or the SCM group (if shared with others).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">22nd December 2005, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">CAn you explain me how to do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">22nd December 2005, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">As a matter of fact, I used the same method to test single objects provided by baan support.<br />
<br />
The problem with SMC, apart from being a pain in the lower back to install, is that you change your entire development environment. You will also have to install version control on your UNIX because that is what Baan really uses.</div></div><hr />

I have to differ with Francesco, I would rather install an SCM VRC as a safer option and one time effort, compared to letting developers messing with fd files and making a mistake with the structure inside it.<br />
Monica, you have a setup a new check-out/derived VRC and link to the development VRC. Refer to the sessions in the Menu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Application Development -&gt; Software Configuration Management (SCM).</div></div><hr />
