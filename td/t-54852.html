I need a help -- We have implemented HR Module in BaaN. I am facing a poblem in Maintain Leave Transaction .. any one can give me logic..<br />
suppose i m having 2 leave balance....then BaaN should allow only for 2 days leave to take...but now it is accepting more than 2 leave. Because now system is when the boss will approve then only leave balance will be deducted otherwise leave balance will remain same. If boss has not approved then leave balance will remain same. And in this case users can apply leave for any days because in leave balance it shows 2.<br />
<br />
so, what i want to give logic is--- if users have applied leave and that is pending then SUM total pending leave and if this pending leave is &lt; Total Leave Bal. then only allow else not allow.<br />
e.g. Total CL = 5<br />
users have applied CL for 2 days<br />
Again applied CL for 2 days<br />
if next time he is applying for CL for 2 days then it should not allow.<br />
So i want to calculate if (2+2) &lt; 5 then allow  else not allow<br />
So how to calculat in BaaN this (2+2).<br />
Plz help me..... thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

If u dont  have any source codes , u can do in a new session with AFS  wrapper or any other tool like QKEY / RUSH etc . This board is replete with ample documentation and help on this topics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvpBaaN</div><div class="date">25th January 2009, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">You probably are storing the leave data in some Baan tables, with the status (like Pending or Approved).  When user is applying for leave, check for all leave records for that user. You may get different records with different status.  For records with status = Approved, add the approved leave to a variable (example prev.leaves). For records with status = Pending, add the applied number of days to another variable (example pending.approval). For calculating the available balance, use the total leaves - prev.leaves - pending.approval.<br />
<br />
So, with your example, it would look like:<br />
<br />
total.leaves = 5<br />
[users have applied CL for 2 days - Assume status = Approved for this leave]<br />
prev.leaves = 2<br />
[Again applied CL for 2 days - Assume status = Pending]<br />
pending.approval = 2<br />
[Again he is applying for CL for 2 days]<br />
avbl.leaves = total.leaves - prev.leaves - pending.approval<br />
= 5 - 2 -2<br />
= 1<br />
Since avbl.leaves &lt; leaves he is applying now, don't allow him to apply.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for help..<br />
But can you help me...<br />
I have a table where I am storing total no. of leaves taken<br />
Lets say  lttcd492 in field lttcd492.lvdy<br />
Now I want to add as below..<br />
2 CL applied on 01-01-09 in lttcd492.lvdy (Status is Pending)<br />
again 3 CL applied on 12-01-09 it also stores in lttcd492.lvdy (Status is Pending)<br />
Now I want to get total no. of days as Pending.<br />
So how to add 2+3. Can you give me script because both are storing in same field with different date, so i m not getting how to add ??<br />
Thanks in advance!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th January 2009, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">U can do so with above functions .<br />
<br />
If u get a tools training in Baan 4GL ,that can help u substantially doing such tasks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manish2111</div><div class="date">28th January 2009, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Kindly see the below what i wrote but it is not working.<br />
It is calculating only first record.<br />
Lets say if I have applied for CL two times i.e. two records are available.<br />
1st time- 2 days<br />
2nd time - 3 days<br />
Then it is considering only 2 days but it should consider 2+3 = 5days.<br />
Kindly see my script and if any modification required kindly give me.<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

we have three type of leave CL, SL, PL<br />
But how to calculate total pending leave as per leave code.<br />
SUM of CL pending<br />
SUM of SL pending<br />
SUM of PL pending<br />
Here I am getting the SUM of Pending leave of that leave code what is my first leave code as pending in my table.<br />
Plz tell me how to get as per above mentioned code, how i can get SUM of pending leave as per leave code for all leave code.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manish2111</div><div class="date">29th January 2009, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everybody.<br />
now everything is fine. except one thing ???<br />
I am using on.main.table, in this case it SUM all CL Pending when session starts and it stores the Total CL Pending = 4(e.g.) out of total Leave = 7<br />
Means Leave Bal. = 7-4 = 3<br />
But lets say after starting the session I have applied for 3 leaves i.e. now Total Leave Bal. = 3-3 = 0.<br />
But as this is the same session so it has still stored 3 CL Bal. and still it is allowing to apply more 3 leave and so on.<br />
When I exit and reopen the session then this time Leave Bal. = 3-3 = 0. So it will not allow.<br />
So what should i do, so that this problem should not come. That is say earlier Leave Bal. = 3 and we applied for more 3 leave so after saving the record leave bal. should be 0 (ZERO) not 3. plz help me.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
