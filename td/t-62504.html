I need to create a SSRS report for the Purchase order session tdpur4100m000 or tdpur4100m900.  I am afraid we will be getting a lot of request to generate the report in SSRS to have a uniform header/footer layout for our customer facing reports.<br />

What I am worried about are the parameters that LNConfigurator utilizes when I create mine from scratch. Is there are template I can use to convert standard LN Report to a SSRS Report.</div></div><hr />

i'm in the lower version of ln that does not have lnconfigurator but i've been using ssrs and ssis since baan iv. you can build an ssrs report, standardize it with logo, fonts , etc. from there you can just copy and rename the rdl file. at least that's what i do and it worked well for me.</div></div><hr />
