I have seen this posted before with no answer Disable prompt (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5357&amp;highlight=save+layout).  I suspect you'll have to wait until Baan Support comes up with a fix.  You should log a case with them if you haven't already.</div></div><hr />

on 4 c2 the editor is just fine.<br />
May be this is intentional feature so as to save all the<br />

Perhaps it's a bug in a specific patch or SP?  You could try installing the latest solution for ttadv3130m000.</div></div><hr />

One of them created this &quot;new&quot; functionallity, which I also do not care for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that it's SP-11.  We're currently on 10 and have that 'functionality'.  I also hope there is a way to disable it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">themeus</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running BaanIVc4 and there is no problem you described (probably of the low service pack reason) but if you install solution number 121558 it &quot;repairs&quot; editor that it works as you described. Check on that solution.<br />
<br />
On BaanVc that problem is present as well, but I don't know what solution is responsible for that (if any) So if anyone knows help, help...:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 03:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that is the problem. Is there a solution out there to get rid of this saving prompt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 03:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like the only way is to uninstall 121558.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 03:56</div></div><div class="posttext">That should do it I hope</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">The patch(for us) was installed in the tools service pk 10, and wont let me uninstall using pmc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I was afraid of that.  You would have to uninstall the entire service pack.:(   Then either, just go with SP9 or reinstall all the SP10 patches individually without 121558.  <br />
<br />
What I would suggest as an alternative to this is to replace your editor object (ottadvformedit) with an older version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">20th November 2002, 04:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I will try that. It should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">20th November 2002, 09:30</div></div><div class="posttext">One of my customers is facing the same problem, I will try to have it solved by a new solutions (if not done yet)... I will keep you posted.<br />
<br />
On reproduction: the error does not come when clicking or switching between layouts when you click on the black space.<br />
<br />
When you double click on a field (subsession opens) or when you click and move your mouse over a field (even too little to actually move, but enough to put + on field limits) then the question will come.<br />
<br />
It seems currently it will only happen when you enter edit mode. Even without actual changes.<br />
<br />
Log a case and have your cases being linked to defect 131143.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;end&quot; of the story was: artjuh was this one customer of mine and Baan is not willing to change things.<br />
<br />
And we had to be more precise in the problem definition: the question pops up whenever you enter a subsession or perfrom an action that can also be seen as an edit action. Like open a field dialog to view it's contents (where you could also have changed it) and move a field (even if it is only too small distance to have actually moved it, but you was ++ at each side) etc.<br />
<br />
Currently the check is: whenever you were in edit mode, the editor assumes you could have made changes that were to be confirmed.<br />
<br />
The fact that it worked without questions in the past was an error: it was also not saved when you did actually make changes. In that case this is better than not saving any changes at all...</div></div><hr />
