Can anyone help me over this?<br />

I can't say since I am not familiar with the command format.  But it looks like a maybe a / need for /jre/bin/copy or maybe even the space before AwesomePDF , or maybe a &quot;.&quot; needed between awesome and PDF.  That is the first thing I would check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use run.baan.prog(), run.prog() and run.baan.prog(), run.prog() instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are two problems -<br />
<br />
A. If on windows, try usijg run.prog() with cmd command, instead of shell.<br />
<br />
B. The java object was compiled in a Unix environment under a different JRE environment so it wont work on windows with a different JRE environment. Build a new one for windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mani sharma</div><div class="date">6th August 2016, 08:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I  have used run.prog on windows.<br />
<br />
ret = run.prog(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;,str.cmd,RP_WAIT).<br />
<br />
The returning value is 0 i.e it shows executed successfully. But when i copied the file to client ,it shows that it was a damaged file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ravin_singh</div><div class="date">7th August 2016, 07:30</div></div><div class="posttext">return value can be 0 in both cases, i.e. your java program ran fine or ran with errors. ret is nothing but the return value of run.prog() and not the java program. can you explain the command you are trying to run? its not understandable. If you can provide the piece of your, code someone can figure out the issue.</div></div><hr />
