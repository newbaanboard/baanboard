<br />
Report tdpur441101000 was cloned, some minor cosmetic changes were applied to it, then this cloned report was added as the 3nd report option to session tdpur4411m000. But we found that the customized report wasn't incrementing the order step.<br />
<br />
After several weeks, BaaN eventually came back to say that the Print Return Note report will only update the procedure mask if it is report number 1 on the session.<br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered other examples of this kind of customization constraint (effectively, you can't have multiple Print Return Note reports)? Are these constraints documented anywhere.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I have also had the support center tell me one thing, when another is true.  So if you have the source code for this I would trace thru the code and find out if this is true. Or hope that someone here with source(or appropriate knowledge) replies to your message. Sorry to say that we do not own the source.<br />
<br />
Not that I am knocking the support center, but there have been instances where the user community reports one thing and the support center told me something else.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bizen99</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">for this session is true, then, you can modify the source to accept report 3:<br />
<br />
reportno = 1    -&gt; old<br />
reportno = 1 or report = 3   -&gt; new<br />
<br />
with this modifications the program will modify the mask</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry David a quick source inspection has revealed that the session does indeed check the 'reportno' variable it must be '1' in order for the procedure mask to be updated to an 'e'. The reason behind doing this is because report number 2 is a simple list it should not update the procedure mask when printed.<br />
Your first option is to link your customized report as report #1, the other option is of course to approach your local support center.<br />
<br />
What version of baan are you on, maybe I can help you?<br />

You cannot fool the system, unless you really understand what you are doing. And this understanding must be both functional as technical. Only then you are able to do it correct.<br />
<br />
I really like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 07:34</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have the source code and want to use the new customized report, then you should change the code as mentioned by bizen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David A. Green</div><div class="date">9th September 2002, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the helpful replies.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we do not have a developers licence, so it isn't an option to modify the session script as bizen &amp; Morpheus suggest. However, I think I can do what I need to do in the report script by formatting conditional print statements based on the company number: this way, different logistics companies can use the same report and obtain different outputs.<br />
<br />
My main concern (and the real reason why I rasied the thread) was to highlight what I feel is a rather surreptitious (almost unfriendly) feature of BaaN tools. Without a developers licence, how would a user know about this conditional updating of the procedure mask? Worse still, when we logged the call with BaaN Support they initially insisted they couldn't reproduce the problem at their end (despite it being, as we know now, standard BaaN functionality!) and the case dragged on for weeks. Perhaps I should have come to the BaanBoard in the first place and got the answer from you guys within an hour! <br />
<br />
Thanks again for you assistance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">10th September 2002, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">There is this option to gain sources even when you do not have the developers lisence; see the SP booklet.<br />
<br />
In that way you can have the sources after they have been updated.</div></div><hr />

What is this SP booklet? Do you mean Service Pack installation guide!? From where to get it?</div></div><hr />
