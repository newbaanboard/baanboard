<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my dilemma:<br />
<br />
The way that our current menu structure is, is that there have been several customized menus based on user's roles, or the plants/divisions they work in, etc.  There is alot of redundancy in these menus.  Additionally, if there are any new customized sessions they must be researched and placed in some or all of these menus.  Also, if there are SP or patches installed that add sessions to menus, you have to recreate your customized menu from the update.  Thus, the user authorizations are more wide open.  If the 'restriced' maintain session is not on the menu, then the user cannot run it.  (This is a menu structure maintenance nightmare)<br />
<br />
OK...<br />
<br />
I have a vision to go in the opposite direction, putting more emphasis on using authorizations and cutting back all the menus to a handful of top level menus.  This way, when we have a new customization, it is added in one menu and it is available to all.  Since going up to SP19, the copy authorizations session (ttaad2240m000) gives you the opportunity to create user templates and append authorizations to users.  (This is a user authorization maintenance nightmare.)<br />
<br />
There are differences in philosophy concerning these two approaches, but ultimately, I am the one who owns this maintenance nightmare.  For myself, I think the latter would be easier to maintain.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this and please offer suggestions as to best practices.  What have you done?<br />

Thanks,<br />

<br />
We are restricting the normal users to special menus, and we do not allow them to call a session by code. <br />
<br />
To reduce the menu redundancy, I created a special session that can be used in menus to limit sessions to some users. Basic idea: A table contains login + session code; the new session gets the session code as argument and checks against that table before doing a zoom.to$.<br />
We are using that scheme for over 3 years now, and we found only to cave-ats: Very little sessions have problems, because they think they are running in background ...; menus cannot be linked to different languages because of the menu description. But most of our menus are only based on departments, not on department + normal user, department + key user and that on.<br />
