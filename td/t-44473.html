<br />
Does anyone know if it is possible to add a program script to a Standard Session?  I want to use the Session UI with my program script to send data to a customized report.  <br />
<br />
I want to use the UI from session tibom1410m000, my custom script, to send data to a custom report.<br />
<br />
Is this even possible? And how would I go about setting this up (right now when I add a new program script it isn't saved in the list of scripts when I close Program Scripts/Libraries session)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice,<br />
Ben</div></div><hr />

I understand that you want to modify a standard program script. If this is it that you want  then You have to copy the component to the VRC in where it is the custom components and in this you can give the functionality that you need.  <br />
<br />

I am not sure that I understand you.  <br />
<br />
By copying the component (the UI in this case and possibly the program script) to a custom VRC I should be able to add functionality to a standard session.  <br />
<br />
Is this what you meant?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<br />
The session acts as container of components (Screen, program, report),  <br />
  <br />
If you need to give special functionality the program then You will have to copy the program script to the VRC custom and then you will be able to give  the functionality that you need. You cannot modified a standard program.  <br />
  <br />
The report is in the same case<br />
<br />
<br />
See you,</div></div><hr />
