I did the above report.  But in my other report I have to display only  mfg.item and subtotal qqqqq , which I am not getting some how ???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">20th October 2003, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">you can create a new section After field of mfg item and have a field there with the same name as that of the field you want to total up (I guess routime). Make the Aggregate Function for this field as Total. You dont need to code anything for this in the report script.<br />
<br />
hope this helps.<br />

I tried that. I wrote the same code in after.tirou102.mitm and selected the aggregate funtion total in form field. but I am getting ZERO value.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th October 2003, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep the calculating logic in the detail section, so it gets called each time, then if you don't want to print the detail layout use the command lattr.print = false, like:<br />
<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
if tirou102.mcoc = 0 <br />
then rou.time = 1*tirou102.rutm<br />
else<br />
rou.time =tirou102.rutm * tirou102.mnoc / tirou102.mcoc<br />
endif<br />
<br />
lattr.print = false<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then set the aggregate function to total on the form for the rou.time variable in the after.tirou102.mitm section.  Make sure you have a detail layout still too, it won't print because of the lattr.print = false, but is needed to trigger the section's logic in the report script.<br />
<br />
If it still does not work , remove the lattr.print in that call, and instead set the print condition for the detail line = 0 (false).  One or the other should work to get the calculate and total logic on the field.<br />
<br />
These are always a little messy - the main point is to leave the calculate logic in the detail section and supress the printing, then let the total aggregate function work for itself.  Good luck and post back if it still gives problems.</div></div><hr />
