Am trying to hide certain field values on session forms that are already stored in tables. This applies to both multi-occurence and single-occurence sessions. TTAMS authorizations seem to help if I want to insert a record, but not of help if  I just want to mask certain values. For example, would like to mask Purchase Price values for certain users. And I don't have source code so inputfieldinvisible is not an option. Am wondering if there is an option available at all in Vc that can satisfy my requirement using ttams sessions. Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

There can be ways to do it. A way to do it is, duplicate the session and get it into your own VRC. Now, use Dynamic Form to remove those fields. Give the access of this session to your users for whom you want to restrict the access.<br />
<br />
This way you wont need any authorizations to do at table field level.</div></div><hr />

You can offcourse change the form as an alternative as the other member has suggested.<br />

Thanks Bhushan. And interesting. But what if the session is already in the VRC linked to PC and Customized. No, we don't own the source. And this masking of field values is only for some users, not for all.</div></div><hr />

Again, there are 3 ways to deal with that. One way is to duplicate the session and make a new one, remove the unwanted fields and give access to the restricted users to this session. But make sure, if there are any related AFS or session calls to the main session, you have to handle this session the same way.<br />
<br />
Second way is to use session wrappers if you are open to such ideas.<br />
<br />
And offcourse, table field authorization works as the other member suggested. Check the snap where I make reference A field for table tdsls400 masked.</div></div><hr />
