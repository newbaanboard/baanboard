I am getting this error while running a process session. When we run this session in test company it went well. When I ran the same session on Live company we got this error. we r still getting it.<br />
<br />
Note: Both Test ad Live companies are on the same environment and same Package Combination.<br />
<br />
2. None of the links provided above gives me information on why we get this error.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th February 2008, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay:<br />
(1) For link 1 - do you ask a question that might not be in the production environment.<br />
(2) Check your forms - could one of those be corrupt<br />
(3) Well if in German environment check for those patches.  You say same environment, but are the patch levels the same.<br />
<br />
With your original post all three of the links are relevant and could point you to things which may be occuring.  You might want to post more information for the ln experts to help - such as type of session, source maybe, and anything else that maybe relevant.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

The error makes no sense to me unless it is an issue with data.<br />
<br />
Can we also suspect this as a data issue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th February 2008, 05:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I don't know if this helps a 5 or LN person, but does the error happen when you start the session or when you are processing?  Have you debugged it and found a specific line?  I assume it could be data, but I am really not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbabu1</div><div class="date">9th February 2008, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">It happens immediately when I continue the process...irrespective of the range I give.<br />

I could not debug this as we do not have sources with us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marioth</div><div class="date">12th February 2008, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you have to investigate the settings on your form, cos when you start the session the error immediately occurs, this can only happening when the settings on 1 of the fields on the form isn't set up right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbabu1</div><div class="date">12th February 2008, 19:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Setting checked on form and found they are ok.<br />
<br />
I don't think it is an issue with the form field settngs...coz, the same session runs well in on test data (Test Company) and not working on live data.<br />
(Both live and test companies are pointed to same PVRC on the same machine).<br />
<br />
Now, I have asked our remote development team to look in to it in debug mode...and waiting for their reply.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yesterday I got the same error and I discovered that we were out of space. So after I delete some for the $BSE/tmp directory everything was okay. Can you check if that is the problem.<br />

i'm having the same problem, but the strange thing is:it's happening on the standard LN tools package, specifically at the reports session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
had the same error.<br />
<br />
First thougt was the forms ... changed the forms to others, fitting nearly from other session which worked, error still appears.<br />
<br />
The reason was:<br />
<br />
&quot;Change key&quot;, Session &quot;Maintain available Indices by Session&quot;.<br />
<br />
(1) deactivating the additional indices<br />
(2) running the session, no error appears<br />
(3) activating the additional indices (like before)<br />
(4) running the session, no error appears anymore.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
it can also be a programming error. Example:<br />
<br />
long array.size<br />
long array.data(1) based<br />
...<br />
alloc.mem(array.data, array.size)<br />
<br />
If array.size is 0, you get that error.<br />
<br />
Btw. If you compile your script with debugger, you get &quot;... for sym (array.size)&quot; instead of &quot;.. for sym ()&quot;.<br />
<br />
