<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">13th January 2004, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all!!<br />
<br />
I have the following parent-child sessions:<br />
- Parent: Display list, form type 3 [mulit-occ+view+main]<br />
- Child: Display, synchronized dialog, form type 3.<br />
<br />
I know a synchronized dialog is meant to be used as single-occurance insert/modify/display, however the reason I have applied it to my case also, is for the sake of being able to double-click on a record in the parent, and getting to the child with the relevant info (the child is a further break-down of the details per selected record in the parent). As far as I know - and I'll be glad if someone can tell me I'm wrong - double-click is only working for synchronized dialogs, at least in Baan 5.0b. <br />
<br />
My issue is the scrolling in the synchr. dialog, i.e. page-up, page-down. First it didn't work at all. After playing around with the standard form commands, I saw that for some reason the next-form, previous-form etc options have to be enabled in order to get page-up and page-down to work. In order to get scrolling with mouth-click on the arrows to work, the 'search' command has to be enabled. <br />
<br />
However, now every command in the synchr. dialog requires double action, so if I hit page-down on my keyboard, I have to hit twice in order to get 1 page-down. the first time nothing will happen. The same with mouse-scrolling, and the same even when hitting for instance cancel or close to close the dialog. <br />
<br />
Could someone help me out please??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />

I have been working with sych dialogs for a while, and specifically right now.  Mine all work the way you see it usually - both on the same main table, but clearly the doc's show you can use it in your way.  I don't find that the 'next form' option is needed to browse records - the 'next record' option is, is that what you mean?<br />
<br />
From your description, it looks like during generate of the 'm' session, you may have had some options not filled in (that darn generator is a pain, and resets if you move around too much).  The fact that your next form / next record buttons were not set right is a clue that generate did not go well.  I think maybe if you regenerate your form it may help.   Try generating again (a new number so you don't overwrite your current).  Check that the following are set in the Generate:<br />
Session Type:  Display (does that work ok for you?)<br />
Start Option:  I use 44, that's what my doc says, can't see how that would effect your scrolling though.<br />
Window Type:  List Window<br />
Main Session:  Yes<br />
Form Type:  2 or 3<br />
   View fields set appropriately<br />
St. Command Set:  Should default to M2.S or M3.S , or D2.0 D3.0.  I think any of those is good, but make sure something appropriate comes in.<br />
Occurances:  Default should be 8 or 10. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, for double clicking, you can try this post and see if anything is new for your version, the default button should be executed on double click, but there is some doubt in V.  I'll be testing some things out over the next few days if you do not get a better answer I'll post more.<br />
