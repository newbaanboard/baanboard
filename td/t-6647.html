Every position represents one of these steps.<br />
Every position can have three values (that I know of), with 'e' being the value for a completed step.<br />
<br />
The other 2 might come to me after my third cup this morning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In one of the threads, there was mention that field &quot;stno&quot; tells you the current step (the next step that should be executed).  I am running IVc3.  It appears that field tdsls045.ssls also stores the next step that should be executed and I cannot find a field named stno.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if field stno is in a prior release of BaaN or is it in a table other than tdsls045?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">12th September 2002, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">tdsls045.ssls is the next step to be executed.  In various pieces of Baan code, there are variables such as stno.4404, which might represent the step number of &quot;Print Sales Invoices&quot; (tdsls4404m000).  This is determined at run time using a function in itdsls0014.  Perhaps that is part of the confusion.  However, you list the correct field.</div></div><hr />
