<br />
NOTE : THIS IS FOR BAAN IVC4.<br />
<br />
We have a simple item sales report, where at each item change, we want to display sum of amount, total no. of customers by item and total no. of sales orders by item.<br />
<br />
The condition is, it should count unique customers &amp; sales orders by item. One way is to put control break login in session script, but, I was wondering if there is any simple way of doing it ?<br />
<br />
I have attached the output coming and desired output in Excel format.<br />
<br />
Any hint would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd December 2017, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I typically put the breaks in on the report and then leave the layouts empty. Seems to me a lot easier than trying to track when then value changes in the report script to add to the count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">22nd December 2017, 22:52</div></div><div class="posttext">This is one case where the powerful report writer will not cooperate, I think. You will have to make do with a small work-around programming. The following is just an idea you will have to adapt.<br />
<br />
So, I will make following assumptions:<br />
- You have the Program Script Source code<br />
- And, in the program script your selection is sorted by customer/order<br />
<br />
So, then you can try as follows:<br />
- Define an extern field called p_count (or whatever make sense) in the program script as well as the report fields.<br />
- In the program script, also define another field like p_prev_ordr<br />
- Then make the count field zero or 1 according to the change of Customer and Order<br />
<br />
* It is unlikely that the order number will be same for two different <br />
* customers, so we can simplify as follows:<br />
* Approximate code:<br />
if p_prev_ordr = current_ordr<br />
then<br />
    p_count = 0<br />
else<br />
    p_count = 1<br />
    p_prev_ordr = current_ordr<br />
endif<br />
<br />
- In the report layout, on change of order number, count this new field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srprks</div><div class="date">26th December 2017, 07:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi you can use a function on.change.check. below is the sample program from Pro guide.<br />
<br />
string   city(10)<br />
<br />
city = &quot;Paris&quot;<br />
on.change.check( city )   | checkpoint value set to Paris<br />
city = &quot;Rotterdam&quot;<br />
on.change.check( city )   | checkpoint value now set to Rotterdam<br />
city = &quot;Amsterdam&quot;<br />
if ( changed(city) ) then | changed() returns TRUE here, but also sets<br />
              |    the new checkpoint value to &quot;Amsterdam&quot;<br />
        not.curr( city )<br />
        message( &quot;City is changed, old city is: %s&quot;,city )  | city is Rotterdam<br />
        not.curr( city )<br />
        message( &quot;New city is: %s&quot;,city )   | city is Amsterdam<br />
endif<br />
off.change.check(city)</div></div><hr />
