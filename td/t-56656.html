<br />
While generating the report, I am getting the details of product line which is not required. under the unused product, I am getting the details of 956 items. I am not sure on how to delete those things. <br />
<br />
Please let me know the following,<br />
<br />
1) Whether I need to delete product line alone or the items also?<br />
2) If so, how to delete product line and items?<br />
3) If not, what I am suppose to do to fix the issue?<br />
<br />
I would appreciate your valuable ideas and resolutions. Kindly let me know as soon as possible.<br />
Thanks in advance!!!<br />
