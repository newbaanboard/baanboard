Our picking list has been customised and it is always displaying the last line of detail twice. To try to spot what has gone wrong I copied the report into our test environment to debug it. The trouble is that it works fine in our test environment and not in the live. I have tried to debug it in live but the report script appears to be fine, the loop appears in the standard program in the background (the bits I don't understand).<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me how I go about fixing this.<br />

==================================<br />
Often, the Test and Live environments are not strictly in synch.If you are sure and have checked all the solutions are up to date<br />
on both,you may look at a couple of things:<br />
<br />
1.Is it the line text or item text in that part of detail which is<br />
   printing?make sure you have similar Text propertes set up<br />
   as also any layout specific script if the same out layout is<br />
   supposed to print based on another condition only<br />
<br />
2.Another way to test would be,copy the  report onto another one<br />
 with just a couple of layouts including the detail in question and<br />
 see if it behaves the same.<br />
<br />
 sometimes what you see on the output is not exactly at the same<br />
line as you see on the &quot;Layout&quot; within the editor.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did it just start printing the last line twice recently or has it been doing that since the beginning? If is just started recently, then there might have been a new patch installed affecting the picking list logic, and this new logic has not been accomodated for in your customised picking list. If it has done that from the beginning, that means you just did your customisation not so long ago, and there's something wrong with the customisation<br />
<br />
Pls try to copy the standard picking list from standard VRC to another report code in your production VRC. Attach this new report code to your picking list session, so that when user wants to print picking list, there will be 2 choices available; the customised one and the one that is an exact copy of the standard picking list. Then try printing using the exact copy of the standard picking list to see if the standard report is doing the same thing. If it doesn't, then pinpoint the difference between the (copy of) the standard picking list and your customised one on the associated detail layouts<br />
