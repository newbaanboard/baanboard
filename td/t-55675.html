<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimw_143</div><div class="date">20th April 2009, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a document, user guide, etc. that explains how to use and navigate around the Report Layout editor?  I'm designing my first &quot;from-scratch&quot; report, and I can't even figure out how to create the 2nd line of the header layout.  I can pull up 'Help', but even trying all the different &lt;Esc&gt;,&lt;Ctrl&gt; key combinations, I still have only 1 line.  It may seem silly, but this is driving me crazy.:eek:<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help that can be offered.<br />

The control sequences is what you need.  Many of them need to be done more than once.  When editing your header, use the command to resize the window.  This will give you 4 corners of your header.  Us the arrow keys on your keyboard to go down 1 line and use the control keys again to leave resize the window.  Now you will have 2 lines to work with.</div></div><hr />
