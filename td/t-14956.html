<br />
any idea, <br />
<br />
are there any integrated softwares / third party solutions availablae for warehousing logistics, that is integrated with BaaN c4.<br />
<br />
The processes include, receving - putaway - storing - picking - delivery - packing, stock take, billing activities. <br />
<br />
If it can support RF Computers, HandHelds, PDAs ... for USER INTERFACE.<br />
<br />
Typically my forcase, planning, purchase orders and landed costing is there in baan. But when the actual goods are received this WMS software should take the data from baan receive and update back in baan; does necessary put-away. Likewise the Sales Orders will be in Baan, delivery picking, packing processes and update back in baan is expected.<br />
<br />
highly appreciate your inputs.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
I have successfully integrated BaanIV and CIM-Prolag (http://www.cim.de/eng/index.html). I used a very tight (Oracle-Oracle) integration with the same functionality that you seem to need (Slaes/Repl. delivery, Produnction/Purchase receipt, Inventory correction/ Cycle counting,...). This is however not an off the shelf solution. The one major requiremnet - as you might guess- is for Baan to be running on Oracle.</div></div><hr />

a fully-integrated solution for BaanIV and BaanV with lots of off-the-shelf functionality covering all the areas you mentioned and more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">9th April 2004, 20:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, there are several solutions of this nature.  My company - RMCis, has been doing warehouse / shop floor solutions integrated with Baan for 10 years.  We have standard / streamlined functions for receiving, putaway, time &amp; attendance, outbounding, all the basics plus many more along the way, including Cross Docking capabilities.<br />
<br />
We run on RF, Handhelds, anything that runs a TE Terminal, and very soon CE (already working, there are actually many versions), and of course, any old PC laying around.  These connections can be combine to use many fewer Baan licenses, via the Baan DDC.<br />
<br />
If interested in a demo please contact Kathy Barthelt at kbarthelt@rmcis.com, or myself.</div></div><hr />
