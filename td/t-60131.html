<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
don't know your requirement and your reportlayout well, but:<br />
<br />
You only have header and detail ?<br />
No before field?<br />
<br />
use a long for counter (tcoqan is double !)<br />
<br />
extern domain tcmcs.long draw.count<br />
<br />
and in after layout, first do layout.again() an the decrement the counter.<br />
<br />
if draw.count &gt; 0 then<br />
layout.again()<br />
draw.count = draw.count - 1<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
But better it should be a report like:<br />
<br />
header<br />
before.tisfc001.mitm<br />
before.tidcs101.item<br />
detail<br />
after.tidcs101.item<br />
after.tisfc001.mitm<br />
<br />

Many thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
When I change the location of the layout.again() line, I am getting the last value in the set of values I am looking for, reprinted for as many rows as there are in the tidcs101 table.<br />
<br />
I don't know the first thing regarding the implications of your layout suggestion. The idea for me is to produce a list of drawings associated to the mitm. I will then format them as Code 39 barcodes for calling up visual aid instructions from an external application.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
don't have access to one of my a B IV systems yet, but from memory:<br />
My layout suggestion should represent the flow of your data without need of use a layout.again()<br />
<br />
1.)<br />
Use tisfc001.mitm as presorted and tidcs101.item as ascending<br />
<br />
2.)<br />
Define a layout as suggested : Header, Before.tisfc001.mitm, Before.tidcs101.item, detail<br />
<br />
3.)<br />
in before.tisfc001.mitm do (read the drawing itemcodes):<br />
before.layout:<br />
select tidsc101 ......<br />
from .... where tidcs101.item = :tisfc001.mitm<br />
..........<br />
(So you'll have all drawings in your recordset)<br />
<br />
If tidcs101.item is your inputfield, it should be displayed in detail layout as long as tidcs101.item value changes.<br />
<br />
If you don't need the layout tisfc001.mitm, supress it with lattr.print = false<br />
<br />
e.g.:<br />
<br />
before.tisfc001.mitm.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
select tidsc101.*<br />
from tidcs101<br />
where tidcs101.item = :tisfc001.mitm<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
lattr.print = false<br />
<br />
Same for tidsc101.item !<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
Be sure that lattr.print is placed, after all calculation is done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this is what you try to achieve.<br />
<br />
<br />
The standard reports from session tisfc0408.... are following a similar logic.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

You are being most gracious with your time - I am very appreciative. I hope I am not wearing out my welcome.<br />
<br />
I have recreated the script based on what I inferred from your suggestions:<br />
<br />
header.1:<br />
<br />
before.tisfc001.mitm.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
        select tidcs101.*<br />
        from tidcs101<br />
        where tidcs101.item = :tisfc001.mitm<br />
        selectdo<br />
        endselect<br />
<br />
        lattr.print = false<br />
<br />
before.tidcs101.item.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
        select tidcs101.*<br />
        from tidcs101<br />
        where tidcs101.item = :tisfc001.mitm<br />
        selectdo<br />
        endselect<br />
<br />
        lattr.print = false<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
<br />
The detail section (in Maintain Layouts) contains only one print expression:<br />
<br />
tidcs101.draw<br />
<br />
The report produces only the last record of the set I am looking for - it does not print each corresponding tidcs101.draw value.<br />
<br />
Again, I am thankful for your help, and especially so on a Saturday.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;order by&quot;, and &quot;with :count rows&quot; along with If statement in the after.layout did it.</div></div><hr />
