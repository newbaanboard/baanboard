I uploaded this field before and everything was OK. I used the same existing scheme as before. It has two batch lines. This time, the &quot;Active&quot; for the second batch line is &quot;No&quot;. I tested it in the testing company, it's working. When I did on the live system, all records are skipped. Why??? :confused:  <br />
<br />
Please advise...Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Double check and make sure the correct batch is active and it is set for update and not insert.  Make sure to re-compile the exchange also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make sure that you create the script in the Live Company using tuxch0227m000.(if VRC for both are different)<br />
<br />
Another important to note that while Maintaining batch make sure that you put Live company number and not test company.<br />
