<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subbulu</div><div class="date">28th March 2008, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to access a customized session when the user enters a value in a field on the form from a standard session. In otherwords the customized session should pop up automatically when the user enters a specific value in a particular field. We don't have scripts and we are working on Triton/HP Unix with Tbase.<br />
<br />
We have used the methodolgy given in this forum by exploding the object. When we explode the object using bic_info6.1 we are not seeing the &quot;extern&quot; functions (relating to 4 GL events) that we normally see when exploding the object in a windows environment (B40C4). The same methodolgy suggested here is working very well in a C4 environment but not in Triton B6.<br />
<br />
Can't we use the same process to explode the object in Triton environment as in Widows environment (B40C4) ?<br />
<br />
Should we use any other method to explode the Triton object to see the 4GL events of a standard script?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

This will let you add events or program around events in the session.  We use Q-key here, but Vamsi's solution should work for this situation.</div></div><hr />

But actually I am trying with the code developed by Vamsi ... I think this will work only if I am able to successfully explode the object and identify the extern functions in the object. But when I explode the object using bic_info6.1, I am not seeing any extern objects. But If I explode a C4 object, it is showing all the extern objects and in fact it is working in a C4 environment. My main problem is while exploding the triton object tdpur4120. Any possible reasons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th March 2008, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Something to keep in mind - just because you do not see an event does not mean you can not use it.  I have found some of the simple Baan maintain session did not have any events.  So in that case I could just add events for the fields I want to check.  Granted I do not know anything about triton b6, but I would certainly expect tdpur4120 to have events.  Are you sure triton uses bic_info6.1 to explode objects?  I thought I read somewhere that bic_info6.1 was introduced in 4C(I do not know for a fact).  Can you look in the directories for a different version - just a swag on my part.</div></div><hr />
