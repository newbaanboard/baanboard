I'm using B40C4.<br />
I have copied a standard Baan session to the development environment, renamed it and inserted Q-key code to add additional functionality. (We don't own Baan code).<br />
The sessions I copied are the tdsls4110m000 Maintain Sales Orders and the tdsls4102s000 Sales Order Lines. <br />
The problem is this: The sessions work fine except when I try to close them. The main session closes fine, but the original Sales Order Line session appears and the new Sales Order session (with the Qkey) won't close. <br />
I've tried everything I can think of codewise, but there must be something I'm not doing right. <br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

Recompile both sessions. Make sure they work with out your code.  This will at least let you know if your code is at fault.  I do know if you leave out |#call by mistake in one of the events things can get ugly.<br />
<br />
If things still do not work call give the Qkey people a call.  They have always been real helpful - actually told me what solution for a session I needed.</div></div><hr />
