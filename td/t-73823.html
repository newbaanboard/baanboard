<br />
in the print session cprrp1410m000 there are several possibilities to sort the output report. However, the existing options are not enough for us and we would like to add our own sort orders here. Is this realized via an extension or how can I implement this?<br />
<br />
Or how can I influence the sorting in a report?<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty new on Infor LN, but I habe some experience on Baan IV. And I guess that extensions can't be uses here.<br />
<br />
But you could have a look at my post http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9090 to get a possible way. So you would add a new input field (even as a sort field), and since the standard script does not fill that field, you do it before the sorting starts within the report script.<br />

<br />
thanks for your answer. We try to stick to the standard as much as possible and not change the report scripts. Therefore, this would be the very last step. I guess we are not the only ones who would like to add a simple sorting in a print mask.<br />
<br />
It must be possible in any way. The only question is how :)</div></div><hr />
