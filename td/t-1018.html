<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th February 2002, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a table with a text field on it.  When I delete this record I want to also delete the text. So I am trying to use text.delete, this is after the delete on my table and the commit.transaction.<br />
<br />
if(tppss990.txtn&gt;0) then<br />
  numlines = text.delete(&quot;tppss990.txtn&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
I have tried several forms of the text.delete and the above is just the current version.  Is there something I am missing? The record on my table gets deleted, but not the text in the text tables.<br />
<br />
By the way - I am a super user on 4c3 and I created all the text in the test environment that I am trying to delete. Once my table is deleted I can go into tttxt1100m000 (Maintain Texts) and delete the text record.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

The code I posted actually works, but in order to run the new code I forgot to close the old version.  I did not catch this until I tried to compile in debug mode. :)<br />
<br />
Being a moderator I could have just deleted it and nobody would have known it but me. :)<br />
