<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, trying to take a value, and based on the rounded result to 0 decimal places, I want to truncate that value so that no decimal places print out ...<br />
<br />
<br />
	if (tcmcs002.dscb = &quot;JPY&quot; ) then<br />
		invo.totl = round ( invo.totl,0,2 )<br />
		invo.totl = trunc(invo.totl)	<br />
                endif	<br />
|<br />
<br />
The problem is the TRUNC function I don't think I am doing correctly and working through a few sources I am having no luck ...<br />
<br />
Error Unresolved reference to function 'trunc'. Is this because I am trying to use a variable invo.totl ??<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated !<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure there is a command called trunc - at least I did not see anything in help. Anyway your round statement should do the trick.  Round 1.65 would round the value to 2.  Then in your just print it without decimal places using something like ZZZZ9(just use enough places).  Or you could set the round to a long variable - something like somelong = round(invo.totl,0,2).  This would also remove the decimal places and the report would then print the long instead of the double.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I see. The TRUNC was just a SQL command function I was looking at. <br />
<br />
Now, when printing OA's for our Japanese customers, we need no decimal places. <br />
<br />
BUT, we use the same invo.totl variable for all of our other customers in different currencies that do use decimal places. <br />
<br />
How can I just format the IF JPY values to not print decimal places ?  If I hardcode that format, It'll affect all values sent to invo.totl correct ?<br />
<br />
Thanks ....OH, Can you perhaps suggest a good source for valid commands I can look at ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a wiki attached to the board - yes it is baan 5 commands, but most are available in Baan IV.  As for your problem yes what I suggested would impact all customers.  Is there a way you can identify which customer is doing the printing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the easiest way I was going to determine that was if the tcmcs.dscb description was = to &quot;JPY&quot; for Japanese Yen charge. <br />
<br />
As Yen do not have any decimal anything equivilents, I thought it was best not to restrict this to just a group of customers because it is theoretically possible to sell something in Yen to a customer outside of Japan.<br />
<br />
Perhaps i need to investigate wiritng this to another variable and tell the code that if dscb is = JPY, then do not print out the regular totl field and print out the JPY field equivilent with the formatting you suggested ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moon Lok</div><div class="date">16th April 2005, 05:22</div></div><div class="posttext">In my case, I will print the value as String<br />
<br />
For &quot;JPY&quot;<br />
str.invo.totl = sprintf$(&quot;%@+Z9@&quot;, round(invo.totl,0,2))<br />
<br />
For &quot;Other&quot;<br />
str.invo.totl = sprintf$(&quot;%@+Z9VDZZ@&quot;, round(invo.totl,2,2))<br />
<br />
But I don't know it work on baan 5 or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">18th April 2005, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice solution. That's appears to make sense and solves a few issues. thanks.<br />
<br />
My string is of same length as my long integer. When I enter in code for this solution and re compile / print, the report just gives ###### instead of actual values.<br />
<br />
I am assuming it has something to do with the conversion from long to string ?<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say the field on the report is to short to display the value. Just make it longer.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Agreed of that, even you have set the same length, try increase the length to test. Also beware of the domain of str.invo.totl in my suggestion both in script and report layout.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure if this is helpful.<br />
You can use the Language/currency exp. option in Report fields to format the field as per the currency. Pass the currency as the input field and use it as currency expression. The format specified for the passed currency code will be used.<br />
<br />
See attched.</div></div><hr />
