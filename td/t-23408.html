Has anybody built a FedEx API in Baan before? If so, what are the pits and tips?</div></div><hr />

I worked on writing a Packship system where we were calling Fedex Ship API and do the Fedex shipping transaction. This was not though in Baan. I also did a rating system in Baan where it would use API's for different LTL carrier to rate the shipment. We are on IVc3 so I don't have Baan Open world. All I did was create a ASCII file from BAAN, generate a XML file from Baan, merge the two files in a java prog, that would call the API's and then write the o/p to a flat file which Baan prog can read. It works seamlessly. Based on this concept we have designed inhouse Credit Card processing solution. We are also integrating Baan with Sales Force.com using there API's. This may not be the best technical solution, but it works for us. I don't see any thing specific in Fedex API. The key thing is to form the correct request.<br />
