<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">3rd June 2009, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to compile an old report, that was supposed to be working last year - but now find that it won't compile with an error at line '321'.  There aren't 321 lines in the report script, so assume its referring to the temp compile file.  Here's the rep_gen results:<br />

tmp081142931( 321): Error: 'ser' not declared<br />
  2 warnings  suppressed due to errors.<br />
  1 ERROR     REPORTED.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't find referece to 'ser' anywhere in the report (input fields, script) - but if I add :<br />
<br />
			string	ser(666)<br />
<br />
to the report script it does compile!  (BTW, if you make ser or type that isnt string it says error long=string)<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea of modifying code without knowing why, and wonder what else might be different/wrong - any ideas what's going on here?</div></div><hr />

Is &quot;ser&quot; there absolutely anywhere?  Just wondering if a control character got into the script, looking like a new line or something.  Windows or UNIX for the server?</div></div><hr />

Mark, thanks for your reply - I dont think I can paste the script, but I'll check.  In the meantime, I pasted the script into a similar report for the same session and it compiles fine.  So, this string 'ser' seems to be 'in a part of the report that is NOT the report script'!<br />
<br />
How can this be??<br />
<br />
PS - its windows server, BaanIVc4 with fairly recent service pack</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">4th June 2009, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks from your description that somewhere in your layout you have a misplaced &quot;ser&quot;. Note: this may be as a report field, but also as a condition, initial value, expression, etc. So your best bet is to go carefully through your entire layout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">5th June 2009, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, thanks for you inputs.  There was a field called 'ser' on the layout that wasnt defined as an imput - it turns out the report script had somehow got out of sync with the layout.  Not sure how it happened, but was before my time!</div></div><hr />
