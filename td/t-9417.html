<br />
I have created a new layout based on the Purchase Order layout tdpur440101. I haven't really done that much except for to remove a few &quot;redundant&quot; layouts and added a couple more. My problem is that now I've made these changes the totals do not print out in the After.Field 20 layout. Which has me very confused.<br />
<br />
I still have the Detail.10 layout which shows the PO lines and I have not changed the After.Field.20 layout which displays the totals.<br />
<br />
The changes that I made to the report script I have taken out. The script is now the same as a layout that does work.<br />
<br />
I can only think that one of the layouts that I've removed must have some link to the logic calculating the totals. But I cannot see where!<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any ideas?<br />
<br />
I've attached the report objects for reference.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

The field print conditions have not been touched. They have the value of '1'.<br />

Be careful when removing redudant layouts, if the layout is not present then the corresponding section in the report script won't be executed. Rather use the following functionality:<br />
<br />
detail.1 &lt;= dont want it any to print anymore<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
       original code line 1<br />
       original code line 2</div></div><hr />

<br />
       lattr.print = false<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Using this method the layout won't print anymore but any code linked to the layout will still be executed.<br />
