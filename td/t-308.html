<br />
We are in AIX environment. We are printing differents barcodes values on a report. The type of barcode is 39. We are printing on that report : production-order number (6 length), operation number (3 length) and part-number (16 length). <br />
<br />
On any part number value that is longer than 10 characters, the print value is always TRUNCATED after the 10 first characters. All others value that is less than 10 are printed correctly. No problem with production number and operation number.<br />
<br />
I have try to increase the size of the output fields and still have the problem.<br />
<br />
Wld appreciate any inputs..<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Barcodes can be printed using a variety of techniques. Please specify which one of the following you are using:<br />
<br />
<br />
 ActiveX Control which is part of BWPrint<br />
 A soft-font installed on the Windows machine triggered by BWPrint<br />
 A cartridge in the HP Printer which gets its escape sequences from a shell-script on Baan (Unix) server<br />
 Something totally different (please explain :)).</div></div><hr />

Seems to be related to the portingset. On a system with a newer portingset, including newer BW and BWprint he did not experience this problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are using 3of9 cartridge in the HP Printer which gets its escape sequences from a shell-script on Baan (Unix) server (HP_BARCODE directory).<br />
<br />
I don't know if is link to the escape sequence, but if I print the field value on an non-barcode printer, this is what I got :<br />
<br />
Value : 123456789012345    --------&gt;  (15 characters length)<br />
<br />
result :  (*1234567890*(     ---------&gt;  (only 10 first characters)<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
<br />
BTW, we are on the portingset 6.1c.06.01 and AIX4.3.3<br />

<br />
One of our consultant fixed partialy the problem. It was the 'print substr($1, 1,5) ' line in the type file under hp_barcode directory.<br />
<br />
We have change that line for .... print substr($1, 1, 20) to see at least the first 20 characters.<br />
<br />
Now the problem is : sometime we can have a 'space' in a value to be barcoding (ex: 3316498-1 CAG) . The 'CAG' suffixe suppose to be in the part of the barcode. Now it is truncated.<br />
<br />
How can I fixe that one ?<br />

Last time I had a problem with printing barcodes with a length of 12 and more. The problem was a the old poringset and old bwprintversion.<br />
<br />
After you installed all the new stuff, you are able to use all length for barcoding as you want to.<br />
This is problems only occures by using the escape syntax.<br />
<br />
You can also use a cardridge for a printer. Then you're able to print by using the barcoding fields on a report field, without programming.</div></div><hr />
