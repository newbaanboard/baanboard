<br />
I want to add some text to a report layout but want to apply a print condition. I would normally put this in the &quot;Print Condition&quot; box of the Maintain Report Field. My problem is that the syntax is too long. I'm not sure how to change the report script to make this work for me. I have attached screen shots as reference. Would somebody be able to help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
That worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
I had tried something like this but obvioulsy the syntax wasn't quite there.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<br />
Do I need to put any brackets in the 'if' statement?<br />
<br />
if tdsls040.cuno = &quot;A84200&quot; and tdsls040.comp = 203 and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3TR&quot; and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3BS&quot; and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3SC&quot; <br />
<br />
If I print an invoice out for customer &quot;A84200&quot; and finance company &quot;203&quot; and order type is &quot;3SC&quot; the layout is printed. As the order type is &quot;3SC&quot; I would expect it not to print??<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">21st March 2012, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">resolved it.<br />
<br />
The report did not have tdsls040.cotp as an input field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st March 2012, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I would expect it not to print.  Because the &quot; and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3SC&quot;&quot; would be false and it would kick it into the else statement which has lattr.print = false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st March 2012, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also try this.<br />
<br />
after.tdsls045.orno.60:<br />
before.layout:<br />
   lattr.print = false<br />
   if tdsls040.cuno = &quot;A84200&quot; and tdsls040.comp = 203 and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3TR&quot; and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3BS&quot; and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3SC&quot; then<br />
       lattr.print = true<br />
   else<br />
       lattr.print = false<br />
   endif<br />
<br />
Then put it in debug mode and make sure the tdsls040.cotp has the correct value for what it is printing.  I can't see how one with 3SC would print.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">21st March 2012, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to put the tdsls040.cotp field on the layout but got the error saying &quot;field not defined as report input&quot;. So I added the field to &quot;Input Field&quot;. After doing this your original solution worked. It was the fact the report did not know the value of tdsls040.cotp that the logic was failing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st March 2012, 22:56</div></div><div class="posttext">If you put the condition in the before.layout, your layout overview does not show the condition anymore (because that layout condition will be 1 or true). To have more visibility of conditions in the layout overview session, you can use the #define. In your report script you code:<br />
<br />
#define SPECIAL.ORDER.FOR.CUSTOMER.A84200 (tdsls040.cuno = &quot;A84200&quot; and tdsls040.comp = 203 and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3TR&quot; and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3BS&quot; and tdsls040.cotp &lt;&gt; &quot;3SC&quot;)<br />
<br />
Then you can use SPECIAL.ORDER.FOR.CUSTOMER.A84200 as layout condition.</div></div><hr />
