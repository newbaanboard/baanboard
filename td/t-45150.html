<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently, I have been tasked with a project that requires to read data from a schema external to the BAAN schema (ORACLE).<br />
<br />
The attempt to use views to read was a disaster, because of performance problems - the underlying tables are rather large, and there is a need to 'join' them during their processing.<br />
<br />
SO, the next attempt was to define equivalent BAAN tables and fire SQLPlus scripts from within a BAAN session to insert/ update the data in these tables. Once the data is in the BAAN tables, then it is business as usual - the necessary indexes on the tables take care of the performance issues.<br />
<br />
This however creates a different issue of source code control. These scripts are files sitting in some defined directories. The issue I am struggling with is how to store the scripts so that they are not 'lost'. Is there a 'good' practice around this?<br />
<br />
I thought of saving them as text fields in some way, and then each time the script has to be fired, create the script in the /tmp directory on the fly, execute it and then remove it, all of this inside a BAAN session. Not sure if this is a good approach.<br />
<br />
The only one time earlier that there was a need to read an external table, the entire SQL script was created by the session on the fly (using seq.puts()). But I found that approach difficult to use whenever the script needed to be modified. Sure ensures the SQL 'script' is safe though - can never get 'lost'!<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on this will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just a suggestion: Why not use &quot;Maintain Scripts&quot; in Development? No one says that these must be Baan scripts :rolleyes:  They won't compile of course :)  You could possibly make a Package &quot;db&quot; and Module &quot;ora&quot; and set the directory for software components to wherever you want! One advantage would be that you could generate DD-dumps of your scripts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you. This looks like an excellant starting point and got me thinking.<br />
<br />
I have verified that the SQLPLUS command does not mind what the file name is as long as there is a file extension. (If there is no file extension, it adds .sql as a file extension). For example, I could run SQLPLUS by specifying a script file name like tccom000.sq0. The reason for this verification is that now I can store my sql script like you suggest, but BAAN saves the file with an extra 0 (that's zero) at the end in $BSE/application/... I just have to make a programming standard that when creating these as program scripts in BAAN, to remember and add a .something to provide a dummy extension. Luckily these are going to be very few.<br />
<br />
Now, I have to hunt for a BAAN function that will give me the directory name of where this source code is, so that I can locate the script and execute from within my BAAN session. Otherwise, I will have to live with a certain amount of hard-coding of the directory name.<br />
<br />
I see many possibilities. Especially nice is that the source code is now in a good place where it can never get lost. The other is that I can execute the script from right where it is sitting in the $BSE/application environment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 20:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I love BAAN: Here's how I can locate the SQL Script that (one day) I will store in BAAN:<br />
<br />
<br />
        string file_path(256)<br />
        if pathname(&quot;ptisqlcom000.sq0&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, file_path)<br />
        then<br />
            message(&quot;File not found : %s&quot;, file_path)<br />
        else<br />
            message(&quot;File found: : %s&quot;, file_path)<br />
        endif<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tested this with a dummy script I created. In the above, ptisqlcom000.sq0 is the actual program script filename that I have to locate. Only this needs to be hard-coded in the BAAN session that will execute the script - I see no option but to hard-code.<br />
<br />
Now, I have to figure out how to execute this - I mean, I have to pass at least the Company Number as an argument (since the underlying development company table names are different from production company table names). (SQLPlus is not (yet) my strong point.) I will probably have to use an intermediate shell script, which also I can store as a program script just like the sql script.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the good directions.</div></div><hr />
