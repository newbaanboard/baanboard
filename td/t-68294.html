I have a situation, we have developed a report in LN and that has 2 different detail layouts  (A and B), in my choice, If I select A then details of A will be printed and vice versa for details of B. Now, the same report layouts has been designed in SSRS and I have created them as 2 different rows with common header. Now when I run the report I'm able to see the result in SSRS,but its displaying both layouts and as per selection the data is populated and other as a blank layout. Could someone help me to change this behavior and populate only one layout as per the selection.<br />

<br />
=iif(TRIM(Fields!T_TNUM.Value) &lt;&gt; TRIM(Parameters!Parameter1.Value),True,False)<br />
<br />
you need to decide what triggers the value True or false</div></div><hr />
