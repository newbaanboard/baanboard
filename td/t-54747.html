<br />
I have a situation: in a report I want to print a text for an item, but the text is too long for my column space, so the text should be printed on multiple lines.<br />
But in my report, the text is truncated :( <br />
For better understanding, please see the attached picture<br />
<br />
Something I can't understand: the same report is installed in 2 different servers, on first server the report is printed corectly: the text is printed in multiple lines, but on the second server the report is printed like in the above situation: the text is truncated. <br />
<br />
Please heeelp<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot :)<br />

<br />
really sure that the report is defined in exactly the same way on both servers? Sounds strange.<br />
Anyway, the length of the textfield and number of lines is defined in the report <br />
<br />
 -  Print Length     :  80                                                    <br />
                                           <br />
 Min/Max of textlines:    0 /    0  (Zero means that the number of lines will be calculated automatically)<br />
<br />
So I would suppose that in your report Print Length has been set to 50 and maxlines is 2<br />

<br />
The reports are the same on the both servers (I exported &amp; imported the report again to be sure).<br />
Min and Max lines = 0<br />
<br />
On the second server the text is still truncated - for any device (including display device D).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
