I have a report with a header line in which the last two headers on the header line are not showing when I run the job.  The detail data is but not the last two headers.  <br />
<br />
I am attaching a word doc with screen shots of the header layout plus the definition of the two label fields  Margin and Margin Pct.<br />
<br />
The width of the the report is set at 255.  I have several more columns to add to this report.  Is there anyway to get this report wider and print landscape on legal size paper?<br />
<br />

Thanks,<br />

<br />
There can be two reasons for that. Either you have not set the width of the report in report properties or have not compiled the report after changing the width.<br />
<br />
Double click on the report an check the Page Width under Specials Tab. Check the screen shot. For reports having more than 255 characters you will have several ways.<br />
<br />
1. Create a delimited i.e. comma, | separated text/ascii file and put your data into it using seq.* functions. Transfer the file to client machine using client2server() and open it up using start.application.local() function. <br />
<br />
2. Create your own print device to manipulate the data coming from Baan report.<br />
<br />
3. Use external reporting systems like SSRS etc.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of threads on the board giving numerous example of how to do all the above listed ways.</div></div><hr />
