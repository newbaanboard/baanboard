That is how I take it - they created an customization in baan 4 and trying to import it to LN.  I assumed they used an export of software components.  I am not sure that would work from 4 to ln.  Then again I do not know anything about LN and importing custimizations on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">18th October 2012, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, this scenario is not possible. Tools tables in these two versions are different, table ttadv401 for example, has an additional field in ERPLN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">18th October 2012, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">And also there are differencies in SW - dynamic forms, reports and forms layouts are not language dependent components, ....</div></div><hr />

ok first ill explain completely what i need.<br />
<br />
1.We are using baan 4 past few years at that time there is lot of customization session in 4.<br />
<br />
2. Now we are planning to migrate LN FP7 because there is lot of new functionality added.<br />
<br />
3. Our main problem with Customization component<br />
<br />
In Baan 4 one complete custm package is there, we want same package in LN . i tried different ways.<br />
<br />
First i tried from baan 4 Export component session<br />
Next In LN tried to Import that baan 4 Export component.<br />
During import i got above error.<br />
<br />
Can you suggest me is there any different ways or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sanjana</div><div class="date">19th October 2012, 07:36</div></div><div class="posttext">First you have to make the patch in baan 4 for all ur components , then create the same module in  LN ,link the package &amp; module, transfer the patch in LN server , then import the patch in LN through session ttiex1285m000 .<br />
You will get all your components  in  LN . Then  you have to Convert the sessions to dynamic  through session ttadv2900m000.compile the script &amp; session , then run  ,your session will  be opened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">26th October 2012, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is rather complicated. You will meet at least three categories of issues:<br />
- functional : you must decide whether your customization is still required; some requirements that needed customizations in Baan IV may be covered by existing LN functionality<br />
- conceptional : there are so many differences between BaaN IV and LN flow of operations; many customizations may have to be redesigned deeply<br />
- technical : moving software components from Baan IV to LN is in common not possible with Export/Import Runtime DD or PMC; there is a lot of manual work.<br />
<br />
Of course, your effort depends on number of customizations you have and how deep they touch standard functionality. There are major table changes in practically all modules - new tables, old tables renamed, domains changed etc.<br />
Many sessions are different than they were in Baan IV, so if you used AFS to perform some tasks, you must redesign your code. Even if you used only your own tables, you still have to redesign your application to make it consistent with LN &quot;look and feel&quot;; there are dynamic forms, no more &quot;choice.user.*&quot; events and many other changes.<br />
<br />
So IMHO its is not impossible to move your customizations to LN, but it is not easy at all.</div></div><hr />
