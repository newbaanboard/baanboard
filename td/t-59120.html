By open I mean lines which still have at least 1 piece to still be delivered.<br />
<br />
This is always a hassle, and purchase &amp; sales don't work in the same way. <br />
<br />
It is rather hard to find waterproof rules and selection criteria. Often after running certain queries there seem to be some exceptions which are not correctly handled by the query. I think many of us could benefit from these exact criteria.<br />
<br />
Thanks  in advance,<br />

I can not imagine any code that would work 100% of the time.  Plus doesn't some of this depend on how your system is setup? I do know that with different users we have used different queries to define what is open. So in one case(just an example) anything with a back order might be open and in another it would be considered closed.</div></div><hr />
