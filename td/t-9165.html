Please refer to - Application Performance Guide - M2017 B US.pdf - Chapter 6- Profiling and Tracing.<br />

BAAN Application Performance Guide<br />

6.2.3 Analyzing the profiler output<br />
The meaning of the column headers is:<br />
Count Number of times the function is carried out<br />
Utime User time in seconds<br />
Call Average time for certain function call<br />
Perc % Percentage of total time<br />
Stime System time in seconds<br />
Rtime Real time in seconds<br />
Alloc Number of allocated bytes<br />
Free Released memory<br />
Ticks Number of bshell ticks<br />
Function Name of executed function<br />
Each time in the output is the time used only in that function. The profile figures are<br />
not cumulated.<br />
So, if another function B has been called in function A, the time used in function B is<br />
not taken into account for the time logged in function A.<br />
The Rtime column is the most important column.<br />
This is the time a function really takes (a user must wait).<br />
For this reason, it is advisable to search for the highest values in this column.<br />
The Count column is also very important.<br />
The numbers in the Count column can be verified to see that the number is not too<br />
high.<br />
Because: count * call = rtime.<br />
The Ticks column is also important.<br />
The number of ticks indicates how may CPU ticks (instructions) are handled in the<br />
bshell.<br />
There is no relation between Rtime and Ticks because one tick take a fraction of a<br />
second, but it can also take many minutes.<br />
For example: A full table scan can be carried out in one bshell tick and can take<br />
several seconds (or minutes). A calculation can be carried out where thousands of<br />
bshell ticks are needed and only one second or less is taken.<br />
So, a function with a high rtime and a low number of ticks, is probably a function in<br />
which intensive database action has been implemented.<br />
A function with a low rtime and a high number of ticks, is probably a function in<br />
which a calculation or a fast database action with a lot of fetches has been done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">6th December 2004, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. I think it was on the iBaanERP-5.2a(Reger) Document CD.<br />
<br />
You have to contact BaaN Support to get it.</div></div><hr />
