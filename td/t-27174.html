<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">23rd May 2006, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a stand-alone display-session, which displays all kinds of relevant data for items. Since I want to also be able to zoom to this session from a different display session, upon double-clicking an item in that (parent) session, I declared the session in the parent's program script as synchronised dialog (although it's another stand-alone display-session).<br />
<br />
Session type = Display<br />
Window type = Mondal window with menu<br />
Frm type = 1 (single-occ + main)<br />
<br />
When running the session stand-alone, everything works normal. When being called as synchronized dialog, then when hitting the hourglass (def.find) to search for a different item, I have to click twice; the first time nothing happens. Then when wanting to enter an item code in the find-dialog, the cursor is not placed on the field item as it's being done normally, but I have to actually click on the field in order to be able to enter a value (item). And finally when hitting the 'ok' in the find-dialog to search the selected item, I need again to click twice; first time nothing happens...<br />
<br />
I assume this behavious is to do with the fact that I call the second session as a synchronised dialog. Anyone has a clearer view on this, exactly what causes what behaviour, and of course how to solve it... <br />
<br />
Again for all clearity: I actually don't need the second session to be a synchronised dialog, since it's a stand-alone main display session. The only reason I declared session as synchronized dialog, is to be able to enter the session by double-clicking a record...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
Anyone???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">9th June 2006, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Are both sessions on the same main table? That is a pre-requisite for the usage of set.synchronized.dialog.<br />
<br />
We use constructions like:<br />
before.program:<br />
	set.synchronized.dialog(&quot;tccom0101m000&quot;)<br />
<br />
What should be the behaviour? Do you want the second session as single-occ session or as a multi-occ session?<br />

<br />
     1) Command &quot;set.synchronized.dialog&quot; must be used only when the main-table is same for both the sessions.<br />
<br />
     2) If the main-tables are different for the sessions, you cannot use the above command.<br />
<br />
     3) If the main-tables are different, you can create a form command of type session or function. When clicking on this form command you can go to the desired session.<br />
<br />
    4) If you create the form command as session, make sure that you imported the desired field in the target session. If you create the form command of type &quot;Function&quot;, you can use the command &quot;start.synchronized.child&quot; with matched index key fields. So that parent and child sessions will be synchornized.<br />
<br />
     Let me know if the above information is not enough to solve your issue.<br />
<br />
