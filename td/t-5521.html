<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mickbaan</div><div class="date">16th June 2002, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I am running Baan on NT, as well as a VB application on the same server that connects to Baan via CreateObject(...). <br />
I recently installed the latest tools object for ttstpstandard and ttstpapihand, but after installation the Baan connection from VB gives me the following error: <br />
&quot;Windows Sockets error 10053&quot; <br />
&quot;Connection with server broken&quot; <br />
<br />
When running the BWclient.exe (BECS) connecting to Baan still works fine. <br />
<br />
Does anybody know what has caused this problem or more importantly: how to solve it? <br />
<br />
Thank you, <br />
Mick</div></div><hr />

<br />
If not, try latest BW version too. See solution number: 13743. Latest BW version is 065, for BaaN IV.<br />
<br />
Also take a look at solutions numbers:<br />
<br />
- 105481, 109800, 109807, 110755 and 150883.<br />
<br />
Try to connect from different PC's in order to see if is a local problem like I suggest.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
During implementation stage, we also faced this problem but were not able to diagnose. Later it was discovered that the problem was neither of BaaN nor of Windows, it was the LAN (switch 3com) which needed to be reconfigured for optimal flow rates etc. etc. <br />
<br />
I am sure you also need the same methodology, just give it a try.<br />
<br />
all the best.<br />

<br />
I solve the problem above:<br />
it had to do with a new version of ottstpoledaemon that didn't communicate with my (old: 6.01c.04.05) portingset.<br />
<br />
I copied my old ottstpoledaemon object over the new one which solved my windows sockets problem.<br />
