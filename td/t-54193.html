file.no = seq.open.local(file.name, &quot;a&quot;, false)<br />
<br />
But the file.no would return 0(I had tested wether the local file exists or not, the return value always is 0). I found the return value &gt;= 0 means success(written in the BaanERP Programmers Guide). In fact, when the 0 return value, it neight create nor read the file. Anyone use it like this?<br />

PS:<br />
I found this program also with file.cp().:confused:</div></div><hr />

So many predefined variables and functions are deprecated. Though some of them still would work, some would not. Rats!<br />

As the seq.open.local() does not work in append mode, how I get it come true? Use seq.open(), client2server() and server2client() between local and server is so stupid. And use client2server(), the size of local file is not allowed greater than about 5MB(this is another idiotism).</div></div><hr />

I do not know any other solution. I did not check if they fixed that bug in a certain SP either. You might want to check that.</div></div><hr />

So what I do is client2server, append or write files, then server2client to put the file back. Just made it easier.</div></div><hr />
