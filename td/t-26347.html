<br />
I'm facing a problem while attaching some of the Software Components in a Customization Part.<br />
<br />
Some of the Software Component's (Labels/Help Text) Description is not coming up while I insert them under a Project/Project Part/Customization Part through the Session Software Components by Customization Part (ttadv1176m000). Instead the Description is filled with an &quot;*&quot; overflow character which indicates &quot;No Reference&quot; Character. I double checked such components and they are present in the VRC. For similar components the Description is coming up fine.<br />
<br />
Can anyone hep me with this. Why is the Description not coming up for some components. I'm working on BaaN 5c on a informix database.<br />
<br />
I'm attaching screen shot of the session.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

I would check to make sure that the width/height of the label are correct since these are part of the label identifier in the table.  Sometimes I shorten or lengthen a label; then I need to modify the customization part to point to the &quot;new&quot; label.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have already checked the height/length of the labels and they are correctly maintained.<br />
<br />
Also, this problem is not only restricted to Labels but I'm not getting description fo some of the Texts Components too.<br />
<br />
Thanks for looking into this problem.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganesh_kapase</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 09:04</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the possibility - Check component's PVRC hierarchy. My means if you are using component's from lower PVRC then will not work properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gaurav.agrawal</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Component is present in the current VRC itself !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">When you go into that ttadv1176m000 session, what happens if you try to insert the same label by zooming to the label list?  Does it come up with exactly the same code?  Does it give a 'Record already exists error'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gaurav.agrawal</div><div class="date">14th February 2006, 10:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, if I try to insert the same label again, it gives me the &quot;Record Already Exist&quot; Error. The Label name that comes up after zooming to Labels Session is the same as the one that is already present.<br />
<br />
Also, this problem is not limited to Labels but some of the Help Texts too, under the same Customization Part. When I try and insert such Help Texts again. &quot;Record Already Exists&quot; Error message comes up.</div></div><hr />

Refer to the post above by evesely. When I do what evesely suggests, I get the correct label, i.e., even if the label already exists in the project part and shows *** for desc, it selects the label again, this time with a different 4-digit number in front of it, and also shows the desc correctly...<br />
Look at the attachment...<br />
I think the best way is to zoom and select...<br />
