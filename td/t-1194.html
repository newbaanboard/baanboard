<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ramchand50</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Create a new font (you should be able to find free ware 'font creation' softwares on the web) and assign your company logo to a charecter in this font.<br />
<br />
2. Install the new font on the client<br />
<br />
3. Edit the registry (using regedit / HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; BAAN -&gt; BWPRINT) to include the new font.<br />
<br />
4. On the report where you want to see the logo, Insert a new layout and set it as a 'User-Defined font' and place the logo-variable in this layout.<br />
<br />
5. After compiling the report, send the report in a preview mode and check if the logo comes-up.   If it is not, then right click on the layout and change the font there.  It is just a one time setup.   After the first time, you don't need to repeat this step.<br />
<br />
It worked on Win-Nt/Win'98 for me. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbclark79</div><div class="date">26th March 2003, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to print to a postscript file via BW Print it would be necessary install such a printer device on your local windows workstation/PC.  BW Print can print to whatever printer devices are installed on your local printer and the ASCII text is converted via the printer driver installed for that specific printer.   And so if you want to print to PS or PDF that printer driver must be installed and used by BW Print.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note....<br />
In BaanERP 5.X the printer fonts are stored in the local windows registery per report per printer device (NOT per use).  This allows for a new printer device to be created within Baan to be used with user defined fonts.  The local Windows registry settings can then be distributed to all of the necessary workstations with the appropriate settings for those reports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marselhober</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear ramchand50<br />
<br />
Thank you for posted the file logoprinting.doc.<br />
I have downloaded and read it.<br />
<br />
I just can understand from step 1 to step 4.<br />
In step 5 and 6, there are some instructions i dont understand.<br />
<br />
In step 5 :<br />
- &quot;Select the print session &amp; the report, ... &quot; How to go to &quot;the print session &amp; the report&quot; ?<br />
- How to go to session &quot;Maintain Report Layouts&quot; ?<br />
<br />
In step 6 :<br />
- How to open the report in preview mode ?<br />
<br />
I have created the font and installed it. But when i print the report, it still displayed the letter &quot;A&quot;, not the logo.<br />
<br />
I really need the answers.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />
