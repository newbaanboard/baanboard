<br />
We are running a Baan Vc environment, using the service package. In case of an urgent service order we would like to sent a signal to the service engineer. When releasing the order, automatically a mail message or a SMS should be sent to the engineer. <br />
<br />
Has anyone any experience with doing something like this?? What are the possibilities?? Can we use just Baan or do we need some external software for this??<br />
<br />
Any help, tips and trics are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />

     You could either send an email or page (as in pager/beeper).<br />
<br />
     There are a lot of posts on this forum on how to send emails <br />
     thru Baan. mailx is a very easy way to achieve it. Dont bother <br />
     buying an external product just for email.<br />
<br />
     I had done a similar thing at my previous client.<br />
     They wanted the &quot;GUYS&quot; to be paged thru Baan.<br />
       <br />
     In our case it was simple.  <br />
     The pagers were capable of receiving email &quot;alerts&quot;. <br />
     For. e.g. If the pager # was 123456, then all I had to do was <br />
     send an email to 123456@nextel.com<br />
<br />
     Check with the &quot;paging&quot; service provider if their pagers can be <br />
     beeped via email. In most cases it is possible. <br />
<br />
     So  now if you can send an email thru baan u could send a <br />
     page . <br />
  <br />
     Try the &quot;page&quot; option. It makes the client hazar excited :)<br />
<br />
     Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
