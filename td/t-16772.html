<br />
I need some advice URGENTLY:<br />
<br />
For a certain (fully-customized) report I have to add a list with data for records not mentioned on the report detail lines. These lines are variable - depending on the data printed - and thus, the amount of lines is variable too.<br />
 <br />
The required list has to be printed at the bottom of the report, so I have to add it as an after.report layout. In the report script I will make the query to determine which records &quot;are missing&quot;, i.e. which records I have to add there. How do I handle this? How do I keep the amount of lines for this layout variable? Do I do this best by using the need() fundtion? If yes, please give an example of how to use it (I am not so familiar with those functions). Any other suggestions are most welcome!!<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">11th October 2004, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Andreas,<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your response! Let me try to explain a bit better what my situation is:<br />
<br />
At our company, for most 'areas' there is a warehouse with the same name. I.e. if you find in tcmcs045 an area &quot;abc&quot; you will find in tcmcs003 a warehouse &quot;abc&quot;. <br />
<br />
The report has to print warehouse data based on a selection of areas. So if the user selects areas &quot;AAA&quot; to &quot;ABC&quot; the report will print data (in teh detail lines) of warehouses &quot;AAA&quot; to &quot;ABC&quot;. Now at the bottom of the report I want to print a list of the data of all warehouses that are not yet mentioned on the report, i.e. those who do not have an area with the same name. <br />
<br />
I retrieve them very simply, with the following code:<br />
	select	tcmcs003._index1<br />
	from	tcmcs003<br />
	order by tcmcs003._index1<br />
	selectdo<br />
		creg.cwar = shiftl$(strip$(tcmcs003.cwar))<br />
		select	tcmcs045._index1<br />
		from	tcmcs045<br />
		where	tcmcs045._index1 = {:creg.cwar}<br />
		order by tcmcs045._index1<br />
		selectdo<br />
		selectempty<br />
			|// Selecting my data, and sending to report				<br />
		endselect<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope my intention is clear. So now, if I adopt your solution, how will it work? My code to select the required records goes through the whole tcmcs003 (warehouses) table and then checks for each warehouse if a tcmcs045 (area) exist; if not, a record has to be printed in the after.report. Can this be achieved also with layout.again?? If not, would you, or anyone else have another suggestion??<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance!!<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
En</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks very much for your response, and sorry for my late reply; I just now found time to continue working on this...<br />
<br />
Your solution still has one big problem: <br />
I only want a record printed in case of 'selectempty' on the tcmcs045-query, i.e. if for that warehouse there is no area linked with same name; but what for all those who land in the 'selectdo' section, i.e. there is an area found with same name as warehouse; those will all be printed as well now...<br />
<br />
I cannot use lattr.print = false, because then it will stop the cycle, and not check the remaining warehouses anymore; i.e. it will never hit the layout.again() anymore....<br />
<br />
As you were so nicely on your way to helping me, I'm sure you will find a nice solution to this as well.... ;) <br />
<br />
Thanks again!!<br />

I have a problem while compiling the code with the not exist statement: I get compiler warnings for the after.report.5: after.layout: and for the after.report.10 layouts saying &quot;label 'after.layout' declared but never used&quot;, &quot;label 'after.report.10' declared but never used&quot; and &quot;label 'before.layout' declared buit not used&quot;.

What did you revise? I do not see many changes between your latest code, and the code from before. I don't know why this is, but I keep getting those warnings.<br />

If I delete the 'not exist (select ...)' part, I don't have the warnings. <br />

Lattr.print is set to true on all those layouts.<br />
<br />
During runtime in r.s.after.report.2.bef.lay, the report goes through all the code of section r.s.after.report.2.bef.lay, r.s.after.report.2.aft.lay, and r.s.after.report.3.bef.lay (which is basically till the end of the report script). During runtime Baan does not recognize the last 2 sections, they do not exist at runtime, for they are seen as part of after.report.2.bef.lay, as labels (as quoted on the warnings)....<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if I take section after.report.3.bef.lay, and put it up in the report script, for instance before after.report.1, then I receive only one warning, on the after.report.2.aft.lay, but no warning regarding after.report.3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus, it is very clear, that like I said, the problem is that those sections in the program script are not recognized as seperate sections, but rather seen as kind of labels (???), within the after.report.2.bef.lay section. <br />
<br />
When removing the nested subquery 'where not exist', the problem does not occur.<br />
<br />
I am getting more and more curious...!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
So when u use 'not exist' sub query, the report does not recognize the <br />
sections. Those are treated as part of before layout for after.report.2. <br />
<br />
Very strange.Just try putting all those lines above the  after.report.2.bef.lay<br />
in the report script . Alternatively re-organize the logic so as not to<br />
use the 'not exists' clause.<br />
<br />
U may report this 'not exists' issue to support. <br />

Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Putting the other layout sections above the after.report.2 section in the script itself, indeed solves the issue, yet not the whol eissue, because I need to still have the after.report.2.aft.lay section where I call layout.again(). This I cannot move up, for then I will receive an error saying after.report.2 section already declared....<br />
<br />
To use an alternative method, I couldn't yet think of anything. I unfortunately have never yet worked with dynamic sql. As a matter of fact I always avoided it, for I do not have enough knowledge of it. Maybe now will be a good time to play around with dynamic sql a little. Thanks Lakoon to your suggestions, I will look into it.<br />
<br />
As for reporting the issue to Baan: I have already logged a case by Baan Support a couple of days ago; still haven't received any response from their side...<br />

<br />
as I see there are two things to do: 1) determine the data you like to see on your report and 2) how to get them onto the report.<br />
<br />
part 2) has been discussed by the &quot;loop&quot; consisting of after.report.x and layout.again() combinations.<br />
<br />
part 1) has been tried by different approaches with more ore less tricky ssql statements -- why don't you try my quite simple approach that I posted recently?<br />

<br />
By shifting the code before after.report.2.bef.lay , I did not mean<br />
change in logic . Just change in script arrangement like <br />
<br />
<br />
after.report.3:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	|actual code<br />
after.report.2:<br />
after.layout:<br />
	layout.again()<br />
before.layout:<br />
	|complete code with 'not exists'<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure it helps or not . Suggested this because label error indicates<br />
system does not recognize it as valid layout . This means it's either <br />
treated as continuation of earlier code or the layout does not really exist.<br />

Indeed the code suggested by u will accomplish the results. We just persisted<br />
in the Andreas' approach becasue En had worked lot with that code and I wished<br />
the results to come with that code itself. En should try this code too.<br />
<br />

The code suggested by Gunther &amp; Lakoon are the alternative and <br />
I add more to it with basic structure derived from the code pasted by u.<br />
<br />
<br />
domain tcbool crgexst<br />
select	tcmcs003.*<br />
from	tcmcs003 <br />
where	tcmcs003._index1 &gt; {:creg.cwar}<br />
order by tcmcs003._index1<br />
selectdo<br />
	crgexst = false<br />
	select tcmcs045.*<br />
	from tcmcs045<br />
	where tcmcs045._index1 = {:tcmcs003.cwar}<br />
	selectdo<br />
		crgexst = true<br />
	endselect<br />
	if crgexst then<br />
		continue<br />
	endif<br />
	creg.cwar = tcmcs003.cwar<br />
	| all code to print the correct record in after.report.2.bef.lay<br />
	break<br />
selecteos<br />
          if crgexst then<br />
                 lattr.print = false<br />
          endif<br />
selectempty<br />
	lattr.print = false<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
I know some SQL overhead in it but it's not high considering size of tcmcs tables.</div></div><hr />
