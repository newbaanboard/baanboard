I want to call a session from LN standard Sales order Line session(tdsls4100m000) specific. My requirement is I want to change the appearance of my customized session vlsls4101m000 conditionally. Some times it should open in Detail mode and sometimes it should open ln Overview mode.<br />
<br />
What I have done:<br />
 In the form command of Ln Standard session tdsls4101m000 I am calling my customized session vlsls4101m000. It has two group. One detail is ticked and other overview is ticked. But when ever its called from standard session overview mode only appears. I want to change the view dynamically based on certain condition.<br />
<br />
If anybody has done this kind of things in past, please share your code snippet or ideas and suggestions. It would be a great help to me.<br />
<br />
What I have tried:<br />
<br />
synchronized.reason = 1 or 0 .<br />
I made in before.program: section<br />
But the session always opens in overview mode. In DFE both overview/Detail/Rich view are ticked.<br />
<br />
Alternate Idea:<br />
<br />
Create two separate dedicated session one for detail , one for overview mode. Which would be my last option though sounds odd and redundant.<br />

<br />
If you are calling your customized session from a form command, you can double click the form command and under Execution tab you will find option to select the Start Mode Session and Kind of Session. <br />
<br />
In Kind of Session you can select Details Window. <br />
<br />
Now, in this way, you can create 2 form commands i.e. one for detail mode and other for overview mode. Haven't tried it through script but this works just fine.</div></div><hr />

Its amazing and working perfectly. I have never explored that option and oversighted it. We can move now smoothly.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot. In such case we can avoid creating multiple session.<br />
