<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mick_m</div><div class="date">15th December 2004, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We changed the pc that prints the accounts payable checks from a Windows 98 to a Windows XP system. Now the printing keeps moving down ever so slightly that after 12 -15 checks we have to realign the form back down 1/8th inch. We are using an IBM 6400 printer with continuous form checks and are on Baan IVc. Any ideas would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th December 2004, 05:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure it is not just a worn part on the printer?  Have checked for more current drivers?  What about a new Baan client? I also assume you have compared printer set-up between the old and the new. I assume you are using baan windows printing - which we do not use.  Just thought I would throw out the first couple of things that came to mind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mick_m</div><div class="date">16th December 2004, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your advice. We have another special form that stays right on the money so I don't think it is worn printer parts. I may try using a direct printer and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

Noticed that the font was set to one with 12 cpi so changed it to TT Courier New. That fixed the creeping problem. Thanks to those who made suggestions.</div></div><hr />
