1. You need to find why hrpay0111m001 gets hanged by dbugging your code<br />
2. Try to Run hrpay0111m001 directly thru Run program ttdsk2080m000<br />
3. Do you mean to say that session hrpay0111m001 and subsession hrpay0111s000 are the same ?</div></div><hr />

Because a sub-session will always called by zoom.to (or similar i.e. start.session etc.) you only need to search for Scripts/Librarys.<br />

<br />
Kalyan, if I understand correctly you want to have a way of knowing the parent session of a child session, i.e. knowing from which session a subsession was zoomed to. If this is the case, the best thing is to call the subsession as a zoomsession. Like this you can use the zoom.from sections in the subsession. If you need more help on that, let us know or search the board.<br />
<br />
Besides you have the predefined variables storing information:<br />
'parent': predefined variable containing the session id from the parent session (in the parent session, its id is stored in the variable 'pid'<br />

But how do you plan on programming certain actions if parent = session xxx if you do not have a source? Then you should work with AFS. I.e. you copy the subsession to an AFS version, and like this you can check and control the subprocess...</div></div><hr />
