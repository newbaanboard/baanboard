<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">19th December 2003, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a session that displays a table with a text field.  What I would like to do is display any (well, first 7 lines really) contents of the linked text number on the form like in the session tcedi5105m000.  This session is somehow getting the contents of the text into an array of strings which it then displays... I think that is fine, but... <br />
<br />
How is BAAN doing this?  <br />
<br />
My only thought right now is to read the text number to an ASCII file and then read the ASCII file into the array of fields on the form.  I can do this if I have to, but I am hoping there is a simpler way.<br />
<br />

I played around with a problem like this,<br />
and in a session where you have source code, you can read the text tables directly, and put each record from the text table into temp variables, and then display those variables on your form.<br />
<br />
It is not very nice, but I think it should work.<br />

I am not sure if this is available on your BaaN Version or not. In our version we just have to add a text field into the form and it shows up with text.<br />
<br />
Also refer to the tools function -  set.file.for.textfield() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_text_fields_set_file_for_textfield)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">19th December 2003, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I have &quot;found&quot; a neat function that does exactly what I want.  It is text.to.buf(&quot;ttmmm999.text&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, N, BUF).  Given the name of a text field, it moves N lines into the variable BUF in language L.<br />

PS: I would link this to the library, but I don't know how.  NPRao... how did you do that?</div></div><hr />

You would have to use the tool include in your script -<br />
<br />
#include	&lt;bic_text&gt;<br />
<br />
PS - The online manual on the board is very recent, its more vaid for Reger and Gemini Versions.</div></div><hr />
