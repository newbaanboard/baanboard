<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 14:34</div></div><div class="posttext">So I suggest to format the amount field yourself in a string variable.<br />
I.e:<br />
domain tfgld.amnt  amnt1<br />
domain tcmcs.str15  amnt2<br />
amnt = &quot;$&quot; (or field containing $-symbol) &amp; str$(amnt1)<br />

<br />
Here is KQ extract:<br />
<br />
Example: You wish prices in a specific currency to be registered with two decimal places, and amounts to be presented as whole numbers. Execute the following steps:<br />
a)	Define the currency as generic unit in the session &quot;Maintain Generic Units (ttaad1106m000)&quot;.<br />
b)	Define the currency as application currency in the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot;.<br />
c)	In the session &quot;Maintain Formats by Generic Unit (ttaad1107m000)&quot;, select the format code for prices (003) and link a generic unit to it with a format allowing two decimal places to be specified. Execute the same steps for amounts; link formats without decimals to the format codes for amounts (a.o. 005 and 095).<br />
Consequences: Within the application this will have the following consequences. It will be possible to enter amounts in whole numbers only. Decimals will not be accepted. In calculations, amounts will be rounded to whole numbers. Prices can be entered with up to two decimals. Prices will be calculated to two decimal places.<br />
Note: The currency format system is subject to various limitations. As these are NOT tested by the application, users should be careful to comply with them:<br />
	The currency in the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot; must have the same code as the generic unit in the session &quot;Maintain Generic Units (ttaad1106m000)&quot;.<br />
	When creating a new currency, you should check if the currency is present as a generic unit. You should furthermore check if a generic unit with the right format is available for all relevant format codes.<br />
	In the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot; you can link a rounding factor to each currency (in the field &quot;Rounding Factor&quot;). This will allow you, for instance, to round amounts to multiples of 0.05. This rounding factor is not related to the format (and the degree of rounding resulting from it) recorded in the session &quot;Maintain Formats by Generic Unit (ttaad1107m000)&quot;. Hence, it hardly makes sense to define a rounding factor of 0.01 in the session &quot;Maintain Currencies (tcmcs0102m000)&quot; if currency formats without decimals have been linked to the currency concerned in the session &quot;Maintain Formats by Generic Unit (ttaad1107m000)&quot;. This rounding factor is only used to round amounts (not prices).<br />
