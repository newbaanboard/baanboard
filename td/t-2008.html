Off course this can be done by logging on twice (need more licences!) or changing companies all day.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to pass a company number to a session either from the Baan menubrowser or the Baan desktopbrowser? Or any other trick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">13th May 2002, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have code:<br />
<br />
Copy the session to a new customized session<br />
Put in before.program section:<br />
long new.comp<br />
new.comp=lval(argv$(1))<br />
switch.to.company(new.comp)<br />
<br />
You can execute this new session from menu browser with parameter company number.<br />
<br />
You do not have code:<br />
<br />
Create a new session:<br />
(session.st = session you want to execute in different companies)<br />
<br />
new.comp=lval(argv$(1))<br />
switch.to.company(new.comp)<br />
wait.and.activate(session.st)<br />
<br />
Also you can call this session form menu, execute program...<br />
<br />
<br />
Which method is better you decide. Sometimes if there is a zoom process from a session, the session name that called the zoom process is in the code of this zoom proccess, so if the session name is different, things will not work right.<br />
<br />
You have to try and then decide.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

There is an example there (implies coding).<br />
<br />
Running sessions for multiple companies need to be done thru the normal ways (use multiple BW's, change company within Baan). Since the other options involve coding, this thread is moved to Tools Dev.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you only want to play between two companies and for some sessions, you can use the key map settings. <br />
Nevertheless in which you are playing at present the key map settings always search for the user's starting company from the user masterdata. <br />
E.g. in the user settings he starts with company 601. Beginning of the day he change to 602. When using a key he will get the session from company 601. <br />
Might be a bug, but in our system it is like that. <br />
<br />
