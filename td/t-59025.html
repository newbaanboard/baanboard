<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preethi</div><div class="date">18th August 2010, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
i have gone through the posts containing how to add a session through the 'special' option. I am facing some problem pertaining to the same issue.<br />
<br />
i want to add a session to a standard session for which we don't have the source code. This standard session is already having a session added in its 'special'. I tried creating a menu and adding the existing session and my customized session into it. this menu i added in the 'special'.<br />
When i am running the standard session i couls see both the sessions(existing &amp; customized) in the special option. But what ever i select only the old session which already existed is opening. I think that has been hard coded in the script. <br />
<br />
in this case is there any option where i can activate my customize session through the standard session.<br />
<br />
Any ideas are welcome.<br />
Thanking you in Advance.</div></div><hr />

I recommend creating and convert RDD on the session and forms and menus.  Log out and back in - try again.  Also if you provided the session and sub-session name maybe someone could look and confirm if it is hardcoded somewhere..</div></div><hr />

This may not be hard coded always.<br />
In some case zoom sessions could depend upon parameter settings <br />
or It could be maintained in master data, like for Maintain transaction sessions, which are specified in master data &quot;Maintain Transaction Type&quot;<br />
If you can post the session names, it will be helpful in analyzing you problem.<br />
<br />
However, in case it was hard coded in  program script, there is another way, a bit complex and unorthodox method, to change the zoom session without making changes in standard script.<br />
(I have tried this solution once when we faced a similar problem. We did not have program script of main session and wanted to control the zoom session which opened on Continue button.)<br />
What you can do is: <br />
(Assuming old session which opened on zoom:tfacp1120s000)<br />
1. Copy the old he session to you development VRC with different name.<br />
    for eg, old session was tfacp1120s000, copy it to tfacp1210stmp.<br />
    Make sure that it still has links to original forms/script/reports, so that if works exactly same as original one.<br />
2. Create a new program script in your development VRC. Lets name it as zzabc0000<br />
    In section before.program, write following code:<br />
|* Start of code<br />
before.program:<br />
if &lt;condition&gt; then<br />
zoom.to$(&quot;tfacp1120stmp&quot;,Z.SESSION,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,0)<br />
else<br />
zoom.to$(&quot;xxabc9999s000&quot;,Z.SESSION,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,0)<br />
||* Assuming xxabc9999s000 is your customized session<br />
 endif<br />
 end()<br />
|* End of code<br />
<br />
Also define all form fields in declaration section of the script<br />
<br />
3. Copy old session to development VRC with same name. But do not copy any other object linked to the session. In development VRC, link program script zzabc0000, which was created in step 2, to the session tfacp1120s000<br />
 <br />
How this works:<br />
When session tfacp1120s000 opens after zoom, it works with the program script zzabc000. In before.program, as we put the logic of selecting zoom session, depending upon the condition it will open either old or new customized session. Note that, as we have written code in before.program, tfacp1120s000 will not be visible, instated only tfacp1120stmp or xxabc9999s000 will appear for user.<br />
<br />
But, this method looks too complex. So, use this if it is very much required to have customized session, and you really don't have any other option.</div></div><hr />
