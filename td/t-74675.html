I usually use the sequence number since it increments, but this times the line number does not increment normally. (Firstline has 1, second line has 4). What is the syntax for referring to line with index 1, or index 2 and so on?:confused::confused:</div></div><hr />

less information, do not know what you want to achieve, maybe the following helps:<br />
<br />
<br />
Predefined variables<br />
You can use the following predefined variables in a report script. <br />
<br />
R = read-only     R/W = read and write<br />
<br />
lattr.autobefores R/W A boolean indicating whether or not before.field layouts are automatically repeated at the top of a page if the page break does not correspond with a sort break. The default value is true.  <br />
lattr.autoreset R/W A boolean indicating whether or not Report script functions is automatically performed in the case of breaks of layouts in sorting fields. The default value is true.  <br />
lattr.break R A boolean that is set to true during printing of before.field layouts when the layout is printed as the result of a sort field change. It is set to false when a before.field layout is printed because of a page break.  <br />
lattr.enddata R A boolean indicating whether or not the end of the data has been reached.  <br />
lattr.header R A boolean that is set to true during printing of header layouts and during printing of before.field layouts at the top of a page.  <br />
lattr.language$ R The language code of the report. <br />
lattr.lineno R The current line number. <br />
lattr.multicol R/W Indicates whether or not multiple columns are used when more than one layout fits on a line. Possible values are: <br />
<br />
MULTICOL_NONE<br />
<br />
Normal output; no columns are used.<br />
<br />
MULTICOL_ORDER_HORIZONTAL<br />
<br />
Output is arranged in multiple columns, ordered horizontally. For example: <br />
<br />
rec_1    rec_2    rec_3<br />
<br />
rec_4    rec_5    rec_6<br />
<br />
MULTICOL_ORDER_VERTICAL<br />
<br />
Output is arranged in multiple columns, ordered vertically (per page). For example: <br />
<br />
rec_1    rec_3    rec_5<br />
<br />
rec_2    rec_4    rec_6<br />
 <br />
lattr.multicol.count R/W Specifies the number of columns to use when multiple columns are specified (see lattr.multicol). The default value is 0. In this case, the report manager calculates the number of columns based of the report width and the layout width.  <br />
lattr.multicol.repeat R/W A boolean indicating whether headers and footers are automatically repeated for each column. The default value is true. The width of the header and footer layouts width must be equal to or less than the width of the detail layout.  <br />
lattr.pageno R/W Current page number. <br />
lattr.print R/W Indicates whether or not a layout is to be printed.  <br />
lattr.prline R/W After expansion of a variable in a report, this is filled with the text line that is printed.  <br />
lattr.recordtimes R/W Indicates the number of times the layout will be printed.  <br />
lattr.textexpand R/W A boolean indicating whether or not variables included in text fields can be expanded. The default is false.  <br />
lattr.textlang$ R/W The language code for printing text. The default is the language code of the report.  <br />
lattr.textline R A string containing the source text line from the text manager.  <br />
lattr.textlineno R The number of the line that must be printed. <br />
lattr.textlines.max R/W The maximum number of lines in the layout. <br />
