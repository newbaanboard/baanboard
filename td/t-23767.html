<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">16th April 2005, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to put output to a color printer when certain conditions appear in the input. My use would be for a report about activities in the moth. For example, with calendaring where in the header, the days of the month show in landscape legal, I would want to show the Weekends in color, and the holidays in another. I would also like to show (with some background), when an entry has a condition that persists for several days. A example of a condition is a time and attendance report where I could show vacation absence in one color, union activity absence in a second, illness in a third, and so forth.<br />
<br />
I would also like to know if there are examples available for doing the same on window displays. I have an application where information on the display has to change as some critical value is reached (Green, Yellow, Red).<br />
<br />
Our version is Baan 4C4 Standard <br />
<br />
Any examples would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Do you have sources? If you have the source, then you just write something like this:<br />
if &lt;conditions for color printing are met&gt; then<br />
brp.open(&quot;reportname&quot;, &quot;colourprintername&quot;, 0)<br />
else<br />
brp.open(&quot;reportname&quot;, &quot;black&amp;whiteprintername&quot;, 0)<br />

Good luck!<br />

To be able to have colours on baan gui forms you have to work with graphical elements which you are placing on the form.<br />
<br />
I'll provide an example (can't get it right now) .. got it.<br />
<br />
/lakoon<br />

|Defenition of graphical element<br />
<br />
	gc.id = create.object(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 05:25</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the requirements I have is a horizontal layout with squares, 31 of them, representing a month. I need to color the squares corresponding to weekends, and holidays.<br />
<br />
I know I can set up variables that would turn colours on, and would also control intensity. That data is instream data to a colour printer. <br />
<br />
I was hoping for some easy native Baan printer support for color, with the ability to change colors dynamically.<br />
