Am trying to do aggregation based on parent child relationship within the same table and updating. For example, there are 2 fields in every record indicating current order and parent order. I need to go bottom up until the BoM ends. Then pickup next record I get as I descend the index. <br />
What is the correct approach to this. Querying through same table and updating is resulting in unpredictable results. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always used the typical Baan bom explosion using some fields to track where you were in exploding the bom.  I always had them give me the top item and then started working thru that bill of material exploding each level as a went.  I never really aggregated anything because we could export the bill to excel and if they wanted to know how many of a buy part like a screw was used to make some end item, they could just filter and total.</div></div><hr />

This is now fixed. Thanks for your reply, Mark.</div></div><hr />
