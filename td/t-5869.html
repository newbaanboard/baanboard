I need to print barcodes through BaaN IV. The OS is Windows NT. The documents that I have gone through talk about some barcode directory and printinf file. But, none of them is available on my system. Is it that these files/directories are required for UNIX only? If no, then from where to get them?<br />
Waiting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klesch</div><div class="date">18th July 2002, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly suggest you to print barcodes using bwprint functionality.<br />
<br />
A good document exists that covers this well. I will try to find it for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carice</div><div class="date">18th July 2002, 10:47</div></div><div class="posttext">- First of all file dbocx32.ocx must be installed in path c:\baan\bin\dbocx32.ocx<br />
<br />
- This ocx must be registered ; <br />
regsvr32 c:\baan\bin\dbocx32.ocx<br />
<br />
- start bwprint and do the barcodetest from helpmenu.<br />
If you see barcodes; ocx is installed and registered.<br />
Now you have to couple a barcodefont to a fonttype.<br />
<br />
- In your reports; you have to set the font to that specifiek font for the fields that must be printed as barcode.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help you.<br />
<br />
PS: I just posted a thread; maybe you can help me!!</div></div><hr />

I have gone through the guide mentioned by you. Thanks. I have been able to print the barcode. But, can you explain me the following syntax, from the guide -<br />
<br />
p.barcode = chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp; &quot;E#%&quot; &amp; &quot;Q5412&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, it is the &quot;Q5412&quot; thing that is confusing me.<br />
I have printed the barcode for the production order #, having only one digit. I replaced &quot;E#%&quot; with &quot;E#!&quot;.<br />
The other doubt I have is that does BaaN prints only linear barcodes only or the 2-D and 3-D barcodes also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klesch</div><div class="date">18th July 2002, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Q5412 is the value that has to be printed as barcode. There are several standards for printing barcodes and some of them support alpha characters as well.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure, but I think that only linear barcodes are supported. Will someone correct me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">19th July 2002, 08:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
That's exactly what I was thinking about. But, when I execute the session, then I get only &quot;Q&quot; written under the barcode. So, the barcode is generated probably only for &quot;Q&quot; and not the complete string!! Got to work on that too. Also, tell me how to print a number of fields in barcode. Like, if i want to have a barcode having the following values -<br />
<br />
Item Code, Supplier Code, Purchase Price, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klesch</div><div class="date">19th July 2002, 10:22</div></div><div class="posttext">You get only one character becase you replaced &quot;E#%&quot; with &quot;E#!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;E&quot; means that barcode type is Code 39.<br />
<br />
&quot;#&quot; means the height of 3 characters<br />
<br />
&quot;%&quot; means that the input string's length is 5 characters. (&quot;!&quot; means 1.)<br />
<br />
See tables on page 3 of the document I've posted. Everything will be clear instantly.<br />
<br />
If you want to print itemcode as a barcode (Code 39) then the following code should be used<br />
<br />
<br />
p.barcode = chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp; &quot;E#0&quot; &amp; tiitm001.item<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that this helps you.</div></div><hr />

I understand what you say, and I also understand what the document says. But, I am still unable to see the barcode in the preview mode. I would like you to see my code. Please give me your mail id so that I can mail you the dump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klesch</div><div class="date">19th July 2002, 12:46</div></div><div class="posttext">My email address is klesch@its.si. But I will not be able to help you until 5th of August. I'm starting my vacation today.<br />
<br />
By the way: Did you install dbocx32.ocx?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">19th July 2002, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the .ocx file has been registered. Also, I have been able to print the barcode. I had to increase the report field length.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
