If this solution can meet your expectation:<br />
In your fields on.input event ,you can do one thing, start the session using start session/zoom.to$ and provide there session type MODAL/ MODLESS. and kill your session.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Now the user wants all the details by Project Wise. So i have created the view field as Project. And in the detail section, all price lists are there, cost price, sales price etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now he wants to see the details by Project and Parent BOQ wise. Parent BOQ is an entity under project. A Project can have multiple Parent BOQ under it. Now the thing is Parent BOQ is not in the index field. And even if i include it under index field, i would have to restart the session, wouldnt i have to?</div></div><hr />

In my case .. just to upload the data from excel ..using mingle. ( all data - no just the data related to view fields. ) .. so instead of a new session . just had a toggle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not familiar with the Tools system of BAAN LN. They may have better flexibility than BAAN IV c3.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I would almost think that they could not have disturbed the foundation of the 'standard program' because when a type 3 session is generated (or any type for that matter), the generator EXPECTS the index to be defined at the DATABSE level - that is what allows us to choose how many fields of an index are the view fields and how many in the detail.<br />
<br />
(As far as I have understood your requirement) In terms of how I would do this (maybe you have the code and license that will allow to do this):<br />
<br />
- Session 1 - type 2 session - display project level data<br />
<br />
- sub-session 2 - type 3 session - on selection of the project in session 1, zoom to the sub-session to display the details by BOQ ( assuming that this field is also part of the index at the database level - if not, consider possibility of adding it - but that will need some amount of impact analysis, so something else does not 'break')</div></div><hr />

How did you handle the type 3 form navigation? Or did it just work by standard program logic?</div></div><hr />

Works by standard session logic.  Each tab is a separate subsession. So basically when you click on a tab it executes another sub-session.  Then if you are in that sub-session and click on a different tab - the subsession ends, returns to the main-session and then calls the next sub-session.  This beast was designed so you could pick a part - then go to different places and see what it says for inventory and peg.  And if necessary you can update a few fields to so the part quantity is balanced across all the tables.</div></div><hr />

Can you share how you achieved this please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th December 2016, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">So each session has the same 7 forms - so all the session point to the same forms.  And yes some are type 1's and some are type 3's.  So lets take form 5 - maintain items.  Besides the normal session code for its table the parent session code is:<br />
<br />
form.5:<br />
before.form:<br />
	chld.proc = wait.and.activate(&quot;tifix0101s00a&quot;)<br />
	check.return.from.sessions()<br />
	to.form(some.form)<br />
functions:<br />
function check.return.from.sessions()<br />
{<br />
	import(&quot;some.form&quot;,some.form)<br />
	import(&quot;abrt.code&quot;,abrt.code)<br />
	if abrt.code&gt;0 then<br />
		execute(end.program)<br />
	endif<br />
	import(&quot;zoom.cprj&quot;,ticpr951.cprj)<br />
	import(&quot;zoom.item&quot;,ticpr951.item)<br />
	import(&quot;zoom.mbcs&quot;,ticpr951.mbcs)<br />
	ticpr951.item = zoom.item<br />
	ticpr951.cprj = zoom.cprj<br />
	ticpr951.mbcs = zoom.mbcs<br />
	ticpr951.trdt = 0<br />
	execute(find.data)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
So now the subsession tifix0101s00a is activated.  <br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
before.form:<br />
	set.exit.variables()<br />
	<br />
init.form:<br />
	to.form(5)<br />
<br />
form.2:<br />
before.form:<br />
	set.exit.variables()<br />
	<br />
form.3:<br />
before.form:<br />
	set.exit.variables()<br />
	<br />
form.4:<br />
before.form:<br />
	set.exit.variables()<br />
	<br />
form.5:<br />
init.form:<br />
	max_window()<br />
	import(&quot;ticpr951.item&quot;,ticpr951.item)<br />
	import(&quot;ticpr951.cprj&quot;,ticpr951.cprj)<br />
	import(&quot;ticpr951.mbcs&quot;,ticpr951.mbcs)<br />
	tiitm001.item = ticpr951.item<br />
	execute(find.data)<br />
<br />
form.6:<br />
before.form:<br />
	set.exit.variables()<br />
	<br />
form.7:<br />
before.form:<br />
	set.exit.variables()<br />
	<br />
|****************************** field section *********************************<br />
field.ticpr951.item:<br />
before.display:<br />
	get.all.totals()<br />
|****************************** choice section ********************************	<br />
choice.end.program:<br />
before.choice:<br />
	abrt.code = 1<br />
	export(&quot;abrt.code&quot;,abrt.code)<br />
	exit()<br />
	<br />
choice.abort.program:<br />
before.choice:<br />
	abrt.code = 2<br />
	export(&quot;abrt.code&quot;,abrt.code)<br />
	exit()<br />
functions:<br />
function set.exit.variables()<br />
{<br />
	abrt.code = 0<br />
	some.form = form.curr<br />
	export(&quot;some.form&quot;,some.form)<br />
	export(&quot;abrt.code&quot;,abrt.code)<br />
	zoom.item = ticpr951.item<br />
	zoom.cprj = ticpr951.cprj<br />
	zoom.mbcs = ticpr951.mbcs<br />
	export(&quot;zoom.item&quot;,zoom.item)<br />
	export(&quot;zoom.cprj&quot;,zoom.cprj)<br />
	export(&quot;zoom.mbcs&quot;,zoom.mbcs)<br />
	exit()<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what I did not post is some of the code for the normal session use.  Which was not a whole lot - I only allowed certain fields to be modified - mainly quantity fields.<br />
<br />
library code - <br />
<br />
function extern max_window()<br />
{<br />
	long My.Win<br />
	My.Win = current.mwindow()<br />
	change.object(My.Win,DsNx,0,DsNy,0)<br />
	update.object(My.Win)<br />
}</div></div><hr />
