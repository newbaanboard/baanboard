<br />
For example, I want to start my document with label &quot;Picking list&quot; always in the middle of the page.<br />
<br />
I've positioned the label &quot;Picking list&quot; on the middle in Report designer (see attachment 1).<br />
But one the actual report (printing to device D) the text &quot;Picking list&quot; is sometimes in the center, sometimes shifted left or right, depening on the data that comes after the header layout (longer strings, shorter strings, causing change in the grid layout while rendering the PDF). (see attachment 2, 3)<br />
<br />
Is there some posibility or option in designer to have a label always printed in the center or the page, no matter what the data lenght is in the other layouts?</div></div><hr />

The 2 screen shots with the barcodes almost looks like they have a different font.</div></div><hr />

Did you try moving the data into different layout?<br />

<br />
oirfeodent, I tried moving the &quot;Picking list&quot; into new layout, still the same result<br />
<br />
Attachments; previews with grid on, because of the longer/shorter strings in the columns, everything just gets shifted to the right/left. I guess that's how PDF rendering works in LN. It calculates positions based on the data width.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th July 2019, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you put like the order number and barcode in its own layout?  It almost looks like the whole report is adjusted based off the amount of data in the field being printed.  I was expecting like the description to look the same length between the 2 screen shots.</div></div><hr />

I've tried moving everything into seperate layouts, but nothing changes. I still get shifted heading, depening on the longest/shortest column. Looks like PDF converter calculates grid/column positions based on data width on every layout and changes the grid size accordingly (&lt;= LN 10.6). <br />
<br />
Looking at the 10.7 documentation for Report designer I can see mentions of &quot;exact positioning&quot; and &quot;fixed length&quot;, looks like this feature is new, starting in 10.7:<br />
<br />
Grid columns have fixed widthIf a font size is specified for a field, it may be that the field content does not fit in the reserved area.Normally the PDF converter then resizes columns to ensure that fields do not overlap and arepositioned in the correct relative order.If this check box is selected, the converter does not resize columns, but only draws the text. Thismakes the layout more predictable when the font size is changed, at the risk of overlapping fields.This property is not available if the report uses exact positioning.<br />
