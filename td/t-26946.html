<br />
after I changed an enum domain (I changed some descriptions and added some enum fields), I get problems in my reports.<br />
The description of the new enum fields is not printed. An empty string is printed instead, although the table field is filled with the correct enum number (tested in debugger).<br />
In &quot;General Table Maintenance&quot; the enum description is shown correctly too.<br />
<br />
I should note, that I did a &quot;Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary&quot; (ttadv5215s000) with &quot;Domains&quot;, &quot;Tables&quot; and &quot;Reconfigure Tables&quot; options checked, after changing the enum domain.<br />
<br />
Temporary I solved this problem by using enum.descr$(..) manually in one report. But I think this is not a good solution, because I don't want to change all my reports the enum domain is used in.<br />
<br />
Kind regards...<br />

Make sure the field length on the report is big enough to hold the field.  In one case where a domain stopped working I had to edit the report, pull up the field, then save everything and recompile to get it to work.  I did not make any changes to the report, but a simple re-compile would not work.  The report worked after just pulling up the report field, saving and recompiling.  Never had this happen to a bunch of reports - but here and there I have had quirky problems like this.</div></div><hr />

Of course!<br />
<br />
Make sure the field length on the report is big enough to hold the field.<br />
Hmmm... that is a point, I will check. But normally it is not a problem, if the report field is less then the enum string field (or vise versa). In my experience the enum describtion is cut in this case.[/QUOTE]<br />

I actually removed the field (in one report!) and recreated it. But with no success. Maybe I try this with all reports, the enum domain is used in.<br />

I will report the results. Thanks for the tips...<br />

ttadv504 and commit  by using  SQL .<br />
