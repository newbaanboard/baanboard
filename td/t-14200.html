<br />
I am facing a problem and would be looking forward to the forum to provide me some solution.  I have to upload the data to some of the tables by reading from text files.  Now the problem is the reference errors that I am getting while uploading the data because the transaction tables are being uploaded before the tables containing master data.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to disable the referential integrity constraints, in the same way we do in &quot;Create Table from Sequential Dump&quot;, while uploading data thru BaaN Script that contains db.insert() or db.update() <br />

Well I guess you could go into all the tables and remove all references to it - not a good idea.  I must ask why are you loading transactions before loading the master tables? Is it possible for you to load master tables first?<br />

<br />
One thing I have done in the past is create 'staging' tables for importing.  The staging table has the same fields as the destination table, but has no references and has everthing in string format.  <br />
<br />
You can run the import to the staging tables.  Then fill your tables from the staging tables when ready.  The staging tables will accept just about anything an ascii file can throw at you, and you can validate from there, removing records as they are succesfully put into the final table.<br />
<br />
Alternately, you have seen the path to a more complex solution.  You can turn the ref. integrity off during a seq. load, and really all the seq. load is is an ascii file.  You can make your file the same format as the seq. load is expecting, and use that.</div></div><hr />
