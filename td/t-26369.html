That may help someone else in the future.  As it is I do not work with importing/exporting the data dictionary.</div></div><hr />

If you want to export complete datadictionary then you need not to worried about , just take the VRC and press continue. This will create the dump at your desired path.<br />
<br />
Remember if u create dump for any particular components always click on export based on option and select parent vrc into compare with VRC field.<br />
