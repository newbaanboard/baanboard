As far as what you need to set up I am not sure.  All I did on my sun server at my site was to put a entry in the NIS hosts file pointing to the mailhost at the other site.  I think the entry was just the IP address and mailhost.  I will check tomorrow at work.<br />
<br />
I know there is some work setting one up as a mailhost(not sure what), but I think you just have to setup your box to point to the other as the mailhost.  Not an expert and this and I only pretend to be a sys admin at my site. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th January 2004, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I can find that I added was this:<br />
<br />
xx.x.x.x    mailhost<br />
<br />
into the hosts file.  I could not find any changes anywhere else.  I just pointed my server to the mailhost they have up north.<br />

<br />
although we have HP-UX instead of your Solaris, I guess that you also have a sendmail.cf file on your machine (/etc, /etc/mail or so), and that sendmail itself might be the transport program that is called by mailx itself.<br />
<br />
So, you could have a look at 'man sendmail', and you should define your mail server as &quot;smart relay host&quot;; all mail that cannot be delivered locally (user a on machine mail server sends a mail to user b on that machine) is given to that machine -- just one level up -- and maybe that machine gives it to &quot;the internet&quot; and so on.<br />
