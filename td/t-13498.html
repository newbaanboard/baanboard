Hi all, my company always have strange request and I am wondering if this is a do-able thing.<br />
<br />
They would like to scrap a list of pre-defined Item number<br />
They would like to:<br />
1. Have someone (other than me) to create a list of Item that needs to be scrap<br />
2. Automate session tdinv1101m000 Enter Inventory ransaction by Item so that it can scrap those Item within the list (Automate meaning to read off that list and do the following in this session)<br />
e.g. change the Trans. Type to Inventory Adj<br />
change the Delivered Qty<br />
change the reason code<br />
<br />
Please please help.<br />
<br />

Click here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7251)  for a post with the start of discussions and link to a Baan doc on that type of programming.  There is a whole forum devoted to this method, so ask questions there if you need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have used cycle count orders to do things like this before,<br />
<br />
1)<br />
Create an exchange scheme based on tdilc501 (assuming location control).<br />
<br />
2)<br />
Export out some sample records, after you have :<br />
- generated cycle count orders<br />
- printed cycle count orders<br />
- entered cycle counting data (setting counted inventory equal to zero).<br />
<br />
3)<br />
Based on your list of items, create (in Excel for instance) a flat file that has the same format as your sample records.<br />
<br />
4)<br />
Load using Baan exchange.<br />
<br />
5)<br />
Print Cycle count check report to validate impact.<br />
<br />
6)<br />
Process cycle count orders, which actually adjusts the inventory.<br />
<br />
If you have used Baan exchange before, this is relatively easy, <br />
1-3 hours work, depending on the data to be uploaded.<br />
