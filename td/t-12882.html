<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bvallepalli</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to print a report which has Company logo and some footer information with other details. The report footer is not printed when output is sent to printer. It is shown if the output is displayed on screen. I am not using any user fonts for Footer information.<br />
<br />
If I remove company logo from layouts which is user defined font, Footer information is printed perfect.<br />
<br />
What is blocking this? There is no print condition as well. I am using Baan5.c.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure our user defined font (which prints the logo) would work anywhere other than the first field on the first layout of the report.  The first thing the report script does is a &quot;lp&quot; command to send the logo to the report.  I guess I could add in a foot section on the script, but I am not sure it would work.  I am not a printer guru and am not familiar with the HP PCL language.  Is this how your user defined font works?  Is it expecting something to be sent for this font and not receiving it?<br />
<br />
Just some guesses.<br />

The company logo is the very first layout. Footer information is in a different layout under footer section. This user font which used for company logo printing is not used anywhere else either in this report or other reports.<br />
<br />
If I copy the footer information to after.report layout, it prints fine!!<br />
<br />
Somehow the Company logo (this is in before.field layout) doesn't like any footer information  while printing??<br />
<br />
To mention again, I am not using any user defined fonts for Footer information.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 06:18</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are printing the logo in the footer, just check that there is enough room at the bottom of the page... What could be happening, is that the footer has a need of 1 line, but the logo (even though the field on the footer is only taking one line), may require multiple lines...<br />
<br />
Either check the 'Need' column of the Footer layout in 'Maintain Report Layouts' or check the report script to see if there is a 'need' or 'skip.to' function. If not, try setting the 'need' column of your layout to a few extra lines...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 06:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I've re-read your request (so may have posted incorrectly). If I have it right; you are using a company logo at the beginning of the report and if you have footer info, the logo doesn't print. But if you move the footer info to an after.report layout, the logo prints. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
If so, why not keep the info in the after.report layout and use the skip.to function in the report script, so that this info prints at the bottom of the page (although, the issue with this, is that you wont get the layout printing on each page).<br />
<br />
Have you tried using a different 'first layout' to print the company logo (ie: a header instead of a before layout, with the header conditioned on lattr.break, so that it only prints in sort changes, which is similar to a before layout)...</div></div><hr />

Ruskin has the solutionl. If you were to open the the temporary file in the ${BSE_TMP} folder on your local client using a text editor instead of BWPrint, you will see that the footer line is still present. The logo must be taking up more than one line, and Baan continues to count it as one.<br />
<br />
Adjust the number of lines for the footer to be a greater value than you currently have.</div></div><hr />

I tried all the possible combinations of copying Company logo to header and Footer information to Detail and print it based on some condition. The wierd thing is I see footer information when displyed on the screen (as company logo is not shown in display) but not when printed on to printer.<br />
<br />
Last option will be to print this information forcefully as suggested by you.<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't see footer info even in print preview, the bottom line is I see either of them but not both. I have even tried giving extra width to Footer but of no success. I guess there is something wrong with some font settings? Well I will check out in temp folder and let you know if I found some clue.<br />
<br />
Well I thought you changed your track away from Baan?</div></div><hr />
