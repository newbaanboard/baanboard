<br />
I have create many SQL Query reprots, When we excute query. If our client use the chinese language, then there is a error, &quot;report doesn't exist&quot;. if we use english language, there is no problem.<br />
Why we can't use the chinese language?<br />

<br />
1. Use the session maintain reports to determine whether the particular report(s) exist(s) for the chinese language. If not conduct step 3.<br />
<br />
2. Ensure that your current VRC is set to that of the relevant report and compile it.<br />
<br />
3. Create the relevant report(s) for the chinese language.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">24th July 2003, 11:15</div></div><div class="posttext">When you create a report, normally you have to create first in the std language (2 = english), then copy to the other language you use (in your case o = chinese). <br />
Doing this, you have two options: <br />
1) link the report to the language 2 - this means that both the reports have the same structure, changing one in one language reflects the changes in the other.<br />
2) don't link to the other language - this means that both the reports can be different and you have to maintain them separately.<br />
<br />
In both cases, you have to compile the report in the language 2 and in the language o. <br />
You can have the report message if you haven't compiled the report in language o.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some wild thoughts:<br />
Language Chinese is not properly installed... you say it is installed (leaving out the &quot;properly&quot; part).<br />
The report is not allowed in Chinese, so there must be a reason. It may be that the report does not contain multibyte fields, some language dependent report parts are not present in language Chinese.<br />
<br />
Have you tried to copy the report with session ttadv6200m000?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">31st July 2003, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just find this kind of problem... there is somewhere a session on which you have to state the languages. <br />
I guess (really I don't remember exactly)  that session is the &quot;Maintain Languages to Deliver by Package&quot; ttiex0101m000 (You can found this session in Tools-Software Distribution-Master Data).<br />
Try experiment with it...</div></div><hr />
