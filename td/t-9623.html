<br />
I have a report with Report Size= 'A4-SMALL'.<br />
I want to change the Report Size to 'A4-LANDSCAPE'.<br />
Can I change this or do I have to create a new report and copy contents of the old report?<br />

If it is a standard report, and you are not able to change the size, then you have to copy the standard report in your &quot;live&quot; VRC, and then change the size.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used the session ttadv3130s000 to change the size and I compiled the session. The current options are replaced by the new ones. The new Page Width is now 188.<br />
I opened the report layouts and I wanted to change the page width by using 'Form &gt; Resize Window', but the maximum page width I can get is still just 136 characters...<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

From your signature file, it shows that you are from Barco. I think they are also Reger customers.<br />
<br />
So you can choose the paper type in the select the landscape/postscript/portrait - Paper type option when you choose a printer.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, when you choose the preview, the report output can be viewed with the BWPrint where you can change the orientation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are using Reger BaanIV.<br />
I know I can choose the paper type when I'm choosing a printer, but that's not the problem. The problem is situated earlier:<br />
I want to add a new label in my report layout, but I can not resize the Window, so I can not add this label, because I don't have the place for it.<br />
<br />
I just created a new report and copied the content of the old report in the new report. Now I can resize the window. A parameter was wrong in the old report, I guess...<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway,<br />
