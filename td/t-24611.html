In Baan 5, are the functions and DLLs (in Baan 4) still used?<br />
or these are also written in the DALs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th July 2005, 00:10</div></div><div class="posttext">There are tons of regular dll's still, as well as functions.  Many functions have been moved to dll's but not all.<br />
<br />
In fact, they have made another entire layer of regular DLL's.  Many calls to a dll in another package must first talk through each packages Integration DLL's.   For example, to call a Warehouse library (wh package) from the Sales Order (td package) script, they have introducted this layer:<br />
 <br />
td code calls the function from an Integration Library of TD to WHINH (tdintdllwhinh)<br />
<br />
the Integration Library of TD to WHINH calls the integration Library for WH to TD SLS (whintdlltdsls)<br />
<br />
The Integration Library of WH to TDSLS calls the WH library function needed, and passes the results back along the integration chain.<br />
<br />
In this way they can make the packages more separate, connected only at the integration library points.  That's a plus, but it sure makes debugging nutty :P</div></div><hr />

say for example: currency conversions.<br />
we use function for currency conversions in baan 4. how is it handled in baan 5?</div></div><hr />

I just came across this thread and it caught my attention as it has some thing that is related to dll structures and dll design concept. This dlls structure looks very interesting to me as it is an attempt to reduce the dependencies among the packages and modules and make them more organized and formal. I can understand how much it can be helpful in maintenance point of view<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm very curious and interested to know about the BAAN (LN) design. It my field of interest. Although I have been working with Baan for some time, but still I have lot of Baan design and architecture related question that unanswerable, neither i can find any helping document in this regards. I have a lot of questions like how different packages are organized, how the dlls are structured and which design pattern are implemented in baan design? <br />
<br />
Is there any guy who can help me in this or can some body tell me if there is any detailed documentation available regarding this.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance.<br />
