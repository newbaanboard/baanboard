<br />
I'm new to LN Programming.  I want to read a record one by one from the baan table by mentioned the record number  like in  MySQL &quot;select *from employee limit 2,1&quot; which read the second record only.  Similarly can you please let me know that how to read a particular record in the baan table by mentioned the record number.<br />

But if I new I needed exactly 2 records I could use something like this:<br />
<br />
select tccom010.*<br />
from tccom010<br />
where tccom010.emno &gt;0<br />
as set with 2 rows<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Just doing this I know the last set of tccom010 fields will have second record.  I never really code something like so this is just for example.  I do as set with, but usually to get the last record(or first) for a given set of criteria.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I want to read the record one by one from the source table and also need to store it some another table.   So can you please tell me how to read the record one by one without mentioned any condition in where clause until the end of record is reached...<br />
Thanks...<br />

<br />
           In Baan Sql,limit and offset function are not there while writing Sql query.<br />
           so if you want read record and also offset some record like in query you offset in 1 record.you can do this like below<br />
<br />
select tdpur400.orno<br />
from tdpur400<br />
selectdo<br />
|it will loop all record in table<br />
|          select other table<br />
            select tdpur401.orno,tdpur401.pono<br />
            from tdpur401<br />
            selectdo<br />
            endselect<br />
selecteos<br />
|end of search after looping all record this section will executed.<br />
endselect<br />
use as set with n rows to limit recordset.<br />
offsetting the recordset can be done in selectdo section.but no direct function available.</div></div><hr />
