<br />
We are investigating the option to extend the domain of tiitm in b40_c4. <br />
The number of positions of the item number in standard BAAN is too short as we want to incorporate longer manufacturers' item numbers. <br />
We are still in the implementation phase. We would like to know if any of you came accross a similar issue and how you resolved this. <br />
Of course we are aware of Alternative Items but feel that this offers only limited functionality to us. <br />
<br />
We also learnt that there should be an existing BAAN extension available that would cover this issue. Especially in the Automotive industry companies will be dealing with long manufacturers' item numbers. <br />
<br />
Regards, <br />

we had to check all the forms/reports and make sure the new field length did not extend into another field.  Other than that  it is straight foward. - maybe check any hard coded use of the old field length in exchange schemes/interfaces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me Baan provided something for us to run at installation time to convert the item length from 16 to 32.  That was back in 99, so I can not really remember.  I looked through the setup and it seems to be 32 in all the baan layers.  I do know that we fixed a few reports and displays for the users, but not many.  It has been too long since we did this.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">20th May 2002, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We increased the &quot;tcitem&quot; domain to 25; conver to RTDD. <br />
<br />
It changes all the table fields that are connected with the &quot;tcitem&quot; domain. Also all forms that can accomodated the increase in item field length. Otherwise you have to manually fix the forms.<br />
<br />
Reports do a &quot;Global compilation of reports&quot;. As long as the layout accomodates the increase in legth it will convert otherwise you have to manually fix reports as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SevalUcar</div><div class="date">20th May 2002, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We've done similar in BaaN IVc.3. You are in BaaN IVc.4, but  we think that same funcionality should exist in IVc4.<br />
<br />
Try this.<br />
<br />
Use ttgfd4121m000 session. Read helps of this session first and take your backup ...   In this session you can extent  &quot;any&quot; domain.<br />
<br />
After extention of the domain you should  &quot;handle&quot; all your related report and forms....<br />
<br />
You can also look at BaaN Support Knowladge Base to see the related solution. Use &quot;extended field&quot;  keyword to search...<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
