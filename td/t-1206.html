<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jeanbean</div><div class="date">1st March 2002, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: <br />
I would like to make the t_creg and t_crep fields mandatory in tccom1101m000.  I thought I would be able to do this by running ttadv3100m000 (Maintain Forms) and going to ttadv3101s000 (Maintain Form Fields) and just putting a check mark next to &quot;Mandatory&quot;, but BaaN will not allow me to do so.  Maybe this is because these two are both table fields?  So I then thought I might need to make the change via ttadv4127s000 (Maintain Table Fields) but that doesn't seem to work.<br />
I am not a Tools person and I might be in over my head here, but if there is an easy way to do this I sure would like to give it a shot.  I run many reports (via MS Access) that use these two fields and blank entries are causing me grief.  <br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

When setting a field on the form as mandatory, it uses the domain checks to see what is valid.  In the case of tccom010.creg it is already mandatory on our system, but the domain allows blanks.  So maybe if you change the domain it will take care of your problem.  I would look at a few other domains to see how Baan does it.<br />
<br />
Of course when I want a field as mandatory I always add a check.input to make sure it is not blank.  Just my preference.<br />

Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">1st March 2002, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, there is a flag in the 'Maintain Fields' option of 'Maintain Table Definition' session that allows you to declare the field as 'mandatory' or not. You would need to do a good impact analysis, because once you change this flag, the maintain session will demand that the field be input.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would do as Mark suggests though: add a 'check.input' test for the field being empty. It is usually less painful, especially if you are sure that there is ONLY ONE session where the field is being input. (The table definition change is more fool-proof approach).</div></div><hr />
