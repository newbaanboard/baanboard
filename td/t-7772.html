<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">21st November 2002, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
There is a standard main session (NO source code). I have customized it's form. On one of it's text field, I have attached a customized zoom session (auto zoom). Now, the requirement is that, I would like to save the data, in the main session, before the related data is displayed on zoom session!!<br />
I've been trying event handling in the customized session, but could not achieve the objective! Can anyone help!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">22nd November 2002, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">How can you save data in the main session, from your customised session?<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont understand what you are trying.Please give more info.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">23rd November 2002, 06:10</div></div><div class="posttext">At first point, I do not know whether, what I am trying to achieve can be achieved in BaaN IV c4 or not!! Anyway, the scenario is as following -<br />
I am using Maintain Lots session (tdltc0101m000). The lots are generated by BaaN. The lot number gets generated only after saving the data on the form. I also need some more data, related to that lot, to be stored. This data needs to be maintained when generating the lot. So, I have a zoom session, which auto zooms from one of the fields. In this zoom session, some fields from the &quot;Maintain Lots&quot; are being imported, and lot number is one of them.<br />
So, I want the system to generate the lot (or save the data of main session), before the zoom session is displayed!!<br />
Is this possible!!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">23rd November 2002, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible, but the field from which you are auto zooming should be such that, all the mandatory fields for Maintain Lots Session are already filled before the time user comes to this field.<br />
<br />
Before saving the record, baan will execute check.all.input() and an error will be thrown, if data is incorrect.<br />
<br />
so the solution is:<br />
<br />
in the maintain session:<br />
<br />
zoom.from.&lt;field.name&gt;:<br />
on.entry:<br />
      execute(update.db)<br />
|after this import the Lot number as it will be updated in the table.<br />
<br />
<br />
You should test all possible user actions and try to make it error proof.<br />
<br />

I do think you can do what you describe without the source code or using products like Qkey or ~vamsi's Extend source code.  We have Qkey.  With one of these products you could include a before.zoom section on the main session and save the record before zooming.  I do not know of any other way to do this without source code. <br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

You have written I want the system to generate a lot(or save the data of main session), before the zoom session is displayed!!<br />
<br />
<br />
for that execute(update.db) will work.If you want to update other tables from maintain session, use after.update.db.commit.<br />
<br />
or write session by session with table what you want to do, we will try again .<br />
<br />

I think Extended Source Code may solve my problem. But, it seems to be quite difficult :eek: . I think I will give it a try.<br />

Probably you are talking about modifying session tdltc0101m000. But, I do not have the code for that, as mentioned earlier.</div></div><hr />
