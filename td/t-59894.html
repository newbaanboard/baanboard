<br />
I have a receipt session where i m trying to search a particular record with standard &quot;FIND&quot; command.By default the Order Origin is defaulted as say &quot;Service&quot;. Now if the focus is on the field Order Origin, and if i am hitting the keyword &quot;Enter&quot; first and then letter &quot;P&quot; to find the record having Order Origin as say &quot;Part&quot;(The  Both keyword has to be pressed simultaneously almost with no time delay). I am getting the tool error on one of our client server.<br />
<br />
I tried the same senario in our development server but i am not getting the same tool error, actully the moment i presses the &quot;Enter&quot; Button,the find session goes away without giving me any fraction of time to press the other key &quot;p&quot;. Its looks like our server is too fast but on client side i am getting small fraction of time to press the next key &quot;p&quot; before closing the find session.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: Ideally i have to press the letter &quot;p&quot; and then keyword &quot;Enter&quot; to find the required result, but in this senario i am not getting tool error in client side too.<br />
<br />
I have attached the tool error as well as the find session.<br />

Thanks in Advance,<br />
