<br />
it just occured, that I got an &quot;Table doensn't exist (Error 506)&quot; in our standard environment. As just checked Baan's &quot;dict&quot;-folder, without having experience with that, I found, folders like that:<br />
<br />
ddb50c<br />
ddb50c.org<br />
ddb50ccu01<br />
ddb50ccu14<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO I'm missing something like: &quot;ddb50ustnd&quot;. According to the above structure, I fear I can't have tables in stnd-package. So I think, every time Baan tries to access a table in &quot;B50Ustnd&quot;, it has to take the version from B50C ???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check session Companies (ttaad1100m000) as well and you will see where are your companies (in which package combination).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 05:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Well what I was going to say is that I see all tables in our production layer not in a baan layer.  I thought when you created the DD for a company it used the most current(based off VRC structure) to create the DD in the companies package.  So in our case even though most of the tables are defined in a baan VRC, they get created in the DD for the VRC for the company.  Not sure if I am explaining it well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... difficult situation for me. Usually I try to keep my postings as short as possible, because the chance to produce a mess with my english, is growing with the length of my message (not linear) ;-)<br />
<br />
The problem: We tried to check some things in a pure &quot;standard&quot; company, in our case 351 (b50c). <br />
In that company we get an table doesn't exist error for whwmd211.<br />
In an other company 551 which also is assigned to b50c the table exist.<br />
In &quot;table definitions ttadv4520m000&quot; the table is only in b50ustnd.<br />
So far the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I used ttaad1520m000 and ttaad1100m000 to check first the package combinations, there is no: b50ustnd (which is also not in dict). Second I checked company 351 which is assigned to b50c. But the table itself is only in b50ustnd. So for me, at the first glance, I thought, that is the reason for the table doen't exist error. <br />
But in the other company: 551 which is also in b50c, everything is fine. <br />
<br />
Why is the table present in 551 an not in 351? Is there just missing a &quot;create table&quot; for comp 351? (But it is &quot;standard&quot;-Baan!)<br />
<br />
Mark: what do u mean with baan layer and production layer? Do u mean package combinations like b50c for production and b50u for baan layer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I'm still not sure about the contens of the dict-folder</div></div><hr />

In &quot;table definitions ttadv4520m000&quot; the table is only in b50ustnd.<br />
<br />
Check session Change Current Package VRC of User (ttadv0140m000) - probably is field <br />
&quot;Show current VRC only&quot; checked.<br />
<br />
But I'm still not sure about the contens of the dict-folder<br />
<br />
In dict folder are all tables and domain definitions for this package combination.</div></div><hr />

Yes - that is what I mean.</div></div><hr />

I never use that feature!!! <br />
<br />

<br />
u mean &quot;all the package combinations&quot;, or? And in the folders for the package combinations are the tables and domains?  This is what I can see.</div></div><hr />

Soory, that is of course what I meant.<br />
<br />
But that is not the question. The question is still: Why do we (our system) not have a folder for every package combination for which we have a table definition?<br />
<br />
Maybe Mark is right that Baan doesn't really create a folder for every package combination, but only for the most current one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">11th January 2008, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">There must be folder for every package combination but could be on different directory, not necesserilly on dict.

<br />
I did that already, see above (6th posting)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th January 2008, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - in my dict directory I only see maybe 3 package VRC's.  So in our case I would expect to see all tables created in our ddB40c_prd directory, even thought some tables might be defined in something like B40_stnd.</div></div><hr />
