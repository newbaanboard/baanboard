1) I have a weired problem with my invoce report.<br />
Where there is more than one page, the before.layout doesn't print (this were i have the header information) and the print is screwed up<br />
<br />
2) WEIRED thing is it works for some of them correctly, not others...<br />
See the attachment with one GOOD 2 page invoice and 1 BAD one. Its exactly the same report...<br />
<br />
I am trying to find a root cause to this. I am looking for some ideas, to do additional research. Already searched through the board, but couldnt find a answer to the problem..<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have further ideas.<br />
See the attached file for more information. Also incldued the layouts i use<br />

The problem is it works fine 'sometimes' and other times it doesnt..<br />
I think Report processor will calculate the 'need' automatically, if we dont specify an explicit value for need<br />

I have exactly the same problem with one report. When I print to display or a physical printer I get all pages, whereas when I print to ASCIF or Excel I only get one page.<br />
<br />
On Display I get 2 windows; one shows a header/overview page and the other shows the lines (which is much more).<br />
<br />
When I print to a file I only get the header page. This is similar to session tfgld1410m000 whre it is possible to get a summery and details.<br />
<br />
Any Ideas?<br />

Hello,<br />
ASCIF is Print to Ascii-File.<br />
ASCIT is Append to Ascii-File.<br />

I am not sure about that.  To me it looks like if you added 2 to the needs lines it might actually format bad report correctly.  Something to play with.<br />
<br />
Germanicus - what session or report are you having problems with?  With tfgld1410m000 I get both reports in excel - two separate files, but they are both there.  For sending to an ascii file inorder to get both reports I have to use ASCIT like bdittmar mentions.</div></div><hr />

Make sure page length and actual  printer page are accurate.  Something else I did for my printers early on was to check the &quot;Form Feed&quot; button on the maintain devices.</div></div><hr />
