<br />
I am new to LN, I want to know the difference between DAL, DAL2 and UE in LN.<br />
In which case we use DAL,DAL2/UE. Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

To be simply, DAL and DAL2 means, you can use it for your own table. <br />
However, the UE means, you do not have the source code, you can do some extends.<br />

<br />
<br />
A User Exit DLL (UEDLL) is a DLL that will reside outside the standard software.<br />
It will have the same name as a standard DAL with the extension ‘ue’ (for ‘user exit’). <br />
E.g. ‘whinh200ue’ for table whinh200. Customers can implement a UEDLL in order <br />
to be able to define extra business logic before and after <br />
the standard ‘before’ and ‘after’ handling of<br />
<br />
saves and deletes, by means of specific hooks that will be executed by the 4GL engine <br />
and/or DAL Engine. In this way it is possible to e.g. conditionally publish <br />
data changes to the outside world.<br />
<br />
Interaction with 4GL Engine / DAL Engine<br />
<br />
When present, the User Exit DLL for a certain table will be loaded by the 4GL engine/DAL <br />
Engine by the time the DALfor this particular table will be loaded. In situations where <br />
no DAL is present this will be the moment at which a DAL would be loaded if it existed. <br />
This means that there is no need to have a DAL in order to make use of the UEDLL.<br />
<br />
Preconditions<br />
<br />
A DLL becomes a UEDLL when it meets the following conditions:<br />
•Its name is consisting of the table code with ‘ue’ as suffix, like whinh200ue<br />
•It includes bic_dal, as follows: #include &lt;bic_dal&gt;<br />
<br />
Restrictions<br />
<br />
A UEDLL is treated like a regular DAL. This means all kind of DAL related functionality can be used, like:<br />
•Function with.old.object.values.do()<br />
•Function with.object.set.do()<br />
•Pre-defined variable subdal<br />
<br />
<br />
Note however that the following restrictions apply:<br />
•Business methods cannot be implemented in a UEDLL Instead the business logic <br />
should be programmed in another (separate) general DLL.<br />
•It is strongly discouraged to define other external functions in a UEDLL and <br />
link the UEDLL directly to other scripts. Instead, use a normal general DLL. <br />
(This also applies to regular DALs).<br />
<br />
User Exit Hooks<br />
<br />
A UEDLL script can contain the following hooks:<br />
<br />
•ue.before.before.save.object()<br />
•ue.after.before.save.object()<br />
•ue.before.after.save.object()<br />
•ue.after.after.save.object()<br />
•ue.before.before.destroy.object()<br />
•ue.after.before.destroy.object()<br />
•ue.before.after.destroy.object()<br />
•ue.after.after.destroy.object()<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
For example, ue.before.before.save.object gets called before before.save.object and ue.after.before.save.object gets called after before.save.object.</div></div><hr />
