We have 2 application and 1 database server with network licence. Due to load balancing we divide our total number of users on 2 different box. Presently we are doing customisation in one of application server and my query is how to update other box automatically.<br />

Sorry but I do not remember what commands he used - we only have one application server now.  This moved all objects including the data dictionary files.  It was not automatic, but it was quicker than creating customizations and then exporting and importing them.<br />
<br />
I guess you could create a common directory between the two servers. On the devolopment server you could export into this directory. Then have a batch job that would import what ever it found in this directory.  Then delete it after the import. Just a thought on something you could try.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
