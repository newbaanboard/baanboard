<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a program that I can not find what the problem is.  This piece of code aborts on the second run with with the record changed after delayed lock error:<br />
<br />
<br />
	db.retry.point()<br />
	select	tpbcr606.*<br />
	from	tpbcr606 for update<br />
	where	tpbcr606.gcid = :gcid.f<br />
	selectdo<br />
		tpbcr606.incl = tcyesno.no<br />
		db.update(ttpbcr606, db.retry)<br />
		commit.transaction()<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
This program is the only one that can change this table - plus only one user can run it at a time.  Is this delayed lock error being caused by another query on this table?  There are other places that do updates on the table, but they all look like the above.  What am I missing?  I have read all the other posts on this topic, but see nothing that helps me.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe some more detail will talk it out..<br />
<br />
Is this an exact description - it runs ok the first time but then not again the second time?  Repeatable?  Does it work right after you exit the session and come back?  And, how does this look in the debugger...?  It should go back to the retry point on a 'dirty read', does it do that?  Are there multiple records for that 'gcid.f'?  If so, probably should put an 'order by' in there to resolve issues on a retry.</div></div><hr />

Click process again and boom.  The program hits the commit.transaction on the very first post and starts processing again at the db.retry.point.  <br />
<br />
I went through the program and added an order by clause for every query with a table selected for update.  Still have the error.  In this case for the contract there are multiple records.  As long as I process and exit the session it works every dang time.  <br />
<br />
No main table sections tried as both print and maintain session. Did I miss any questions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally I had it defined as a maintain session, changed to print just for grins and giggles.  Script type is 4 as is the form.  All the user does is enter billing cycle date and contract.  The program pulls the tpppc981 records, stores them, does stuff to them, then puts them back in tpppc981.  The maintable defined on the session record is tpbcr600.  I have a whole series of tables to track what happens to keep things lined up for putting back into the tpppc981 table.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Solution found - it was the 	rcd.ttpbcr606 = rcd.ttpbcr605. Took this out and put in all 28 fields and it started working.  The table tpbcr605 and 606 used to be the same number of fields.  I added a couple to tpbcr606 and I guess those hidden fields like ._compnr were causing problems.</div></div><hr />

You found it before I had a chance to reply.  I had a similar problem about 1 year ago.  When you use the record buffer there is a unique identifier for the lock id.  When you transfer it to the other table it looks for that lock and give you the error.  If you save the original lock id from the first record buffer and restore it after assigning the buffer it should also work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks - I saw something about that mentioned.  The last time I had errors using the record buffer it was caused by the &quot;._compnr&quot;.  In that case the two tables were identical.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone for the assist.</div></div><hr />
