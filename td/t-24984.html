<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I was debating whether to post this in Finance or here, and decided it's more for this forum, since a regular, even super, Finance user, will probably not know the answer to this...<br />
<br />
In tfgld106 (finalized transactions), each amount is booked positive, with just the field dbcr determining whether it is a debit (+) or credit (-) transaction. Now, of course for each transaction/document, there are 2 records in tfgld106, one is the transaction itself, and one is the clearing/matching (with the oposite db/cr sign!!). <br />
<br />
I need to print a list (report session) of transactions based on some search/filter criteria,  and of course some up the amounts. I seem to have trouble determining which of the two records per line is the correct one. I.e. let's say the transaction is debit, there will be a seconde line for the same document in CREDIT, which is the matching of the transaction to bank/open entry etc.<br />
<br />
So far I just took the first record of eacht document, and if it was debit the transaction is + and I ignore the next one, if credit it was -. However, it seems not waterproof, because I see that for journal entries, not linked to any invoice or unall. paym/rec. the SECOND record is the determining one...!!<br />
<br />
So bottom line, what criteria do I have to determine in tfgld106 if a transaction is debit or credit??<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Though I am not a finance guy but few days back I have developed a debtors ledger . From that experience I am telling u  better to start working from tfacr200 and compare with tfgld106.<br />
<br />
<br />
       if tfacr200.amnt &lt;= 0 then<br />
            cr_amnt = tfacr200.amnt * -1<br />
            totamnt_cr = totamntc + cramnt<br />
         else<br />
            dr_amnt = tfacr200.amnt<br />
            totamnt_dr = totamntd + dramnt<br />
         endif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is, that I need not only records from customers (acr), but all bank transactions, both from acr, acp, cmg etc. We need this list as a check-list for automatically registered bank statements (customized). In the transactions (tfcmg2100s000) the field reference is filled with the corresponding bank statement number. The reporting session makes a selection on specific bank statement numbers.<br />
<br />
So bottom line, it's not enough to go to acr200. The only table as far as I know that all those records are present in, is tfgld106. But I'm confused. Why is it so dificult to fetch/determine the correct, desired data, with corresponding debit/credit signs...?</div></div><hr />

Them Bean Counters are strange folk  ;) <br />

You are correct, by definition you _should_ end up with zero if you add all transactions in all accounts together. You should just have somebody from Finance tell you which account(s) to report from. <br />
<br />
If you have a report in Baan that tells you what the bottom line should be, then that will be helpful too.</div></div><hr />

You mean I should program hard coded bank numbers to include/exclude...???!! I would hope there should be a correcter way than that...??!<br />

What do you mean with that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
One filed in table tfgld106 is known as transaction origin means transactions way can help to sort out this proble. I have generated supplier and customer ledger from table tfgld106 only.<br />
<br />
Transaction Origins are :<br />
<br />
1.  Cash<br />
2.  Anticipated Payment<br />
3.  Anticipated Receipt<br />
4.  Cash Discount<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
It will definatly help to solve your proble.<br />
