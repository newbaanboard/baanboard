<br />
I am working on a project to create an interface file to be shipped off to one of our providers.  The length of the file is greater than 256.  <br />
<br />
My collegue wrote his file creation using the Baan report editor, so that he could created header, detail and footer layouts.  The problem is the data is greater than 256.  He is printing to a txt file.<br />
<br />
He wanted to know if anyone had idea's to get around this limitation.  For example making the layout multiple lines and continuing the fields on the next line.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
PS.  I would not do this using the Baan report editor, but he does not like my idea.</div></div><hr />

But the provider would have to be able to read this format - I can't answer that question.  I would recommend using the seq.* commands to create the file.</div></div><hr />
