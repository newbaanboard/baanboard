<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">4th August 2006, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I am planning to change the domain tcpdno such that it will be 8 digits long instead of the current 6 digits. (It has been 8 years, and we will be nearing the end of its limits shortly!). <br />
<br />
The domain is used (among other objects) in some 31 FUNCTIONS.<br />
<br />
My question is: Do I have to recompile all the program scripts in which these functions are included after I make the domain change?<br />
<br />
The changes I will be making to the domain will be as follows:<br />
- Nos. (before dec. sign). = 8 (from 6)<br />
- Display format = ZZZZZZ9 (from ZZZZZ9)<br />
- Range = $$ in [1, 99999999]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forms and reports needs to be modified to display values according to the new domain. Im not so sure about scripts, but probably shouldnt face any problems.<br />

Good Luck !</div></div><hr />

<br />
baan made a modification for german customers for the tcorno, tcpdno domain because the customers have to keep records for 10 years because of legal requirements. (i guess from 6 to 7 digits).<br />
<br />
I had to make this modifications, maybe some usefull hints:<br />
<br />
(1) you have to check all forms and reports manually because you need the space for the domain enlargement in the layout.<br />
<br />
(2) you have to check all scripts for stuff like&quot;999999&quot; (in relation to the domain, e.g. in SQL commands) and now you should set it to the max value of the domain (bad solution just use 2 more  9, better is the solution of baan using a baan function to check the digits of the domain).<br />
<br />
(3) You have to open the reports, forms manually and dump/compile them afterwards. A CRDD is not enough!<br />
Be aware you have to copy all Repors which are using the tcpdno domain to a customer/own VRC.<br />
This is a lot of work, otherwise your reports e.g. for production are not showing correct data.<br />
<br />
(4) This change is also for all tables using tcpdno like tisfc001 and others. So you need to convert them to RDD. <br />
<br />
Other problems could arise if you use the tcpdno field  as part of another table field e.g. concate a serial number (pdno &amp; running number). <br />
Now you have to deal with old 6 digits and new 8 digits.<br />
<br />
You can check baan support for documentation for the german solution (should work  on every system). There are also some check programs included.<br />
<br />
