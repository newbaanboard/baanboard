<br />
For testing/debugging, you need to open Debug and Profile 4GL (ttadv1123m000) from the Options menu and indicate the activity of the in-development objects.  After you do that, you should be able to run the objects.<br />

<br />
This is not for test. I have already delivered the objects. Now it is generating other error message: Cannot read session or object<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

Some times in 4c4 they became owned by someone other than BSP and that would cause issues.  Not sure if this is relevant with LN or not.</div></div><hr />

One of the reason might be - while creating maintain session, either the script is not generated or compiled.</div></div><hr />
