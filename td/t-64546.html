<br />
Version: LN FP8<br />
I'm facing a strange situation: I created a new report, compiled and linked it with a session. When trying to print this report i get the message &quot;Report nor present&quot;.<br />
In $BSE/application\tfB61U_l_ro8\otfitc0 I have the new object.<br />
But in $BSE/application\tfB61U_l_ro8\rtfitc the report I created does not exists !!! How is that possible?? The report file was not created on disk.<br />
Please help.<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

<br />
Compile the reports first. Unlink the report and link it again. If it doesn't allow, or still gives error, then check table ttadv212. If any extra report is linked to the session, you can delete that. Take precaution while deleting. <br />
<br />
This often happens, when you delete the report without unlinking it and then adding a new report to the session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I unlinked the reports and compiled them again. I linked the reports again and I get the same message &quot;Report not present&quot;.<br />
I unlinked again all the reports of the session and I linked only one report. It's working fine with one report linked per group.<br />
Still I need all 7 reports linked in one group.<br />
<br />
And why the report file does not exist in BSE$/application ?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simona</div><div class="date">6th September 2013, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Table ttadv212 shows the real situation: when I unkink the reports the records for my report disappear; when I link them again, the records are written in table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">6th September 2013, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, that means one or some of the reports which were previously linked to this session was deleted. But the record is present in the table ttadv212. Please check the records in this table for your session. <br />
<br />
I have got this error, I deleted the record having a report which was not in the system. A safer way will be to unlink all the reports for this session, find your session in the table. And delete the existing records for that session. Generally, sometimes this table is not cleared.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: I am repeating again. Unlink your reports and then delete the records for this session in table ttadv212.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">6th September 2013, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Ohh, so the object file for the report might have been deleted. I am not sure about this problem. May be due to data corruption. Have you tried duplicating the report and linking the new one??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another session had the same problem: &quot;Report not present&quot; even my reports are present, recompiled and unlinked and linked again with the session.<br />
<br />
So I opened a new incident on Infor Xtreme and after the installation of the newest Tools  solutions (in my case: 1435686 and 1435729; and their dependencies) the problem was solved.<br />
Thank you.<br />

<br />
Thanks for posting the solution. It will help others and will check them on my system as well :) And I just checked for them, they are included in this weeks dump. ;)</div></div><hr />
