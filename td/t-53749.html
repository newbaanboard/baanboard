In a PO report there is a field that displays the selected shipping method.  I need to also create a field that displays the associated account number for our business account with each shipper we use.  I know its kind of vague but can anyone guide me to get on the track of doing this.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
(1) Do you have source for the session which generates the report?  If yes you can trace through the source to see where would be the best spot to include code to find the associated account.<br />
(2) Use the report.  In the report script add code in the appropriate layout event to use the shipping method to find the business account. for example:<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:   <br />
     select sometable<br />
     from   sometable<br />
     where sometable._someindex = shipping.method<br />
     as set with 1 rows<br />
     selectdo<br />
     endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry to be so generic, but without being familiar with your system and data it is hard to be specific.   I usually just use the report script to lookup additional data - we do not own source.</div></div><hr />
