Previous to this hard copy of export declaration was printed and sent with the shipments outside of US. I think about 2 years ago, they switched to all electronic AES filing. Till now we were doing this through our shipping carrier - UPS and they charge $10 per shipment.<br />
We would like to do this ourselves. Would like to know if anyone else did this? The process involved etc..? To gain some knowledge and experience on this topic</div></div><hr />
