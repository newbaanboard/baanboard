<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">28th September 2002, 03:53</div></div><div class="posttext">We use the ttstpconv command to export to Excel.  This was great, as it saved a .txt file, and opened MS Excel with the text wizard.  Users were more than happy to format the data themselves, pretty easily, as we sent a space delimited file.<br />
<br />
This was great on Win98, Win2000 systems won't run the same way.  I can get Excel to run, but the file comes in without the text wizard and is all in the first column.<br />
<br />
I've been reading a lot tonight about .csv formatting - but I don't want to rewrite all my reports.<br />
<br />
I also downloaded the tuddcconv2 script (thanks Kevin B), but it doesn't seem to make much difference.  I can't get it to execute the text wizard.<br />
<br />
Isn't there a flag I can use when I execute MS Excel that will force it to run the text wizard?  I realize this isn't really a Baan issue (???)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th September 2002, 07:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never had Excel to start with the text wizard on 97,98 or 2000.  Of course our reports are | delimited.  Always one column and then the use just selected column &quot;A&quot; and then did a convert to columns. Or they could take and close the file, re-open it, then go through the format wizard. Not sure what the wizard is really called, is that what you are calling the text wizard? You want to compare the settings on old and new software. There could be something in the Excel setup that I do not know about.<br />
<br />
I did post this not too long ago (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1546&amp;pagenumber=2). Maybe it will help.<br />
