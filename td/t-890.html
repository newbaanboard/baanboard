<br />
We are running Baan 5b.  We have a session which runs off a table we created.  The session has been running fine up until today.  I needed to add some fields to the table.  I added the fields and then did a convert to runtime dd.  However it seemed to process this too quickly.  I then went to general table maintenance and after entering the details of the table it will not allow me to display it.  I get an error &quot;Data definition ttdzzz300 not present&quot;  We tried a number of things, to try and get the table to work.  But we kept on getting errors coming up.<br />
<br />
However we finally decided to delete the table and recreate it.  I did this as normal.  However now when I go into General table maintenance I get an error &quot;Error 401&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't have the explaination of errors handy.  Can anyone shed some light on the error and also maybe what the problem was with the table originally?  <br />
<br />
Can it just lose its link to the Data dictionary like that?  I know I have had problems before where I have needed to force Baan to Convert to runtime DD by changing a field and changing it back.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are three categories of errors:<br />
- Error numbers 1-99 are operating system errors<br />
- Error numbers 100-899 are database errors<br />
- Error numbers 900-999 are network errors</div></div><hr />

Sometimes the table definitions are stored in shared memory, and bring the system down and back up again, clears and reloads memory?  <br />
<br />
I also couldn't find error 401, sure it wasn't 501 which is an internal memory error?<br />

<br />
I had a similar problem and reported to baan and they agreed the bdbreconfig was a bit buggy and delivered another version of it.<br />
<br />
Although that works fine, rarely it gives problems on some tables.<br />
<br />
What I do is - I add a dummy field to the table and do a reconfig, logout &amp; login, create table in a company. then go back to that table and delete the dummy field I added and do a recofig, logout &amp; login, got back into that table/company from the GTM and it worked.<br />
<br />
I think that program has some problems with the .old and .new DD files, maybe it doesnt detect the changes well...<br />
<br />
I know this is a roundabout solution! (based on my experience)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">30th January 2002, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I also suppose the problem is in the DD. I found the description of the error 401: &quot;A configuration file is corrupt&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">30th January 2002, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Erros like this may happen if you create a new domain within a package (say td), add a field with that domain to a table of amother package (say tiitm001) and then do a convert to runtime for that table. Why? Because you didn't convert the td domain then! So your table DD contains a reference to a domain DD that does not exist. <br />
<br />
If that's the case, be very careful now, since you may lose the data in that table completly. There should be a recovery procedure described somehow here in this Forum below. If you are at a customers site and do not have too much experiance with Data Dictionary / Reconfiguration Process, (and if that tables data is important!) get professional advice.<br />

<br />
If you have loaded your table definitions in shared memory the table definitions will not be updated after the installation of a patch which contains an update of a table definition. On NT you have to bring shm down and up again.<br />
To be honest I am not sure how this reacts if you change the tabledefitions yourself. I guess the same.<br />
<br />
On unix this is not a problem, in some way Baan can detect on unix that the tabledefinition is changed.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I am not used to load the package combination in which our developers work in shared memory. <br />
<br />
If the bdbreconfig process fails it should leave an R.&lt;tablename&gt; file in your tmp directory which contains the data. However it happened also to me that I lost the data, however with a good backup that's not a problem.<br />

<br />
Our guy here dropped Baan overnight and brought it back up.  Things are working again this morning.<br />
<br />
Bit of a pain having to drop Baan but I am glad its working again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">30th January 2002, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick note to NPRao2000 - sometimes the flag to reconfigure is not set when you make a table change.  When a label changes sometimes, and also when importing.  You're adding the dummy field will set the flag, and removing it will also, so the table gets converted.   A slightly easier way of doing the same thing is to add a period at the end of the table description.  This sets the flag(?!).  Go figure.  You can reconfigure then and see the changes after you exit and come back.  You can then remove the period if it bothers you and reconvert.  Still a hokey solution, but easier than the dummy field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">30th January 2002, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi lbencic,<br />
<br />
I never tried that way, maybe I will try next time. <br />
But I figured out that the bdbreconfig needs to detect a change to do a reconfig on the table. Since I am a programmer as a well as an admin, I felt comfortable to go ahead to add a dummy field to get the table reconfigured.</div></div><hr />
