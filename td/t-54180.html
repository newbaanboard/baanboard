<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">3rd November 2008, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We installed solution 208434 with tiboidll100010 on our (Baan5) Testsystem. This is a solution, which is installed due to a prob in the &quot;Infor Scheduler&quot;.<br />
<br />
For the people who work with the &quot;Scheduler&quot; this solution seems to help.<br />
<br />
Before we install this solution on our productive system I tried to find out how the influence, to the Baan-System is.<br />
To find that out, I &quot;grep&quot;-ed our unix-sources for function-calls of this DLL ....<br />
and I found absolutely nothing.<br />
I think we have more than 90% of the sources installed. <br />
<br />
Why can't I found any call to a function of this DLL? Strange because the solution seems to work.<br />
Is is possible, that the functions of this DLL are only called from this objects where we don't have the source, or is it possible this DLL is only called from the java-code of the Infor Scheduler?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">4th November 2008, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I found in $BSE/lib three qcd*-directories. I will check this files. I have no experience with BOI's. Where are they located? <br />
Besides is there any influence from this qcd-files to the normal Baan functionality?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">4th November 2008, 12:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Integrations via OpenWorld use BOI's. In the QCD files queries on Baan tables or function calls can be defined. In this way another application can trigger Baan functionality. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, because I still doesn't found any call of this above DLL (also not in the QCD files). The problem is not that important to invest hours and hours all over the world ;-), but it's just anoying me!<br />
<br />
Thank you and regards</div></div><hr />
