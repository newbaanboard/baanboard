<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sctoolsguy</div><div class="date">15th November 2006, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to create a recurring job for Create Sequential Dump of Table.'  I want the dump file and error files to have the create date in their respective file names.  When using the session I can see that the variable @#$ is somehow used to append the company number to the dump file name.  I discovered this by running the dump and tabbing through the fields after the dump completed.  Does anyone know how this variable gets populated?  Are there other variables like this one available for use as parameters for file names?</div></div><hr />

I have done this with path names, but have never tried to use one in a file name.  You can give that a try.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">15th November 2006, 19:39</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also look at the predefined variable section of the manual, all of those are available as well:<br />

http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_misc_predefined_variables<br />
<br />
In addition...try compiling in debugger and running to the point where you print your file.  Enter the debugger command 'L', this will list all the open variables, including system ones that you can use, along with their value.</div></div><hr />

You can schedule this AFS session to take dump periodically.</div></div><hr />
