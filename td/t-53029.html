<br />
   My requirement is that I want the text editor to have a window title. e.g. if you have a form command named &quot;Equipment Details&quot; on a particular session , clicking on which opens the text editor, I want the window title to look like this:<br />
<br />
       Text Editor : Equipment Details<br />
<br />
   Can anyone please tell me how to achieve this ?<br />
<br />
   Thanking you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please see the attached file. It has a screenshot of a typical Baan Text Editor window. I want the window title to read as &quot;Part Detailed Description&quot; in the encircled region shown.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to do it ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

The whole handling of the text is done from the tools layer so as far as I know it is not possible to interrupt somewhere. <br />
In LN you can use multi line edit fields with your normal screens. But in 5c this is not available.</div></div><hr />

Add the text field in the DFE and then change its height &amp; width.<br />

Refer to the screenshot.</div></div><hr />
