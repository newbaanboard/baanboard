<br />
I don't know whether works on B4c3. You can try the following settings. After your tests close the Worktop I think it's important to get the files.<br />
<br />
-set PROFILE_ALL=1 -set PROF_CLIENT=save:c:\tmp<br />
<br />
PROF_CLIENT pushs the logging files on your Client Workstation.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

              thanks for your reply. the profiler is working for B4c3. But not as i have seen for other tools. Even though we kept the profiler commands in bshell its not working for it. i tried the way you suggested but no file has been saved to the folder. The result of my testing is that after the session has finished processing, surprisingly i am getting device window &amp; after i pass the parameters its printing the profiler report to that device file. Even the report also showing only the functions level, not query level which query is taking longer.No idea why its that way.<br />
<br />
i have queries to clarify?<br />
1. Based on this is there any command which can supress user intervention so that at the end the pofiler report goes to file directly?<br />
2. can we get report at query level? any command for that?<br />
3. when we have multiple sessions to process &amp; check the profiler do we need to compile all the sessions in profiler mode? and at the end all the details will comeup in single report?<br />
<br />
Thank you to clarify.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Sunil</div></div><hr />
