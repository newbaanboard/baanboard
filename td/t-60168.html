I am trying to run a Baan 3GL from windows (ie without using Baan UI) *<br />
I wrote the code into a 3GL (called otclcrhours)<br />
Used the following command line  and put it in a .bat file and if i double click and run it, it works beautifully.<br />
x:\baan\bin\ntbshell  -server  -set BSE_COMPNR=&quot;105&quot; -set PACKAGE_COMB=&quot;b50cprd1&quot; otclcrhours <br />
<br />
However i take the same file and put it into a SQL server DTS as a windows task, it doest execute. It looks like its not getting some environmental info. I tried setting BSE, BSE_TEMP etc but didnt help.<br />
<br />
If i try the SQL DTS with some standard windows commands (like copying a file it works fine, the problem is the baan objects doenst execute).<br />
I poked around here and tries few many things but no luck<br />
<br />
My backup plan is to make a regular baan session and run it as a job, but i do have a need to run from the command prompt<br />
<br />
Any thoughts/ideas??</div></div><hr />
