<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ash Gajjar</div><div class="date">20th June 2006, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: I have a session with both Program &amp; report script. <br />
<br />
On execution, I get a runtime warning error : error in reading sort file - 3 fields scanned, 44 expected.<br />
<br />
I am only sorting on one input field. There are 44 input fields.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what I should be looking at ?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjack</div><div class="date">20th June 2006, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes mark is right(as always :) ) , just check your fourth field(as 3 fields  are already scanned) declared in &quot;report input fields&quot; .  As suggested run the report in debug mode , whenever the program execution halts, check the data values from fourth field onwards. You can probably find the culprit. If the fourth field is a string field then look out for any newline character or if the fourth field is a number then look out whether accidentally the value obtained is by dividing a number by zero.<br />

Reply with your observations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">21st June 2006, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting... I just ran into the same error message when running a new customized report. Strange, I don't recall having this problem ever before. I know what field causes it by me, it is an input field item.dsca with domain tcdsca which is placed on the report with - obviously - the item description, which is being fetched in the item script into the variable. Field is declares is extern with domain tcdsca, I have no clue why the problem.. When I remove that field from the report (input fields) I don't get the error.. <br />
<br />
Have no time at all now to check it more in depth, but will keep you all posted when I get a chance to look at it... This will probably not be for today anymore...</div></div><hr />

In that case the report could have different input fields for the different languages.</div></div><hr />

It is very interesting that you mention this. The report-field which caused the errors by me yesterday, was a description field, fetched in specific language, based on user's selection on form. In other words, this was not a report printed in the USER-language, but instead user had to select the desired language on the selection-form, and description would be printed in the selected language. Indeed, the report was not yet available in all languages at the time of the errors (since I was still in testing phase of a newly developped session). <br />
<br />
Due to time-pressure yesterday, I just solved the problem with a workaround, and did it all in one report, in system language. <br />
<br />
So indeed, it looks like it could have to do with the different languages..<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to get input on this issue from others also who have faced this issue...<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

Thank you all for the input.<br />
<br />
The way I finally overcame the problem was to build a sort key in the program script and created a second report which then used this sort key. <br />
<br />
This way I did not have to worry about manipulating the original sort at all.<br />
Once again thanks<br />
