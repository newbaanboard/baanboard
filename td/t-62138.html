<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuart</div><div class="date">29th March 2012, 06:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonder if anyone can help. I have a new windows 7 64 bit machine with BW.98 installed. <br />
Local $BSE = c:\users\{name}\appdata\local\infor\baaniv\bw\tmp<br />
<br />
When using an editor other than notepad the .cln file created from the server gets created and then disappears. The error in the even viewer is as follows<br />
<br />
Env : Baan IV (c:\program files (x86)\infor\bw\baan iv) Program : BW file q:\ui\bw\ts\win32\p_applet.cpp # 485 Keyword : TsApplet::start() Username : type:S language:2 Process : 2404 ProcessSet : Stuart@STUART-LAPTOP:2404 Lasterror : 2 (The system cannot find the file specified.) Errno : 2 (No such file or directory) BdbErrno : 0 Message : 21 : Couldn't create process. File=cedt.exe, Parameters=&quot;C:\Users\Stuart\AppData\Local\Infor\BW\Baan IV\tmp\tmp002037641.cln&quot;, Verb=NULL, Error=2 <br />
<br />
The cln file definitely gets created but gets dropped almost immediately. If notepad is set as the editor it works fine. <br />
I have set the permissions on the directory to full control by everyone so dont think that is the problem <br />
I normally use crimson editor but have installed scite and tried that <br />
<br />
The funny thing about this is both scite and crimson work perfectly on my old windows 7 machine - but that is a 32 bit os.<br />
<br />
Anyone out there who has any ideas it would be much appreciated</div></div><hr />

And you are positive you have the correct path for the software?  What happens if you save a cln file to the tmp directory and then start scite or crimson, can you edit it?  I know when we first went to win 7 we had problems launching and editing files with scite.  It was all around permissions and where directories were located.  I know one of our problems was baan was installed in c:\program files and the tmp files were going to c:\users\user name like you mention.  Eventually our windows support group had to change it so we had permissions to the c:\program files\baan\tmp directory.</div></div><hr />

thanks for the rambling.  I had tried setting the user permissions with no luck. However I have had issues with permissions on these newer versions of windows where the actual permissions are not updated until a restart. I went and re-tested having restarted the machine and it now seems to be working fine. <br />
Thanks again<br />
Stuart</div></div><hr />
