The form input field is only, which is read valute from Barcode. The session has two requests.<br />
The first, every record input by Barcode reader. Once the input data has no error, it should autosave the current record, then execute insert data and jump to the input field.<br />
Secord, nobody allow to modify the input data.<br />
<br />
I had tried: execute(update.db), update.occ() and execute(add.set). They didn't work on autosave, include update table. <br />
Even if combined with db.insert(), auto jump to next input field would not effective. It would goto the above first record.</div></div><hr />

 You can use insert.db or update.db in after.field of the field, where barcode data is to be captured. To trigger after.field you need to do the setting on the scanner which will scan your Barcode and put a &lt;TAB&gt; alongwith the Scanned Barcode Data. <br />
This &lt;TAB&gt; will trigger after.field in you Baan Session there you can do your desire coding and at last use to.field(field name). This will takes your control again to the same field.<br />

Thank you for your reply. <br />
I wasn't familiar with scanner. But I knew we can set &lt;Enter&gt; and &lt;TAB&gt; behind the Barcode data. So, I should try this method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">9th December 2009, 10:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I had tried. When I read Barcode by scaner, and added a &lt;TAB&gt;, it still had the error. As I said before, the record would be saved. But the input focus had jump to the prev record and the prev record can be modified, which was not allow to be modified. I used update.occ(), but it didnot work.<br />
<br />
My code is:<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
    if update.status = add.set then<br />
        execute(update.db)<br />
    endif</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th December 2009, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) Maybe try turning off modify on the session and only allow inserts.  Then after the execute(update.db) try executing add.set again to put it back into insert mode.  The problem with update.db is in takes it out of insert mode.<br />
<br />
(2) What I did was create a session with input fields only, not multi-occurence.  I did not use multi-occurence for the simple fact that I did not know how many records or input they would have. If I was you I would set up a simple input session to accept one record at a time. Then you could always display it in a multi-occurance session.  On my tags each barcoded field had a tab appended and after the last input field it moves to the choice.continue button to process the records.  Then what I did was the last field on the label contains %A$M - we use barcode 3 of 9 and I think this is a carriage return. This processed the record and moves back to the first input field.  I only did this on one tag and I am not sure how often we use it anymore.  It worked really well and they were able to process 100 inventory moves in just a few minutes.</div></div><hr />
