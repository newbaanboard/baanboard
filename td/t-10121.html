<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">23rd May 2003, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to write software to do this....<br />
The users options are used in the script, there is nothing in the form that calls a session by using a specific option.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<br />
choice.user.1:<br />
on.choice:<br />
| do something<br />
<br />
choice.user.4:<br />
on choice:<br />
| do some other thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">23rd May 2003, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do that in following way:<br />
- in Maintain Forms go to standard options and enable zoom (option 34) if disabled<br />
- start form editor, click twice on choice field, switch on zoom to session and give session code; if your form does not have a choice field, add it.<br />
- if you want to add more sessions, create menu containing them and use zoom to menu in choice button<br />
- dump your form and you will see new option in Special menu without any extra source code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What u said that i can do it by using choice field and then define a menu/session which calls my session, but user.choice doesn't comes into picture, is it that i cannot call a session using user.choice.no ???<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">26th May 2003, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so let's go thru an example. Assume,that you want to modify a simple Maintain Countries (tcmcs0110m000) session, and you would like to put Maintain Areas (tcmcs0145m000) in Special menu. In standard version of tcmcs0110m000 menu Special is greyed out<br />
So, repeat following steps:<br />
- run Maintain Forms, locate form tcmcs0110m001 and copy to your current PVRC<br />
- go to Standard Options and enable zoom (option 34)<br />
- open the form in form editor, you will see something like VVVVVVVVV CC in bottom right corner of the form<br />
- double click on CC letters, a new subsession starts (Maintain Form Choice Field)<br />
- in field &quot;Zoom&quot; choose &quot;Session&quot;<br />
- in field &quot;Zoom to&quot; put session code (tcmcs0145m000)<br />
- save and exit, dump your form and run the session.<br />
You should see, that &quot;Special&quot; menu is now available  and Maintain Areas can be run from there. Is that, what you want? Note, that it has nothing to do with choice.user.n section in script, you do not need to change any source code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as u can see above, there are diffrent Methods to call subsessions. <br />
May be u want to use a user defined Button to call your subsession, so u have to use the way u began - but u have to add a line in the choice.user.x - section of the script which uses the function zoom.to$().<br />
<br />
If u would like to see the subsession in the specials-area u have to do the way like grzegorz. In this case u don't need to code anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">26th May 2003, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yaah i agree the way u told that i click on this xx field on the form and take the option as Session and specify the respective session over there to be called, now my doubt is what if the special menu has 5 options ( 5 sessions to be shown in special menu ) rather than only 1 session to be called....in this case i am not able to enter 5 times the session by clicking xx option on form.... probably the idea now comes is use Menu in that case ...right .....!!!<br />
<br />
anyway , I will try with this function zoom.to$()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">27th May 2003, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, right. In that case create a small one level menu with those five sessions. Menu will be attached to your Specials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 09:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
When attaching 5 sessions via the menu option from &quot;Form Choice Field&quot;, how do I export and import variables between the calling session and called session?<br />
Is it the same way as when we call from user defined choices...<br />
In user defined schoice, I think export and import is normally done as follows:<br />
<br />
choice.user.0:<br />
on.choice:<br />
export(&quot;x&quot;, x)<br />
<br />
zoom.from.all:<br />
on.entry:<br />
import(&quot;x&quot;, x)<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 20:23</div></div><div class="posttext">It works a little bit different.<br />
In main program (calling session) you don't do anything, just declare your variable as extern. In subsession ( called one ) you can use <br />
import( &quot;var_name_in_main_prog&quot; , local_var ) <br />
somewhere at start to obtain a value and <br />
export(  &quot;var_name_in_main_prog&quot; ,  local_var ) at the end to push a value back to the main program</div></div><hr />
