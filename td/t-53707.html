  <br />
I have a big problem, because I have to install a customization in an application that cannot be disconnected, because this installation belongs to a company that works 24/7/365.  <br />
  <br />
The all components are news, but in the tables exists references to standard tables.  <br />
  <br />
Which procedure should I make with the tables for not having problems in this installation?  <br />
  <br />
When Do I run the sessions ttadv5210m000 for sessions and ttadv5214m000 for menus and forms can I have problems if the users not leaving the system?  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
Thank you for your responses</div></div><hr />

A trick to do convert to RTDD instead of do the create RTDD is to 'touch' every table involved (even standard tables that are referenced by new tables), so the system put the names of table involved in the list of table to be converted, but pay attention to do this or your DD can became not correct .<br />
<br />
You can always do convert for sessions and form/menus without any problems (users that are logged only see changes when they relog).</div></div><hr />

  <br />
But, Is it necessary reconfiguring the tables when I only have indexed to the standard tables?  <br />
  <br />
That is to say, I haven't touched the standard tables I only have created a table reference to  it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">19th September 2008, 08:59</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have references to a standard table,  the table has not to be reconfigured, but the runtime DD for this table has to be dumped because the new referenced table.<br />
<br />
If the main problem is that the environment cannot be easily stopped, I thonk that the best option for you is to remove the reference and do all the work by reading this std table in the customized sessions.</div></div><hr />
