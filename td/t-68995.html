<br />
i have a report with layouts as given in attachment. the problem is after printing records on every page, the report prints four blank lines.<br />
<br />
i want to print the report in such a way that it should print headings once and then all the records without any gape between pages.<br />
<br />
the report is printed on device with rewrite file type (ASCIF).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">21st June 2016, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">When I create a new Report, using the report-Generator, it always will have two layouts: one header and one detail layout.<br />
The header layout will be repeated on every page, so I'm changing the header layout into a before report layout (a layout that will be printed only one time at the start of the report; you'll need to copy the layout into a new one and delete the old one).<br />
After doing so I'm always startled by looking at a blank screen (scroll down, data is really there). The new before.report layout has the option &quot;new page&quot; activated, so deactivate it (I always forgot this option when copying the layout in LN... ;-) )<br />
<br />
Some empty lines will remain. This are the on the second page of the reports session (set Top Margin to zero).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">21st June 2016, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want the header to print just once and all the detail records after that, copy the contents of the header to before.report and delete the header.That way the content of the &quot;header&quot; will be printed just at the starting of the report.<br />
<br />
Yes, and attaching the images wouldnt harm anybody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st June 2016, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually what we do is use the report script.  So we add something to the layout output expression like header_cnt =0.  Then in the script in the before layout of the detail layout we add something like if spool.device = &quot;excel&quot; then header_cnt=1.  This way when a person picks excel they only get the header once.  Now the problem you might run into is with margins - you have to get those set correctly also or you will end up with blank lines between the pages.  The same will happen with the before.report section.  So make sure all your margins are 0.</div></div><hr />
