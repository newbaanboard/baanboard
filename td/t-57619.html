<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">14th January 2010, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">One way is to read the whole file using seq.gets() and write it again to another file using seq.puts. Keep doing that process until you reach the line that you need to edit, edit it and continue.<br />

If you are on Linux (or any Unix) you can use the operating system's utilities. <br />
<br />
A simple example of sed to find and replace patterns (Hello to Goodbye) in file -<br />
<br />
$ sed -e &quot;s/Hello/Goodbye/g&quot; input_file &gt; output_file<br />
$ mv output_file input_file<br />
<br />
If you like to keep it platform neutral then you should go with George's suggestion and use find.and.replace() function. You can use search on the forum for its usage.</div></div><hr />
