<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">6th March 2006, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to get the functionality of the Enter Hours Accounting session to work in a customized session.  When inserting a new record or modifying a field on an unprocessed record, the man time for sure, the total normal hours that displays at the top of the form updates when exiting that field.  How in the world does that work.  I've tried several things on my after.field - and it just doesn't work cleanly.  When I tab out it will send the focus to another record not the next field, it won't redisplay everything correctly.  It's just very quirky.  If anyone can show me the code in the enter hours accounting session that does this I would be greatly appreciative.<br />

<br />
I have done things like this a couple of different ways. Is this a multi-occurence session?  Is this field the last field on the record where a tab would move to the next record.  Remember that a tab will execute events and click into another field will skip somethings.  So sometimes a after.input on one field may also be used in before input on the next field.  It really depends on exactly what you are doing.  Usually I end up putting checks in mutliple places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">13th March 2006, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Mark - I was wondering if you were ever going to respond!  :)  So I've done a couple of things with this.  First, it is a multi-occurance type 2 form.  I've used type 3 as well.  It is mostly going to be fields where the user will make a change then tab out of the field on the current record.  I've done after.update, when.field.changes and everything I've done have made it act quirky.  I've been able to update the total display but the focus will end up on the first record I think because what I'm doing is execute(find.data), execute(first.set).   The reason I do the execute(first.set) is so I get the correct data in the first record because for some reason if I don't do that the info from the last record is then displaying on the first record.<br />

Any ideas?  Do you have code for tihra1101m000 Enter Hours Accounting?  When you tab out of the man time field it will automatically update that normal hours display.<br />

I have had problems doing totals before, I actually think the when.field.changes is correct.  You should have an email from me - if not let me know.</div></div><hr />
