<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">26th May 2004, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
	We have situation where the bdbreconfig just hangs after a certain time. I am trying to add new column to a table that has around 354984 records in it. After adding the new field when I do the convert to runtime with the Reconfigure Tables flag set to Yes it goes smoothly when it is extracting data out of the table but when loading it back it hangs just after loading maybe 15% of the data. Not only it hangs but if someone else login to BaaN and try to open any session it takes a long time to come up.<br />
<br />
	Also, after hanging for may be 30 minutes are so, the bdbreconfig starts to do the undo. I think this is probably because of the timeout settings.<br />
<br />
	This is happening on our dev server and I dont see any issues with locks and it happens when trying to reconfig any table. I checked db_resouce file and stuff and it is not changed since a long time. We never had this problem before. Just a month back the same table I am trying to reconfig took less then half hour to complete.<br />
<br />
	Any ideas? Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
to delete all the records of the tables ttadv500 .. 504 it´s a good idea too.</div></div><hr />

But, the problem does not seem to be on one table. it is happning with every table. even if i run the session you have mentioned, it takes the same amount time (which is very very long) to reorg.</div></div><hr />

I know with one we installed recently the reconfig would not work - not sure how it failed.  Baan sent us a update for it and that fixed our problem.<br />

  No, we have not installed any patches recently since we don't have baan support.<br />
<br />
  Could it be a issue with oracle server?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th May 2004, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there any errors in any of the log files?  What about the log.reconfig?  I am not sure what errors would appear where if it was the oracle server.   You may also want to check for any environment variables the effect bdreconfig. I know if these are set incorrectly they can cause problems.  The ones I know of are RDS_FULL, SSTS_SET_ROWS, ORA_MAX_ARRAY_FETCH, ORA_MAX_ARRAY_INSERT.  I can not think of any thing else to look at.<br />

<br />
You might consider trying to reconfigure a very small table (take a backup of course) like one of the parameter tables so you can test that it probably isn't a space issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 03:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Brendan,<br />
   Yes, our database does have enough space and i also tried to reconfigure a small table (3600 rows) and it works just fine. It seems to be a problem with large tables.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 05:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I see that you are on Unix. Check the disk space in BSE/tmp directory/mount point using -<br />
<br />
$ bdf $BSE/tmp <br />
<br />
then calculate the dump size baan tools is going to dump in $BSE/tmp - table size x number of rows<br />
<br />
Since you can reconfig small tables but not big ones, I think you are running out of space there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Rao,<br />
	I checked the disk space and this is what it came back with:<br />
_______________________________________________________<br />
	baan02:/local/home/bsp $ df -v /baanc/bse/tmp<br />
<br />
Mount Dir  Filesystem        blocks     used     free  %used<br />
/dev/vx/dsk/rootdg/baanc<br />
/baanc                     34603008  5906374 26903144    19%<br />
_______________________________________________________<br />
<br />
	So, based on this I am assuming that we have enough space. Also, there is no problem when extracting data out of the table during reconfig and given the fact that it creates the dump file during extraction, I am not sure space is an issue. The problem we are having is when it tries to load the data back to the table. This is where it seems to sit forever. It loads the first 50,000 rows or so really quick and then it becomes slow and ultimately hangs and starts to do the undo.<br />
