Any thougths and pointers would be helpful.<br />

Why do you hesitate to change standart table and add all fields you need?</div></div><hr />

And to tell you the truth, with the number of patches that BAAN sends, it is nice to know that we have not customized anything of theirs and we can install patches without checking for confilicts.<br />

Back to the original query... anyone?<br />

I am NOT a functional person, so I don't know about discreet vs. other types of items.  But I do know I have seen code that checks if the length &lt;&gt; 0 and it does some logic.  I believe this was in Manufacturing, and really I think it was on Baan V.  <br />
<br />
My point:  You may still want to use those fields, but if you are going to choose one I would not use length, use one of the others.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the thoughts... I was thinking along the same lines and went with thickness as it is the third dimension and as such would be used by the least of the dimensional units (length and area units would not use it).<br />

Adding a tale field doen't affect program script at all. If any wya you are going to change sales order scripts for using length, width etc you will need to do some work for pacthes then. It is always better to add the field and use it properly. If you have patches like  problem, I would suggest to use product like Qkey. So even thoug h you have source, patch management becomes so eary.<br />
