<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smi4975</div><div class="date">26th June 2008, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a customization done on the standard  session for Maintain Sales orders (tdsls4101m000). Under the special option we have the Print Order acknowledgement session added. When the user clicks this session , the order number is carried forward to the subsession (print Order Ackn -tdsls4401m000). I have to remove the customization and make it standard, though the functionality should remain the same. Is there a way of importing the order number without making any change to the script? <br />
<br />
Need an urgent help on this as we have to remove the source codes from our system very soon and i need to get away with the customization.<br />
Is there any solution in Baan that could resolve this problem???</div></div><hr />

Sometimes sub-sessions will pull in the data that they need.  No promises that would work.  Usually I have to do a some coding in one or the other session (sometimes both) to get this type functionality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smi4975</div><div class="date">27th June 2008, 05:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The Print order ackn session is not a subsession,it's a standard print session, but it is called in the special option of maintain SO session(customization). The export and import command is used internally to export the order number while activating the special option session(tdsls4401m000). i need to remove this customization from both the scripts , but still need the functionality of carrying forward the order number. Is there a way to do this, without using the conventional method? <br />

Can u suggest any other work around for this???</div></div><hr />
