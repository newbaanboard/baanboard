<br />
I have a problem in conversion of Baan report in RTF format. I have created a new device and configured it to convert the report into RTF format using the 4GL program &quot;ttstpconv&quot;. Report converted well into RTF format, the problem comes after conversion. The report header and footer are misplaced. The footer of the first page come at the top of the second page and so on. <br />
<br />
Actually the reson is, if define a device of type &quot;Windows Printer&quot; then you can also set the paper type, and while printing the report windows will print the page header &amp; footer at the right place according to the page attributes. But if configure a device of any other type e.g. &quot;Rewrite file&quot; or &quot;Append to file&quot; as required for RTF conversion, its not possible to set the paper type. Now the report generation process out all report in the file as the text, and that RTF conversion with ttstpconv not inserted the &quot;page break&quot;, only out the page header and footer as the text, without calculating the position of header and footer because the paper type is not available. If open that RTF converted report into MSWord, the footer and header not comes at the proper place. <br />
<br />
Further more, somehow I calculated the number of lines that could be fit in one page with an specific font and its size, and set that number of lines in attributes &quot;page lenght&quot; in the device configuration session. Now the page header and footer comes at the right place. That technique works well with some reports, but those report where any detail section's text contains a &quot;Carrige return&quot; mark or text in any detail section extends from the specified number or lines, the footer misplaced and printed on the next page.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any way to set the page attributes, any paramter that could use with that ttstpconv to insert the page break or any other way to print the page header and footer at the right place.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I just found out that Baan released a new version of ttstpconv, which deals with a page-break problem when using RTF conversion. Check solution 142500 for this.<br />
