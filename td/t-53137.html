As an end user, you have to justify why do you need the SQL? From a security perspective, one has to know if &amp; why you are accessing sensitive or confidential information, which is not provided by a Baan session or report. You cannot execute your SQL without knowing your database login and password information. You have to work with your IT/Development team.</div></div><hr />
