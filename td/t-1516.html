<br />
At the moment we are using a quite extentive excel-sheet to prepare the management report for our company. This sheet combines the Profit part of the P&amp;L in a certain way and the Loss bit in another way.<br />
<br />
I thought that it should not be so difficult to make some sort of a report in Baan that generates the output that can go straight in the report, so that we may be able to reduce *somewhat* the size of our excel file from the current 29 mb to a more reasonabl figure.<br />
<br />
To do this, I would like to know if there is a good document on creating these reports as well as if anyone of you guys has some good pointers I should look out for.</div></div><hr />

But I can tell you that as you develop the session and reports there are some really good experts that use this forum and could answer your questions. Have you developed Baan sessions before? If not i recommend some tools training first - just to get the basics.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Domburg</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I do have reasonable programming experience. I would be looking for some good general documentation first and see how far I stumble (usually it is quite far)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you could find some old tools manuals. Other than that I have not seen anything posted or in electronic format.  You could use the Baan help(ours is corrupt and not very helpful most times) to get some answers and I do recommend getting a Knowledge Quest CD - I do not know where ours came from.  I was told a Baan support person provided contact information on purchasing this CD.  If you have Baan source code you can always glance through that and see what it is like.  It is not hard, just a matter of learning what goes where and when.  I am still a newbie and I have been working on it(Baan Programming) for three years.  And on some really simple things you can use the &quot;Generate Session&quot; program.<br />
<br />
It would be really cool if someone posted a good tools document here. Any takers? :)<br />

<br />
you don't need a tools documentation. The kind of report you want to create, you should do it in the FST-Module in Finance. It is easy to handle.<br />
<br />
There you can set up all kind of account and dimension information. History data and budget. <br />
<br />
Have a look on the documentation CD-ROM in the installation Package, there should be some kind of documentation. If not ask again. <br />
<br />
Bye, Juli</div></div><hr />
