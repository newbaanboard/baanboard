<br />
I am facing a strange problem when users  with Windows 7 OS are taking reports from BaaN IV a message is being displayed<br />
&quot; An error has occured while running BW. For more information refer log file BW.log or netevent viewer&quot;<br />
<br />
if the user clicks 'OK' button on the message box entire session is closed<br />
<br />
i tried to check for BW.log &amp; netevent viewer in ttstoerrlog, but i couldn't find them. <br />
<br />
1. where can i find these files<br />
2. Any idea why this error is coming?<br />
3. How to avoid the error, because some of the finance sessions are getting locked as BW is closed abruptly<br />
4. Does this have any link with security settings<br />
<br />
Any help is welcome</div></div><hr />
