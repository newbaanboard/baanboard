all our users are connected via webui, and we commonly use the conditional formatting options to set color for records with specific conditions.<br />
But these conditions can be set only on the main table of the session. <br />
Is there a way, by adding code to the session script, to set the record color using more complex rules (i.e. with check on multiple tables)?<br />
Thanks <br />

I've never come across such scenario and, I don't believe that it is possible to achieve. Is it for a Custom Session or you're trying on a Standard Session?<br />
<br />
Which version of LN Application &amp; LN UI you are using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gianci</div><div class="date">3rd July 2017, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sasi and thanks for your reply.<br />
In this case, it would be for a customized version of a standard session (we have the source codes available).<br />
Our application current version is FP7, we have a migration project to 10.5 in progress.  Our web UI version is  10.10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the delayed reply. I believe there are few work-arounds' to achieve this. <br />
<br />
Could you give me a valid business case/scenario, so I can check and let you know the possibility?</div></div><hr />

An example of where this feature should be nice to have is the Inventory DashBoard.  Due to our distributed logistic, but with a single logistic LN company, sometimes users get confused.<br />
Our logistic is spread over 3 countries. Each country has several warehouses defined on LN, and these warehouses are coded in LN with a different initial digit (1,3 or 5) to help understanding which company a warehouse belongs to.<br />
<br />
When an item is common between our companies, it happens that it has stock on several warehouses of different companies. Therefore the total &quot;on hand&quot; quantity (on table tcibd100) is the sum of the stocks on many warehouses (on whwmd215).<br />
So users get confused when they see this value, and then operating on their local warehouse find that what they saw as &quot;on hand&quot; stock is not available.<br />
It should be nice to have those line (or field) highlighted in color, to let them know in advance that that value is a total, and to know the available quantity they should access the stock by warehouse. This result cannot be achieved with conditional formatting on the Inventory Dashboard, as these information are on another table.<br />
<br />
Hoping I have been clear<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You're correct in your statement that, the conditional formatting can't work on Multiple Tables.<br />
<br />
Because the On-Hand field is a sum of all the warehouses, we can't put a conditional formatting on that.<br />
<br />
I can quickly give you an idea / possible process that can be followed for this specific example.<br />
<br />
1. Highlight the On-Hand Quantity in the Inventory Dashboard Session (standard conditional formatting feature)<br />
2. Users must always go to the Warehouse-Item inventory Session to check the stock in their specific warehouses<br />
3. In the Warehouse-Item Inventory Session, we can restrict the users to see the inventory in the warehouses for which he/she is authorized for.<br />
<br />
I'm using ERP LN 10.5 version to map this and it worked for me. <br />
<br />
Please find the screen shots for your quick reference.<br />
