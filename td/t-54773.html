<br />
I am creating a session wherein I am to compare Quotations from different suppliers. For this they need the tax calculation break up as well.<br />
<br />
For this instead of writing out the logic, I tried using the DLL tctax.dll9141, namely the function tctax.dll9141.determine.aggregate.tax.amounts.per.line.<br />
<br />
Here, I need to pass only the Aggregate Tax Code, Tax Country, Price Calculations, Assesable Values, few flags and the arrays for returning the values for the tax layers.<br />
<br />
This is the DLL used in Tax Calculator as well.<br />
<br />
The DLL gives me all the values, correctly. However, sometimes when I run the session, the Baan gives the error &quot;server connection lost&quot; and terminates. This I believe is due to the memory manipulations taking place. The DLL makes it clear that I have to use free.mem.<br />
<br />
This is the first time I am using free.mem and alloc.mem. So, I am not sure of the exact usage. If a variable is declared, then before it is used in alloc.mem, do I have to do free.mem?<br />
<br />
Or is free.mem to be used, only at the program termination, as it is used in C (malloc and free)?<br />
<br />
Right now, I am freeing the memory as soon as report is being sent. One last question, after alloc.mem is done, do I need to necessarily do a free.mem before doing an alloc.mem? It is not mentioned anywhere in the Programmer's Guide.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
Cyril</div></div><hr />

I was not declaring the arrays as based and hence the error.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
