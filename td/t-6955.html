<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbclark79</div><div class="date">1st October 2002, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running BaanERp 5.0c SP7, porting set 7.1.3.4, BW Client 7.1c.04.147 on Windows 2000 with MS SQL 2000 RDBMS.<br />
<br />
Some of our users are getting kicked out of Baan (lost connection) when performing commands in debug mode.  The debugger is launched but the users are unable to step through the code or see any values.  All of the users having this problem are super users and they were copied from the user &quot;baan&quot;.  <br />
<br />
We also have many users that do NOT have this problem and their user data profile appears to be identical.  Same defaults, authorizations, developers data and database user.  Also, all users are using the same BW Client and client operating system.<br />
<br />
We performed a series of tests running the same debug object for two different users on the same PC - one user would work and the other would not.  We have not been able to determine any differences between the users that do work and those that do not work.  The problem seems to possibly point to an NT User configuration.  Has anyone ever encountered this problem?  Recommendations for problem solving?<br />

<br />
We have the same problem and we use NT machines.  I logged a call with Baan and they have referred it to their programmers, they recon its to do with the porting set.  I also get kicked out of Baan when in debug if I click on variables to see their values.  However if I type the variable instead it gives me the value and does not kick me out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This problem is really strange because we've tried a couple of other scenarios that have left us on a wild goose chase.<br />
<br />
Our &quot;baan&quot; Baan user is using &quot;baan&quot; NT user.  We copied &quot;baan&quot; Baan user to &quot;test&quot; using &quot;baan&quot; NT user.  We then logged into Baan via the &quot;-- -set USER=test&quot; configuration.  This user in fact got kicked out of Baan when attempting to use the debugger although the Baan user &quot;baan&quot; worked successfully.  This seems to indicate that it has nothing to do with the NT user.<br />
<br />
So then we took a look at the database user and both &quot;baan&quot; and &quot;test&quot; were using the same RDBMS user.  <br />
<br />
What further tests may anyone recommend????<br />
<br />
When we get kicked out of Baan the event viewer is showing:<br />
&quot;Exception C0000005 (Access Violation)&quot;<br />
