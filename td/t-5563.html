<br />
Whan conceptual question which will help me a lot is:<br />
What's happened when we link language dependant software component to component in original language (2)?<br />
(I do not copy or move nor overwrite component)<br />
For example:<br />
I link report in my (Croatian) language to original report in English. <br />
When some changes appear in original report - do I have to start &quot;link SW compo. to original language ... &quot; AGAIN, or I can only compile to make it apear OK in my language?<br />
<br />
The same question is for other language dependant SW components?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
Linked to Language field helps to maintain report layouts and reports in one main language, using labels. It eliminates translation of the report layouts, so you avoid having to paint the same change in the two different languages. Only the Report Description and the Labels need to be translated. Maintenance of reports becomes much easier in this way.<br />
<br />
The same concept apply to forms.<br />
<br />
Labels, messages and questions have to be created in the individual languages anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">21st June 2002, 11:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, <br />
it's ok, but<br />
I found in Baan documentation that copy and link are not the same things - are they or not?<br />
Baan said that with linking I save disk space - is it true ?<br />
When I compile linked report do I realy compile peace of original + language dependant part  and get object in my language?<br />
or I copy whole story and get object (where is there saving space?)<br />
<br />
And,<br />
when we get report from Baan (is it in binary form? or in source?) <br />
does my link breaks (or it is copy and link is kind of typefehler)?<br />
<br />
Is there a documentation on this subject to clear things up.<br />
(I now look into unix with ls -lau to see if something is copied/moved/linked/partialy linked/nothing if overwrite not allowed...<br />
  with this so trickie session ttadv6200m000) ...<br />
and help said ... treat with care ...<br />
And, I have to say - it is one of basic things to know when administering Baan - but so confusing and secret ????<br />
<br />
Thanks again <br />
(can't wait to see reply)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">24th June 2002, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">The reports (language dependent objects) do consist of several parts:<br />
1) The layouts (borders, lines, space, position of lables etc)<br />
2) The variables that will be filled with the data<br />
3) Logic on the report for calculating sums etc<br />
4) The data in the lables (which are language dependent)<br />
5) The data in the variables (which can be language dependent)<br />
etc<br />
<br />
Some of these are strictly not language dependent (1, 2, 3). These take diskspace, but in the database.<br />
<br />
Others are language dependent (4) they are in the database.<br />
<br />
Obviously the data (5) is never written to the object itself.<br />
<br />
When you link to other language, only the (mother) layout is changed when you change something in the type 1-3 parts. There modifications are stored in the native language of the report. All different language reports will be look-alikes.<br />
<br />
When you copy to other language, all of the (language independent) parts are copied to the other language. The layout of the report can be made completely different from the native language.<br />
<br />
All the parts 1-4 are compiled into one language dependent object. Part 5 is added at runtime.</div></div><hr />
