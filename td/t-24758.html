<br />
Search the threads for &quot;training&quot; or &quot;administration&quot; to get an idea of what exists but, in the end, you will come to the conclusion of:<br />
<br />
- there are no books<br />
- get some decent training on the area you want as starting point<br />
- get training on Operating Systems (try to cover Windows and a UNIX)<br />
- get training on a database<br />
- install a test database + Baan system<br />
- download the Baan quick guides and whatever Baan related documents you come across (uguides and so on)<br />
- play around with your test system (heavy play)<br />
<br />
And also search the threads for the above mentioned topics.<br />
Baanboard is a good place to get information on topics that cannot be found easily or get the contacts that can provide that information thru training.</div></div><hr />
