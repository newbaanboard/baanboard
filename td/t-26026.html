I only found one post on this site in the database area and it did not have any responses.  I also checked the support site and did not see anything there.  One of the users received this error while running tpcin1400m000 (Finalize invoices).<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually we had to replace the harddisk of the PC a couple of weeks later because of a disk crash. So it looks to me that this is an error message comming from BW when it is having trouble writing/reading to the PC's harddisk.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th January 2006, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The program in this case is tpcin1400m000 I know it does call some routines that creates the M12 file we use for milpac.  It just so happens that we have the code for the library and that is a distinct possibility.  I have not heard back from Baan or the user.   Thanks - this is something I can look into.</div></div><hr />
