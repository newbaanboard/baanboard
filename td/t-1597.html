<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">5th April 2002, 07:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all of you,<br />
What is the easiest way to move file between different directories through Baan program script. I tried using run.prog in which I execute a batch file that contains the command to copy. Is there exists any Baan function to do that? I guess how Baan does say in case of EDI programs.<br />
I am on Baan IVc3, NT SQL.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.<br />

<br />
Use bic_info to see correct syntax for functions (copy.file,move.file, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
 FILE.CP(3GL)<br />
<br />
 NAME<br />
      file.cp           Copy a file<br />
<br />
 SYNOPSIS<br />
      long file.cp(const string source, const <br />
string target)<br />
<br />
 DESCRIPTION<br />
      Copies file source to file target. Source <br />
and target  may be on a remote host (þhost!pathþ).<br />
<br />
 RETURN VALUE<br />
      The function returns 1 when successfull. A <br />
negative value will be returned on failure.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also just use bic_info on the tools files.  In the case of the ottdllfilehand most of the subroutines are documented.<br />

Good Luck!<br />

I used the copy.file() and move.file() as suggested above by our friend. Is the file.cp() a different function. The copy.file() and move.file() expects 3 arguments, two one are obvious but he third one is a lin and calle dby reference. Any ideas what is that? I too have knoweldge Base CD Under which section can I find bic_info information.<br />

Not sure if we have the same version, but you should be able to search for bic_info and find a few hits.<br />

<br />
this thread on ottdllfilehand helped me a lot. <br />
<br />
But I have a problem. <br />
<br />
We have a file pool directory in the baan server. Text files will keep coming in to this directory from many POS systems remote.<br />
<br />
I dont know the file name; First I want to a fetch a file from this  directory and use that file for appending a baan table and then move the file to another archive folder (move.file() helps here) and then move on to next file.<br />
<br />
How to fetch a file from a pre-defined directory one by one using the program script. Can &quot;ottdllfilehand&quot; help?  I dont know the file name, I want to read the directory and obtain the files one by one, HOW DO I DO THAT?<br />
<br />
any work-arounds, suggestions pls. <br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
<br />

I also have same question. I guess, one of the work around is get the listing of files in a file. And that is possible by doing die or ls. Read that file and get all the files in that directory.<br />
You may have to execute run.prog.<br />
