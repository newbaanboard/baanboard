today i downloaded the Ultra Edit trial version to test it in combination with Infor LN to open and edit scripts. I edited the script management parameters by user and entered uedit64 to open the script i want to edit. If i try to open a script ultra edit ist starting with a new empty tab. Does someone has experienced a similar problem and found a fixed? I tried to use the forum search here but i didnt found a usefull thread that solved my problem.<br />
<br />
thanks for you answers in advance!</div></div><hr />

This happens sometimes to me, too. But in generally it's working fine. I only had empty tabs, when I open scripts from multiple LN environments. The first one will always open just fine, the second may sometimes open as an empty tab.<br />
I don't have a fix. If it happens, I will close Ultraedit and open the second script alone and copy the complete script. Then I close Ultraedit again, open the first script, open a new tap and insert the second script. It does not happen often, so the workaround is fine to me.</div></div><hr />

Hey Andreas. Thanks for your response. In the meantime i figured out that i have the same behaviour like you. Im using your workaround now. If i figure out another solution i reply in this thread.</div></div><hr />
