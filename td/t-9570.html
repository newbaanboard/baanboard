<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">9th April 2003, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
We use Notepad and Baan's own &quot;Text&quot; editor for creating/updating Text fields.<br />
<br />
However, we've noticed on many instances that when a text has been entered using Notepad, the text doesnt print on many reports. Havent seen this happening all the time, but everytime a user reports that a particular text field has a value but isnt printing on a report, it turns out that the text field was entered using Notepad.<br />
<br />
I dont know if anyone else has encountered anything similar to this ?<br />
<br />
Also the users would prefer using Notepad compared to Text as they can cut n paste stuff from emails etc on to the text editor.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th April 2003, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Where are they cutting and pasting from?  We have had specific instances where users cut and paste from Word - and then have problems printing the text.  Sometimes it does not print and sometimes it does print, but with a lot of garbage.  What we found out was that when cutting and pasting between word and notepad you could not have any special formating in the text you were cutting from.  You really need to make sure that the text you are &quot;cutting&quot; is plain old text.  When we run into these problems we have to cut the text from Baan, put into into wordpad, save as plain text, re-open the file, cut it from wordpad, and then paste it back into baan.  Our users have become pretty good at copying/pasting text, so we do not run into it much.  Not sure if this could be the problem, but thought I would mention it.  We also had some initial problems with Office XP - in word we turned off some formating characters.  I will try to find that.<br />

Good Luck!<br />

I just mentioned that since users have to cut n paste thats y I cant have &quot;text&quot; as their default editors.<br />
<br />
But even on instances when they've manually entered some text using Notepad it doesnt print on Baan reports.<br />

We logged a case with Baan Support and they sent us a tools patch or a portingset update.</div></div><hr />
