<br />
If i have an ascii or excel file on the client machine; is there a way of developing a session in Baan IV c4 by which, i could read data from the file in client machine and generate a report with a script. I would like to write a session script in the same way that i read from one of the Baan tables. This needs to be done without taking this data to any table in Baan or without taking it to the server. Is this possible? If yes then.....<br />
<br />
If anybody could give me a small example of the coding that i have to create, it would be of great help.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">27th August 2003, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a look at these (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_client_file_access_synopsis) functions.  In BaanIV they work as well, since the DLL ottbwdll is present and working fine.<br />
<br />
Logic would be (very cryptic, I don't have the time right now to write an example script):<br />
[list=1]<br />
 Open local file (seq.open.local())<br />
 Read string from local file (seq.read.local())<br />
 If not an error, send to report (rprt.send())<br />
 If not error, iterate to step 2, else continue<br />
 Close local file (seq.close.local())<br />
[/list=1]</div></div><hr />

Have a look at the script below, you will have to do some research on the functions used. It can become tricky if you are using a delimited ASCII file vs. a fixed length file. All this script does is locate and read the file, it puts each line read into a variable and you will then have to parse the information out before sending it to the report. Rember there are many ways of doing this, but give this a try, its work for me in the past.<br />
Hope this helps<br />

However I am curious to understand as to why would you want to run a report out of Baan for a set of data (or text) already<br />

Based on your post it looks as if you are not even validating /<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th August 2003, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">He will need seq.open.local, seq.read.local and seq.close.local to get to the files on the client.  The example shows seq.open alone, which reads from the server only.  The rest of the syntax is the same i think, but for seq.open.local you must include the library ttdllbw (Libraries button on Maintain Program Scripts).</div></div><hr />

I tried to define as Brian mentioned, but it gave the error message &quot;file not located&quot; since the file is in the client machine. Then i tried the following script, but it gives an error message;<br />
<br />
        long fp1<br />
        string ascii.line(255)<br />
<br />
        fp1 = seq.open.local(sourcename, &quot;r&quot;,0)<br />
<br />
        if fp1 &gt;= 1 then<br />
        while seq.read.local(ascii.line, 255, fp1) = 0<br />
            prop = val(ascii.line(1;4))<br />
            item = ascii.line(5;20)<br />
            desc1 = ascii.line(21;50)<br />
            prgp = val(ascii.line(51;54))<br />
            desc2 = ascii.line(55;84)<br />
            rprt_send()<br />
        endwhile<br />
        else<br />
            message(&quot;file not located&quot;)<br />
        endif<br />
<br />
        seq.close.local(fp1)<br />
<br />
error message &quot;Argument 2 for function 'seq.read.local' should be call by reference. <br />
<br />
how could i solve this in the script and compile.<br />

seq.read.local() <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Syntax <br />
long seq.read.local( ref string buf, ref long size, long lfn ) <br />
Description <br />
Deprecated. This function is only supported for Baan Windows and its usage is therefore deprecated. Instead you should use function: client2server(). <br />
<br />
This reads a specified number of bytes from a specified file into buf. <br />
<br />
SSA ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide<br />
Client file access overview <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Use these functions to perform various operations on client files &#8211; for example: <br />
<br />
to open, read, write to, close, and delete files on a client <br />
to show a file open or directory chooser dialog on a client <br />
to transfer files between client and server <br />
to retrieve client file information <br />
to create and delete directories on a client <br />
to start an application on a client <br />
to retrieve client hostname and IP address <br />
Note<br />
You can use most of these functions both with the Baan Windows and with the Webtop client. However, some functions are only supported for the Baan Windows client and therefore deprecated.<br />
<br />
You should use client2server() function copy the local file to the server and then get the contents of the file using - seq.gets().</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">14th March 2006, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK it also works for BaanIV.

I'll use the server2client function to retrieve the file and then read <br />
it with seq.gets.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NirajKakodkar</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi  Jmathew,<br />
<br />
<br />
 fp1 = seq.open.local(sourcename,&quot;r&quot;,0)<br />
if fp1 =&gt; 1 then<br />
while seq.read.local(ascii.line,lfn,fp1) =&gt; 0<br />
prop = val(ascii.line(1;4))<br />
<br />
<br />
Hear only one record works correctly because , the function <br />
seq.read.local(ascii.line,lfn,fp1) instead of reading and inserting the line in your local file to the variable puts the entire content of the file to the variable ascii.line <br />
<br />
so next time in a loop in the second iteration it do not read ne thing and ascii.line will be equal to &quot; &quot; (blank)<br />
<br />
where as in case of seq.open<br />
we use <br />
seq.gets(ascii.line,255,fp1) = 0<br />
it reads line by line <br />
<br />
This is why only one record is read and updated in the table</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NirajKakodkar</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">hi ,<br />
<br />
Do any one know any function where in we can read the local file line by line<br />
<br />
i tried using while seq.read.local and then using a condition<br />
 if (buffer&lt;&gt;&quot;\0&quot;)<br />
<br />
but the problem here is at the first iteration itself it reads the entire file<br />
so obviously it has to reach the eof or carriage return<br />
so next iteration buffer empty<br />
<br />
Ne suggestion<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Niraj</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NirajKakodkar</div><div class="date">16th October 2006, 08:50</div></div><div class="posttext">hi ,<br />
<br />
Mark suggested me dis , this works fine <br />
<br />
if fp &gt;= 1 then<br />
while seq.read.local(buffer , 1 , fp) &gt;= 0 <br />
	if buffer = cr or lf then<br />
		process.record()<br />
		record = &quot;&quot;<br />
	else<br />
		record = record &amp; buffer<br />
	endif<br />
endwhile<br />
<br />
But copying to server and reading it according to experts is good rather then reading from client as there is a possibility of data loss if connection breaks in  between<br />
