The data itself is formed by a four digit code and 16 trailing spaces. <br />

<br />
The barcode is printed but without the spaces (&quot;1234&quot;). However if you put any character at the end (a &quot;.&quot; for example) the remaining spaces are printed OK (&quot;1234           .&quot;)<br />
<br />
This behaviour is the same if you use the escape characters from the famous 1310 quick guide or the field &quot;barcode type&quot; to print the barcode.<br />

How can we have the spaces printed?<br />

Try declaring the field as fixed in the script. It seems to me I had to do that for something - can not remember why I needed trailing spaces.</div></div><hr />

Hello Fred,<br />
Code128 is split in 3 different charactersets A / B / C<br />
<br />
If you're using Set C, the trailing spaces are ignored.<br />
I've tried with set A, the 16 trailing spaces are printed.<br />
<br />
See enclosure / attachment<br />
<br />

The question is...how do I select the character set from within Baan?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
