<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Youp2001</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for ways to fax a report from Baan ERP (5.0 c). I've found several threads about this issue, but as far as I can see now all these solutions require some user action. <br />
<br />
Here is what I want to achieve:<br />
<br />
Somewhere in Baan some information is stored required for faxing (fax number, attention etc.). At some point in the application I want to send a report to this defined fax number and person, without any user inter action, so the user should not notice this. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to achieve this??</div></div><hr />

I am actually working on an open source fax solution with baan ERP that should be ready in a few days (http://spoolfax.alioth.debian.org). What you may do, is to create a sessione to be called by the baan job daemon. This session might use any fax middleware you may select.<br />

There are a number of posting regarding Nazdaq products, just do a search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Youp2001</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Why should I create a new session for this. I assume I can include this in an existing session also? Or I can create a DLL for this purpose, or not? <br />
<br />
But still, is it possible if I have a fax number and an attention, can I then automatically send a fax to this number and with this attention (so, no user interaction) and what should I do exactly to achieve this. <br />
How do you set the fax number automatically and how can you set the attention etc.?</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you are planning to send a fax of a report to one single number<br />
and one name always (it appears as if you want to report in the background to a manager / officer), the number and descriptions can be stored in any  file / table.if it is multiple names and numbers same strategy can be adopted.else you can dynamically pick the data based on some input from your report.<br />
<br />
the final execution can be done as others have suggested using any of the fax options / software.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that most of the fax solutions that specificallly feature a Baan &quot;module&quot; provide a method to batch fax without user intervention.<br />
<br />
In our case, using a product from the Merkur Group, we have to  modify the report script to select the fax number (from supplier or customer related data in Baan) and put that into the report layout.  Depending on the fax Baan device selected by the user, the report script can prompt the user and give them the ability to overwrite the default fax number; otherwise, it just selects the fax number and adds it to the report layout without user intervention.  Some more recent solutions may not require modifying the report script to accomplish the same thing.</div></div><hr />
