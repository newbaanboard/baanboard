<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kevin_Rell</div><div class="date">30th July 2002, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running Baan IVc4 and the same Tools version.  Over the past 4-6 months, we have been experiencing some when.field.changes &quot;misfires&quot;.  We have various custom sessions that extend some totals based on a quantity being entered.   We are finding cases where the quantity was updated but the totals were not recalculated.  The recalculate and display code is in the when.field.changes event for the quantity field.  It happens very rarely and we have not been able to reproduce the error.  We are experiencing this behavior in two unrelated sessions and the behavior seems to have just started.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th July 2002, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I once had a session that for some reason the when.field.changes event only functioned when tabbing from field to field.  For some reason every now and then when I clicked to another field the when.field.changes event did get executed.  I was able to duplicate the problem, but it happened just like you state - seldom. I solved my problem by moving the code to the check.input event.  Then did a check.all.input to solve my problem.  Just wondering if you could duplicate the error by running the session and clicking to another field somewhere else on the form - not using the tab key.<br />
<br />
Another Baan session (Maintain Estimated Materials or Enter Material Issues not sure which one) has the same type problem.  Baan has told us to ALWAYS tab throught the fields to get all events firing correctly.  I never did hear the reason.<br />
