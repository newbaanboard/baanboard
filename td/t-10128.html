As far as I can tell, currency isn't involved in the session.<br />

Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference between running as 'batchjob' and under Job Management could be that when running under Job Management, you have logged in with a user ID that has a Package Combination/ Company Number that are different from that of 'batchjob' user ID.<br />
<br />
If that does not help then, it is possible that the Convert to Runtime DD for (Currency) Formats did not complete successfully. You can try that first, since that is the least harmful. (Remember to exit the bshell and restart before you run your session again!)<br />
<br />
Next, if you keep getting the message, check that a NEW currency that was introduced in a USER Company (i.e. other than 000) was ALSO introduced as a currency in the TOOLS System and its formats defined and converted to Runtime.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As to why the message comes, even when currency is not involved, I have not figured out. Maybe it is some internal intializations of the report writer system that calls for the currency information.</div></div><hr />

Are there any logs that I could check?</div></div><hr />
