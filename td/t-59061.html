<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">25th August 2010, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jenningspk,<br />
<br />
First off all welcome to this board. <br />
<br />
Years back I had the privilege to work with an as400 dba and he told me the same as you do.<br />
<br />
Baan uses companies to seperate several financial entities. The company numbers are used in tables as well since tables can be shared between companies. So if you want to copy a company to another one you normally need to export all data (in order to maintain integrity), renumber the company number with tccom0214m000 and import it again in another company.<br />
<br />
Within the application there is no real support for copy a single item/bom etc (unless you talk about e.g. archiving orders etc.). That's not that easy because due to all references it could be necessary to copy a lot of data.<br />
<br />
If you tell us what error you did run into we can probably assist.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Han</div></div><hr />

I have a copany created that is used for archiving and this is where I am trying to copy the data Oracle) could learn from the AS400 database.  Too much typing for commands and I programmed for over 19 years on the AS400.</div></div><hr />

The log can be found in $BSE/log directory on your unix server.<br />
I know it takes time to learn these things. Perhaps you can ask your implementation partner to assist in these things?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
as HAN suggest, have a look at the logfiles in $BSE/log.<br />
log.oracle8 and log.bshell6.1 or log.ba6.1 may give you hints to solve the problem.<br />
Are the source and target company in same PVRC ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jenningspk</div><div class="date">27th August 2010, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I first tried to create it using the sequential dump as I followed instructions from a former IT associate that worked here and I could not figure out how to place the sequential dump back into the 399 library.  Do you have instructions for this.<br />
Infor is telling me that I use the copy company.  <br />
The other thing I do not like about Baan iV c is you cannot delete old part numbers we presently have over 13,000 part numbers in the system and out of these over 1,000 are no longer used.  With all of these parts in the system it takes longer for Mrp TO RUN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th August 2010, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two sessions - ttaad4226m000(Create sequential Dump of table) and ttaad4227m000 (Create Table from Sequential Dump).  You can pick the company to load the dump into.  You can look at the help on the two sessions.  I don't really have instructions for the two sessions.  I have used them and the only thing I really recall is using the | as the field separator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">27th August 2010, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have many custom tables and when I archive, I have to do this to populate master tables and maintain referential integrity.<br />
<br />
In the attachment, I have documented the parameters I typically use.  The bill of material table; tibom010 is just an example.  You can run this for a range of tables, however be careful about the size of the dump.</div></div><hr />
