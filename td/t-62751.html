<br />
Summary will be in first page and in portrait <br />
and detail will be in next page and in landscape.<br />
<br />
Could you please tell me how to achieve this using single spool.<br />
<br />
Summary and Detail should come one after another on single Print.<br />
<br />
eg.<br />
Summary 1 ( Portrait)<br />
Detail 1 (Landscape)<br />
Summary 2 ( Portrait)<br />
Detail 2 (Landscape)</div></div><hr />

Typically the summary contains total or sum functions and the only way I see to get that first is to do it in the session script.  Then send the totals to the report just like a details line.  Easiest way I can think of reversing it.<br />
<br />
At least one other method comes to mind, but would probably be more complicated in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">22nd August 2012, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Look up the spool functions - that may show you some options.<br />
<br />
All in all, looks to me like too much programming anyways, just for cosmetic gains.<br />
<br />
So, unless it was dictated by customer demand and is a definite requirement, I would prefer to stay with 'standard' report writing, wherein I would to a minimum amount of programming and let the report writer system do all the work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">22nd August 2012, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done something similar by printing a different report per page, where each can have a different orientation, font, etc.  Use the 'brp' calls and close them in the right order.  The limitations are that you can't do totals/counts/page numbers within the report - you must do the calculations in your program script and pass them to the report.  Since the orientation is handled by the device, you will also have to know the device names for the landscape and portrait device that supports the same physical device.</div></div><hr />
