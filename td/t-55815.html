I´m trying to compile a program script customization, but I´m getting this strange message:<br />

See attachment.<br />

I have checked permissions, and no changes have done on the script.<br />

Anybody have seen this message before?<br />

Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

Yes I have checked on that directory and no core file found.<br />
<br />
I´m suspecting that is something SO related. Today I will try to compile that script on a HP9000 server to see if the flavor of the SO have something related.<br />

<br />
Are you allocating memory inside your script or are you using arrays?<br />
<br />
(alloc.mem / copy.mem )<br />
<br />
It is also possible that you have an hardware failure.<br />

No, I´m not using arrays on the script.<br />
The error trows when I´m trying to compile it.<br />
<br />
But sounds interesting about a memory fault.<br />
<br />
Have you faced a similar problem?<br />
<br />
Than you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe the following link is helpful:<br />
<br />
http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/<br />
<br />
If you can find the core file, you can investigate it using the quick guide 1841 &quot;Debugging a Core dump file&quot; from BaaN support.<br />

It seems like it is a SO problem related.<br />
I will perform some tests and I will post the results.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">13th May 2009, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">This may seem a bit silly, but sometimes, when I get errors when compiling a report, and there is no hint about what is wrong in the compiler output, I simply re-compile in debug mode and it gives usually some more messages that help fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Not sure if the same trick will work with a program script - but may be you may want to try.<br />
<br />
Seems like you have a bad copy of the compiler binary though. Maybe there is a update available for you at BAAN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">14th May 2009, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
Actually I have put a case on Infor. But guess what?<br />
No answer yet.<br />
<br />
And yes, I have tried several times to recompile my script, also in debbug mode, but the error are the same.<br />
<br />
The only variable is that I have perform a platform migration from HP UX to Intel-Red Hat. My other program scripts compile without problem. This is the only that I have found with problems.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">18th November 2014, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">HI grzegorz,<br />
In my case, the problem was in my script code.<br />
On that case, I had a long line with calculations and by mistake I continue with the calculation on the next line and I have a double plus sign. One at the end of the previous line and another at the beginning of the second.<br />
<br />
That was strange for me because when I compile that script under HP UX there is no problem.<br />
<br />
When I moved to RedHat the problem begun. But definitely It was my mistake.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th November 2014, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Like mig28mx mentions you might want to start commenting out sections of code to find where the problem might be coming from. Try compiling in debug mode as mentioned above.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">2nd December 2014, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Makiju,<br />
Once I have that problem with the same script program.<br />
In my case there were caused by two main factors:<br />
1.- the table of purchase orders lines tdpur041 had a lot of records (around 4 millions).<br />
2.- Database problem.- On that case I had Informix with a serious segmented table.<br />
<br />
To fix the first one problem, I had to customize the script in order to pass by some restrictions. The second one was a little harder due to in fact I had to defragment the whole database. But that was with Informix. If you have a powerfull db like Oracle, it offers you a lot of tools in order to identify the bottleneck that causes the slow execution.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">makiju</div><div class="date">2nd December 2014, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Our problem is related to compile in debug mode...this is not performance related.<br />
Compile works without debug ok. Script is customized. This is pretty hard to solve because we are on latest licmon -porting set. We have upgraded one environment to newer porting set with SLM, but now waiting for licenses which takes ages...ID 7125 should be server license, not user or concurrent. Compile with debug works ok on HP-UX<br />

On HPUx everything was ok.<br />
