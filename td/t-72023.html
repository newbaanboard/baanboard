<br />
We are running LN version 10.5.<br />
<br />
we have a problem with exporting special karakters out of LN. Exporting characters like üÜéÉ€ß with the function seq.puts() give us all kinds of unreadable characters in output .txt file.<br />
<br />
I've assigned this problem to Infor. Their reaction was that we have to use a function &quot;mb.export$&quot; for every field we export which contains these specials characters.<br />
<br />
Is their anyone who has had these problems before? Is their a better solution (like a parameter configuration) that makes the export of special characters more easier? Thanks in advance for your reaction.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
using function mb.export as mentioned by Infor is the solution we also use to solve that character output problem. I'm not aware of any other trick to overcome that issue.<br />

The Solution was to read the Multi byte text into multibyte strings and then they were stored into DB.<br />

String      multibyte.text mb<br />

This solved the problem.</div></div><hr />
