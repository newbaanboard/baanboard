1) IN Tools - Application Configuration - Formats - Formats by Generic Unit [ttaad1107m000] you can set the format for a particular used currency. If your monetary unit has a (too) low value like VEF you can ommit the decimals so it can hold up to ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ9-<br />
2) If that is not sufficient enough, (then probably also %A95 is insufficient) you can add a new Format Code in  ttadv485 using GTM and set its characteristics as required. In that case you can probably also replace the use of %A95 by %A96 in the reports where you get an overflow...</div></div><hr />

Google claims there are approximately 200 billion trillion stars in the universe. Lets see:<br />
200 000000000 000000000000 stars - that 24 chars in lenght. If I didn't make any errors.</div></div><hr />
