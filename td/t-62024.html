The client was under the impression that the INFOR conversion tool would basically allow him (after configuration) to push a button to get all his data converted to LN and then he could simply resume business in LN where he left it in 5c. Honestly I thought it would work like this as well. Now he is told that he has to manually re-enter the open S/O, P/O and production orders, essentially going through a cutover. He is also told that financial integration transactions won't make it over.<br />

Can you share your experience using the INFOR migration tool?</div></div><hr />

We have reviewed with Migration Labs, Infor, and B&amp;D.  I would contact all three as we received same information from one but other were able to bring all data over for us with having to reenter date.  Migration Labs was best fix for us.</div></div><hr />
