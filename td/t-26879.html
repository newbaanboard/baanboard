<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nokopi</div><div class="date">12th April 2006, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I try to access external table from baan session.  I created a baan table.  Then, I dropped the table within the database (not from baan) and created a database view to replace it.  The database view points to a remote table on another database.  If the remote table has 512 rows or fewer, baan session can read all the rows without any problem.  If the remote table has more than 512 rows, baan session will hang.  Is there any parameters I can set in baan to increase the number of rows fetched to maximum?<br />
<br />
Our company requires that we do not create an ascii output for external table to process within baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 00:19</div></div><div class="posttext">A few years ago we did the exact same thing that you did.  We did not have a row limit so I can not help with that.  The problem we ran into at that time was with the convert to runtime of other tables.  Everytime we made a table change the CRDD would fail.  If we re-did CRDD on that table it would drop the view and re-create a baan table.  Then we could do other CRDD's.  I am not sure that is an issue for you, but thought I would mention it.<br />
<br />
Also since you can not write an ASCII File can you write a middleware solution.  For one of our web apps it reads from one database and writes directly to the Baan table using an Oracle connection.  The only table this app has access to is this table.  It writes transactions by date - then the user can process these records into the project cost ledger whenever they feel like it.  This eliminated ASCII files, exports and imports, ftp and all of that stuff.</div></div><hr />

But keep in mind, that this works 99,9% ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanow</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">What is ur Baan version and if u have Open World then u can use OW JAMES to access external data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nokopi</div><div class="date">20th April 2006, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, everyone.  I found out what the problem is.  Some rows on the remote table (through the view) has null value on one of the columns.  Once I recreated the view to handle the null value, the Baan session retrieves all the rows.<br />
<br />
By the way, our Baan version is Baan 4 C3 with A&amp;D 2.2b.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rrankinmba</div><div class="date">5th March 2010, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to establish a link via a Linked Server on the Baan SQL Server DB to another SQL Server DB much the same as this post.  We drop the Baan table and add a view pointed to the other DB.  No matter how we tweak it Baan is giving either an Error 8329 or 1229.<br />
<br />
Any advise would be apprieciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
