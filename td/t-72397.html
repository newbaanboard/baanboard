<br />
First of all, I have no access to standard program scripts including the standard libraries. <br />
I need to calculate Price Simulator (Session tdpcg0200m300) from other session (customized) so I need the standard DLL that does exactly as the Calculate button in that session does.<br />
I have searched for it in this forum but found nothing.<br />
Anyone kind enough to share this please?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am trying to do the Pricing.SimulateSalesPrice as you suggested.<br />
The document says it needs DLL tdextpcgapi, so I added this line in my script.<br />
#pragma used dll &quot;otdextpcgapi&quot;<br />
But when I compiled it, it gave me this error.<br />
otdextpcgapi: No such file or directory<br />
Fatal Error: Can't open DLL 'otdextpcgapi' for reading<br />
When I looked into it to find if the DLL is actually existed, it is indeed not there.<br />
I put the whole Pricing.SimulateSalesPrice function in the program script too but it seems it cannot find the needed DLL.<br />
What am I missing?</div></div><hr />
