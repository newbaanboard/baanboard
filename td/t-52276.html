Im trying to obtain the opening balances in a report, <br />
Here is my code<br />
	select 	tfgld206.year, tfgld206.dim3, tfgld206.leac, sum(tfgld206.fobh):imp.erogado1, sum(tfgld206.nobh):imp.erogado2<br />
	from	tfgld206<br />
	where	tfgld206.leac between :tfgld804.lacm and :tfgld804.lact<br />
	and	tfgld206.year = :year.c<br />
	and	tfgld206.dim3 inrange :tfgld804.di3f and :tfgld804.di3t<br />
	group by	tfgld206.year, tfgld206.dim3, tfgld206.leac<br />
	selectdo<br />
		sa = imp.erogado1 - imp.erogado2<br />
	endselect<br />
	<br />
	imp.erogado = round((sa + imp.erogado )/tc.prom,0,2)<br />
<br />
but it seems that I´m only obtaining the last dimension defined by tfgld804.di3t, that is wrong due to I want to obain from tfgld804.di3f and tfgld804.di3t range...<br />
Any ideas?<br />
Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd May 2008, 21:52</div></div><div class="posttext">First from what I have read inrange and between are the same unless using combined fields.  So make sure those tfgld804 fields are structured correct.  Next validate some data for that range.  Then I would take turn commenting out each of the lines to see which one is causing it to fail. As long as year.c is filled correct I do not see in being a problem, but I can see where if those inrange checks are not correct then you might have this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">22nd May 2008, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Mark,<br />
The fields tfgld804.di3f and tfgd804.di3t are not combined fields. I have done some tests and when tfgld804.di3f = tfgld804.di3t, I mean, there is only one dimension, this problem not appear.<br />
So I don´t know why only the tfgld804.di3t are used...<br />
any othe idea?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd May 2008, 03:20</div></div><div class="posttext">What I was saying was - in this case inrange and between are the same.  You use between when using a combined field.  Since these are not combined fields then I would use inrange just to make it consistent.<br />
<br />
Second here is how I debug a select statement - first I would comment out the or year piece and the in range on dim3.  Did I get what I expected.  If no - then the problem might be with the where on leac.  If yes- then add in year.  Again did I get what I expected?  If no then problem might be with year.  If yes - add in the dim3 inrange piece.  Again -did I get what I expected?  No - then there is the problem.  If yes then the query was correct - could it be the report?<br />
<br />
In this case the first thing you need to do is make sure the inrange variables are formatted correctly.  I have seen field not formatted the same - so are dim and leac same lenght, same justification?  These are basic things that I check - since I do not have a 804 table I do not have a clue how things are formatted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has to be INSIDE the selectdo to get all the dimensions you require.<br />
<br />
If it is AFTER the <br />
<br />
imp.erogado = round((sa + imp.erogado )/tc.prom,0,2)<br />
<br />
then, you WILL get only the last dimension.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">23rd May 2008, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Mark and sha_bs,<br />
I debuged the code and I realize that I have used the built in SUM in the select, so i eliminated that SUM and use the old-fashion algorithm to do that sum manually.<br />
<br />
I never have realized that SUM function do that.<br />
But at least my problem was solved.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th May 2008, 02:06</div></div><div class="posttext">You should be able to use the sum function - it would just need to be inside the select do as shah suggest. I might not be understanding what the end results are.  Glad you solved it.</div></div><hr />
