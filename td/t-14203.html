<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">15th January 2004, 21:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you declared all of these variables in your report script or in report input fields? If you are trying to use some predefined variables, make sure you are using the right once. For example, I donÂ’t see any predefined variable called latrr.layout.id$ in our version BaaN.<br />
<br />
Also, post your report script for reference.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<br />
If so, did you close everything you opened?  (EG: select without an endselect, if without an endif, { without a }, ...)<br />
<br />
If not, maybe you used a reserved word for a variable name?  Guessing there :) <br />

You may want to manually check the report to see if the generate session caused the report to be created with errors.  I actually think the repgen(report compiler) program is causing the problem and may need a tools patch.  It seems to me that we have received new tools releases that have cause the report compiler stopped working.  I think it has happened twice, but it has been a while.  I would report this to Baan.<br />

good luck.</div></div><hr />

I Guess the problem is with the porting set, rather the tools version. Check put if all the SP's  of the Tools are installed.<br />
