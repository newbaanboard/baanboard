I tried language$ and it is an error.  Is there special function that determines the language of the report or user anything that I can use pass in my SQL statement that dynamically capture a language that report is printed instead of hardcoding it?</div></div><hr />

Please refer to it.<br />
You should be feeding clan.e with those 1 character values and then you can achieve your requirement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">13th December 2016, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are you creating custom tables for multi language descriptions? LN (in Unicode mode) has standard support for multi language application data fields. The Enterprise Server Administration Guide has a chapter &quot;Multilanguage Application Data&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eric.dizon</div><div class="date">13th December 2016, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">But what I like to acheive is the report's language not the user's language.  I was expecting 5 = Spanish and it was showing 1 = English instead.   And I am trying to execute this inside the Sales Order Acknowledgement report script.   Any more other special keyword to retrieve report language and in the XML of the SSRS report for language it is passing 5 I would just need to get that value before it gets written to the SSRS language.  I don't have development source code for LN.</div></div><hr />

but it is returning 1 which is the user_Data language, not the report language as shown in my attachment.  How do I extract the report language instead of uesr language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pillai.ganesh</div><div class="date">14th December 2016, 07:39</div></div><div class="posttext">The architecture of &quot;Infor Enterprise Server Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services&quot; is such that; all the data that is to be printed is first processed at LN level and a xml file is given as datasource to SSRS.<br />
<br />
The name of this file could be-<br />
${BSE_TMP}\ier_[your name]_[report name].xml<br />
<br />
Thus your report script is also executed before the control is transferred to SSRS. Which means your Report Language at SSRS level has no significance at the LN report script level.<br />
<br />
I understand that your user's language is English and he wants to print only this particular report in Spanish. This can be achieved by adding a single character input field on the LN session. Where before running the report; user will enter 5. And in the program you must use this field instead of language$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">14th December 2016, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">language$ is the user language. lattr.language$ is the report language.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't knowing that lattr.language$ can be different than language$. Can you also please share the parameter where the report language can be set for LN report.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is an immature doubt :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">14th December 2016, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">This is set in the print session by opening the report in that specific language, with function brp.open.language(). This is done in print sessions that print documents for e.g. business partners. The language is then determined based on the language of the business partner. Relations between BP languages and system languages are stored in tcmcs0146m000.<br />
Moreover, you can overrule the language in the Select Device dialog: Select Language...</div></div><hr />
