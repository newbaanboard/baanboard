<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rohan_rege</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">i have created a exchange scheme for exporting data from tables tdpur050 and tdpur051.......<br />
<br />
<br />
but its taking a lot of time bcoz in the exchange scheme<br />
<br />
i first pull data from tdpur051 which is PO lines  History table<br />
and then the rest of the fields in the same ASCII file relevant to PO header History table are pulled for each PO line using a select query in a condition for each PO header field.<br />
<br />
this takes a lot of time ...but this is the requirement where i have to club the tdpur051 and tdpur050 data in one ascii file...<br />
<br />
i am thinking of switching from exchange scheme to programming<br />
where i will do a select join on the two tables and then<br />
in the select do write the selected record one by one to a ASCII file....<br />
<br />
has anyone done something like this ...?<br />
<br />
I wud like someone to share a similar script<br />
<br />
Mainly i need the part of code to write the record selected to a ASCII file ,such that the fields are delimited by a tilde ~<br />
<br />
bcoz i have not done this before , and i have a time constraint..<br />
where in i cant afford to waste time trying things out..<br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone has a sample code for writing selected records to <br />
ASCII file by delimiting the fields by either tilde or any other delimiting character...pls do reply<br />

<br />
I have created several ascii files (formatted in any way I want) using the following procedure:<br />
<br />
I use &quot;Generate Session&quot; to create a report session.<br />
Let Baan create the report script etc...<br />
In the report detail, layout the data how you want it<br />
If you want a tilde between fields, just put it on the screen.<br />
<br />
When you finish, run the report then output to ASCIIF; give it a file name and presto....<br />
<br />
In the Script for the session you can massage the SELECT statement to do any table merging, selection criteria, sorting etc....<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</div></div><hr />

You can print to csv file and the benefit is that you can fit many fields accross the page. Safari will export the full field even if the feild in the layout is very narrow.<br />
<br />
The other option is easy SQL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rohan_rege</div><div class="date">18th October 2002, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">hi , <br />
<br />
Whats this Safari .....is it free download...or we have to purchase it...is there any doc. on it available...<br />
<br />
can u throw some more light on what this safari is abt ?<br />
<br />
also i have heard abt Easy SQL but never used it...any idea ...<br />
if we have any doc.on it also on baan board...<br />
<br />
also how does easy sql help me for my purpose....?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks a lot <br />
Rohan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dansimmo</div><div class="date">20th October 2002, 02:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Safari is an external report writer that was aligned with baan but i think is no longer. It costs money unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Easy SQL is good because you do not need to create sessions and it will write some of the sql for you. You can then edit the sql for more complex queries and edit the report. Reports can also be included on users menus (if you use the DEM menus) vie the execute query session. Also can be made into jobs.<br />
<br />
In the baan report it is easy to place delimiters between fields and the baan date and time stamp are available as standard.</div></div><hr />
