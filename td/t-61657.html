Please mention the standard report.</div></div><hr />

Are you wanting a report like tfgld1406m000?  I think it prints the details or are you wanting something else?  I mean I can see two ways to get the details of a summary report - modify the source code to send the detail transactions if the summary is done in the script.  Or the second is if the summary is done in the report - change or clone the report to include a details line to print.<br />
<br />
If you are asking what query to run to show which tables the data is in - that is something different.  Never had to mess much in that area so I do not know all the tables to do something like you are requesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Standard report is &quot;tfgld1406m000&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then what's the problem with tfgld1406m000 (eliminating it's detail lines if required)</div></div><hr />
