If you have duplicated it from standard, there might be a missing compiled object for it. You need to copy the form into your own VRC. Compile it and then duplicate it or edit it as per your requirement.<br />

Did you generate the form dump of the form in Session &quot;Maintain Forms&quot; (ttaad3100s000) ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th October 2015, 15:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Check on the file system - I was had a form(and session) that was created and owned by a different user.  It looked like the dump and compile was working but it was not overwriting it on the UNIX file system.  You can always clear out the objects and try compiling again.<br />
<br />
This does not sound like your case, but I once had a form and session that were corrupt somehow - I ended up having no choice but to completely delete the session, forms and script.  I could not edit or compile anything, much less run it. I did make a copy of the script.  Once I was sure I had everything deleted - including runtime data dictionary.  I created it from scratch again and it worked.  Usually I have had only corrupt forms that I could not edit, deleted and recreated them.</div></div><hr />
