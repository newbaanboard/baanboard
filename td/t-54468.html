  <br />
I am working with Infor Ln 6.1.  <br />
  <br />
I have worked before with Baan IV and Baan V, in these ERP's not exists the concept of sessions integrated, then when we made the installation dumps, we attached to the project the sessions and the forms one by one for separate.  <br />
Now in LN appears the concept of sessions integrated.  <br />
My question is:   <br />
Should I attach only sessions integrated or too the sessions, the forms and the sessions integrated for separate?  <br />
  <br />
Anybody can help me with this explanation?<br />
<br />
Thank you.............</div></div><hr />

That includes the form and session.  You still need to include the script source separately if you would like it included in the project/dump.<br />

  <br />
I understand you, but There is one thing that is not cleared for me, because when I look for in the target installation I see the form as component in ttadv300. That is to say, this is  the dump do it always when I dump it on the target installation....<br />
<br />
Thank you for your advice......</div></div><hr />
