I mean since we r using Work top can we create static forms in LN.</div></div><hr />

- You can make a new static form , you can compile it, seemingly. BUT <br />
--- When it compiles , the resulting file will be put in the directory for dynamic forms and not in the directory where the imported static form resides. Dubious.<br />
--- I have not found a way to connect it to the session. Seems like a showstopper if you can't find a way.</div></div><hr />

Mahesh, Pellus,<br />
<br />
Based on the LN Tools Development Methodology all Sessions/Forms are Integrated/Dynamic. This is the Go-forward strategy for Thin Client Compatibility. You have to adopt to the changing Tools by Versions and start using DFE (Dynamic Form Editor).<br />
<br />
--- When it compiles , the resulting file will be put in the directory for dynamic forms and not in the directory where the imported static form resides. Dubious.<br />
There is nothing dubious, you have to understand how the new versions of Tools work. All dynamic form dumps/objects are created a directory $BSE/application/package-VRC/fpackage-module-0 (for example, /app/lms/lmss/opt/bse/application/baseline/zmB52U_a_mlgd/fzmadm0). In the previous BaaN versions with static forms, the last digit is represented the language the form was created/copied/compiled. In case of dynamic forms, it is always 0.<br />
--- I have not found a way to connect it to the session. Seems like a showstopper if you can't find a way.<br />
You cannot connect, because, all Sessions/Forms are expected to be Integrated/Dynamic. <br />

It is : The static works if you import and NEVER modify/translate the form after that. In all other cases (which should be 99 % of the cases) go with the new dynamic way.</div></div><hr />
