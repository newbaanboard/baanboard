This is what I want to achieve:<br />
A (dynamic) formfield will be filled by a barcode scanner which fills in an (EAN) number followed by &quot;tab&quot;. As soon as the scanned code is entered (last field of the form) the (default) button cont.process must be executed.<br />
<br />
To avoid possible redundancy it is not allowed to use execute(cont.process) here. Where there acceptable alternatives? Which?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My solution was not very good, but it worked for us.  I put a continue button on the form. After the last field followed by the tab, the focus moved to the continue button.  Then I put a barcode on the tag that sais process(or something like that) and when the user scanned it, it did a return.  This ran the choice.continue button.  So the tag contained 7 or 8 fields of data and a continue bar code.  The user could just scan one barcode at a time.  They could fly thru a stack of tags in minutes - never even looking at the screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">18th September 2012, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the move and the option. I have been thinking of it too, but I assumed there also was a nice &quot;automated&quot; way. In your solution an intermediate barcode needs to be scanned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Program your Barcode scanner to append &quot;TAB&quot; after each scan (this is supported by all major Barcode scanner),  in 'after.field' section of barcode field you can call any function or standard button using execute(any std option) function.</div></div><hr />

- in the when.field.changes, call a function<br />
- in the called function, say execute<br />
The warning should go away.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it is just a warning message, it will work, and depending on situation of your company policy about such way of making code changes, you could choose to make the change as you first planned.</div></div><hr />

Confirmed. Anyway because of the high volume scanning I would rather not run into the risk of recursion. Thanks for the option. I will use this one.</div></div><hr />
