<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">14th November 2005, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all , I got error like &quot;index out pf dim error&quot;  when I wanne edit my form. In fact everthing goes very well but I added some fields to the form. Ad it worked. After I added another new fields and ordered desing of the form and saved it. When I want to edit I got it ! . Now I couldn't open it. I search some threads about this problem. I did suggestions like coping form, remove the form layout from ttadv304 tables. But they are failed. Does ANYONE know this problem reason and solution ? It is very strange problem for baan. I am lucky because My form didn't contain so many fields and complex design. May be re-create form is best solution but I wonder main reason of the problem .<br />
<br />
THanks All for your suggestions ....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">15th November 2005, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">HEY! I am bored !!!! Same things happened again ! OUT OF DIMS....!!!<br />
I think that anyone knows the main reason of the problem !!! I read some threads  and I awared of something. I think that problem is concerned with LAYOUTs of the form. I created again and it worked and then I add some fields. Sum of my fields' count is 50<br />
there is a baan table like TTADV304. there is a layout field (CHAR 255) for forms. <br />
I delete my form from this table. But it isn't successful. But I think problem should be concern with layout and its limits !!!<br />
<br />
THANKS IN ADVICE !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">15th November 2005, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Try to position your fields not till the last position of your form. I.e. if your form is 132 pos. width, don't position fields till the last position, but till max. let's say 100th position. Let us know if this helps. I think by me this would solve the problem in the past, although this kind of thing didn't happen to me for long!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beginer</div><div class="date">16th November 2005, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes , I too agree with en@frrom.<br />
<br />
I also used to face the problem frequently but then i started defining the fields till 130 instead of till 132.<br />
<br />
The similar thing is found while Report Maintenance. Here there is no error popped up but while moving from one layout to another the login is disconnected.<br />
Absolutely Wiered !!!!<br />
<br />
But here also the same solution......works.</div></div><hr />

Save, then switch it back to the correct form type and it fixed it.</div></div><hr />
