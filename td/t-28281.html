<br />
I want to write a script wherein you can search for any itemcode based on their description.  somewhat like searchkey option. but one should not zoom to another display session for searching the item. searching process should be on the same screen and should start as u enter a character (description should be sorted). example is shown in the attached document. <br />
please suggest....<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">30th September 2006, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK , there is no event triggered on an input field as u keep on typing . So executing a search code for each key press on an input field may not be possible in Baan Iv . Dont know about the later versions. <br />
<br />
Also from performance perspectives , such feature may be slow and it can be more useful for small database with VB kind of front ends (where client  is executing the code) that too for an indexed fields only (unlike description) . In a client server ERP application like baan this may be difficult to use even if there is an event triggered at each key press on an input .</div></div><hr />

There is a new feature in the Reger, Gemini/LN Tools. Refer to -<br />
fields.autocomplete() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_form_and_form_field_operations_fields_autocomplete)<br />
<br />
fields.autocomplete()<br />
Syntax<br />
<br />
void fields.autocomplete( long try.autocomplete [ , string field_name(18) ] ... )<br />
Description<br />
<br />
Auto-complete is automatically executed by the 4GLE for fields that have a reference path to another table and have a zoom session and has no button and is not segmented. With this function auto-complete can be turned off ( try.autocomplete = FALSE ) and on again ( try.autocomplete = TRUE ).<br />
<br />
For array fields, the element number should be sent as part of the string, between brackets. See example<br />
Context<br />
<br />
4GL library function.<br />
Example<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
     fields.autocomplete(FALSE, &quot;ttadv200.cmod&quot;, &quot;ttadv200.cmop(2)&quot; )</div></div><hr />

<br />
But still it will not help in trimming the selection as user keeps entering  field value . Vaishali needs  that a selection be shown and trimmed as users keeps on entering keys on keyboard .</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe you can use this:<br />
<br />
Just create e.g. 30 Fields of length one. After each input you search for the result list:<br />
You can programm your SQL with the after.input event of the fields.<br />
With the proper field order it should work.<br />
<br />
|T|E|S|T| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |<br />
<br />
Resultset. (could be a included Formtype 2).<br />
|TEST                              |<br />
|TEST1                            |<br />
|TEST123                        |<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">3rd October 2006, 11:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I can think only of one way, but depending on the number of items you have in your table, you will always notice serious performance slow-down...<br />
<br />
For my idea you need to have an ascii file somewhere on disk (for instance ${BSE}/items/items) containing all the item descriptions the same way as they are stored in the Baan table. During runtime you create an object (function create.object() ), which will be the form field (so no field defined on the form), and in this field will be listed all the descriptions. Then you can just start your input and have the autocomplete functionality of Windows. In another form-field next to the description, you fill the item code (which you fetch via a query on user's selected description).<br />
<br />
It is a bit a different mindset, but it must work. I didn't try it now, but if you need assistance I can try to give you some conceptual example of the code I suggest.<br />
