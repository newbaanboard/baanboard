<br />
Does anybody know how to integrate security certificates in LN?<br />
Example: we need to approve purchase orders but for security reasons only one person can do that and we should have a strong mechanism for precisely identify that person, for example by a security certificate.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

I'm not a Functional expert, I believe you can enable the Document Authorization in LN which is integrated with ION for the PO approval.<br />

<br />
Just wanted to add few things to what Mr. Nprao had mentioned.<br />
<br />
1. Yes, you can use Infor ION for Document Approvals<br />
2. I believe from LN 10.4.1 version onwards, Infor have given the standard feature (within LN) to enable/disable the Document Authorizations. Using this option, you can integrate your LN with ION for Purchase Order Approval<br />
<br />
Prior to LN 10.4.1 version, only purchase requisition approval is supported by standard, and we have to customize the Order Approvals.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps you. If you need more details about the Approval process in ION, stay in touch. I'll be happy to help you!</div></div><hr />
