   I am currently working on BaaN IVc4 under windows NT environment and writing an update session which reads input file containing two fields, item code and purchase price in the delimited format. And also I am accepting the input file name from the user using the form field. The external form field accepts the value like &quot;d:\baan\admintmp\pur_price.txt&quot;. The declared form field in the program script showing the field value as &quot;d:\\baan\\admintmp\\pur_price.txt&quot;. It shows 2 backward slashes for each backward slashes. I worked all the time in the unix environment and used to use forward slashes. This the first time I am working on NT and MS SQL database. Can anyone please help me how to avoid duplicating the back slashes so that I can able to read the input file?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I think that there is a problem in your logic but if user every time put files under the admintmp then you can determine it shared folder on NT. Then you only use field on the form  to get file name from user.<br />
Then in your program construct your path for NT like mine ( think that filetmp is shared folder)<br />
<br />
   filepath = &quot;\\server01\filetmp\&quot; &amp; userfilename <br />
<br />
<br />
I hope it may help you ! <br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

<br />
May be it is domain related problem, try changing it or try removing slashes by programming.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also try something like in your script:<br />
<br />
${HOME}/admintmp/pur_price.txt<br />
<br />
All the best.<br />

This does not prevent me from opening and uploading the client file.  What kind of error are you getting when trying to read the file?</div></div><hr />

      Even I tried to hard coding in the program like the following<br />
<br />
asci.f = &quot;d:\baan\admintmp\pur_price.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
where asci.f is the variable declared in the programming. Still it shows like <br />
d:\\baan\\admintmp\\pur_price.txt. When I open the file it gives error return code -2. But, if I use forward slash it is not duplicating.<br />

Seq.open should be used for a file relative to the server and seq.open.local is for a file with a path relative to the client.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">17th November 2006, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Because ASCII strings can have control characters like \n for new line, when you want to actually use a \ it requires a second \ to tell the system that you really want to use a \.<br />
<br />
I don't think your problem is the \, but that there is either a misspelled directory, permisssions in one of the directories, or file that does not exist.  For quite some time the porting set will convert the \ properly for you if you want to use a / instead.  Sometime just the initial D:/ has to be used then the rest can be \\. <br />
<br />
Please update your post with your results for the next person that has the problem.</div></div><hr />

   Thank you very much for all for your valuable input to resolve the issue. The problem is resolved on Friday. So, I am updating and it may be useful for others if they have the similar kind of problem. Per the input from you all, I analyzed my code and removed the drive d:\ and used like this &quot;\\baan\tmp\pur_price.txt&quot; and it worked fine eventhough it was duplicating the backflush.<br />
