<br />
anybody tried to read out the function stack at runtime, for example to do error logging? any thoughts about that, do you think it's possible?<br />

Can you elaborate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hwstow</div><div class="date">13th January 2014, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">What i want to do is adding a logging function to a DLL/ueDLL, that is capable to log what process called it and which functions (and parameters) were called to reach this point. The same information, that is logged when a fatal error appears or if you click &quot;stack&quot; in debugger. The object/prcoess itself should have this data, and maybe there is a way to retrieve it. I searched the tt libraries for useful functions but could not find anything. Just thought i can't be the only one that want's to do this.</div></div><hr />

You can trace your bshell to get all this information. You have a lot of options like getting object information, getting program flow, getting database actions etc. You can just set a trace to your session, go through the processes and take the trace file which will cover a lot of things.</div></div><hr />

Refer to -  How Do I know what dll gets the program flow  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=52702&amp;highlight=program+flow)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your replies, but the point is i don't want to do a trace. I wan't to log the stack independent to the environment settings because i don't know when which bshell process will produce an error. Therefore i am trying to fetch this information at runtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">14th January 2014, 11:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly!<br />
<br />
You don't know which processes are executed at the run-time and hence comes the logger into picture. As mentioned, if you want the logs/traces, setting the Debugging BW Commands which Prashant has mentioned in the thread or taking a trace using BW logger (ttstpbshdebug) is the only way to identify the things you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Not sure what exactly are you trying to ask, you should check the link Prashant has mentioned in his signature.<br />
<br />
May be you want to produce your own log files like what the system does using some inbuilt tools functions/dll's in your Program Script. But I am afraid, they might not be compatible to your 4GL scripts or may be out of its scope. Again, not sure what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Also, for other system based logs you can use:- ttstperrlog</div></div><hr />
