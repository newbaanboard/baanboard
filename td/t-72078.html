    I made a Sync. session between maintain session(main-session) and display session(sub-session). The number of records for display session(sub-session) may exceed the form limit(eg.Occurrences=6). But when I set the scrollbar status(fattr.scrollbar = true) in the script for the sub-session,When click on the vertical scrollbar of sub-session, the next.set action is performed on the main-session.<br />
    I think it's probably the control that's been transferred to the main-session through function witch.to.process(parent) (in the sub-session) at this point.(But the forms of the two sessions don't overlap!?)So how can I clicked vertical scrollbar on the sub-session and produce an action that only works on the sub-session?<br />
    Thanks for any suggestions!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd August 2019, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep bottom session was really the main session. Below snippet of code.<br />
<br />
choice.next.view:<br />
after.choice:<br />
	hold.rfq = tdexi010.rfqnum<br />
	export(&quot;hold.rfq&quot;, hold.rfq)<br />
	instruction = next.set<br />
	switch.to.process(process.exi0109,SWITCH.SAME.SIZE + SWITCH.WITHOUT.INTERACTION)<br />
	import(&quot;hold.rfq&quot;, hold.rfq)<br />
	tdexi010.rfqnum = hold.rfq<br />
	get.header.text()<br />
	execute(find.data)<br />
	execute(first.set)</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much Mark, I did some tests, never found a good way to solve this problem, and finally I decided to give up this idea.<br />
Thank you for your help!</div></div><hr />
