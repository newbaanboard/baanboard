<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Number of days from one date to another is simply the difference between the days .<br />
<br />
no_of_days = abs(date1 - date2)<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure whether u r asking for this only. If not , please elaborate ur question preferably with an example .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 20:15</div></div><div class="posttext">What hitesh said - with the exception that if you are counting &quot;work&quot; days then there needs to be a company calendar somewhere with the non work days defined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raynathan</div><div class="date">2nd February 2008, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry quys. I need to conut woorkdays and I can't find that company calendar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 04:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you running the manufacturing module?  I know there is another calendar somewhere, but the two tirou4xx tables contain what is and isn't a work day and those are what I use.  I will look for the other table tomorrow when I get to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to arrive at work day you roughly divide by 7 and multiply by 5.So say if the difference is 21 then work days would be 15.If you get some number not divisble by 7 for e.g.23 then find the lowest multiple of 7 and multipy by 5/7 and add the remainder,so in this way 23 calendardays would result in 17 working days. Ofcourse, you can build holidays etc in this calculation.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
generate company calender an you have one.<br />
It's used for whole company.<br />
With kind of days you're able to define holidays and non working days.<br />
<br />
It's just a simple click.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
the table tppss030 is for project modul.<br />
<br />
Why not &quot;one click&quot;, session tirou4204m000 creates the &quot;Standard Company Calender&quot; from Date to Date.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
