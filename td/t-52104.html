First I know this would work:<br />
select ...<br />
...<br />
and     warehouse in (&quot;CH1&quot;, &quot;CHF&quot;, &quot;CHE&quot;)<br />
...<br />
<br />
So I wonder in the following:<br />
if foreign.flag = true then<br />
    cwar.1 = &quot;CH1&quot;<br />
    cwar.2 = &quot;CHF&quot;<br />
    cwar.3 = &quot;CHE&quot;<br />
else<br />
    cwar.1 = &quot;UN1&quot;<br />
    cwar.2 = &quot;UNF&quot;<br />
    cwar.3 = &quot;UNE&quot;<br />
endif<br />
<br />
select ...<br />
...<br />
and     warehouse in (cwar.1, cwar.2, cwar.3)<br />
...<br />
But like the code I wrote, it says error. How to solve it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
in Baan this is usually coded as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
       if foreign.flag = true then<br />
              cwar.1 = &quot;CH1&quot;<br />
              cwar.2 = &quot;CHF&quot;<br />
              cwar.3 = &quot;CHE&quot;<br />
       else<br />
              cwar.1 = &quot;UN1&quot;<br />
              cwar.2 = &quot;UNF&quot;<br />
              cwar.3 = &quot;UNE&quot;<br />
       endif<br />
<br />
       select   ....<br />
       from     ....<br />
       where   ....<br />
       and (warehouse=:cwar.1 or warehouse=:cwar.2 or warehouse=:cwar.3)<br />
       ....<br />
<br />
<br />
but on second thought I think you just forgot to add the semicolons :rolleyes: these are needed as cwar.1 etc are bounded variables. Try this:<br />
<br />
     and warehouse in (:cwar.1, :cwar.2, :cwar.3)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the point is not this. I also have tried as your said.<br />
and warehouse in (:cwar.1, :cwar.2, :cwar.3)<br />
But it is not the correct way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can try (maybe works) the wherebind option:<br />
<br />
<br />
       select   ....<br />
       from     ....<br />
       where   ....<br />

Sorry, this method is not true. Error:&quot;:1&quot; not expected.</div></div><hr />

So, in the IN(...) operator you can only put constants, not variables. There is no way to do what you want. You have to use warehouse = ... or ... instead of the IN operator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a shame! I can only use this method to do.<br />
Anyway, thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
And thanks for all replies.</div></div><hr />

In embedded query one always need to put constants for in operators .<br />
<br />
Alternatively u can write 2  different embedded SQLs depending on the conditions (which seems more easy work) .</div></div><hr />
