<br />
We need to have &quot;Terms &amp; conditions&quot; to be printed on PO/SO report , as a developer i can always type in these &quot;Terms and conditions&quot; and put spaces between words to align it, however from maintainence perspective it might not be a good idea since, if there are any major changes to the &quot;Terms and Conditions&quot;, i cannot copy paste from word doc to baan report editor &amp; worst of all if I type it manually then i will have to align it again in baan report editor :o which is kind of a pain.<br />
<br />
So to avoid above issue, i was thinking to maintain these &quot;Terms &amp; conditions&quot; using Baan TEXT functionality, but the problem is auto alignment. It expects that i have to align the TEXT manually so that it prints perfectly on report, so my question to u guys is how do i ensure whatever text i have maintained in TEXT prints in auto align mode when somebody print a PO ?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to auto align the text printed on report using some baan function ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th March 2011, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I am missing something - I have a text session that lets them keep several types of text.  Then it allows them to copy(append or create) this text from this stored text field into the header or footer text of the purchase order.  Nice feature about this is it lets them have different texts for each POs for different contracts or customers.  Anyway this is printed using the PO header or PO footer text lines.   So I assume in baan 5 you can do this - what I do not understand is the auto align.  I would think you would just add a text field on the form and let it print normal.  I would think your text window and print window would just need to be the same size.  Then they would print correctly.</div></div><hr />

We used to do the same as you but in the end I made a separated file with the &quot;Terms and Conditions&quot; (well designed PDF, with company logo) , and attach it in the same email/fax automatically.<br />
<br />
However, there is a new feature in Baan Mail-Merge (http://www.nazdaq-it.com/utilities.php?prod=mailmerge), that can concatenate any PDF file to your main PO/SO.</div></div><hr />

Is mail merge suppose to render the doc. on user pc or is it going to send it as a attachment in form of email ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">17th March 2011, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">This is how Baan Mail Merge (http://www.nazdaq-it.com/utilities.php?prod=mailmerge) works:<br />
<br />
o	Parse the original report to individual documents<br />
o	Recognize supplier/customer for each document<br />
o	Match it with supplier/customer e-mail/fax<br />
o	Adds “inserts” that are document specific (logo, Terms and Conditions, Background and other..)<br />
o	Deliver each document according to preferences (e-mail, fax, print, or archive)<br />
<br />
Here is a presentation (http://www.nazdaq-it.com/pres/emm71d4p.ppt) about it.<br />
<br />
If you need any more information, please contact us.<br />
