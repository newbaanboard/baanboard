<br />
I am trying the print the baan report output to PDF (with GS) and it works fine for me for the reports without logos. <br />
<br />
The problem is with the reports with logos in baan. Ghost script is converting the reports to PDF but logo is not coming in the output. It is coming with the character (i.e. A) which is assigned to the font.<br />
<br />
Please help to get the logo on the PDF output.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

GS script takes in  postscript file as input , Font logo is understood by baanwindows printer not GS script.<br />
<br />
1) In order get the logo you need to stamp a   pdf page with just a logo on the top  with you report pdf .  this is know as stamping. Theres are application which does this .. like command line pdf ( cpdf ) .. is an open source for non commercial use.<br />
<br />
2) or you may use itext in java to created your own pdfs ( it there in baanboard)<br />
<br />
3) 3rd party application like hidox , Nazdaq's products  .. etc</div></div><hr />
