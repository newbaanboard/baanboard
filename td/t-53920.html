since we're on ErpLN-FP3 we have the problem, that there is the last character of each barcode-string printed in the beginning of every barcode on the paper so our barcode-scanners have problems to read it. <br />
I've tried anything but I don't know how to get rid of that character.<br />
Maybe it's relating to the fact that FP3 also made changes in the handling of line breaks on text-fields, etc.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I'm on Baan IVc4, but I guess that the barcode principle hasn't changed since then ... And I'm on Unix. (We recently had problems with barcode, but that came from a change in porting set 6.1c.07.15).<br />
 <br />
So have a look at the files $BSE/lib/barcode/*/type*. These are shell scripts!<br />
 <br />
You may also have a look at the printer drivers in $BSE/lib/printinf/*/*; you should see an entry like &quot;barcodedir=hp,&quot; there.<br />
