<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vincent</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">When i run a report session and have the output device as D( screen)<br />
it displays the report in say 10 seconds<br />
<br />
but when the same session is run to device ASCIF , the output file gets generated in abt 40 seconds.<br />
<br />
Why is it so ?<br />
<br />
I have about 30 report session that are to be run via a JOB, if the sessions are run individually, the total time is abt 10 mins,<br />
<br />
but the JOB takes abt 30 mins to complete the same.<br />
<br />
Can any one help ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I do not know ratios and I am sure these all depend on your drives, setup and configuration.  Anyway when Baan writes to the display, it first goes to a tmp file and then is sent to the display.  If you watch on large slow queries or sessions the display will start printing before the session is actually complete.  So it sends it to a tmp file and then converts it for display. When sending to a file it first goes to the tmp file and then gets converted into the destination ASCII file.  So more disk I/O and maybe even the conversion to ASCII is extra.  Thats my take on it.  Maybe a real expert will stop by and post a better answer.<br />

Or as said by mark , it's ttstpconv takes more time. Just check the device setting and arguments for ttstpconv . Also if the output file path is on nfs device , it is definitely slower than local hard disk path.</div></div><hr />
