Hello,<br />
<br />
for invoice, there's a include &quot;itdsls0006&quot; calculate invoice totals, maybe it will help you.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
you're right this would be the solution, however we don't have the sources, we've &quot;cleaned&quot; everything thanks /due to the SSA &quot;witch hunt&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I have to calculate it myself... problems is the possible discounts on header and line level. Therefore if some has done this and give me a few hints it would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you schould have the include itdsls0006 as this is used in the scripts of  OA and Invoice reports. You still do have the report scripts I hope? You can take a look at these scripts and report layouts to get all variables that are filled<br />
<br />
The basic code for order calculation is something like this:<br />
<br />
  	#include &quot;itdsls0006&quot;	  | calculate invoice totals<br />
	select	tdsls045.*, tdsls040.*, tdsls041.cvat, tdsls041.ccty<br />
	from	tdsls045, tdsls040, tdsls041<br />
	where	tdsls045._index1 = {:i.orno}<br />
	and	tdsls045.ssls = :i.status<br />
	and	tdsls045.orno refers to tdsls040<br />
	and	tdsls041._index1 = {tdsls045.orno, tdsls045.pono}<br />
	selectdo<br />
	        amnt.isls0006 = tdsls045.amnt<br />
	        ldam.isls0006 = tdsls045.ldam<br />
	        odam.isls0006 = tdsls045.odam<br />
		ccty.isls0006 = tdsls041.ccty<br />
		date.isls0006 = tdsls040.odat<br />
		ccur.isls0006 = tdsls040.ccur<br />
		rate.isls0006 = tdsls045.rats<br />
		ratf.isls0006 = tdsls045.ratf<br />
		crnd.isls0006 = 0.01<br />
		if tdsls040.cvyn = tcyesno.yes then<br />
			cvat.isls0006 = tdsls041.cvat<br />
		else<br />
			cvat.isls0006 = &quot;&quot;<br />
		endif<br />
		update.line.totals.isls0006()<br />
	endselect<br />
	calculate.invoice.totals.isls0006()<br />
	|Variables invo.totl, good.totl, vat.totl, disc,totl.... can now be used!</div></div><hr />
