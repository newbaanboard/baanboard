Our requirement is to print the trial balance for the calendar year. On the input from i have provided range fields for the Fiscal year/period i.e. year.f/prod.f and year.t/prod.t.<br />
<br />
Now the transactions are being retrieved from table tfgld201. E.g suppose the table is having records starting from  2008/01 to 2009/09.<br />
<br />
If i input 2008/1 to 2009/9 in the input range, then the report should print all the transactions from Fisacl year 2008 and its period 01 to 2009 fiscal year's period 09.<br />
<br />
The following select query is not giving me the desired result. It is selecting records multiple times.<br />
<br />
             select 	tfgld201.*<br />
	from 	tfgld201<br />
	where 	tfgld201._index3 	<br />
<br />
                  between { :cono.f, :year.f, :tfgld008.leac,	 <br />
				  :ptyp.f, :prod.f }<br />
	and<br />
		{ :cono.t, :year.t, :tfgld008.leac,<br />
				  :ptyp.t, :prod.t }				 <br />
	 and	tfgld201.duac = :save.duac<br />
	 order by tfgld201._index3<br />
	selectdo<br />
		process.transactions()<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
What could be the possible reason?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
you don't have gld008 in the query<br />
Try to use tfgld210.leac in the &quot;between&quot;</div></div><hr />

Are there multiple records in your table?<br />
the query must be ok in my opinion.<br />
I am on C4 also but don't know tfgld201.duac, maybe there's a problem, could you explain save.duac?<br />
<br />
<br />
select tfgld201.*<br />
from   tfgld201<br />
where tfgld201._index3 between { :cono.f, :year.f, :leac.f, typ.f, rod.f } <br />
and                                       { :cono.t, :year.t, :leac.t, typ.t, rod.t } <br />
and    tfgld201.duac = :save.duac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">5th January 2010, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Points to observe &amp; follow .<br />
<br />
1. When  u r giving tb in calender year , it is not good practiice to ask user to input fiscal year . U should use some enum domain on month .<br />
<br />
2. U should convert input calender period to  fiscal period . This u can do by finding difference between (calender year) * 12 + calender period on one hand and (fiscal year*12) + fiscal period on the other hand . To convert periods u may need to use remainder / integer of  12 in the period indicator  arrived at using this way.<br />
<br />
3. Always use fiscal periods in tfgld201/3 . <br />
<br />
4. For each output row convert the fiscal period to calender period , using reverse formula in point 2 above.<br />
<br />
5. For opening balance , sum up all records tfgld203 for fiscal year or year in tfgld003 whichever is less .  Add to  this  get all records from tfgld201 which are less than f(from fiscal year ) * 12 + fiscal period (from)and greater that (opening balance year from tfgld003)*12 +1<br />
<br />
6. Period transaction u will get in tfgld201 for records using the from to year/period indicator(as aforesaid).<br />
<br />
7. Use sublevel 0 for the same only using tfgld008 . <br />
<br />
8. Eliminate year closing p&amp;l transaction when tfgld201.prno = 12 , by deducting the ledger transaction balance for year close trans type in tfgld106 .</div></div><hr />
