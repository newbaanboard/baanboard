<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vik.patil</div><div class="date">6th June 2016, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently we applied latest service packs on BAAN IV. We have customized Sales Invoice report in BAAN VI in long back which is missing latest solution changes. Now we are getting Float Exception error for Customized report and Standard report is working fine. Right now we are suppressing these error by FPE_STRICT_ENABLE=0767 command in config file. Is it possible to set this command in Report script so we can restrict it to this report only? <br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th June 2016, 02:37</div></div><div class="posttext">If your getting a divide by 0 error then in the report script you can just check to see if the divisor is 0 using the double.cmp()  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=13737) test.  So basically you compare your value to 0 and if the difference is less than the tolerance you can set the results to 0(or what ever you want).  See http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_mathematical_operations_double_cmp for help on the command.</div></div><hr />

But divide by code is not available in customized report script. It is in standard dll so we cannot modify the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">7th June 2016, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">your first post said standard report is working fine and custom report gives float exception error. then modify your custom report, the one that's giving you the error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th June 2016, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">If the error is coming from a &quot;standard dll&quot; and the standard report works fine - then it has to be what is in the customized report.  Like Benito mentioned if the standard report is working then you have to fix the customized report.  You can put it in debug mode and step thru to see what is happening.  If that is not the case then you will need to provide more details on what the issue is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do the division only If the Divisor is &lt;&gt; 0.<br />
<br />
<br />
If divisor &lt;&gt; o then<br />
 result = div/divisor<br />
endif</div></div><hr />
