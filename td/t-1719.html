<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 10:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We have just installed c4 (incl sp9 and some weekly patches) and upgraded to portingset 6.1c.06.02<br />
<br />
After the upgrade one of our customized scripts is malfunctioning:<br />
Somewhere in the script a select statement was done to select all items without a &quot;/&quot; on position 8. (special items in our company)<br />
it said something like :<br />
<br />
	select ...<br />
	from psfrm010<br />
                where<br />
	and psfrm010.fitm(8;1) &lt;&gt; &quot;/&quot;<br />
	...<br />
<br />
it was this line that caused the problem.<br />
<br />
Nothing was selected although lots of items fulfill the conditions.<br />
<br />
During some more testings I changed the line into <br />
<br />
	... and psfrm010.fitm(8;1) not like &quot;/&quot; ...<br />
<br />
and now it works.<br />
<br />
It must be something to do with the newer tools version (somewhere in a service pack) or the portingset.<br />
<br />
I have no clue yet on any specific objects or programs to check.<br />
<br />
Has Baan changed the functionality in order that a &quot;/&quot; is a special character in sql in c4 ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Portinset fixes document said &quot;The Oracle level-2 drivers returns wrong results on queries containing a SUBSTRING expression.&quot;</div></div><hr />
