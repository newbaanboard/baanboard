I would like to write a script which will replace the field purchase price i.e. prip  from table tiitm001 (item data). with some formula.<br />
like prip * 1.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had not written any script till today. But for this particular requirement I need to write some code and do the this job as early as possible this is required for Item stock valuation.<br />

<br />
you can use this script -<br />
<br />
db.retry.point()<br />
select         tiitm001.item, tiitm001.prip<br />
from           tiitm001 for update<br />
where        tiitm001._index1 between :item.f and :item.t  <br />
order by tiitm001._index1<br />
selectdo<br />
                  tiitm001.prip = tiitm001.prip + (tiitm001.prip * 1.1)<br />
<br />
                  update.db(ttiitm001, db.retry)<br />
                  commit.transaction()<br />
endselect                 <br />
<br />
Hope this will help you. But you try this in test VRC first and confirm whether you really want to update tiitm001 or other.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">12th April 2003, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">If your requirement is a one time  valuation based on the multiplier and the end result required is just an idea of value with<br />
a new prip, you are better off reading prip and multiplying in the script to get at your report.YOU MAY NOT NEED TO UPDATE THE TABLE.<br />
<br />
All the 4 fields prip, avpr, copr, and the last purchase price are critical to standard cost update (based on how standard cost is updated) and caution is advised before you make a blanket update with a multiplier like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not use session tdpur0201m000 &quot;Global Update of Purchase Prices and Discounts&quot;, This session gives you functionality to effect changes as desired by you using either a % increase or a value increase over existing prices.<br />
<br />
Caution given by tools123 remains !!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But currently I had done in following way.<br />
<br />
Actually this was required to calculate Standard Cost price the priority set for the calculation was pp lp  (i.e. purchase price<br />
<br />
So I had exported the data using exchange scheme | separetor<br />
then save this data in Excel. (Only Purchased Items)<br />
<br />
Read the same file using VB applied the suggested formula by A/c's dept. Created | separeted file using VB and imported the data into baan.<br />
<br />
I had done excercise in test company and now I will apply the same into live company, while doing the same no one will work in that company.<br />
<br />
Thanks once again<br />
