My questions (and wonder) is if the min() or max() are considered as a condition and works fine (since I get compiling errors when using it).<br />
It would make queries simpler... anyway... the problem could be solved making another selection in the selectdo.<br />
Thanx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">16th July 2004, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">What does the compile error say?  I think it's your having clause.   The having clause is like a where clause but for the group functions.  It needs another side of the equation, like:<br />
<br />
having min(tdilc995.date.c) &gt; some date</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">feluchin</div><div class="date">16th July 2004, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">what I want to select is the first date of the group selection.<br />
that´s why I was not sure if I could set the condition as min o max.<br />
If soo... I could compare to a very old date... but it´s not too nice  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">16th July 2004, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, but that's why you are getting the syntax error, you need 2 sides on the Having.<br />
<br />
As Tom said, just having the min in the Select statement will get you only those records with the minimum value on the date.  You probably don't need that Having clause at all.  I am not sure how having multiple min/max's after that effects things, but I think you will get the minimum date records for each grouping, the count of those records, and the sum/average of those records without the Having clause at all.  If not, try just the min call, then add the others 1 by 1 and see how it goes.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
