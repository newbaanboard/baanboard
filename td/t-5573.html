<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">20th June 2002, 14:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
I have a session that prints two reports out to a printer, a success report and an error report for example, to the same printer.  A user wants this changed so that he can pick his device for each report from the session itself and be able for the two prints to come out on different printers.<br />
<br />
I know a couple of sessions where this happens but have no source to look at.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
	#include &quot;itccom0010&quot;		| Report handling<br />
	#include &quot;itccom0007&quot;		| Rounding quantity<br />
<br />
function domain tcbool open.reports.for.exports()<br />
{<br />
	domain tcbool	open.okay<br />
<br />
	open.okay = true<br />
	if prnt.rprt = tcyesno.yes then<br />
		if not open.report(1,spool.device,1,language$,1) then<br />
			mess(&quot;tcmcs00005&quot;,1,language$)<br />
			choice.again()<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
	spool.device  = &quot;INTERFACE&quot;<br />
	spool.fileout = strip$(shiftl$(file.path)) &amp; &quot;/BOM&quot;<br />
	if not open.report(2,spool.device,1,language$,2) then<br />
		mess(&quot;tcmcs00005&quot;,1,language$)<br />
		open.okay = false<br />
	endif<br />
	spool.fileout = strip$(shiftl$(file.path)) &amp; &quot;/CST&quot;<br />
	if not open.report(3,spool.device,1,language$,3) then<br />
		mess(&quot;tcmcs00005&quot;,1,language$)<br />
		open.okay = false<br />
	endif<br />
	return(open.okay)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The report data is sent using the print.record(1),print.record(2) or print.record(3) commands depending on which report gets the data.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

This function will trigger the ttstplopen where users can select the same or another device for the error report.<br />
<br />
If you need a solution without programming effort in the Baan tools but some on OS level, you can choose to print to a file using a driver (printerdriver) and ttstpconv to write the output in ascii file, with a batch file to send the first doc (or part of the file) to one device and the second to the other...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">27th June 2002, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies.  I have now been able to getting round to looking at this problem again.  I have checked my tools manual and have nothing about open.report  Could someone send me some info on it?  I am hoping to allow the user to select on the form the two devices he wishes to print the error report and success report to.  I am guessing by using the open.report function I can pass it the inputted devices from the form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">27th June 2002, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry,<br />
<br />
The function mentioned is programmed in the include function tccom0010. If you do not have the include source itself, you can get it from me (tell me what appl. version). In Baan IVc4 it is only 282 lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">27th June 2002, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">use simply the brp.open/rprt_open statement twice? Once for the normal report and once for the error report.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to hardcode the reports in your program script you can make use of different reportgroups via the reportgrp variable.<br />
<br />

Han</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">27th June 2002, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">The report functions in the include are just sophisticated calls to enhance and ease the use of the standard 4GL functions Han is mentioning. Of course you can use the &quot;bare functions&quot; themselves too, see programmers manual - 4 GL functions Manual Pages section - under &quot;R&quot; functions rprt_open, rprt_send and rprt_close.</div></div><hr />

Or had my sharp eyes missed something... :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marioth</div><div class="date">6th May 2009, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Look up the library tccomdll0010.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">6th May 2009, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I could have guess this. :rolleyes:<br />
Shure it is better that it was placed in an own dll...<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
