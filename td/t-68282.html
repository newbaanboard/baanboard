<br />
I have a tool which is on my machine and there are several executable files to extract data from that tool. I created a batch file put it in my machine and i am successfully able to run batch file using this below command.<br />
value = start.application.local  (mdir &amp; &quot;test.bat&quot;,true,exitCode)<br />
<br />
Now problem with this is that tool should be on each user's machine.<br />
<br />
I thought to put that tool on server and then run all executable on server. I tried run.prog() but it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
How can i solve this problem? Suggestions are welcomed.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">20th October 2015, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">shell() command does not work on Windows. run.prog() is the function you need to use to run batch file on the server. Maybe if you post your piece of code someone can see what's wrong...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">20th October 2015, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Jaap is correct. Providing the code will help here. 2 most probable causes of failure - <br />
<br />
1. Incorrect syntax/call<br />
2. Not enough Privilege/permission on file</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhruv_x0</div><div class="date">20th October 2015, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure whats the problem here. I am getting &quot;0&quot; return value which means it is successful but i am not getting the desired results. Nothing in err.file also.<br />
Here is the code:<br />
<br />
value = run.prog(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;,&quot;/k&quot;&amp;&quot;C:\&quot;&amp; &quot;b1asharma1\test.bat&quot;,RP_WAIT,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,err.file) <br />
<br />
When i ran that batch file manually there it worked well. Here i am clueless now.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">20th October 2015, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I see there is no space between the 2 parameters.<br />
<br />
Try this  - <br />
<br />
value = run.prog(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;,&quot;/k &quot;&amp;&quot;C:\&quot;&amp; &quot;b1asharma1\test.bat&quot;,RP_WAIT,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,err.file) <br />
<br />
Or you can even without cmd.exe<br />
<br />
run.prog(&quot;C:\b1asharma1\test.bat&quot;,&quot;&quot;,RP_NOWAIT,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;C:\b1asharma\err.txt&quot;)<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
run.prog(&quot;C:\b1asharma1\test.bat&quot;,&quot;&quot;,RP_WAIT,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;C:\b1asharma\err.txt&quot;)<br />
<br />
I am assuming you have given full permission to this file and the folder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Return field says &quot;0&quot; means successful but i stored error in file and i found one error there. Its says &quot;'download_data' is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file.&quot;.<br />
Now when i ran that batch file manually it is executing without any error.<br />
Content of batch file is &quot;CD C:\XMDBTOOL\XMDBTool - HARSCO\bin<br />
call download_data -downloadModule=ER -autoVerify=0&quot;<br />
This command is present in thiis path &quot;CD C:\XMDBTOOL\XMDBTool - HARSCO\bin&quot;. <br />
<br />
I am still trying on this. If you have any suggestions then please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">21st October 2015, 14:36</div></div><div class="posttext">That's probably because, when you run it manually, the path stored in some environment variables is recognized as the program is called locally. But when called from LN/Baan, it becomes a remote program call and hence the command is not found.<br />
<br />
Try one of this - <br />
<br />
1. Set the path of the program in environment variable &quot;PATH&quot; on the server<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
2. Provide full path while using call statement instead of changing the directory.<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
3. Simply execute the program without creating the bat file using run.prog()<br />
<br />
And off-course, make sure, the program can be ran by any user.<br />
<br />
About the return statement -<br />
<br />
The bat file is executed successfully and hence the return value is 0. If you run a program which returns any value for failed calls then probably you will get a different return value. But, in this case, run.prog() is executed properly but your bat file gives error which is stored in the log file.<br />
<br />
run.prog() can fail if the bat file is not present or the name provided is incorrect and at those times you will get a different return value than 0,<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
Update - <br />
<br />
You may also try this instead of CD<br />
<br />
pushd yourdir<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
cd /D yourdir<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
cd /D C:\XMDBTOOL\XMDBTool - HARSCO\bin<br />
call download_data -downloadModule=ER -autoVerify=0</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to call without changing directory but i got the same message &quot;It is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file&quot;<br />
<br />
Also there is no such direct command for this. To run we need to write commands to CMD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">21st October 2015, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">There is one more thing you could try if possible.<br />
<br />
I had faced a situation where the spaces in the path caused problems. Reason being that, the path may gets split and is converted into path and argument.<br />
<br />
You can try to change the directory name and make it without spaces and check if that works. <br />
<br />
Also, I had updated my previous answer. Try that as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhruv_x0</div><div class="date">21st October 2015, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried them all:confused:. No idea now why its not running that file. <br />
Its not changing  the directory because if it was able to change then it could have run easily. Its trying to run the call command that's why &quot;recognized error&quot; is coming. I will keep looking into this and will post if i could find anything.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">21st October 2015, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">For testing purpose, what you can do is, try creating 2 bat files. Now, call 2nd from 1st bat file. Now, use run.prog() to call 1st bat file. It will give you a hint whether there is a problem.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have simply added the path to that program and not the full path with the program name in &quot;Path&quot; environment variable, I will suggest you to add the full path as well and try again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you add the full path, open you command prompt and type that program name and hit enter to see if its able to run directly.<br />
<br />
It takes quite brainstorming dealing with some issues. Hope you get it working. All the best!</div></div><hr />

Can you access your folder and your executable through this?<br />
<br />
go to dos command and try accessing the remote server directory. type dir /x. it will display the long and shortnames. i am thinking that maybe try using the shortnames like DOCUME~1 instead of long names.<br />

see a sample file:<br />

C:\Windows\startm~1\programs\startup\somefile.doc</div></div><hr />

<br />
When running the bat file in Windows, there is no issue<br />

But when I call the bat file with run.prog, one of the commands do not run<br />

The command is<br />
java.exe CreateSMime<br />

This command encrypts one txt file to p7m file<br />

Please advise<br />
