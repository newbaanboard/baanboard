I tried to google for MIME type. I got this result (http://www.webmaster-toolkit.com/mime-types.shtml)<br />
<br />
I think you are looking MIME type for sending attachment for .csv file. I tried to do it with some different options like: <br />
text/csv, application/csv, application/excel<br />
<br />
For all these options I got the file name as 'att2.csv' inspite of setting the file name for it.<br />
<br />
I also tried to download this file after sending and email, this file was ok and not corrupted.<br />
<br />
I hope this inforamtion could help you little.<br />
<br />

Hi,<br />

I also searched on net and tried various MIME types still no luck. I hope you must have set-up SMTP service in session ttcmf0130m000. What is the file type u have associated with the service. is it possible to post your script so that i can find where is the difference.<br />
<br />

I am using Outlook service, File Type associated to it is 'Plain Text Unicode'.<br />
<br />
As far as code is been concerned, it is the same which we have in the pragrmmers manual (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_emessage_connector_examples).<br />

When using smtp as the provider my csv file when send as an attachment automatically gets converted to .txt format.<br />
The MIME type I have set is 'text/csv'.<br />
