You can do the development in BW mode like baan 4. But It's better to learn studio.</div></div><hr />

- Worktop was an additional tool used for logging in. Now, you don't need that anymore.<br />
<br />
- Is it possible to develop customizations wthout LN Studio?. If this question is true, Do we have any problem later if taking this option?<br />
- As already said, you just need to install bw and use BECS to log in and do the development. You need to set the bshell command as -set NO_WORKTOP = 1 for that. But again, its better to learn and start development using LN Studio. It has some good features and greater capabilities.</div></div><hr />

Thank you a lot for your support. I have two additional questions. If I continue with my work without LNStudio, then won't I  have problems later???.  and I only could lost features, for example Which features do I could lost?</div></div><hr />

You can simply continue to work using BECS without LN Studio. Doesn't harm if you are now comfortable with a new tool.</div></div><hr />
