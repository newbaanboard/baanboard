I tried making a graph session. Was able to achieve the easy part, i.e., opening the graph editor, but somehow could not continue working on extracting data from the tables!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
     I played around with charts awhile ago, and have attached an example of a session that I created.   The session name is tccom9999m999 and was developed on Baan 4c4.<br />
<br />
     This session is suppose to print a pie chart of the top 10 customers.   We have a small test data base, so you may want to further define the selection to make the session run faster. (Top 10 within a certain timeframe).   Included in the dump files are the session, chart, form, script and script source.   I haven't played with this in awhile but do remember that you need to include &lt;bic_chartman&gt; and itcmcs0000.<br />
<br />
    Take a look at the function tcmcs0000, it has quite a few functions that may be of use to you.<br />
<br />
    Hopefully this will be an easy example to get you started.<br />

<br />
I tried copying your example to a different package comb., but when I execute the session, the graph is empty. <br />
<br />
What are the steps in creating the graphs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is set up under the chart manager.<br />

Was anyone else able to get the chart to work?<br />

Example. I want tou use the same script you have for the sales, however, the currencies are different. I want to make the conversion using the tcmcs008 table(currency conversion), but I am not having any luck. Do you have any examples where you have done this type of conversion or use of multiple tables to make calculations?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkorst</div><div class="date">4th March 2003, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem with the multiple tables, has to do with the select doing a group by statement.  If you can get away with using the using the currency from the customer, you can possibly do the conversion before sending the data to the graph.   If not you may need to rethink the select statement, to determine the top 10 customer amounts and then send the data to the graph.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmathew</div><div class="date">25th April 2004, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I had tried the Pie chart and was successful. I have only one problem in the output Chart. I am not getting the legends in the bottom of the graph which represents each of the labels. I am not sure where this is to be defined in the session. <br />

However the tccom9999m999 session has the legends coming at the bottom the graph. I would like to know how this is controlled and where it is to be defined?<br />

Please help!!!<br />

If you need this include you can always contact SSA.  In emergencies that have been very helpful.</div></div><hr />
