<br />
I need some help from you about the evolution of BaaN SQL in the versions b2, c2 and c4.  Where can i find information about the subject?<br />
<br />
thank you very much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">8th October 2002, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think anybody will be able to give you that info.All I can tell you is that is you see very old program scripts in baan you find all db. calls with while loops. Now you see normal SQL or Dynamic SQL.<br />
<br />
Probably you can serch the baanborad library about available options and arrange them from db calls to Dynamic SQL for the evolution.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">9th October 2002, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">In older versions like bocs1.x etc the database was addressed with db.statements. Later SQL standard was adopted, like starting in triton3.x But it takes some time to have all programscripts modified, so replacing the old db.statements with proper SQL queries. In Baan IV most of the db startements got removed, but still there are some. Even in iBaanERP 5.x there is some remainders of the old programming standard. The db.statements are gone for most parts, but the idb.statements remain. They of course differ (see programmers manual) but the principle of calling remains the same... <br />
<br />
In iBaanERP 5.x the dynamic SQL came in use.<br />
<br />
As you can note: the movement/changes are over a bigger timescale than you ask for. The minor evolution is rather irrelevant, since they are in the bigger scale. Sometimes a portingset (database driver) gets changed to handle SQL slightly like in the &quot;refers to&quot; change in the recent portingsets.</div></div><hr />
