<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swapnilj</div><div class="date">4th November 2014, 08:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All,<br />
I have written a 3gl script which reads information from audit files and generates a  report.<br />
But the problem is this script takes lot of time to complete the process. <br />
If I use baan sessions (e.g. ttaad4463m000) to print audit files then it takes less time compared to my custom 3gl script. <br />
Could someone please suggest me a way to improve 3gl script so that it becomes time efficient.<br />
I am also attaching my script for your reference. Please check and let me know if I am missing out on something.</div></div><hr />

Code looks fine. May be you can try using CSV instead of XLS also you can try using Baan Report instead of writing it to a file in case if that is not a special requirement.<br />
<br />
Again, can't say that will make any difference.</div></div><hr />

Hello bhushanchanda,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your quick reply.<br />
I tried making CSV instead of XLS but it didn't help. <br />
Also requirement is to print audit details in custom report so Baan Report won't do.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<br />
One more thing you can try is, rather than using sequence as 999, try calculating the number of sequences generated for that table.<br />
<br />
That can reduce some time as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I tried that also. There are 40 sequence file for tiitm001 table (whih I am using in script for testing). So, I replaced 999 with 40 but that too didn't worked.<br />
