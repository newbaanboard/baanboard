<br />
When you use get.var the variable must be declared as extern. Check the example in the following link:<br />

<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

I was changed in the script of session tipcf2201m000 the definition of the variables of the features to extern. With this solution works fine.<br />
Please, anybody knows if that change could give me bad consecuences?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't worry it will work fine, but its better to check the initialization of that variable once...where and whether its initialzed or not else it may lead to unwanted results because when you declare a variable as external then You can use them in all functions that occur after the variable declaration, and also in other programs (for example, forms, reports, and runtime expressions),so you should be aware of where the value that particular variable is being used or modified...(but remember that if a local variable has the same name as an external variable, the local variable is used within the function. The external variable is not affected.)...<br />

All the very best!!!<br />

<br />
If you are already using a dll, then why don't just read the pcf tables here. By doing it this way you don't have to modify the original code.<br />
