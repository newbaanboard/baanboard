<br />
    I have created a new batch in Transactions(tfgld1101m000) with JV entry for some amount against one supplier. But I cannot find that entry in tfacp200 table. That entry is found in tfgld102 (Non-Finalized Transactions). So is it possible to find that entry in tfacp200 table?<br />
<br />
Thank You...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">19th March 2013, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">What transaction type did you use. The transaction type in your batch does not only function as a kind of number group for your financial document, but it also indicates what kind of transactions you can execute.<br />
If you want to enter purchase invoices, then you need to use a transaction type with transaction type category &quot;Purchase Invoices&quot; or &quot;Purchase Credit note&quot;. Also on the transaction type you can enter the first and second session the system should start. When creating a transaction type of category 'Purchase Invoices', the system will default the correct first session (tfacp110s000 (or tfacp2600m000 from FP8 onwards)). <br />
I suppose that you have used a transaction type of category 'Journal Voucher' and with such a transaction type you can ony enter plain journals.<br />
Please read the helptext on transaction types.<br />

But In my system there is one customized report Supplier Ledger. But that Journal Voucher entry is not reflecting in report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">19th March 2013, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I have of course no idea what the functionality of your customized report is, I hope you do -). Anyway, suppose that report will only report on postings related to purchase invoices, then a normal journal posting (eventhough you enter a business partner on it) will not be part of your report. But like I said that depends on the functionality of that report.<br />
