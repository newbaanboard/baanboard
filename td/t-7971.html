<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">5th December 2002, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I've entered the following into the tdsls4404 report script.<br />
<br />
after.inco.4:				<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
ON	CASE	strip$(isls.cdel.namf)<br />
	CASE	&quot;FRANCE&quot;:<br />
		tax.code = &quot;TVA&quot;<br />
		tax.rate = 19.6<br />
		break<br />
<br />
What I want to do is force the report to print a certain tax code dependant on the country in the delivery address.<br />
<br />
My problem is that the country can be printed on a different line each time, depending on how big the address is. It will not always be the value returned by isls.cdel.namf. Does this make sense??<br />
<br />
Using the isls.cdel.xxx logic is there an equivalent for the delivery country (ccty) I've tried cdel.ccty.dsca, cdel.ccty, spdl.ccty and isls.cdel.ccty but none of these work.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Since when do we set variables in the script? :D I've attached screen shots of the sessions we use to define tax rates by country, the table is tcmcs032.<br />

<br />
We do have tax rates set by country in tcmcs032. <br />
<br />
The issue we had was when raising re-charge invoices on our parent company for services provided in Europe. We have to show the correct tax code and rate relating to the customer's country where the work was carried out. Hence the need to set the tax code/rate in line with the delivery address of the invoice.<br />
<br />
These invoices are always printed from the same Baan company so the invoice layout always deafulted to the tax code/rate of that company.<br />
<br />

You provide a service to a customer, but you bill (charge) your parent company? Does your parent company invoice the customer and then you bill the parent?<br />
<br />
Surely we need some functional advice here!<br />

<br />
I have given them a solution that meets there requirements and they are happy.<br />
<br />
If I can find out some more info I will and post it in the Finance forum.<br />
