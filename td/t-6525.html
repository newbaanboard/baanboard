<br />
Does anyone know of a Baan function that picks up the users login id?<br />
<br />
I want to script some controls based on what user is using the system.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<br />
The user login code is just a Bshell variable. It's logname$. Maybe that helps.<br />
<br />

<br />
I developed a session using BaaN 3GL, my intention behind developing such session was to keep track of the users logged-in, and no. of instance they are running, if any users logged-in more than one times with the same login-id I can find out what are the users and how many times they logged-in.<br />
<br />
My 3GL script is doing the following things<br />
<br />
1. First create a window in which ListBox is created which conatins<br />
users login-id and number of times they are currently logged-in.<br />
<br />
2. same way I can also findout users's activity, whether he is performing any activity or not, if performing any activity what session they are running and in which company. Display separate ListBox for list of active users as well as idle users.<br />
<br />
I am still working on it and would like to make it more user friendly<br />
that is if any users select the any of users from listbox on its click event we can get the user details, but still not able to findout the ListBox items selected.<br />
<br />
soon, I will post the script as well.<br />
