<br />
i have some problems solving this matter, i hope somebody could help me..<br />
<br />
in my report there are some columns, this is output from the query like...<br />
<br />
      variable1   vaiable2  variable3<br />
      10            20          30<br />
      30            40          50<br />
      40            49          59<br />
tot  80            109         139<br />
<br />
now the problem is how can i put the total into variable like this..<br />
<br />
tot1 = 80<br />
tot2 = 109<br />
tot3 = 139<br />
<br />
so that i could have used it for factor like, tot1 + tot2 / tot3<br />
<br />
i know this seems so easy for someone out there, pls help.....i tried some idea but it gives me the first row only like..<br />
tot1 = 10<br />
tot2 = 20<br />
tot3 = 30<br />
<br />
tnx a lot...</div></div><hr />

I think that you used total function on report field option. AFAIK you would keep each total into a variable. <br />
Firstly open report script,<br />
define variable tot1,tot2,tot3<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
  domain tcqiv1        tot1, tot2, tot3<br />
<br />
For example if you print each field on detail.1 then you should also add followings into report script.<br />
<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
after.layout:<br />
    tot1= tot1 + field1value<br />
    tot2= tot2 + field2value<br />
    tot2= tot2 + field3value    <br />
<br />
lastly , compile your report script and don't forget to add those fields on after.report layout to see total values on report.<br />
That's all .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">23rd April 2007, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">When u use the total function in Baan report , Baan report declares the same as total..0 , total..1 etc variable . If u wish to use this total..X variable in the same layout , u can do so by using the same in print expression .<br />
<br />
If how u want these values in other layout before that totals are printed , u can get by 2 ways .<br />
<br />
1. Using print conditions , introducing a higher sort field say sumflag (say  a byte variable  ) , duplicating rprt_Sends with sumflag = 0 and sumflag = 1 each . I do not recommend this bcos it's slower way of doing it . <br />
<br />
2. Another way is to total the same in program in external variable and import the same in report script . Remember these variables should not be used as input variable . Instead it must be declared in report script . This will definitely be a faster way .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes sir, i have used the total function in report script and i got it right what you have told in report script, actually this is a summary of the report, i removed the details on the reports and remained only all the subtotals, by that subtotals to make it for a total again i have used <br />
<br />
field.fieldname.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
tot1= tot1 + field1value, <br />
<br />
and it works really fine.....but i still have one problem, in one of that column, there is one column which is not working, it seems it gives me a random total, let say, totals must be like this way;<br />
<br />
subsubtot1 = value of variable1, subtot2 = value of variable2, subtot3 = value of variable3, <br />
<br />
but it gave me in this format;<br />
<br />
subtot1 = value of variable2, subtot2 = value of variable3, subtot3 = value of variable1,<br />
<br />
for me it is really weird, i adjusted the sorting mode from asc to desc and pre but still i cannot get in this format;<br />
<br />
subtot1 = variable1, subtot2 = variable2, subtot3 = variable3,<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance Sir, i hope my post dont confuse you.</div></div><hr />
