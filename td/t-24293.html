<br />
I have a problem with print reports on two file devices. The problem is that User can select device to print error report and the second device for other reports. When I run session manually everything working fine. But when I run session by job that the problem is that everythink is printed only to one device. I have attempted change spool.fileout but only one file is used to print. I don't know why. Could somebody help me?<br />

On the form is field. To this field you set the device. There is check to file device. This device is used to print error report. When click on continue then you select other two device for two reports. In script:<br />
<br />
if not open.report(1,spool.device,1,language$,1) then<br />
	choice.again()<br />
endif<br />
if totals = tcyesno.yes and<br />
   not open.report(2,spool.device,1,language$,2) then<br />
	close.reports()<br />
	choice.again()<br />
endif<br />
if ( prnt.options = tcyesno.yes or prnt.sellpr = tcyesno.yes ) and<br />
    tipcf000.ppcf = tcyesno.yes then<br />
	if not open.report(3,spool.device,1,language$,3) then<br />
		close.reports()	<br />
		choice.again()<br />
	endif<br />
	apdx = true<br />
endif<br />
<br />
savefileout = spool.fileout<br />
spool.fileout = &quot;\\dkcntbap1\opher\&quot; &amp; logname$ &amp; &quot;.txt&quot;<br />
if amnt_check = tcyesno.yes and	<br />
	not open.report(9, error_dvc.f,0,language$,9) then<br />
	close.reports()<br />
	choice.again()<br />
endif<br />
spool.fileout = savefileout<br />
<br />
<br />
And the problem is that when I set spool.fileout then this file is used for everything what go on report. When I don't send fileout then everything is go on another file which is set by job.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suribaan</div><div class="date">16th June 2005, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I would play with spool.fileout based on the logic when I want to print to file and when to device. Change the value in the variable based on your output requirement.</div></div><hr />
