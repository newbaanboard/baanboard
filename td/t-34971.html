<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertB</div><div class="date">27th April 2007, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I haven't had much to do with Baan programming/customization for a while, and have a problem for which there may be a simple solution.<br />
<br />
We have a customized report whinp1400m000 &quot;Planned Inventory Transactions by Item&quot; which needs to be further customized. At the moment, the report has sections: <br />
<br />
header<br />
before.field whinp100.item<br />
  detail<br />
after.field whinp100.item<br />
after.report<br />
So far, so good. Now I want to alter things such that, for certain items only, a second set of layouts:<br />
<br />
before.field some.other.field<br />
  some.other.field detail<br />
after.field some.other.field<br />
are printed directly after the after.field whinp100.item, and before the before.field for the next item. This second set of layouts are based on a completely different table, and different sort-field, thant that used in the item field layouts.<br />
<br />
In other words, I want something like this to appear in the final report:<br />
# Here's a &quot;normal&quot; item...<br />
[before.item]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
[after.item]      <br />
<br />
# Here's another one...<br />
[before.item]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
[after.item]      <br />
<br />
#This item is a &quot;special&quot; one...<br />
[before.item]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
[after.item]      <br />
<br />
# ...and hence the need for a special set of layouts to be printed before the next item...<br />
[before.some.other.field]<br />
  [some.other.field detail]<br />
  [some.other.field detail]<br />
  [some.other.field detail]<br />
[after.some.other.field]      <br />
<br />
# &quot;Normal&quot; item...<br />
[before.item]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
  [item detail]<br />
[after.item]   <br />
<br />
# etc.........   <br />
I'm not sure whether this is simple or difficult or impossible to achieve. Any clues or printable comments :rolleyes: will be most welcome!<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th April 2007, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Are these fields input to the field or are they fields you will be retrieving in the report script?<br />
<br />
(1) If input fields then just add them to the sort and do normal layouts.  I don't think this is the case, but mention it anyway.<br />
(2) If this is data you are going to look up.  Then just add another item layout.  In the before.layout you would do a check - and if it was false then you would set lattr.print to false skipping the second item layout.  If it is true then you would run what code you needed, check for the end, and if not end then use layout.again.<br />
<br />
So it would look like this in the script:<br />
<br />
after.item.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
      ...do some stuff...<br />
<br />
after.item.2:<br />
before.layout<br />
     If i.am.not.special then<br />
         lattr.print = false<br />
     endif<br />
<br />
after.layout:<br />
     if i.am.not.done then<br />
       layout.again()<br />
     endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Something like this.</div></div><hr />
