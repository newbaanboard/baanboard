Then add declarations into.  Not really sure if that is what you are asking or not.  Not all baan reports have a script and you just need to add one.</div></div><hr />

You use report scripts only if you want some complex manipulation in the report which is not possible in layouts or in program script.<br />
<br />
I guess you have to declare table tdltc001 if it is not declared already in the program script. And then add a select (or join tdltc001 to the select on tdilc401). If table tdltc001 is already declared and selected, confirm that field  tdltc001.lsup is selected. <br />
<br />
You can debug the program script, placing a trace on tdltc001.lsup, to see if it is getting any value before the data is sent to the report.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
in BaaN original sessionsript by Wim van Lemmen, table tdltc001 is not declared.<br />
So the field tdltc001.lsup is not accessible.<br />
<br />
If session source is not available, it's the best way to declare and read the field in reportscript.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Agreed...if source code is not available, it would be easier to do it in reportscript.</div></div><hr />
