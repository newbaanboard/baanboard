<br />
I have a query that returns the eco stock. But then also the production orders that create the allocation AND the history of the usage.<br />
<br />
My report prints the layouts correctly, but does not calculate the usage by quarter1, quarter2 etc.<br />
Bottom line - I don't understand the scripting language <br />
<br />
Please correct my attempt at the script or point me in direction of a good book.<br />
<br />
The before.detail = eco stock line items<br />
The detail is the production order information for each simular item<br />
<br />
Hope this make sense to someone!<br />
Many thanks<br />

In 4c4 on form 2 of ttadv3130m000(or ttadv3130s000) you should see a view script button.  That should allow you to view a report script.  Usually what you will see in a report script is a layout name - for example: header.1:, detail.1, etc.  Then for each of those layouts you have before.layout and after.layout.  The before.layout means do this before you actually print the layout, after.layout means after the layout do this.  <br />
<br />
Without knowing the layouts on your report my first guess is that this might work<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
quarter1=(tdinv750.aupp(1)+tdinv750.aupp(2)+tdinv750.aupp(3))<br />
quarter2=(tdinv750.aupp(4)+tdinv750.aupp(5)+tdinv750.aupp(6))<br />
quarter3=(tdinv750.aupp(7)+tdinv750.aupp(8)+tdinv750.aupp(9))<br />
quarter4=(tdinv750.aupp(10)+tdinv750.aupp(11)+tdinv750.aupp(12))<br />
<br />
Then just compile it in debug mode.  You can step through it seeing everything that is executed.</div></div><hr />

Finally I'm getting somewhere.  Now all the fields print, the sums work but..the order is incorrect. <br />
<br />
As can be seen in the attached files after the change of each item the calculation for usage is made for Q1, Q2 etc. according to tdinv750.year, this is printed inbetween the second detail line for production usage.  So the production work order lines are repeated, when the .year changes.<br />
<br />
I have amended a txt file showing the required output - and the given output.<br />
<br />
And in the .doc all the other sql layout and script.<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th June 2007, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - looks like you are using easy sql.  I am not sure you can get what you want with just layouts.  Here is what I think you can do:<br />
        (1) remove tisfc001,tdinv150 from the query - this will get moved to the report script.<br />
        (2) Changes to the layouts:<br />
                  (a) leave current before item layout alone<br />
                  (b) make detail.1 contain the quarter information<br />
                  (c) create after.field layout for item.  In this layout put in your tisfc001 fields<br />
        (3)  Now change the report script to include the after.tiitm001.item.1 layout.  Here is where you will query tisfc001 and tdinv150 for all of the production orders. You will have to use layout.again to get this to work.  No promises this little script will work since I usually do not use layout.again().<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
	table	ttisfc001<br />
	table	ttdinv150<br />
	domain	tcorno		hold.order<br />
	<br />
before.program:<br />
        hold.order = 0<br />
	<br />
after.tiitm001.item.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	select  tdinv150.qana, tisfc001.orno, tisfc001.prdt<br />
	from	tdinv150, tisfc001<br />
	where	tdinv150._index2 = {:tditm001.item}<br />
	and	tisfc001._index1 = {tdinv150.orno)<br />
	and	tisfc001.orno &gt; :hold.order<br />
	order by tisfc001.orno<br />
	as set with 1 rows<br />
	selectdo<br />
	selectempty<br />
		tisfc001.orno = 0<br />
	endselect<br />
	if tisfc001.orno = 0 then<br />
		lattr.print = false<br />
	else<br />
		hold.order = tisfc001.orno<br />
	endif<br />
	<br />
after.layout:<br />
	if tisfc001.orno &gt;0 then<br />
		layout.again()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this will give you first the item information, then the two yearly break down by quarters, then you can go find all the orders.  Maybe somebody more familiar with layout.again can make better recommendations, I did this off the top of my head.  Searching for layout.again will give more information.</div></div><hr />
