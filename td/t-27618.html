I used table fields in my report and sorted it by using this table fields. In program section, I try to change this table fields value but in report side this changing doesn't affect. It gets orginal table value instead of my assigning. IS THIS NORMAL for table fileds variable. <br />
<br />
    select table.a<br />
    from table<br />
    selectdo<br />
       if table.a = &quot;X&quot;  then<br />
          table.a = &quot;Y&quot; <br />
          rprt_send()<br />
      endif  <br />
      | it works in program script, but report side it determines value &quot;X&quot;<br />
    endselect<br />
<br />
Thanks all ,</div></div><hr />

<br />
The behaviour you described is not normal. Infact i &quot;play&quot; with the values of table fields many times with expected results.<br />
I wonder what is wrong with your case. Is it possible for you to post your script here. Is there any chance that the same record is being selected again in some other place of program or report script.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">18th July 2006, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">My case is very open . In program side I changed the table.field value but in the report side it still see old value of table field.I mean I couldn't change table field value. I can solve it by using variable.Then I must do many changes both report side and program script. look at my small script upside.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">18th July 2006, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi , <br />
My case is very open.<br />
My program script side :<br />
<br />
table ttcqms417<br />
     select tcqms417.rgrp<br />
     from tcqms417<br />
     selectdo<br />
            if  tcqms417.rgrp = &quot;X&quot; then<br />
                tcqms417.rgrp = &quot;Y&quot;<br />
                rprt_send()<br />
            endif<br />
     endselect<br />
<br />
 In report side, tcqms417.rgrp is used in sortmode. In fact this is not important. It is fact that when I check value in report layout, it didn't get my assigned value like &quot;Y&quot;.It gets &quot;X&quot; .It means that assign operation didn't work. Is that normal in BAAN for table variable assigment. I can solve it by using different variable and I use it both program session and report side.But I want to solve it by using table values.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th July 2006, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">What you have posted here works.  I have done this many many times.<br />
<br />
     select tcqms417.rgrp<br />
     from tcqms417<br />
     selectdo<br />
            if  tcqms417.rgrp = &quot;X&quot; then<br />
                tcqms417.rgrp = &quot;Y&quot;<br />
            endif<br />
            rprt_send()<br />
     endselect<br />
<br />
Usually I have the report send outside the if statement.  I can think of a couple things to check.  Make sure report table fields match the session table fields.  Make sure the report send is actually after the statement that changes the value.  Actually debug the report and make sure that you are printing the value in the correct place.  <br />
<br />
It would make it easier if you actually posted the script, but that is my best guess.</div></div><hr />

Everything seems okey but on print layout it prints wrong value.This should be bug in baan.I used this field in sorting mode of presorted on report. I changed the mode to ascending mode. Then it worked well. But This may not be bug due to working mechanism in baan. I think this is a bug. because I assigned value before rprt_send() command.  <br />

Thanks all,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th July 2006, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">It may well have to do with presorted and ascending mode.  I am not positive that I ever changed a sort value - much less a presorted variable.  Have you reported it to Baan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 08:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think to report it. Because of old version ( Baan IV c3). <br />

Thanks for your suggestion marks .</div></div><hr />
