I have logged the case with Baan but they are not sure where the problem lies.<br />
 <br />
The report has been customised by a company we no longer use. <br />
<br />
Even though the report is customised the errors relate to lines that are in the standard report script. If you take a copy of the report from the B40_c4 vrc you do not get any errors when compiling.<br />
<br />
Baan have given me the latest bic6.1 and repgen6.1 binaries but these made no difference.<br />
<br />
I've attached a copy of the error and script<br />
<br />
Hope you can help<br />

Thanks for you reply.<br />
<br />
You were correct in your diagnosis. All the input fields were missing for this layout.<br />
<br />
I'm new to Baan, as you may realise. You've now taught me something else to look out for!!<br />
<br />
To ask a silly question are the Input Fields the ones that get passed from the form used to set the print parameters?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
To my opinion there are no silly questions. However perhaps it makes sense to attend a training if you want to do more in this area.<br />
<br />
Look upon it like this: the program script generates a datastream to the report. Within the report you define the fields that you want to use. However you can only retrieve the fields that the program script reads. Most program scripts retrieve all fields of a table, meaning that if one of the table fields is listed you probably can use any field in that table, however you have to test it! If the program script doesn't read a table you want to use you have to change the program script or read the table within the report script.<br />
<br />
Hope it help to make you understand how reportscripts and program scripts work together.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,</div></div><hr />
