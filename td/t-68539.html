I would eventually also like to put this on a batch (running via Cron on an AIX). <br />
Any ideas? I have looked at some of the search results, but nothing seem to resonate with what I am trying to do<br />

Many thanks<br />

I would eventually also like to put this on a batch (running via Cron on an AIX). <br />
Any ideas?Check the standard first, is there a session which a bit looks like what you want to do? (probably a session with a 2 in its code on the second position of the numerical code of the session: ppmmm.2..m000)<br />
<br />
If you found one, check all the session settings (you can print the session settings and examine them, compare them with your settings). when done that, please inform your findings...</div></div><hr />

Post your code for others to give suggestions to fix it. If you are trying to use main.table.io: section, then its not applicable for a Type 4 session.</div></div><hr />
