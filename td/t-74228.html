As for &lt;bic_httpclt&gt;: This loads the HTTP Client Functionality so that these could be used in the current program script. This functionalty is very extensive and is documented fully in the Programmers Guide. You can get the Programmers Guide from KB22924522 in Infor Support Portal.<br />
Hier a link  The programmers manual for ERP LN (https://support.infor.com/espublic/EN/AnswerLinkDotNet/SoHo/Solutions/SoHoViewSolutionC.aspx?SolutionID=22924522&amp;kb_is_archived=0&amp;kb_accessed_from=LookUpByIdResult) <br />
<br />
As for LN Studio: You can get the user guide from Infor Support Documentation  (https://support.infor.com/espublic/en/AnswerLinkDotNet/SoHo/DocLink/SoHoDocLink.aspx). Go to Your FP -&gt; Tools-&gt; Development Tools .. and then select &quot;Infor LN Studio Application Development Guide&quot;<br />

Hi Vahdani , <br />
<br />
Thanks for your pointer. I could get the latest as well as my version specific docs  which gives clear info on any tools programming aspect. <br />
<br />
Ln studio I already have the docs  but I have to learn more on the same . IF  there are some easy to use practical DIY guide / notes/inputs please share it  (of course only if such sharing is permitted ). I already have access to all the docs on support portal available to us .<br />
<br />
Once again thanks for your  quick and precise help  on this . It's  very much appreciated .</div></div><hr />
