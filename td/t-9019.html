   How different is Baan V (c) tools from Baan IV Tools? <br />
   As a programmer what do you think are the enhancements in <br />
   Baan V Tools? <br />
   PMC is one of them (though it's there in c4 also).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">25th February 2003, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow..that's a big question :)<br />
Too many to mention, and I'm sure I'll miss some, but here's a few.<br />
<br />
1.  The scripts in Baan IV have been separated into 2 components.  The UI script remains attached to the session, and calls the session logic and form handling.  The business logic, or the 'check.input' and 'main.table.io' sections have been moved to the DAL's (Data Access Layer).  DAL's are libraries named after the tables they represent.  Each update to the table (using the new dal.update/dal.new and  dal.destoy commands, instead of the db.update, db.delete and db.insert) will flow through the related DAL sections automatically.   The DAL's object oriented by concept - and introduce new terminology such as Hooks and Methods.  <br />
<br />
2. SCM - Software Configuration Management.  A development tool where components are 'checked out' to a developer while they are working on them, locking them for other developers.   Developer's can test thier changes while other developers do not see them.  When you check a component back in, you are prompted to document the changes, and this documentation is inserted into the script along with the proper ident.<br />
<br />
3.  Synchronized sessions.  A new way of looking at the main and sub session relationship.   New session standards have an overview main session that is multi occurance.  Double clicking on an record usually brings you to a single-occurance maintenance session.  This is apart (in addition to) the normal zooming that Baan IV does to relate sessions together.  End result is some 100's  more sessions in Baan V than in Baan IV.  There are new options in the session generator for synchronized sessions.<br />
<br />
4.  Segmented domains.  You can now split a domain into pieces, and have references (and zooming capabilities) off of parts of a domain.  The only standard one is the item domain.  In Baan V, this defaults to be both the project (which is validated against projects) and the item.  Now, the regualar and customized items  are stored together.  (Although the item master table has been broken into about 10 tables.)  There are new functions to handle filling individual segements.<br />
<br />
5.  Dynamic Forms.    A new form editor that is VB based and much easier to use.  It is 'smart' and can determine if it should be a display or maintenance, single or multi occurance depending on how it was called and who called it.  This is nice, but not supported by the BI Interface, so there are not many standard examples, and I can't recommend using them unless they are BI supported.  New sections in the code have been aded to deal with dynamic sessions.<br />
<br />
6.  Expanded Roles and Authorization Management.<br />
<br />
7.  Expanded query exension capabilities.<br />
<br />
8.  Print / Maintain / Display menu structure largely eliminated.  A new 'bind' option lets you bind a print session to the little print button on a regular session (you still need the print session, but it's not separate on the menus).  The Display is determined more from a user's authorizations instead of making separate sessions for each.<br />
<br />
9.  BAS (Baan Application Server) is available, which lets you hook up with Word and Excel.<br />
<br />
Gosh, I'm sure there is more.</div></div><hr />
