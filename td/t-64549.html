<br />
I'm working with LN FP3, I need to know if in the middle of a process a record in a table is firm in structure or even missing commit.transaction ().<br />
<br />
I come to your help for me to know if there is some variable programming BaaN predefined table (table._ ****) to know if the record is already committed to the database.<br />
<br />
First of all thank you very much and I hope for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if I got your problem , or can it help, but the column ppmmm000._dlock indicates if a record is locked or not, and a commit.transaction() should release the lock from the record.<br />
<br />
You can also try this function: db.check.row.dlocked (long table_id)<br />
<br />
Just thinking about it: A not commited transaction would give you fatal error, just as a not locked. Maybe the problem is on update method (dal.update, db.update)? Just a guess... <br />
<br />

If once the commit is done...the changes would be in db, so querying the record should give you the changed values....   in that case you can say it is updated....although...I am not sure..what you are trying to archive......</div></div><hr />

Thank you, but you suggestion is not valid for me, because in the DB (for example Informix), exists a functionality  that the name is &quot;dirty read&quot;, in where not neccesary the DB changes is done.</div></div><hr />
