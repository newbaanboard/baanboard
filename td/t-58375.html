<br />
Can anybody please tell me how to control the field length on runtime?<br />
In my form there are two fields city and country, the city field value is variable and the length of the field in the form is 12, whereas the country field value is equal to it's length .When the city field value is 4 digits then it's looking very odd in the form because of white spaces.<br />
Hyderabad   ,IND ------&gt;This is somewhat okey<br />
Ajmer          ,IND-------&gt;So many white spaces hence looking odd.</div></div><hr />

There are 2 fields or 1 field that concatenate both with a comma? <br />
They are external variables or table variables?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baansavvy</div><div class="date">5th May 2010, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">there are 2 fields and are table variables</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">5th May 2010, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Table string variables, by definition, are always fixed length strings. It means that your field 'city' couldn't be of variable length. It has always the length defined in the data dictionary, filled with blanks chars to the right (if it's, as normal for a string, left aligned).<br />
Could you post a screenshot of your form? Maybe this could help to better define your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ahmer91</div><div class="date">6th May 2010, 07:57</div></div><div class="posttext">field's length are usually assoiciated with the domain that is linked to the data type and form allocates space to the field based on its type and can not be changed at run time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th May 2010, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">A screen shot would help us see what you are seeing.  I do know on 4c4 there are times the form itself makes the fields look to be mis-aligned.  I do not know if it is tab stops or what that causes this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">6th May 2010, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I will assume that you just want to DISPLAY the City and Country on the FORM.<br />
<br />
You will have to define another field with enough space and put that on the form instead of the two separate fields. Then in the before.display, assign the values:<br />
<br />
strip$(city) &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; strip$(country)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if the fields have to be entered into, then you have to position the country below the city in order to make it less awkward. It is not possible to control horizontal positioning much.</div></div><hr />
