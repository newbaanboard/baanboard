Can you please clarify, what the pmask is ?<br />
<br />
The umask is for the Unix and the bmask is for BaaN option -<br />
<br />
-- -set USE_BMASK_AS_ABSOLUTE=1 -set BMASK=02</div></div><hr />

Are you refering to the procedure mask for order types.  If so,  a procedure mask is used in conjunction with order types. An order type consists of a number of order steps.  Baan provides pre-defined order types/steps and you may also define your own.  The procedure mask is used to record what order steps are mandatory for the particular order type and to also track which steps have been executed.  There is online help available.  For example: navigate from the main menu.   BaanIV/Distribution/Purchase Control/Purchase Orders/Miscell/Order Steps-Types/maintain order steps.  click the pull-down help/using session and then click the order types help link.<br />
Hope this helps<br />

   Yes, by pmask I meant Procedure Mask.<br />
   I know the basic functionality of it.<br />
   But wanted more info from the technical side .<br />
   When I look at the scripts it shows stepnos etc.<br />
   Just wondering if anybody had modified the pmask in any of<br />
   their scripts? Any docs?<br />
<br />
   Thanks for you posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 21:29</div></div><div class="posttext">here are a few functions that deal with pmask and the stno.#### <br />
tcmcs0020 - deal with order line status<br />
tdsls0016 - check particular status on 045<br />
tdpur0014 - deal with order item line status<br />
the stno.#### indicates what session the pmask is being updated/checked from.  <br />
I looked into this many years ago in Triton 3.1b.<br />
I don't know if this is an 'answer' but, perhaps a place to start your analysis???<br />
:))<br />
BB<br />
also table tcmcs042 Order types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 01:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Each position in the pmask refers to the status of a particular step number.  For example, in sales orders the first few steps usually refer to:<br />
<br />
 Print Order Acknowledgement<br />
 Print Picking List<br />
 Maintain Deliveries<br />
 Print Packing List<br />
 Print Bill of Lading<br />
 Print Sales Invoice<br />
 Process Delivered Sales Order<br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
In the pmask, the following &quot;codes&quot; hold:<br />
[list]<br />
 &quot;n&quot; = step not necessary/not used<br />
 &quot;y&quot; = step is necessary but not complete<br />
 &quot;e&quot; = step is complete<br />
 &quot;c&quot; = step has been completed and 'changed'<br />
 <br />
<br />
So, a pmask of &quot;eeynyyy...&quot; would mean that:<br />
<br />
 Acknowledgement and Picking List have been printed<br />
 Maintain Deliveries, Print Sales Invoice, and Process Delivered Sales Orders still need to be done, and<br />
 Print Packing List is not a step for this order type<br />
<br />
<br />
The stno field tells you the current step (what should be exectued next).<br />
<br />
Each order type can define different steps to be used.  There is a standard list of steps, but you can add new ones if you add the proper step processing code to your script.  There is a recent post about this.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
