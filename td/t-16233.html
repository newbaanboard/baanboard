<br />
We modify the BOMs directly and often the project has already gone to the shop and the materials have been pulled.  I am especially concerned to include any materials that have been replaced (Are no longer on the BOM (new material has been added) but are still in the estimated Materials bucket).<br />
<br />
I am having a difficult time comfiguring a script to do the comparison.   <br />
Would anyone have any suggestions ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The first pass would compare the quantity on the same items, one to find the items on the new bill not on old bill, and one to find items on old bill not on new bill.  When releasing it would need to be for the same order quantity.  <br />
<br />
If that is not possible then you have to simulate the release yourself - not something I would try.  We do too much with production orders and estimated materials to really use either method.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naabi0</div><div class="date">9th August 2004, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We use customized bills also.  All of our sub-projects get planned shop orders assigned to them as soon as we get the demand, we just release them on a daily basis.  I have a job that runs at night. that explodes every top-level, sub-project related BOM and then compares that explosion against the prior day for differences.  I then apply those differences to all planned, sub-project related shop orders.  I also take care of any differences at the custom bom level.  The next morning reports are printed and the active shop orders are updated with the differences.</div></div><hr />
