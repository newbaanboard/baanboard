I am new to Baan. We currently have a client using Baan and is requesting a report to see all Invoice details entered with payment detail. I have no idea where to start. TTFACP200 seems like a good place to start. I can see the &quot;Purchase Invoice&quot; and &quot;Normal Payment&quot;. What joins/links these 2 lines? ( I cant see anything that will work)  I am using SQL and received the data of the different tables in txt format.<br />
<br />
Will ttfacp200 give me the Payment Batch as per the &quot;Payment Advice&quot; <br />
<br />
Your help will REALLY HELP!!!!!<br />

That is who I would direct this to at the company I work for - get them to explain to me how to trace through the records.  I do know the primary index fields of ttyp and ninv, play a role in this - but that is all I recall.  Lets see what other responses you get from the tools forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
table tfacp200 contains all transactions for suppliers.<br />
Your supplier invoices are registered therein with a transaction type and a document number. The amount is positive for an invoice.<br />
The table index1 contains 6 fields. <br />
The invoice is registered with all subsequent index fields = blank or zero.<br />
If a payment is linked with the invoice then a second record with the same transaction type and document number is created  but the second transaction type (field4) and document number  (field 5) are filled: this is the payment transaction. the amount is then negative.<br />
<br />
the payment transaction can be retrieved.  with the transaction type (4) and document (5).<br />
If more than 1 payment is done then additional lines are added.<br />
<br />

<br />
Is it possible that more than 1 invoice can have the same ttyp and ninv?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">15th May 2013, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
All lines with same ttyp and ninv  are related, if the fields tdoc and docn are filled this is or a correction or a payment.<br />
With tdoc you can read table tfgld011 and find if it is a category cash : this is then a payment. <br />
I think that different invoices can have the same payment document. <br />
<br />

<br />
I find one thing strange : the 4 first lines have the same index. This should not be possible.<br />
Field tpay  for payment contains 10 (unallocated payment) or 14 (assignment) or 8 anticipated payment.<br />
