<br />
I have built a session that has a main table. I am displaying some of the table's fields and I have also added an input field to the form (lets name the filed &quot;my.calc&quot;). &quot;my.calc&quot; is not a part of the main table. I just need it for inner calculations.<br />
<br />
The session type is &quot;Display / Modeless window with menu.&quot;<br />
The script type &quot;UI Script with DB handling&quot;<br />
<br />
Whenever I change &quot;my.calc&quot; and click on Next (to go to the next table recotd) I get question ttstpq0109c &quot;Data has been changed; Do you want to save your data?&quot;<br />
I did not change any data from the main table! I am only changing the data of my field!<br />
<br />
My Question is can I suppress this question some how?<br />
<br />
I have read this thread:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9096<br />
But putting &quot;execute(&quot;update.db&quot;)&quot; under the modify section did not help much becuase the Next/Prev buttons stopped working. I also read there that this discussion was opened before but I too did not find it.<br />
<br />
Can any one please help?<br />

I am not quite sure in which tools version this is available, but you can use the following statement <br />
	unlink.from.maintable(&quot;field.on.form&quot;)<br />
<br />
Preferably you should use this command in the after.form.read section.<br />
<br />
Good luck and regards,<br />

Thanks for the reply. I have tried this function but it did not work. I have put it in this section:<br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
after.form:<br />
   unlink.from.maintable(&quot;my.calc&quot;)<br />
<br />
If u post ur script , there will be many who can answer u in jiffy .<br />
There is nothing special with my script. I have deleted all the content of the script and kept only the new field declared. I still got the message.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

Session-&gt;specific-&gt;Program Script,double click the Script record,update the &quot;script type&quot;  Property:<br />
UI script with database handling<br />
UI Script with Print/Processing session<br />
......<br />
You will get it</div></div><hr />

         I am just new to Baan. So I dont know any in and out of Baan. Can you please tell me how were you able to predict that &quot;ttstpq0109c&quot; active cause of the main session work with the database handling. Means is there any standard followed for message code also like followed for session code(eg. tcibd0501m000 here tcibd001 is Item Master table and 5 stands for display type of session).<br />
              Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Do you know TOOLS for Developer?The session code is ttadv2500m000 and The Program Script session code is ttadv2530m000.</div></div><hr />

           Yes, session code ttadv2500m000 is for Session and ttadv2530m000 for Program Script session. I think that data for the sessions may be in table ttadv200 while for program script may be in ttadv230 as per the naming convention, I would like somebody to correct me if not so.<br />
          There also may be some situations when we might be in need of having the session code which might not be as per naming convention to avoid session code redundancy.<br />
<br />
         Basically I just wanted to know that is there also some naming convention for the messages from which you were able to tell that the particular message is ment for database handling:confused:<br />
