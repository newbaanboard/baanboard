<br />
I am facing a small issue while writing (Chinese) multi-byte character string(one of which is Business Partner Name) in a file (on to the server and copying it back to local system).<br />
<br />
I have used this functions earlier many a times and it worked fine without any trouble. but then yesterday mb.export$ refused to work and kept giving me return value -3.<br />
<br />
So question for you guys/gals is, Does any one know what this -3 means. Programmers Guide just says &quot;character could not be converted&quot;. but does not tells you the reason WHY character could not be converted.<br />
<br />
I tried passing lval(mb.locale.info(TSS_GET_TSS_NAME)) as the third argument to mb.export$ but no difference in output.<br />
<br />
If you have come across such issue earlier and you have managed to resolve this, please share the solution. It will be great help.<br />
<br />
Thank You</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">9th August 2012, 09:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not have the answer for what does -3 means. I hope the following questions will help you:<br />
<br />
1) Is the function working with another input. Is it specific or general problem?<br />
2) Have you tried to export just part (maybe one letter) of the nonworking string?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MilindV</div><div class="date">9th August 2012, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">George,<br />
<br />
Thanks for quick reply.<br />
<br />
1) The problem is general, it is not specific to a particular input string.<br />
2) I tried this as well but no difference in result.<br />
<br />
Can this be because of some LN ENV set up problem. some parameters we have to set, some configuration problem?<br />
<br />
Because I don't see any other reason for mb.export$ not working, as in previous projects I worked, this function worked.<br />
<br />
I tried uni.export but, I did not get desired output.<br />
in case of mb.export I was getting question marks in output<br />
in case of uni.export I get some junk(unreadable characters) in output.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Were you able to fix the same? I am also trying to write chinese character in file using seq.open but its printing some junk characters.<br />
<br />
Can you please help.<br />

<br />
i have a same issue ,  writing Chinese labels to text file and then opening it up in excel<br />
Same thing is working with standard decive whose parameter is &quot;ascii -u:excel&quot;<br />
i understand that the file is  in UTF16LE encoding <br />
but when i use utf.export()  and write it to file using seq.* functions it doesnt seam to work <br />
Can anyone let me know how it be achieved ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason is that, when you use utf8.export() function and insert the result into csv file using seq.* functions, a UTF-8 file is created. If you open this CSV with Notepad or Notepad ++ it will show you the Chinese characters.<br />
<br />
Reason - When you open the file with Notepad/Notepad++, it adds the required BOM(Byte Order Mark) characters for UTF-8 file and shows you the data.<br />
<br />
The BOM sequence is - 0xEF,0xBB,0xBF<br />
Now, to tackle this programmatically, Following is a hack I use - <br />
<br />
Just add this line as your first line to the generated CSV-<br />
<br />
<br />
cmd.str = chr$(239) &amp; chr$(187) &amp; chr$(191)<br />
seq.puts(trim$(cmd.str),fp)<br />
<br />
This is a BOM sequence required for UTF-8 for application like excel.<br />
<br />
A sample program -<br />
<br />
function main()<br />
{<br />
	string tmp_file(100)<br />
	long fp<br />
	long ret<br />
	domain tcmcs.str256m dsca<br />
	string cmd.str(200)<br />
<br />
	tmp_file = creat.tmp.file$( bse.tmp.dir$() )<br />
	tmp_file = tmp_file &amp; &quot;.csv&quot;<br />
	<br />
	fp = seq.open(tmp_file,&quot;w+&quot;)<br />
	seq.flush(fp)<br />
	seq.rewind(fp)<br />
	<br />
	cmd.str = chr$(239) &amp; chr$(187) &amp; chr$(191)<br />
	seq.puts(trim$(cmd.str),fp)<br />
<br />
	select tcibd001.*<br />
	from   tcibd001<br />
	as set with 10 rows<br />
	selectdo<br />
		utf8.export(dsca,tcibd001.dsca,UTF8_STD_MODE)<br />
		seq.puts(tcibd001.item&amp;&quot;,&quot;&amp;dsca,fp)	<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
	seq.close(fp)<br />
	<br />
	|* Transfer from server to client.<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
Tested and works just fine.<br />
<br />
The other solution is, just open the CSV file in notepad - &gt; Hit Control + S (Save) -&gt; Close<br />
<br />
This will add the BOM sequence and excel will show you the proper data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BOM<br />
<br />
Bytes	        Encoding Form<br />
00 00 FE FF	UTF-32, big-endian<br />
FF FE 00 00	UTF-32, little-endian<br />
FE FF	        UTF-16, big-endian<br />
FF FE	        UTF-16, little-endian<br />
EF BB BF   	UTF-8<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway let me check utf8 , if it works that well and good for me.</div></div><hr />
