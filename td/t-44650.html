This is regarding sending an email from Baan Session. Not just popping up an email with an attachment but to send it too. I have searched all the threads relating to &quot;Sending mails from Baan&quot; but I could not find even a single thread which focussed on sending an email without third party tools or manual intervention. Let me explain the problem.<br />
<br />
Requirement:   To send a generated report as an email.  In other words, when user clicks on continue button the report content should be written onto a temp file. And this temp file should be sent as an attachment to the concerned user. All the above should happen with a click on continue button.<br />
<br />
What I could do:  Capture the report content to a file. Pop up a outlook message window with the file as an attachment.<br />
<br />
What I could not do: To send the popped up message through outlook without manual intervention.<br />
<br />
Constraints:  I cannot use any thirdparty applications to automate the email send nor I can use mailx option in Unix. I have to use outlook only. And it has to be auotmated. <br />
<br />
Thank you for all those who have read this request patiently.<br />
<br />
Please advise <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I know you will have to write a program that uses the Outlook Object (OLE) to create an email and then send it automatically. Here is a link (http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/showthread.php?t=216039&amp;highlight=outlook) of how to do that in VB.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

Thanks for the advise. While I try out in VB, please let me know if there is a way out with app_start function. In other words, I would like to know if the same requirement can be achieved by only uisng Baan functions. For your ref. I am on Baan IV C4. <br />
<br />
I knew that Baan V has got cmf.* functions which would simulate the send option in Outlook. Do we have any such options on Baan IV too? I have searched the forum but could only find that it is not possible. I was just wondering if any one out there have tried it on Baan IV c4 uisng on Baan functions only.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.<br />
<br />

<br />
Since Outlook has very limited command-line options, I think you will need some other program, e.g. in VB or .NET.<br />

I played lot with outlook in past and concluded its not possible to send mail directly without interaction.<br />
<br />
If it would have done, user may get mail copy in his sent items. But seems couldnt do it.<br />
<br />
I then used a third party tool.<br />
<br />
Anyway, whats the reason you want to use only outlook?<br />
<br />

<br />
I don´t try this yet (It´s one of the points in my TO-DO list :D) but in this link there is the code of the class. The page is in spanish, but it must be easy find something similar in english.<br />
<br />
Send mail from Java (http://www.devjoker.com/asp/ver_contenidos.aspx?co_contenido=1)<br />

I hope it helps you.</div></div><hr />

I had to prefer outlook because of the constraints we have with our Customer. Thats the only reason. But as you rightly said, I guess it is not possible from Baan IV with functions only from Baan. <br />
<br />
Now I am trying out with VB. Let me know if you have already done this before using VB. I am not that good at it.<br />
<br />
SergioRuiz - Thanks for the Link.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sanjayhp</div><div class="date">20th November 2007, 19:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I have successfully emailed (thro' outlook) from BaanIVc4 using Java classes that use the Java's mail API. I don't think there is a direct way to do it from BaanIVc4 without using any 3rd party tools or programs. The java classes would obviously be like a 3rd party program but it is free and most of its source is open source that is found in the examples along with the java mail API. You would have to install java on UNIX to execute / run these classes. From Baan side; all a user has to do is press a button or hit continue and everthing happens in the background. You can execute a shell script from the Baan program which in turn will execute the java classes to email the files. Again, the java classes can email with an attachment in any format. But the file to be attached has to be converted in whatever format you want, before emailing it.</div></div><hr />

But outlook automation is possible  through vb / .net without human interaction . U can check Outlook automation  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=15303&amp;highlight=outlook+automation) . API from redemption / mapilabs lets u automate email without human intervention securely.</div></div><hr />
