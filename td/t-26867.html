<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">11th April 2006, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
quite new at baan/ssa LN 6.1 , I hit problems that I solve one by one but this one is a showstopper that prevents me from doing what the customer wants, and I can't find a way around it. Any ideas are welcome; what happens, how I should do, and/or workaround.<br />
<br />
Environment: SSA LN6.1 FP2 on MSSQL on Windows.<br />
<br />
The session whinh3512m000 looks like this in standard: first screenshot in attachment. Info: The lower part (receipt lines) is managed by the session whinh3512m100, it is this toolbar I talk about in the following. <br />
<br />
My task is to add an icon in the tool bar , for a new printing functionality.<br />
<br />
Now I copy the session whinh3512m100 to my cust vrc -level. AND I DO NOTHING ELSE.<br />
<br />
Starting the whinh3512m000 again, it looks like this: second screenshot in attachment. The toolbar is expanded and many of the icons visible (and necessary) in the standard screen have 'overflewn' to the right.  <br />
<br />
Info: The function create.extra.toolbar is used in the corresponding script (whinh3512) with a lot of Function/Session - Icon parameters, much more icons than those visible in the standard session.<br />
<br />
Info: I tried all combinations/permutations of compile session, create runtime for session, out and in to Baan: No change</div></div><hr />

Refer to -<br />
iBaan ERP 6.0 Multi Main Table - Developer Guidelines<br />
5.4.2	Toolbar Satellite<br />
<br />
Secondary toolbar<br />
The secondary toolbar will be placed behind the primary toolbar. There is only room for as many icons that will fit behind the primary toolbar. If there are more, they will not be shown So only use those icons of which you are sure they are used very often in this session. Please talk to your Product Consultant or Usability Consultant about this. <br />
Make sure that there are no double icons in the toolbar of the header and the Satellite (unless they have a different action)<br />
Make sure that:<br />
	Only those secondary toolbar icons are placed in the session that are used most often <br />
	There are no double icons in the secondary toolbars. An icon only needs to be in the header OR the satellite.<br />
	Separators are used in the secondary toolbar</div></div><hr />

I have problems seeing the relevance of this developing guideline,on my problem. I haven't developed anything yet. The only thing I did was to copy the session, as such, up to the customisation VRC. Pls specify more precisely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th April 2006, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Question - Are you sure the source code and executeables are the same in standard?  I have seen cases where the source for a form did not match what is standard.  We went to modify the form and found different differences after copying up to dev VRC.  Baan supplied us with the a quick dump.  So you might want to check that.  My only thought since we are on 4c4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I let it rest. Must present to the customer directly after the weekend. I just compensate by commenting out most of of parms to the create.extra.toolbar, leaving the ones that together forms the correct toolbar. According to the good old principle: two wrong becomes one right.<br />
Thanks for the answers though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, It has probably to do with initial hidden icons. Some how these did become visible and there are to much icons being added to the toolbar.<br />
In case you use webtop you can modify which icons should be shown. <br />
You should try to put some of the icons back to hidden.<br />
