If you do not own source code then be careful - since you should not have these include file source scripts.  Include files can be useful for things like common declarations (or even functions) to be used in multiple sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pralash</div><div class="date">20th December 2017, 07:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks so much for your information... I think that it's equivalent to the header file in C language.. We are include the predefined or our own header file according the process held in C Language....... Similarly I think the same concept is used in Baan Programming... Am I correct?<br />

Yes. It can be considered as C like headers but with its usage limited to declarations mostly and sometimes functions.<br />
<br />
A DLL on the other hand can be considered more like C header which can have capabilities of doing complicated tasks.</div></div><hr />
