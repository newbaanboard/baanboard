<br />
i'm doing an asp page that uses a COM object to connect to BaaN...the file works fine locally but when i try to test it remotely i have the following error: <br />
<br />
on the client side: server object error 'ASP 0177:80080005' Server.CreateObject failed  <br />
<br />
on the server side: The server {00000000-4000-11CE-AAA8-00608C50C597} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout  <br />
<br />
anyone came across with a similar problem ? i searched google and found one solution on the microsoft site...to create a new entry on regedit...but it's still not working...please help...i'm getting depressed with this problem  and my time to complete this task is rapidly running out :(<br />
<br />
thanks in advanced, <br />

<br />
Remembering my support job many customers had problems using dcom, it is not very easy to get it running.<br />
<br />
Did you use regsvr32. But I think your client user needs proper permission settings as well to connect to the server.<br />

Try using CreateObject instead of Server.CreateObject.<br />
<br />
Server.CreateObject is for MTS components which the Baan DCOM is not.<br />
