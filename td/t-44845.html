<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st November 2007, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a parent session, which depending on the order status calls 1 of 2 child sessions.  So for example: Order status is closed it uses my table where information has been archived, all other order status's will goto another child session which uses tisfc010.  Now the problem is that everything so far works fine except for resizing the form.  I have disabled resizing the form for all the sessions involved, but I can still resize the form.  Maybe I missed something on disabling the resize - other than just turning off resize frm on each of the forms.  Now the problem is if I resize the form the child session information disappears - I even tried passing the resize event to the child session, but it did not help.  See the attached screen shots.  You can see I made the form larger by stretching it vertically by 1/2 rows.  When hitting the next.view button you can see part of the data appears and then it dis-appears.  I tried searching, but did not find anything like this on the board.<br />
<br />
I am looking for any help on either (1) permanently disabling the resize function(preferred) or (2) getting the child information to reappear. Once the form has been resized nothing will appear from the child session (refreshing the data, refinding, next record).  For information purposes both sessions(parent and child) are multi-occurance with view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st November 2007, 23:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not actually done this, but here's what I can point to (hopefully this is the correct direction):<br />
<br />
I am, of course, assuming that this is a customized set of sessions, so you have the source code.<br />
<br />
Look up the BAAN On-line help in the Manuals section for &quot;switch.to.process&quot; - within that, look up the help for the variable &quot;sattr.comined&quot;. That somewhat describes the effect you want to achieve. I know it works, because it is used in the standard BAAN sub-session for Maintain Purchase Order Lines where the top form is different from the bottom form - I can resize the form and the display is intact. In fact, if the form becomes too small, the scroll bars appear for the bottom form - the top form begins to lose the columns as the size is decreased.] If you have everything working, it could be a one line change to your sub-sesion code:<br />
<br />
<br />
    sattr.combined = COMBINED.BOTTOM<br />
<br />
<br />
but I could be wrong - you may have to switch what you call the 'main' session as the display sub-session and the sub-sessions become the main sessions.<br />
<br />
[Back to the Resize: even though the manual says the option is effective for Type 2 or Type 3 form, it does not work - whether the box is checked or not, the resize is always enabled.]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd November 2007, 02:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - I can't remember what option I set at the start up of the main and subsessions.  One is set to top and one is set to bottom - not sure if it is sattr.combined.  Will have to check on that monday.<br />
<br />
As for switching which is the main and the child - I can't because in Baan IV when you close an order the tisfc010 records get deleted and moved to ticst030.  What we do is as part of the close process the records get copied into a new table tiudi010(legal requirements and clone of the tisfc010 records).  So what the user wants as part of display production planning is to see both those orders in tisfc010 and those in tiudi010.  So I came up with this - as the user scrolls through the tisfc001 data(which remains after closing), I can see the the order status and pop-up the planning in the lower session(using two different sessions for each of the tables).  <br />
<br />
To make it even more complicated I had to put two forms on the first session(actually one form listed twice) so the form tabs are at the top of the session.  With the tabs on the child session I could not switch between forms.  So now 1 main session that calls 4 children sessions depending on the order status and the current form number.  It works really well except for the resizing of the form. Well except for when it starts up - I think it does the before form and find field options, both which kill and start a subsessions making the lower screen blink twice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wrote you a special function that will disable the resizing of the current form.<br />
<br />
function disable.resize()<br />
{<br />
   long wdth,hght,m.win<br />
   <br />
   m.win = current.mwindow()<br />
   get.object(m.win,DsNwidth, wdth,DsNheight, hght)<br />
   <br />
   change.object(m.win,DsNminWidth, wdth,<br />
                              DsNmaxWidth,      wdth,<br />
                              DsNminHeight,     hght,<br />
                              DsNmaxHeight,     hght)<br />
   update.object(m.win)                           <br />
}<br />
<br />
I hope it helps ;)<br />
