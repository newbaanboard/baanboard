<br />
Is there a way to read a program script in development remotely from production box?<br />
<br />
Is there any alternate to this other than copying it to production box from development which auditors wont allow?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I might not understand what you are asking - but not in our 4c4 environment. With all the security we have nothing I can think of would work.   Back in the older days we could have done something like this at the unix level, but probably not thru baan.  We used to have some shared mount points in unix - where you could move files. Our admin has to export customizations in test, then scp it to production to import them.</div></div><hr />
