<br />
I have little problem. I want to change the status of Batches used in the session &quot;tfgld1502m000&quot;. There is possibility to use the session tfgld1116s000 to change the status of Batch, but I am not able to do that because the main fields are remains disabled. Is there any way that we can change the status of Batches used.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I wonder whether then you have authorisation for table maintenance...? If you do, then you can do it manually via GTM (ttaad4100)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Or alternatively this can mean that the status of this batch is not wrong, thus shall not be changed....</div></div><hr />

I updated the value through the session GTM (ttaad4100), but after that I get the error while try to proceed to finalized it. There should be some other points where information must be updated when we update the value through the session and not getting updated if we updated directly into the table through the session GTM (ttaad4100). Authorization is not the problem. Is there any other possibility.<br />

This session is only intended for batches that got corrupted/interrupted while - for instance - finalizing them. Not for finalized batches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before changes, the status was &quot;In use&quot;. <br />
<br />
Yes I tried to change the status in the table tfgld101 also, but unfortunatly I didnt found any entry for that Batch number in table tfgld101.<br />
<br />
Thanks for quick response<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, it is ok if there is no record in tfgld101, that depends on what stage the process got stuck. The status in tfgld100 should be changed to FREE; did you do that??</div></div><hr />

Yes, I updated the status from &quot;In use&quot; to &quot;Free&quot;. <br />

What is the error you receive now when trying to finalize, and at what stage exactly do u get it? Try to give some more information about your data, that might figuring out what your problem is, so that we can try to help you...</div></div><hr />

I came back after many days, I tried many things as you suggested but the problem is still not resolved. For more information, when we select a batch in session &quot;Select batches for finalization (tfgld1111s000)&quot; and then proceed to finalize, first we got the message that <br />
<br />
&quot;No data within selection&quot;<br />
<br />
after that in the display it prints &quot;Audit List - Finalization of Batches&quot;. <br />
<br />
The main information is printed like <br />
Batch Number <br />
Transaction Entry Date<br />
User login code<br />
Fiscal Period etc <br />
<br />
After above information its prints in the next line <br />
&quot;Batch header for transaction type missing&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, where I should check the missing information?<br />
<br />
Thanks for cooperation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">8th March 2005, 14:43</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds like the record for the transaction type is missing from table tfgld101.<br />

<br />
You are right, I already mentioned that the records are missing in able tfgld101. Where we check and add the information in that table.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
Mahmood</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">8th March 2005, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I would guess there are no transactions for that batch then - check tfgld102 to be sure. If there are no transactions I would delete the batch. If there are transactions, then insert records in tfgld101 using GTM - you will need 1 for each transaction type to match what is in tfgld102.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">29th December 2005, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello friends,<br />
<br />
I got the same problem again as we discussed here. <br />
<br />
Now my question is, if we delete the batches then how we can handle invoice for which these batches are supposed to created but there is not entry in the table tfgld101 and tfgld102? <br />
Is there any ppossibility that we can create new batches for the same invoice(s) and then finalized it? Creating transaction information in table fgld102 through the GMT is a bit risky (my view) because this table has too many fields.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I also encountered this problem quite frequent, where the batch is created in tfgld100 but missing in tfgld101 and tfgld102.  Can anyone tell me:<br />
<br />
1. How to trace back which sales invocies created this batch?<br />
<br />
2. Can I repost the sales invoices? what tables need to change? <br />
<br />
Please help!!<br />
