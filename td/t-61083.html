                 Here in my company there is business need for the estimated material session lines to be more than 9999, and Baan provide only TCPONO domian for that is only 9999.<br />
                    Now I want to change the ticst001.pono to 6 Digits, but there is lot of dependecies on this field and here lot of customization has also been done, I checked here at least 30 tables are got effected by this.<br />
<br />
                    So I want to know that is it possible to change the pono to 6 digits?<br />
And if yes then which way I apply. <br />
<br />
1.   To change the tcpono itself to 6 digit, so that all tables change to 6 digits.<br />
<br />
2. I have to change for all the 30 tables and reconfigure them.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Please tell me which is the safest way to do this.<br />
<br />
<br />

The problem was when did not own source code, so no way to recompile session scripts to make sure they would work.  At that point we gave up on changing the domain.  In each case you will need to change forms, reports and the tables to hold(or display) the 6 digits.  To me these become new customizations - added to what you already have.  I can't remember which domain we were looking at, but with this domain you might not need to check scripts.  I can't say since we do not own source code.  This is not an easy task.</div></div><hr />

<br />
                           I am little worry about the thing that the ticst001.pono has lot of dependency, I found through the stndard code that atleast 30 tables will get effect from this, but if 2-3 table not regocnize or if there is problem in reconfiguration of tables then it create problem..<br />
<br />
                           Any way I will try this ,  if any one  have more ideas then please share..<br />
