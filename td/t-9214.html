I want to create a Baan session that will enable a user to upload a csv file from their local machine to the Unix server.<br />
<br />
Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

I have had a look and it seems to be what I need.<br />
<br />
How do I go about creating this session?<br />
<br />
Obviously I cannot use the &quot;Generate Sessions&quot; because the session will not be based on any tables.<br />
<br />
Is there a specific type of session that I need to create?<br />
<br />
Or is there a certain type of form field that I need to put on the form?<br />
<br />
Im guessing that I write a on.choice command on the button and then in there, I out the client2server command.<br />
<br />
Is that correct?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

I have created a blank session with a button.<br />
<br />
On the choice section I have put this....<br />
<br />
<br />
choice.user.0:<br />
on.choice:<br />
	client2server(&quot;C:Andy.txt&quot;, bse.tmp.dir$() &amp; &quot;/Andy.txt&quot;, false, false)<br />
<br />
However when I compile, it says that &quot;there is an unresolved reference to client2server function&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
There is nothing else in the script.<br />
<br />

please ignore the last post, I had put the line into the declaration section without putting in &quot;Declaration:&quot;!!<br />
<br />
However I am now being told that ....<br />
<br />
&quot;3 arguments epected for function 'client2server'&quot;<br />
and<br />
&quot;Illegal argument 4 for function 'client2server'&quot;<br />
<br />
here is the code.  whats is the fourth argument here?<br />

Even sometimes depending on porting sets for the bw libraries.  <br />
The Baan 4c version we have on our system has the following call, expecting 3 arguments.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
function extern long client2server(<br />
         const string source(),<br />
         const string dest(),<br />
         long text.mode )<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is probably common for updated c4 systems.  You can check your version for sure by doing a bic_info on the ottdllbw object:<br />
<br />
In Unix, from the $BSE\baan\bin directory, run:<br />
<br />
$ bic_info6.1 ottdllbw</div></div><hr />

That thread talks about a server browser, I want to create a session that will browse the local machine allowing the user to put a local file onto the server in a specified directory, bit like a file upload web page...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">O I see.  I should have said, we're sure this exists in the c:\ directory, right?<br />
Still, I think you want to say 'c:\Andy.txt', not 'c:\\Andy.txt'.  I know that slash sometimes gets stripped, but I have a working example of server2client that just uses 'c:\tmp' for the path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">outra9e</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok<br />
<br />
I have removed the extra \, but it does not seems to have made any difference, the Baan account that I am currently logged in as and I am running the session under is bsp so it has permissions...<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the darn thing works, I have done it.<br />
In my example, I use a true for text mode.  Try that...<br />
Also, try typing out the full paths, although the bse.tmp part should work, at least we are eliminating one less problem.  <br />
In my example, I also have notes that the capitalization is very important.  <br />
This performs an FTP - I am assuming if you try to FTP this file, there is no permission or firewall issues, correct?<br />
About all I can say - here's the simple example I have of server2client that works for us:<br />
<br />
<br />
server2client(&quot;\\Kerma\Baan\TMP\HazMat1.txt&quot;, &quot;C:\TEMP\HazMat1.txt&quot;, 1)<br />
<br />
where Kerma is our server name - this is an NT example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is interesting, in your example, the UNIX path is the first path with the path on the client to the file being second....<br />
<br />
would this make a difference?  Mine is the other way around...<br />
<br />
I will give your example a try....<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine is for server to client, but they use the same concept.  And this example is NT ... I don't think so, but maybe an OS issue.<br />
<br />
Try the server to client and see I guess, since this example does work.  Put the file in the tmp directory in Baan and see if you can get it to transfer to your PC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">outra9e</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I have given the server2client a try as you suggested...<br />
<br />
server2client &quot;/baan/bse/home/bsp/rop2.txt&quot;, &quot;C:\rop2.txt&quot;, 1)<br />
<br />
This did not work either?<br />
<br />
Is there something missing?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">A starting parenthesis??  :)<br />
Assuming you have that in the code -<br />
If you try to FTP to this server using an FTP tool from your PC - are there any issues there?<br />
Also.../baan/bse/home/bsp  ... that's the actual name of the path?  Our home directories are not part of the BSE path...everyone is set up different, though.<br />
When you go to the file on the os, and do 'pwd', the path it gives should be the exact path you use, including capitals.  <br />
If still problems, you could include screen shots of the paths so there is a little better visual on our part.<br />
First make sure FTP is not an issue in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">outra9e</div><div class="date">14th March 2003, 11:09</div></div><div class="posttext">FTP is definitely not an issue, I use FTP on a daily basis, although I generally use the cmd prompt to ftp to the server as opposed to an ftp client.<br />
<br />
I have attached screens of the relevant paths in terms of the client2server funtion...<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />

Here is an example to make it simple for you. <br />
<br />
string 	source(80), target(80), fname(20)<br />
fname = &quot;np.txt&quot;<br />
source = &quot;C:\&quot; &amp; fname<br />
target = &quot;/app/common/home/nprao/&quot; &amp; fname<br />
e = client2server(source, target, false)<br />
fname = &quot;ipad&quot;<br />
source = &quot;/app/common/home/nprao/&quot; &amp; fname<br />
target = &quot;C:\&quot; &amp; fname<br />
e = server2client(source, target, false)<br />
<br />
It works fine for me so maybe you need to change your code use some variables and test it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">15th March 2003, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">If your problem is still unresolved, you may want to make sure a<br />
couple of things are going right:<br />
<br />
 1.The Path on the server exists and you are able to write a new file onto that path.<br />
<br />
    example: try creating a new file on the server in the following path:/home/yourbaanlogin<br />
<br />
  you may use seq.puts or through any other approach.<br />
<br />
  try to open and look at the file on the server.<br />
<br />
2.The path syntax for file on the client side is correct<br />
<br />
    example:<br />
       here is one I use for server2client<br />
      f2 = &quot;C:\\Test\\&quot; &amp; &quot;File_&quot;       <br />
<br />
 e=server2client(&quot;/home/&quot; &amp; logname$ &amp; &quot;/shortsreport&quot;, f2, false, false)  <br />
   if the file does get created on the client side, you may try the<br />
similar approach for client to server.<br />
<br />
Try to use a normal user login to run the session(instead of bsp)<br />
as in the end I am assuming the session could be used by any user.<br />
<br />
In the debug, you may want to look at the return values for <br />
server2client or client 2server if they are infact successful.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
