<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th August 2003, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a display session, where in the program I am filtering records from the main table using query.extend.where() [Baan 5.0b]. I need to change the sorting order instead of index1 (there is only one index) to a different field. In regular sql that would be 'order by table_id.table_field' etc. How do I do it in a display session?? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th August 2003, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually my preferred command is GROUP BY. I want to get the sum of all records per year...<br />
<br />
Anyone knows if this is possible for a display session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">29th August 2003, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The best way is to test it.  Since you're creating a display session, you don't have to worry about corrupting the data :).  Just remember that the query extension, if it contains anything, is appended to the main query with the sequence:<br />
<br />
&quot;select * from &lt;table&gt;&quot; &amp; &quot; where &quot; &amp; query.extension<br />
<br />
So you can't start the query extension with the order by, but you have to add some condition first.  Whether it will work, I'm not sure.  The group by will probably NOT work, since you would have to change the main query to include something like sum(&lt;fieldname&gt;).  That doesn't work!<br />
<br />
A general remark (again :p): why not work with a temporary table, filled with the data you need to display?</div></div><hr />

<br />
since you are on the BaaN-5/ERP series you should be able to use the new tools features of - Dynamic Index Switching</div></div><hr />
