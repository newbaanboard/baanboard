Line = 1 or 2 or whatever.  Can anyone tell me what that varible means and what &quot;Line&quot; is being reffered to?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that Line is a variable in the report script or the script, perharps to count the lines in the report. You should see how this variable is used in the script.<br />
<br />
I hope that help you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">31st October 2006, 05:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, Sole. Actually most of the time, Line is a variable set in the program script of the report session. It is usually a flag used by the programmer(s) of  the report session to differentiate different type of records returned by the query. Since Line is variable declared by programmer (as opposed to predefined variables), don't expect it to have same meaning across reports. To fully understand the meaning of Line variable in each of the reports, you have to have access to the program scripts of all the involved report sessions<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">31st October 2006, 07:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding to what Paul has mentioned, output expressions can be at times treated as the WHERE clause in a SQL statement. Based on what i understood from the years of working with Baan Reports, the expression Line = 1 is a flag which makes the section visible on the report. I have seen line =1 for making the section visible and Line =0 for hiding it, but i have never seen Line =2. Sometimes you can find that there is a criteria mentioned.<br />
For e.g. Output Expression = tdsls040.txta (which makes the section appear on the reports only when there is a header text present.)<br />
In short, expression can be treated as a criteria or a condition to show a particular report section..<br />
