All Fields are printed from program script. I cant view script. I just added one more field to that report detail section. When i try to print, its printing all rows with same value(Which is the last record value). When i debug that report script its taking correct values but in report its report last value for all. Can anyone help?? I have attached the output.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th July 2018, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I would first ask - are you sure all the fields are coming from the program script?  If it was me I would add a report script and in the before layout of the section go lookup what I need to add to the report.  If you have the session script you can debug it to see what it is passing each time thru at the report send.</div></div><hr />

But have you added any select query regarding that field in report script? if yes, then that select query is making a difference.</div></div><hr />

Then track as you print each record. So search on layout.again and see what samples you can find.</div></div><hr />
