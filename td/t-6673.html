<br />
BUT, when I start a process/print sesions in MODELESS mode, it still behaves as MODAL. The control is transferred to the started program and only when I close it, the control goes back to the calling program. I have tested this in debug.<br />
<br />
Anyone has similar experiences, clues/tips how they got around this situation ?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
if this process/print session is always started from another session then a crude workaround would be to change the window type of the the process session to Modeless with Menu instead of dialog.  I tried it and it is working but there might issues that u might have to look into depending on ur requirement <br />

<br />
BaaN Support gave me the clues to fix it. :D <br />
<br />
<br />
long procid<br />
<br />
procid = act.and.sleep(&quot;zmadm9400m000&quot;)<br />
reactivate(procid)<br />
sleep(2000)<br />
kill(procid)<br />
<br />
<br />
I found that I regained the control even if I was calling the print or process sessions.<br />
<br />
During my exploration, I also found some new tools functions which seemed interesting to share with others -<br />

<br />
The only issues I notice that the size of the new session's window will be the same as the original session, so if we have big/wide multi-occ/process/print sessions, they look like chopped windows. This will be useful if we have 2 sessions of similar size and we like a superimposition of one over the other. :cool:</div></div><hr />
