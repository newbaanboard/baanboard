However, neither the SQL format nor the Oracle SQL format is working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd September 2022, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Where are you doing the calculated field?  Is this easy-sql, in a session or in a report script? What have you tried so far.  I mean in a report field I have done stuff like total.hrs=0 ? 0.0 : past.due.hrs / total.hrs * 100  not sure what you are looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mo.Saber</div><div class="date">5th October 2022, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to do that in the Purchase Order report (tdpur440101000) where I want to print a certain calculated field if the tax code is 007 and a different calculated field if it is not. I did this:<br />
tdpur401.cvat=&quot;007&quot; ? ext.tax1 : ext.tax2<br />
However, it always results in false (prints tax2) even though that tax code is clearly 007 and is printed in the report as such</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th October 2022, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">In 4c4 cvat is 9 characters long and right justified. You could try something like shiftl$ - but make sure cvat is only &quot;007&quot; and not really something else.  Plus on my 4v4 I have cvat in tdpur041 not tdpur401 - but looks like you are on a different version.</div></div><hr />

Hello, try <br />
trim$(tdpur401.cvat)=&quot;007&quot; ? ext.tax1 : ext.tax2<br />
<br />
And tdpur401 is the right table (purchase positions) in LN.<br />
<br />
