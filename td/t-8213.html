<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ccsrvc</div><div class="date">23rd December 2002, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I updated isls0002 to include new fields I created on the tdsls040 table. When I execute this include from a new session that updates the tdsls040 record, my history record is written corectly from the updated tdsls040 record. If I change a field using Maintain Header Lines, it re-writes the tdsls50 record from the previous  tdsls050 record rather than writing it from an updated tdsls040. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if Maintain Sales Orders uses a different  include to update history record (tdsls050)?</div></div><hr />

Are you using Baan IV?<br />
<br />
As I know, the include is used by tdsls4101. So I think, that is not the reason why you get those results.<br />
<br />
Please remember that an include is included into the script at compilation-time.<br />
<br />
To make changes of an include current, you have to recompile every script which uses this include.<br />
<br />
But be carefull: <br />
<br />
If you recompile a script from a different package-vrc than your life-environment, you can get trouble with pmc.<br />
The recompiled object is allways stored at the life-environment on the hard-disk. Updates of the undlying vrc's are allways overruled by the recompiled object.</div></div><hr />

In that case all writes would pass the new DAL and the problem would not be there (provided coded correctly).<br />
<br />
Changing include files mean: also compile all objects that use the same include in a higher layer than the update standard. This may cause a problem with updates of the standard software that does not work, due to an object in a higher layer.</div></div><hr />
