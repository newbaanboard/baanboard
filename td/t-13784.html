<br />
Can ne one guide me on how can one set the No. of Copies variable in Report Printing ?<br />
<br />
In the device selection option we have a form field as No. of Copies.We can specify as to how many copies are required for this particular report.Can we somehow set this internally in code.<br />
<br />
regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you setting the variable spool.pr.copies in the program script or report script ? If you set it in the report script, at which report layout you set it ?<br />
<br />
I tried in the report script and it did not works.<br />
<br />
I do not have the access to the program script, so I am not able to set this variable in the prigram script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Either use the program script through AFS or user should set it manually in ttstpsplopen , then the number of copies would be printed accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">16th December 2003, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean you need to write your own script which starts the session (for which u do not have script) using stpapi functions and input all field values through stapi functions . <br />
<br />
Set the value of variable  'spool.pr.copies' to the process id of the AFS session using put.var function and then use stpapi.set.report function. <br />
<br />
For more information on AFS , u can check the AFS forum on the board.<br />
<br />
U need to set spool.pr.copies only when u fire an output through program. When user decides the device user can change / set the number of copies manually. Also he/she can set defaults &amp; preference for particular user or particular report in device settings. However there is no default number of copies for a particular report present only.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th May 2006, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you explain why you would not want them collated? I am sure there is a reason but I can not think of one.  I am not sure you can do what you ask without a lot of work.  I believe the report is created in a temp file and then sent to the printer with the number of copies.  What you are asking would be to either write the report with the copies included or get the temp file and resend it.  <br />
<br />
One solution would be to write the report to an ascii file - make sure the page lengths match between the priners and the ascii file.  Second write a program to read one page send it to another report with the spool.pr.copies set.  Then read second page - so on and so fourth.  I do something like this with a series of reports.  We run several reports in batch to files.  I then have a session where the user picks a work center and the script reads the ascii files printing only those pages with the work center in the titles.  Not elegant, nor does it fix page numbering - but it does prevent 20-30 managers from printing the whole reports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">10th May 2006, 00:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting problem... . Like Mark wrote, the report is send to an ascii file and this file is sorted before printing. If you have sources, look at the invoice report. It is a good object to examinate how you can control baan reports. Not exactly (but multiple invoice printing where every copy is printed after the origin... So it is half what you are searching) what you are looking for, but it can give you an idea how to do this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">10th May 2006, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the reason why I need printouts to not be collated.  I have created a program that prints box labels based on pieces produced on an order.  Say for a given order there are 500 boxes that need labels.  Each box needs a label on all four sides of the box. Each label indicates the box number as well. So 1 box needs 4 copies.  When the program outputs the labels it prints as I stated above 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.......5, 4, 3, 2, 1......5, 4, 3, 2, 1.    If there are are total of 2000 labels on the roll to disrtribute, in this scenerio, whomever is applying the labels have to find the break in the roll.   So if they are not collated, they print... 5, 5, 5, 5...4, 4, 4, 4....3, 3, 3, 3....2, 2, 2, 2.....1, 1, 1, 1....  This way they can apply the four box labels more efficiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th May 2006, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - that makes sense - labels versus report.  I do not know about your program, but the way we solved this for labels was just to put a loop around the rprt_send().  What we do is ask for the label printer and the number of copies.  We set something like num.copies = spool.pr.copies and then open the label report with 1 copy.  Then we just put a for statement around the report send.  This keeps the labels together.  Not sure how you print your labels, but that is how we solved the problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joepte</div><div class="date">24th January 2007, 12:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
How do I use spool.pr.copies if I want just one report to print multiple times and the other reports in this session to print just once.  Do I use the report group &amp; number or the name (e.g tdpur4401....) and set the spool.pr.copies = 5 for that report only?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th January 2007, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this a session you wrote?  If not which session are you talking about?  There really is not enough information on what you are asking.  If it is a session you wrote then you could set the spool.pr.copies before opening each of the reports.  If not can you explain exactly what and how it is running?  This might help someone make a suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joepte</div><div class="date">24th January 2007, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for you quick reply Mark,<br />
The session is print packing slips tdsls4403m000 (4cIV) and we have added a whloe lot of reports and when I print reportno 15 of reportgrp 1 I want 5 copies. The report will be printed to more than 1 printer.  I am trying to use these 2 predifined variables and the difficulty now is that I can never get the value of 15 in reportno even though I have by this time selected report 15.<br />
I thought these were available at runtime, am I wrong?<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th January 2007, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember correctly reportno does not match the reportno on the session.  So for example if I have 6 reports the numbers will be 1-6 - but on the maintain reports form I could call them 10-15.  I have never really used reportno and I am not positive about this.  I just checked it on a session where I have 6 reports - numbered 2,3,4,5,6, and 11.  When I select the last report it has a reportno of 6.  I am not sure if this is how it is meant to work.<br />
<br />
What I always use something like spool.report = &quot;rtisfc941702300&quot;.  I do not know why I use this format - just that I always have.  You can try this or making sure it is really reportno 15.<br />
<br />
On a side note what we did for some of our home grown sessions was to create kind of a printer profile for the session.  For our function server sessions we have a table we read to print different reports to different printers.  So for example - released inbound could go to one printer, error reports to a second printer.  In this case we run the print session multiple times to get the report.  Let me get a screen shot of an example.  Notice you can pick if you want the report and if you do where to send it.  I like these type sessions because with a front end you can do different things.  Not sure if this is relevant, but thought I would post it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joepte</div><div class="date">24th January 2007, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark, I was writing back to say I found spool.report working when I listed the varibles in debug so I went that way. Instead I'll say thanks again and your function server looks interesting and perhaps I can set that up another day.<br />
