Hi Bernd,<br />
<br />
I need to export data all records and all column from any table to Excel file.<br />
But when I used &quot;Create Sequential Dump of Table&quot;, I got a dump file that I can't use in another process. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd January 2019, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I typically use create sequential dump  and specify a field separator of |.  Then I can export it into excel like any pipe delimited file.  Other than that I cannot think of anything that does it easily.  You could look at using OLE automation (basically writing VB code in excel to extract data).  I know I use have a tool from Gordon Fasbender that would read the structure of any table into excel - but it did not import the records.  I don't recommend OLE automation - but others use it.  I had way to many problems and it was extremely slow for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">4th January 2019, 22:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I have written my own flexible export sessions using RDI calls to determine fields and field types for a single or list of tables from a spreadsheet.  The nice part of doing it this way is that you can trim string fields, handle delimiters within fields, convert dates/times to an excel-friendly format, and convert enum values to a string.  This is a good tool for export of data into a data warehouse or for migrating to another ERP.  A few days of programming is a good investment for this type of a tool.</div></div><hr />
