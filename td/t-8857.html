vendor and loaded to our customization VRC.  The domain used was a standard domain in BaaN.  When I move this form to a level<br />
above the customization VCR, the domian suddenly appears!!  Then if I remove the form, the domain now appears properly in<br />
our original location loaded (the customization VRC).  Wierd or <br />
what!!!<br />
<br />
To make it worst, this does not happen with every form loaded to<br />
the customized level!!<br />

Does any one have any ideas???</div></div><hr />

Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

What is the package of the form?<br />
Does the Own layer (above the Customised Video Cassette Recorder) have a separate package combination, and does that package combination also have an integration with package of the domain? And forms that are in the same package as the domain, they don't show this problem, and forms that are from other packages but use the same form do?<br />
<br />
If this is the case: create a package combination over the Own-layer and add all packages (Own of Customized, whichever you want) in that package combination.</div></div><hr />

WE only have 1 package combination that contain the VRC structure all derived in from each other in the proper sequence.<br />
All packages belong to this package combination;<br />

       pack combo is 40c2cecp     (all packages)<br />

               VRC          B40O              (derived from C)<br />

               VRC          Stabdard BaaN<br />
<br />
all VRCs contain all packages.   Domain td.....  is stored in standard VRC.  <br />
Form ftd....in B40C VRC does not display domain<br />
Form ftd....  in VRC B40O does show the form</div></div><hr />
