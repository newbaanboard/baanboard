<br />
You can take a look at session ttpmc2101m000 where the field details is related to the variable text.yn which is a program script variable.<br />
<br />
Press [Ctrl][Shft]4 to see the query that was used to collect the current data (the text.yn field is not included there, so no table field); press [Ctrl][Shft]7 to see the XML tree for the form, note that no table is related to the field.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put the variable on the form, as in Omeluuk's description - 'text.yn'.<br />
<br />
In the program script, you must declare it as an external variable:<br />
<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
<br />
extern  domain tcyesno     text.yn<br />
<br />
<br />
you can then have a field section associated if you want:<br />
<br />
<br />
field.text.yn:<br />
before.display:<br />
    do.something.to.fill()<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
    so.something.when.it.changes()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">surinder</div><div class="date">6th November 2003, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the additional information:<br />
<br />
This is Baan Standard form and I was looking to add this field without changing or modifying the source code.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of using it as a virtual calculated field using some formula like (tdsls101.oqua - tdsls101.bqua) in the expression tab of field properties.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Surinder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">6th November 2003, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, the calculation options is only available in the report fields, not the form fields.<br />
<br />
You cannot add a non-table field to a form if it is not declared in the script (or a table field of a table that is not declared in the script).<br />
<br />
The wrapper tools (like RMCgen, QKEY ) are perfect for this - adding fields and/or messages without having the source.  You still create a script, but do not change (or even see) the standard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was able to create field on the form not connected to any field in the table only with using the variable. Since we did not have access to the source code I used RMC GEN wrapper to do the job. It went like a breeze, RMCGEN worked perfect.<br />
