We are on IVc3 and are migrating to IVc4.At this time we would like to increase the order number from 6 digit to 8 digit. I understand changing the domain would call for changing the form, Report and we would have to do this individually. We don't use many of the Baan standard report. <br />
<br />
Is there a documented process by soeone for changing the domain length?<br />
We are trying to identify, how do we migrate data from IVc3 to IVc4, as it would be 6 digit in IVc3 and 8 digit in IVc4.<br />
I also heard in Baan IVc4 there is option to have 8 digit order number? Is this correct?<br />

<br />
Not exaclty: for baan IVc4 I heard something about some official patches that help you to increase those domains from 6 to 7 ( :eek: )  digits .<br />
<br />
Why the hell this domain is so short? There are so many projects that requires this change...  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">28th February 2005, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The Problem is not migrating the data or to customize the fields (okay, much work). Some Baanfunctions are/have been  hardcoded to &quot;999999&quot;. Especially set of numbers (i.e. free order numbers, in german Nummernkreisverwaltung, sorry I don't know a good translation).  So the biggest number you get is 999999. <br />
If I remember correctly there have been 2 places with this, but it's 6 years ago... . <br />
