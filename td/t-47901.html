<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">8th February 2008, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Use ; instead of | as field delimiter and excel puts all output in columns automatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th February 2008, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you can search the board and find several solutions for creating Excel reports from Baan.  Basically what we did was right an PCExcel device driver - with the filename and report name we look up in a table which macro to fire off to format the given report.  Of course most of our macros do more than just formatting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Follow the following steps and you may be able to print directly to EXCEL without any modifiucations to Baan reports!<br />
<br />
<br />
 Set up an EXCEL-Device if not already there:<br />
                 Device type : rewrite file<br />
                 4Gl Program: ttstpconv<br />
                 Argument: ASCII:excel.exe %s<br />
                 Path: excel.csv<br />
 Change the List delimiter in Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Regional Settings. Click the &#8220;Number&#8221; tab and in the &#8220;List Separator&#8221; field, replace the current default separator (usualy &quot;;&quot;) to Pipe (&quot;|&quot;) (In Windows XP there is an extra step involved.<br />
When you open the Regional settings window, you have to click customize next to the language choice drop down.)<br />
 Print your report to EXCEL-Device!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peter59</div><div class="date">12th February 2008, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">If you need more then 255 columns for a baan report designed for MS-Excel or you will not use any delimiter (like '|'), you can customize your report like an XML. The effect will be that Excel opens the file and the user will have nothing do do (like: this filed ist numeric and so on). With MS-Excel Version 2003 it is possible to give out an XML (spezial designed for Excel) with a Baan report. This report contains XML tags which are needed by Excel. You can try this by yourself: Open a new Excel file, type in data and save this with extension *.xml. Then open this file with any editor and you'll have a look on the structure. Then move this file to another name with the extension *.xls and double click an it. In the attachment you'll find an example.<br />
<br />
Good luck! Peter<br />

<br />
I like to discuss on old post. Rather than opening a new thread.<br />
<br />
Yes above solution is also worked for me.<br />
But my requirement is little different. Here users don’t want to change the individual system “List Separator”.<br />
<br />
Please advice, what I would say to users? Is any other alternative way is possible?<br />
<br />
Please assist me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th August 2010, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I can think of 3 other options:<br />
<br />
(1) Purchase one of the reporting tools that takes baan reports and converts them into excel. I think NAZDAQ has one.<br />
(2) Write macros to convert the reports for the user.<br />
(3) Create comma delimited reports instead of pipe delimited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">som.papai</div><div class="date">9th August 2010, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Thanks for ur reply.<br />
<br />
If I go for option three.<br />
<br />
How to create comma delimited reports instead of pipe delimited?<br />
<br />
I am not specifying any delimited in Baan report, from where it's taking? <br />
<br />
The List separator earlier was comma “,” now I changed to pipe “|”.With this settings no pipe is coming in excel sheet.<br />
<br />
User want comma as List separator not pipe, but with this setting pipe will again come In excel sheet. <br />
<br />
Any ideas please advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th August 2010, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">When I say created comma delimited reports I mean go copy the original report into a new report. Then edit the report and replace the | with ,'s.  Then when the user runs it straight to excel it is already in comma delimited.  The other way is to take the report script and modify it to create a .csv file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">som.papai</div><div class="date">9th August 2010, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark. I understand.<br />
<br />
Please tell me the character variable, which will set the report delimited field as pipe or comma.<br />
Like chr$(09) will create tab. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th August 2010, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">As I mentioned you have to actually change the &quot;|&quot; to &quot;,&quot;. There is nothing that globally changes it - you have to actually change the report.</div></div><hr />

Hi, <br />
Try this new tool I have created http://sourceforge.net/projects/baanex/<br />
It is free to use, creates direct Excel file. Instead of a Delimited Excel file.<br />
Best Regards,<br />
