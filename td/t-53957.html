<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">10th October 2008, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running with Informix db using level 2 drivers.  We run update statistics everyday. Informix version 10.00.fc3w4.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we need to read and update many records in a large file, for example, the item master.  So we write a program that reads all the records and given certain conditions, a field is changed.  The item number is displayed on the form while the program is running to indicate progress.<br />
<br />
The longer the program runs, it seems to run slower.  This is based on observing how fast the displayed item on the form changes. <br />
<br />
What is bizarre about this is if I look at the table and move from one record to the next, not changing any data, the displayed item on the running program changes at a faster pace.  I assume the program is running faster.  If I stop clicking to the next record, the program slows down.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain this?<br />
<br />
I began to notice this behavior after we migrated to the level 2 driver.  Is there something we should do different?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this may happen when the commit.transaction() was not called yet.<br />
This may cause some slowly on the process because the buffer is getting full of records.<br />
<br />
My suggestion it's to create a count(if it nos exists yet) to commit the informations every 50 records...<br />
<br />
hope it helps</div></div><hr />

My workaround was to use commit.transaction() after say 100 writes.<br />
