<br />
So you run this report - it works and downloads the file to the client machine? Your client machine? It downloads it to your c:\temp directory?  I have never used client to server in a report script - I usually use it in my session script.  I run the report to a file.  Let it close, then use client to server to download the file in the session script.<br />
<br />
 Or is someone else running the report and downloading to their machine? If that is the case can't you go see the file in the /tmp directory on the server.<br />
<br />
I am not exactly sure what the issue is.</div></div><hr />

Make it simple.  <br />
You have written functionality of report writer in report script !!<br />
First of all, you need to generate an update session (type 4). This will auto generate a program script with update properties. In the update function open an SQL query and within the selectdo, create a temp file using creat.tmp.file$(). Open this file and dump your header (one time only) and keep writing all your data columns. Close this temp file and capture the directory and filename. After closing, bring the file from server to client using server2client() and while dumping to client locatin rename this file to .csv  and open csv file using app_start(). This will open your generated file in MS-Excel. You can convert it to .xlsx after making changes and saving locally. There is no need to use any report script and if so required, you can do it in program script itself when you are preparing the data columns.</div></div><hr />
