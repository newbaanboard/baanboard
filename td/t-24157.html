<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tharden</div><div class="date">27th May 2005, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two Baan instances on two separate servers.  One is in the U.S. (baanus), the other in Canada (baancan).  Both are running Oracle 8i and Baan IV ver B40c.75.<br />
Although these two databases are not sharing data, I would like to create sessions in the U.S. instance (baanus) to look at information on the Canadian instance (baancan).  <br />
I have been looking through the different threads on this board and have seen some references to a remote connection, but the references don't give much detail on how it is set up.  I also have seen references to adding lines to my tabledef6.1, but again I'm unclear as to what to add.  <br />
I appreciate any input from anyone who as successfully done this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
if these 2 servers/instances are completely different with different tools database, it seems like a good case to use Open World.<br />
<br />
I am not aware of your complete environment setup or requirements, alternatively, you can explore using Multi-Site Control in Exchange Schemes (if this is available in your BaaN Version), else ftp in and out the datafiles using jobs or use sockets programs.</div></div><hr />
