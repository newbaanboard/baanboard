<br />
I am trying to run notepad.exe using run.prog but its not working. I am using following code to start NotePad.exe<br />
<br />
long app.result<br />
app.result = run.prog(&quot;notepad.exe&quot;,&quot;&quot;, RP_WAIT)<br />
<br />
After I run this code, I can see the notepad.exe process in Windwos task list, but  notpad.exe GUI never comes up, also run.prog never returns, untill I terminate the notepad.exe process. If I use RP_NOWAIT option, then run.prog returns, but notepad.exe does not comeup, and I have to terminate the process using task manager.<br />
<br />
Any clue whats going wrong in the above code? Actually I want to be able to run an application installed on the same server on which baan is installed.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any clues.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

The function run.prog() runs an operating system command. It is a system-dependent function. It must not be used in applications that are distributed across different platforms.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can try to use app_start() to start the notepad locally.<br />
<br />
The return values help to know what actually went wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.  I want to run the program on the server, not on the client. Problem is that the program is lanuched and could be seen in the windows task list. Its just that it does not returns/responds. For example instead of running notepad.exe I tried to run a console program which simply writes a text  in file, and I got the same strange behaviour from run.prog. <br />
<br />
More precisely, I will not be running notepad.exe in the real scenario, it will be just a non-interactive console program. The notepad.exe example I used to test whether it was problem with the console program or the &quot;run.prog&quot;, and it seems to be due to the later.<br />
<br />
I will appreciatate any further clue to debug/idenitfiy the cause why &quot;run.prog&quot; is not working as expected, or any other way to execute any non-interactive program on the server.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I use run.prog() all the time and it works. Can you rty it with someting else than notepad.exe (give it the full path of the exe)?<br />
<br />
The old way of executing programs was using the Shell() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_starting_and_stopping_programs_shell) function, but it is only for UNIX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">1st September 2006, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">If I am correct you need to start it via a command shell which has notepad.exe as a argument.<br />

<br />
The function that I wrote is given below<br />
<br />
function my.run.prog()<br />
{<br />
	long app.result<br />
<br />
	app.result = run.prog(&quot;E:\mydir\myprog.exe&quot;,&quot;&quot;, RP_WAIT)<br />
	<br />
	if (app.result &lt; 0) then<br />
		message(&quot;Error 1! Could not start program!&quot;)<br />
	else <br />
		if (app.result &gt; 0) then<br />
			message(&quot;Error 2! Program terminated abnormally!&quot;)<br />
		else<br />
			message(&quot;Success!&quot;)<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
I also tried using <br />
<br />
app.result = run.prog(&quot;e:\winnt\system32\cmd.exe&quot;,&quot;-c E:\mydir\myprog.exe&quot;, RP_WAIT)<br />
<br />
<br />
but same results as without cmd.exe.<br />
<br />
After running a number of tests with different programs, I found that some programs do run correctly, but some do not. My observation is that any program (Console or  GUI based) which does not engages command shell while it is executing (i.e. command prompt returns immediately, but programs keep executing in parallel and teminates later independednt of the command prompt), is not run correctly by run.prog. <br />
<br />
The console program which I have developed does not engages command prompt, and perhaps thats the reason its not being run correctly by Baan (based on above observation).<br />
<br />
Any further thoughts to workaround this?<br />

<br />
You can write a small VB application that will execute your program and wait for it.<br />
<br />
Then execute the VB application from your script.<br />

Yes, I think that will do the trick :-)<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone.<br />

Jabran, <br />
<br />
The &quot;-&quot; option is more Unix style and the typical Windows style for options is &quot;/&quot;.<br />
C:\&gt;cmd /?<br />
Starts a new instance of the Windows XP command interpreter<br />
<br />
CMD [/A | /U] [/Q] [/D] [/E:ON | /E:OFF] [/F:ON | /F:OFF] [/V:ON | /V:OFF]<br />
    [[/S] [/C | /K] string]<br />
<br />
/C      Carries out the command specified by string and then terminates<br />
/K      Carries out the command specified by string but remains<br />
/S      Modifies the treatment of string after /C or /K (see below)<br />
/Q      Turns echo off<br />
I hope you got the answer now, for why &quot;command prompt returns immediately&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for replying late. Yes, you are right, -c will not work on Windows, and when doing &quot;cmd /c Notepad&quot;, the shell waits for the notepad to be terminated before returning again to command prompt.<br />
<br />
Thanks for providing the detail :) <br />
<br />
