<br />
I have used a Wrapper on a standard ACR report Session and i get the report printed. Now i dont want the Report Window selection to be coming up. I have used brp.open in my wrapper script but to no avail, as brp.open is again used in standard script/object.<br />
<br />
Any way i can supress the Device Selection Window?<br />

So for example if I did not like what the choice.cont.process did I would write the new section in my wrapper program and make sure I did not call the standard code for that event.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Yes, but it kindof defeats the purpose of wrapper itself, having to write the code..<br />
<br />
Was thinking on the lines of a predefined variable which sets to suppress the Device Selection Window, so far couldnt find any</div></div><hr />

I think what Mark meant is, find the function where the standard code is calling brp.open() and then re-write that function in the wrapper with your own version of brp.open()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th November 2018, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">What Bhushan said.  The wrapper technique works good for adding addition checks and such, but something more complicated like this you basically have to replace infor code with your code - not much choice.  Well - the other choice is to buy source code.</div></div><hr />

3)corresponding report open<br />
4) again report se;ection window opens<br />
5) device selection.<br />

please guide me..........to solve this issue.<br />
<br />
very very urgent.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd June 2021, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I used a wrapper scripts was not for something this complicated.  For this case you would have to replicate the code sections that is opening what I would guess would be 2 reports. But it could be that Infor screwed up and it asks you to open it twice, but you only get 1 report.  So you could change like the choice.continue section and/or the choice.print.data sections to do what you want.  To me to rewrite some of those sections you would need the code to get it correct - or at least know what calls to make to other subroutines.<br />
<br />
With me if the standard session opened the report twice (when it shouldn't) then I would report it to infor and let them fix it.  Maybe there is something ln that would cause it, but not sure since I do not know ln at all.</div></div><hr />
