<br />
I have this problem of &quot;running low on memory&quot; when I run a customized process session on Baan IV C4. Let me explain the program logic ...<br />
<br />
There are around 220 files placed on a file server. Each file will have close to 3000 and odd Items listed in it. My process session is supposed to process these Items and come out with a list of all the alternate items for each item in the file. The same has to be done for all 220 files. The out put has to written onto a ASCII file.<br />
<br />
The problem - Every time I run this process session I would get a fatal error Running on Low memeory. Before I get this error the session would have processed around 45 - 50 files out of 220 files.<br />
<br />
I then tried to write the output to seperate files. In other words each file output is written onto unique ascii file. Even then I get this fatal error of running low on memory.<br />
<br />
I have checked user limit using command &quot;ulimit -a&quot;. It has memory of kbytes 32768. Do you think that this is the problem? Please note that I have used couple of arrays but memory allocation/de-allocation for those arrays is done dynamically for each file.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion on this is very helpfull for me.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
assuming that you are already doing seq.close() on each file you processed there might still be the possibility that memory isn't correctly released - just a guess, I never ran into this problem.<br />
On the other hand you could try to validate that the problem really has nothing to do with your arrays by commenting them out and for a test just open and close all the 220 files to see if the problem persists.<br />
If it's possible without too much reprogramming, I would try to convert the session into a subsession which processes one file at a time and call this session from another session for each file to be processed - perhaps this could help.<br />
On the other hand I often call shell scripts using awk scripts to solve batch file processing problems which might need HUGE arrays - if your problem can be solved in such a way then this solution should be easy. In other words - if your program logic works with one control file that contains &quot;item:alternative item&quot; then it should be easy to create this control file with a Baan session and process the 220 files with awk and the control file .... but this assumes that you don't need access to Baan DB when you process these files.<br />
Feel free to contact me if you need help with awk.<br />

<br />
Your suggestion paid off. The session processed all the 220 files without throwing up fatal error Running low on memory.<br />
<br />
What I did - Developed a new sub session taht would process each file and then gets closed.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

You should always use seq.close() for every seq.open() <br />
You should have got this error -<br />
24 EMFILE - Too many open files<br />
Description: <br />
This error indicates that too many file descriptors are open. No user is allowed to open any file.<br />
 <br />
Solution: <br />
No process can have more than 20 file descriptors open at a time. Ask your system administrator to change the following parameters to increase the number of open files that is allowed: <br />
The NOFILES parameter, which defines the maximum number of open files per process and must have minimum value of 256. Preferably more.<br />
The NFILE parameter, which defines the number of open files in Baan and must have minimum value of NOFILES * BAAN User License * 3 + 100. Preferably more <br />
Also refer to the HP-UX documentation for - nfile (http://docs.hp.com/en/B3921-90010/nfile.5.html)</div></div><hr />
