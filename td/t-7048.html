<br />
Please check your code. I guess you might have made a mistake -<br />
<br />
print cf$(8),mess.form,cf$(0)<br />
<br />
It should be -<br />
<br />
spool.pr.line = cf$(1) &amp;&quot;Printed Bold&quot; &amp; cf$(0)<br />
<br />
You need to use the screen codes and append the string to be displayed between the tags of start bold and end bold/normal mode.<br />
<br />
The screen code 8 is for underscore underscore mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th October 2002, 03:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Armando,<br />
<br />
As Ed says in the other post he has not seen bold work on the GUI. So I am not sure that you are doing anything wrong. You may want to try the cf$(4).<br />
<br />
And NPR says:<br />
It should be -<br />
<br />
                              spool.pr.line = cf$(1) &amp;&quot;Printed Bold&quot; &amp; cf$(0) <br />
<br />
Why spool.pr.line? Isn't this only for reports? Armando says that he is doing this on a form so I believe print is correct in this case.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mark<br />
<br />
PS I deleted the duplicate post by Armando.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">8th October 2002, 03:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the confusion Mark,<br />
<br />
I was using the example from the other posting -<br />
<br />
<br />
Example<br />
<br />
| To screen<br />
print cf$(4),&quot;This is reversed printing on the screen&quot;,cf$(0)<br />
<br />
| To printer<br />
spool.pr.line = cf$(4)&amp;&quot;Printed reverse&quot;&amp;cf$(0)<br />
<br />
spool.line()<br />
<br />
<br />
I just tested it works in reports, I couldnt get it working for the form fields.  :( <br />
<br />
Maybe dbinderbr, needs to post a sample code for GUI. I used ASCII and BaaN-4 long back in 1997.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th October 2002, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">U may use pre-defined variable attr.cf (R/W)  in before.display of the field.  U may set the values from 0 to 15 and see the results.<br />

I had tested this long back .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertB</div><div class="date">8th October 2002, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Armando,<br />
<br />
I couldn't even get the bold to work in the GUI (Vc), let alone reverse!!<br />
<br />
So, true to form ;), I  played around with some Baan Objects, and came up with a form-label that has configurable positioning, font, font-size, font-bolding and font-italics (but, strangely, not color :( ). I used this in a Print session form, but I guess it could go on any form (?).  <br />
<br />
You have to play around with the positioning a little, and make sure you have room on the form for the label. See the attached file for details... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 09:25</div></div><div class="posttext">RobertB's remarks are correct . <br />
<br />
Attr.cf tested by me was for Reverse . If attention catiching is the issue you can use attr.cf = 4 in before display of the form field which will give reverse font.<br />
<br />
All other code features like underline , bold blinking etc are not working in GUI (BW). It works only in ASCII interwace (BA).<br />
<br />
If u need only bold font and that too in GUI , you may contact BGS.<br />
<br />
However as far as i know , they also may not be able to do anything because of the way BW interface works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmartinezber</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, It's long time ago.<br />
<br />
But I've been trying to remark special lines in a multiline form using &quot;attr.cf = 4&quot; in the before.display and others. Nothing goes ahead.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea?, my userkey wants to see differences between lines.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 01:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe an easy solution for the problem. :p<br />
<br />
If you have a spare line on your form (just below the item description field), add a new string field there with the bold attribute set during the form design.  Then, in the select part of the query, clear the field's value, and in the selectempty part, set this field's value to the message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">It has worked very nicely for me . <br />
<br />
I can see following reasons why it may not be working at ur end.<br />
<br />
1. The code attr.cf = 4 may not  be executed at all . Meaning the condition on which this may be executed may not be satisifed at all. Beware of string comparisons with table fields with trailing spaces. Table fields return fixed number of strings.<br />
<br />
2. The code written in before.display will get executed only for display field. The field in ur case may be input .</div></div><hr />

I have BaaN ERP, and  attributes that appear in the word document aren't in my field window (form editor).<br />
<br />
thanks.<br />
<br />
Do you have any other idea?, <br />
<br />
I haven't got extra fields or lines, I have a multine window, and I don't know how to set &quot;bold&quot; in design time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">26th June 2003, 08:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I think u r  right. It may be the version difference .<br />
<br />
But BaanERP windows interface is superior to Baan IV . I am sure somebody on BaanERP can help u out very easily in accomplishing ur objective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">16th September 2003, 11:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried to find attr.cf in the tools help for BaanERP. Couldn't find it. Maybe this variable doesn't work for ERP?<br />
<br />
(I put it into the code. The compiler works without error, but it doesn't work!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">16th September 2003, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Spartacus,<br />
<br />
All the functions listed under - Character-based windows - overview and synopsis  (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_char_b_win_overview_and_synopsis) are valid only for the BaaN-4 series on the Unix terminals and not for BW/Worktop/Webtop Interfaces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">17th September 2003, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">So Baan didn't do a good job, to describe the &quot;Character-based windows&quot; functions in BaanERP, or? Is a little bit confusing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">17th September 2003, 20:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Spartacus,<br />
<br />
When its specified - Character-based windows it means that they are valid for the BA interface.<br />
<br />
Hence, I think BaaN is clear in this instance so you cant say they didnt do good job. I guess you might be confused with the terminology. Although there are instances when the documentation is not always perfect with the latest changes in the tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought threre is no BA inferface anymore for ERP? So I took a look in $BSE/bin and found.... a ba6.2 !! So I tried from ksh to start but get an error.<br />
<br />
Think I have to read the docu, what ba6.2 realy does!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">No ascii interface...that's the pitch, yet General Table Maintenance, and I think some tools / validation sessions still come up ascii.  Maybe ba6.2 is there for running those sessions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GTM does not use the ba6.2 interface.  It uses the old fashioned Character Based Windows functions (similar to the old Unix-C style - Cursors, Panel, Menu.h header files &amp; functions)<br />
<br />
Here is a example-<br />
<br />
function	main()<br />
{<br />
long 	main.win<br />
string description(320), title(80)<br />
<br />
description = &quot;Testing&quot;<br />
title = prog.name$<br />
main.win = new.window(23, 80, 1, 1)<br />
print fg$(CW.CYAN)<br />
box(1, 2, 80, 3, 0)<br />
print fg$(CW.WHITE)<br />
cl.screen(2, 3, 78, 1)<br />
mb.display(description, title, 76)<br />
print cp$(4, 3), cf$(1), title, cf$(0)<br />
cl.screen(2, 5, 78, 18)<br />
refresh()<br />
suspend(3000)<br />
}<br />
<br />
Credits to Nico, I came across that one from his tip.</div></div><hr />
