<br />
Please take a look at Vamsi's thread. I posted another version that works on our Unix platform. The PDF file that gets created by Ghostscript is not pretty, but maybe you could work that out for us.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!!<br />

The workaround would be to use a Windows printer but then  print to a file (local PC), rename the .prn file to .ps, then use the conversor from Ghostscript, if you don't want to code...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">9th December 2001, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you who do not need server based conversion (no jobs!) please take a look at Freepdf (http://www.webxd.com/zipguy/freepdf.htm). This lets you print to a local printer which generates PDF. The underlying components are still Ghostscript and a port monitor called Redmon. If you have NT workstations, you may have to experiment - NT comes with a port monitor.<br />
<br />
Click here (http://www.webxd.com/zipguy/freepdf/fprfarch.jpg) to see what Freepdf does.<br />
<br />
All these solutions presented assume you will want to use some opensource or free software. If you do not have that constraint there are a lot of commerical/shareware options. Check out http://www.pdfzone.com/ for some details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Freepdf95 or 98 does not run with bwprint 6.1c.04 on Windows 95.<br />
<br />
So, I upgrade to bwprint version 6.1c.06.01.  Now freepdf runs.<br />
<br />
But, when printing a P.O. that has many lines and continues onto the next page (20 lines), line (say 15) that should be printed at the bottom of page 1 is not printed at all.  Not at the bottom of page 1, nor at the top of page 2.  Page 1 ends with line 14, and page 2 starts with line 16.<br />
<br />
So, I need version 6.1c.04 or lower to get my P.O to print correctly, but then I can't utilize the freepdf utility.<br />
<br />
Has anyone come across anything like this before?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">22nd May 2002, 05:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting that you should be posting this today. Yesterday I was talking about this at my site. For an indepth understanding please read &quot;Baan Windows Printing&quot; document (should be on the Baan support site). Baan decides how many lines to print to a page on the server. It does not know anything about font heights and other things that get manipulated on the client side in BWPrint.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of solutions to the problem:<br />
<br />
 Reduce the number of lines per page. You can do this in fonts by papertype. Or you can set the report to print only so many lines. This is an option on each of the reports (this option is discouraged).<br />
 Increase the lines per page for the offending font on BWPrint. Do not forget to distribute your registry changes to all clients (Boy, do I love Citrix!).<br />
<br />
<br />
Please read the document mentioned before doing anything.</div></div><hr />
