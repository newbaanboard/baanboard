<br />
I'm developing a session in which sls orders, pur orders, rfq's and purchase order advices are linked (looking from the sls side). The session provides an overview of the current sls situation to the end-user. The session is a type2 display session with main table tdsls401.<br />
<br />
Records should be filtered: only unique combinations of sls order, pur order, rfq and purchase order advice should be shown. Using main.table.io this is easy. But since a dal exists for tdsls401 all main.table.io actions are deactivated. So: the skip.io I programmed in after.read will never be executed.<br />
<br />
Using query.extend is not possible (the programming to find the correct rfq etc is too complex). Also I don't want to modify the tdsls401 dal (the after.get.object function) since the filtering I want is definitely specific for the session I'm developing.<br />
<br />
The only solution I see is to deactivate the DAL, but searching through baanboard didn't provide a clear and definite answer. So:<br />
<br />
1. Is deactivating DAL possible (and if so how to do it)<br />
2. If deactivating is not possible ... is the thing I want to do impossible?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your time ...<br />

2) Solution one: Create a new table, build temporarily records there (copy tdsls401 or some subset), use that table as main table<br />
3) look at it from the functional side (just guessing): Probably pcs projects by sales order would give you want you want, there is a project dashboard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But: <br />
1. Turning the DAL off IS possible. You can do it in ttaad4100 (Deactivate DAL). The problem is what programcode to type in to do this in a program script. Turning the DAL off is in my situation the best strategy. <br />
2. A temporary table could be a solution but keeping the tables in sync would not be so nice.<br />
3. The session I develop is in fact a portal for the enduser in which all regular order handling should be possible (create sls order, create lines, generate rfq, create po etcetera etcetera). <br />
<br />
Thanks for your answers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With LN tools it is possible to switch off the dal for a specific program, by setting the disable.dal() function in the before.program section. It has been introduced, so that it is possible to introduce the usage of a DAL on a certain table in a controlled way. Suppose there are 10 sessions which are using the same maintable and you only have time to check and implement the usage of the DAL for that specific session. In the other 9 sessions you can then use the disable.dal() function, so you can work on those later on. <br />
Of course it is advisable to always use the DAL if there is one, because it can (and should) make sure that you have data consistency. And again the function is only available with LN tools.<br />

<br />
1. Create Dummy baan tables using view in the database. e.g. tdsls900 based on the view of table tdsls400. you may have to create the tables only where the DAL is present and you do not want to modify the dal. (also you may have to modify the baan dict file)<br />
2. create new session using new baan tables.<br />
<br />
this should work if your database supports views. onlne problem with this solution is when the tables get reconfiged. you will have to re-create view. baan drops everything views, permission etc in table reconfig.</div></div><hr />
