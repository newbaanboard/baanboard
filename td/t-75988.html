<br />
We want 3  reports from same session to come in 1 single pdf output in docman. We have created report rules in docman .We  have specified the keyword1 for the group . The reports  are opened with brp.open in session .  The 1st report is defined as main and other 2 as addendum .<br />
<br />
When we print the report to docman , we see document ids  created in Batches. The keyword is rightly populated . However there are only 2  document id's . When we preview it  , only 1  report output is visible . We expected  3  document id with  all 3 report outputs available in batches . <br />
Are we doing anything wrong here or missing anything.</div></div><hr />
