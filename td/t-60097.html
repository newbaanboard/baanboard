<br />
Using the standard XML parser I have been trying to read a multi-line field (which in the XML file contains line feeds: x'0D + x'0A). <br />
<br />
I have tried to read the node using xmlgetdataelement as well as xmlgetdata but both functions removes all CR+LF's and presents the multi-line text as one (very long) field.<br />
<br />
I tried to save the XML-file in UNIX format - the result was the same :-(<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me: How do I read such a multi-line field?<br />
<br />
When I debug and display of the node (using &quot;Show XML tree&quot;), the individual lines are perfectly displayed. (?)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to ask if you solved this problem because I have actually the same problem/situation and can find any solution. Would be great to hear from you!<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
i think that this could be done via the  parameter whitespacehandling in the xmlread instuction:<br />
long xmlRead(long fp, ref string error, [ long whitespacehandling ] )<br />
<br />
whitespacehandling = xmlPreserveWhiteSpace. Look also in the help of xmlRead for more information.<br />

<br />
Yes I did get around the problem, but unfortunately not the most elegant way. <br />
<br />
First I discovered that if the multiline text was surrounded by a &quot;[CDATA[&quot; tag it is treated as &quot;Unparsed Character Data&quot;. The XML element would in other words have the following structure:<br />
&lt;nodename&gt;&quot;[CDATA[...multi-line text...]]&lt;/nodename&gt;<br />
<br />
Having done so the file was at least parsed without errors, but unfortunately the line feeds in the text were turned into spaces, and I needed well defined line breaks in the texts.<br />
<br />
Therefore I decided to change all the line feeds into a dummy character sequence: &quot;$$&quot;.<br />
<br />
Having parsed the file and read the node, I now run the contents through a tiny procedure, which converts &quot;$$&quot; into a line feed.<br />
<br />
Not elegant :-( ...but it works</div></div><hr />

thanks for the answers. Unfortunately my problem is the same but not exactly. Because I don't have a xml file which I read and load into the memory. I'm getting SOAP Responses directly into Baan via the Baan SOAP Client. So the Response is a XML Structure which goes directly into the memory.<br />
<br />
SO I proberly don't have any other choice than contact the Baan Support!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You just have to search the input string for CRLF and exchange the characters with your line &quot;feed dummy characters&quot; ($$ in my example). Afterwards the input string is ready for the LN XML parser <br />
<br />
But if you could manage to make Infor Support fix the problem in a general way, it would be usefull to all of us - and a far better long term solution.<br />

I've already tried that.But when I write the multiline content into a string Variable all CRLF are already cutted out. But all these function with write the content of a Node to a String do that. Or do you might know some function which I don't know? :-) <br />
<br />
----------<br />
	string t.str(1) mb based<br />
	alloc.mem(t.str, 500000)<br />
	long t.file<br />
	long i<br />
	long ascii<br />
	string t.s(1)<br />
	<br />
	t.xml.node = xmlFindFirst(&quot;Response&quot;, i.xml.response)<br />
|	t.str = xmlData$(t.xml.node)<br />
|	xmlAllocPrettyString(t.str, t.xml.node)<br />
	xmlWritePrettyToString(t.str, t.xml.node)<br />
<br />
<br />
	<br />
	for i=1 to 5000<br />
		t.s = t.str(i;1)<br />
		ascii = asc(t.str(i;1))<br />
	endfor<br />
