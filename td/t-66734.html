<br />
I have a script and 3 seperate reports.  Based on criteria, one of the 3 reports, which are labels, needs to print.  The script is a WIP right now.  I expected to use the brp.open(), etc commands but no data printed.  I check make sure all variables are externs.  So I use rprt_open(), etc commands and the data is printed.<br />
<br />
I even generated a new session with a report on a single table, just printing 3 fields.  The data prints with the rprt commands but not with the brp commands.<br />
<br />
Is there an #include.  I've looked at other scripts and there are no #includes.<br />
<br />
I have recently upgrated from SP19 to SP32.  Also migrated from Unix to Windows, but I doubt the migration would affect this.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for any help.<br />

<br />
Are you using a mix of the rprt &amp; brp commands?<br />
<br />
The rprt commands are 'short' versions for the brp commands, but they cannot be mixed.  For example, rprt_open is like brp.open( spool.report, spool.device, 1 ).<br />
<br />
When you open the one report with brp.open(), you get a brp_id.  Are you using this id when you are sending data with brp.ready(brp_id)?<br />
<br />
Finally, I am assuming that you are closing the report with brp.close(brp.id).  Otherwise, I would expect that the session gets hung up afterwards.<br />
<br />

<br />
probably you can use this DLL tcomdll0010 ( report function in ERPLN , not sure abt baan iv) if it works then its well and good <br />
<br />
the other option for rprt_*  is... by attaching <br />
<br />
1 report as 1st group<br />
2nd report as 2nd group<br />
3rd as 3rd group.<br />
<br />
and  then setting reportgrp as per your logic  ,</div></div><hr />
