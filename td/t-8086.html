<br />
I am new to Baan and going through some in house training on Baan Tools. The problem that I am facing right now is related to Parallel Menus in Baan IV. <br />
<br />
I am working on a BaaIVc4 instance on an NT System and I am trying to create three parallel menus (Inquiries, Maintenance, Reports). I think I have followed the correct procedure by creating three different menus with same number but different sequence number.  I also created the three labels in each of these form and placed them at the bottom line, as suggested. But after creating dumps and everything, when I access the menu from the menu browser, I don't see my parallel menus at all and all my sessions are under the same menu.<br />
<br />
Can any body help me in this? If you need more info.. please let me know..<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

I would check to make sure that in each of the menus that you set yellow for color for that menu.  So in the Inquiries menu it would be the color yellow and the rest are white.  <br />
<br />
Also you may have to convert to run time on the menu.  If you do this do not forget to log out and in.<br />
