<br />
IÂ´ve a serious problem with a modified script:<br />
<br />
I modified an existing script with &quot;attr.input=false&quot; , zoom.to$...&quot; and &quot;executes&quot; to enable an automatic import of variables and<br />
closing of the session etc. In my own installation it worked, but on another installtion i get this error.( Compiling the script there are no errors)<br />
<br />
 I compared the scripts and everything is the same. There is only one difference:<br />
The system where it does not word is on Servicepack 11, I developed on Servicepack 8.<br />
<br />
I took my modifications from the old script (SP8) into the new script (SP11). At the beginning there where errors, because of 2 modified dll`s (too many arguments) , but thats OK now.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I noticed that you mentioned the use of execute().  Is it possible that whatever Baan form command you are executing is in turn calling other sections that might lead to recursive function calls?  For example, calling a refresh could launch a before.display which could call a function.  Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Why this would change from SP8 to SP11 is odd.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
