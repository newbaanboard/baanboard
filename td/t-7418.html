<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsrini</div><div class="date">30th October 2002, 03:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to use Baan ODM to attach external documents to Baan Objects (Sales Orders, Service Orders, etc).<br />
<br />
We are in Baan 5.0b and would like to use just the &quot;paper clip&quot; functionality and not the Version Control and other Document Management features to ODM.<br />
<br />
The question is:<br />
<br />
&quot;What is the simplest way I can link an external document to a Baan Object?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meaning, is there is a 3-click approch where I mark my record, click on the paper clip, the file browser comes up, I select the document I wish to link and I am done !!! What ever rest is there to happen, happens internally and the user is not bothered with all those details...<br />
<br />
Any help would be great help.<br />
<br />

I am facing the same problem that you are.  We want the ability to very quickly (1-2 clicks maximum) go from the record in Baan to the images.  The only way to do this currently is via source code modification or via application function server technology (stpapi); however, note that it is NOT possible at this time to invoke the paper clip via application function server.  Baan is addressing this issue in their Gemini release and it is my understanding that in BaanERP 5.0b and 5.0c this will not be possible.  Our work-around solution involves a combination of application function server technology and source code modifications.  Please contact me if you are interested in further discussing.<br />
