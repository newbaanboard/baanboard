I have to change a Report (cppat121011000) without a main table out of the enterprise planing module. There I should insert additional fields. But where can I find the actual available fields?<br />
In the XML-File to the form mask I find the Program script = ocppat1210 but I can't find it in the Tools\Application Development\Program Scripts / Libraries. And if I would find it I can do nothing (view or edit).<br />
<br />
So where do they get the fields rprt.messages or other fields rprt.*.<br />
What is rprt and where can I get the real selection from the tables?<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

<br />
analyse report input fields and layout sections.<br />
<br />
In reportscript you're able to add other tables in declaration section.<br />
This tables and tablefields are usable with selects of your own logic.<br />
<br />
Before you're able to modify, copy the report to your own VRC.<br />
<br />
You can't change the standard !<br />

<br />
thanks for your fast reply. <br />
I would do like you described but in advance it would be helpful to know more about the filled item fields. Cause in the Change I've planned I have to select other values with help of the fields in that Report. For that I should know where these values comes from.<br />

<br />
You can log a ticket with Infor to gain knowledge on the working of any standard report. If you have any functional guys around, they can help you out.<br />
<br />
If you are aware of the report being printed with the session, you can check the input fields of that report and know from where the fields are getting printed. As for a standard script, you cannot view it unless you have licenses to do that.<br />
<br />
Other way is to take a bshell trace or use profiler for the mentioned session.</div></div><hr />
