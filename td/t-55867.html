<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaaNovva</div><div class="date">14th May 2009, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I copied a session from tipcs2451m000 to tipcf9472m000(new session). There is no source code, this is just for vanilla customization. After compiling session, form(form dump) and script and on running session, I get &quot;unknown formfields&quot; for all form fields in the form and session does not run further.<br />
I tried create/convert runtime for session, form before and after making some changes to form but no difference.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this is a familier problem, at the earliest possible.<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th May 2009, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the new session using the original script from tipcs2451m000?  Make sure the correct script is attached to the session.  If you copied the script from tipcs2451 to tipcf9472 then make sure that the script is actually there - go edit tipcf9472.  It almost looks like you don't own source - when I copy a standard program script I get an empty source script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaaNovva</div><div class="date">15th May 2009, 08:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx a lot for the response. Yes, Mark. I dont own source. Since no source file, I cannot edit. So when I copied from tipcs2451m000, the object gets copied to tipcs9472. But this object has all the form field declarations, right? Then why unknown form field? I dropped the form and recopied but no use. Is this anything to do with change in module(from pcs to pcf) under 'no source code' situation? Or is any patch or solution due from Infor? Because this is an entirely new baan development setup done just few hours back and this is the very first customisation. Please let me know what could be missing.<br />
Appreciate your suggessions and from the forum too.<br />
<br />
Thanx again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaaNovva</div><div class="date">15th May 2009, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I thought no source file, compiling gets ignored. But actually, an empty source is compiled(as hinted by Mark, thanx!). This answers missing form field declarations. Until I post result, I am open to suggessions.</div></div><hr />

if it's attached the same script, you have to declare the all form fields  at your script and change what you wished.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaaNovva</div><div class="date">15th May 2009, 20:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem solved by inheriting source script object. This is done in vanilla customisation as I recollect after over 5 yrs. Do not copy script. In new session, just assign source script which inherits all functionality to new session. Thanks to Mark_h for giving me the hint. Thanks to everyone here for the welcoming contributions.</div></div><hr />
