<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I have written in my report script the following:<br />
 <br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
select tiitm001.*<br />
from tiitm001, tdsls045<br />
where tiitm001.item = :tdsls045.item<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
if tiitm001.hatc = &quot; &quot;<br />
and tiitm001.item = tdsls045.item then <br />
     message(&quot;Warining HS code not found for %s&quot;,tdsls045.item)<br />
endif <br />
exit()<br />
<br />
<br />
What happens is that there are 2 items with no HS codes, the message displays one item then exits. How can I display all items then exit, without printing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbclark79</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of recommendations for your script:<br />
<br />
1.  You have &quot;tdsls045&quot; in your FROM clause but not in your WHERE clause.  This may be confusing to the database driver.<br />
<br />
2.  Put the block of code containing your message in the SELECTDO section of your script (after SELECTDO and before ENDSELECT).  This section of code will execute for every record selected in the SELECT statement.<br />
<br />
3.  Avoid using &quot;exit()&quot; in scripts.  It is best to program the code such that it naturally completes execution of the script and empties the stack gracefully.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

I need the report not to send if any item is missing the hs code.<br />
<br />
Basically display the items that have no hs code, then exit instead of print.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you can get away with not printing anything unless you put your code there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th January 2003, 06:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I would mention that you could have used the after.receive.data event in the script - see this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7020&amp;highlight=Report). You could have read through the records and if that field was empty then you could have exited the report.  BUT the best solution is to change the session script - a lot easier and cleaner.<br />

That should take care of it - BUT be aware that if the rprt_send has executed this may leave a report hanging for the user.  If this is the case then check your data before opening the report or sending anything to the report.<br />

PS: Noticed that code gets prettied up... but only after a while.  Is the moderator doing this for us?  I tried adding the same strings around my code here.... but doesn't seem to work in the preview reply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th January 2003, 00:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes the moderator does edit the post and put in the code tags.  If you can edit your post then you can see where I put in code=baan and /code tags - do not forget these are enclosed in []'s. So you can do this your self sometimes I just like to cleanup the code. :)<br />
