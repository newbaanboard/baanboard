<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd April 2007, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Basic steps - I recommend doing this after hours, but that is your decision.<br />
(1) Use maintain tables ttadv4120m000 to modify the table and insert your new field.  You will need to pick the domain.  Convert to runtime - no need to worry about informix.  This will add the field to the table -and you can enter a label description.  Log out and log back into baan to activate the new data dictionary.<br />
<br />
(2) Use maintain sessions ttadv2100m000, goto form 2.  Click maintain form.  Insert your new label and table field.  I am assuming the session that will be modified is Maintain session with main table.  Do not forget that when adding a field to a form to maintain the field order. Under form/field order.<br />
<br />
(3) Assuming you have source code you know go to the other session.  First modify the form to include the new display field. Inside the script for this session you add a select for the new field - I assumed there was not any references between this session and the table used in (1) above.  Pick one of the key fields on this session and use the after.display section to add the select to retrieve the new value.  Without knowing the tables this will work.<br />
<br />
Since you are doing this in production I recommend that this be done after hours so you do not impact users.  The above steps sound easy, but it may take a while. I recommend creating a development environment - you do not have to have separate boxes.  All you need is a VRC derived from your production environment.  Then you can develop there and then when it is ready, promote it to production.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you please teach me how to derive VRC from my production environment? <br />
<br />
When i access sessions like ttadv4120m000 and ttadv2100m000, i keep on getting this message: 'current package VRC unknown'. how should i get access to this session?<br />
<br />
Thank you!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Your going to need to set your user-id up as a developer.  Under tools/application development/developers data you will find several sessions that need to be run to give you developers access.  I do not have access to most of these sessions so I recommend reading the help on them.<br />
<br />
As for how to derive a VRC that question is best asked in the administration forum.  But before doing that I would contact the support center to get instructions or a document on how to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a reminder - do this at your own risk in production.  Again contact baan for directions on setting up the VRC.  And make sure you have backups before making table changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaybuffer88</div><div class="date">4th April 2007, 08:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark. For safety consideration, i would wait until our BAAN server migration complete then only i explore those things that you have taught me in our new test environment.<br />
<br />
Thanks again !!!!</div></div><hr />
