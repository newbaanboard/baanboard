<br />
there are a lot threads discussing ftp-scripting. For us here, it works fine so far. What I dislike is, that I have to put my password somewhere on the system, for ftp-login.<br />
<br />
Is there an easy way to use an encrypted password ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th January 2007, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering - couldn't you have your admins create an ftp login(only ftp can use it) and then use that login/password?  Or you can look at using trusted logins between the servers - at least way back when I did some playing in UNIX that is how we did it.  I believe this let me remote copy, ftp and remote login in on the server with out a password.  Been a long time since I looked at this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
please be aware, that with ftp the password is transfered as clear ascii over the network. Maybe better to use ssh.<br />

<br />
thanks for the advice. I think at the moment &quot;normal&quot; ftp should be OK, because we are talking about an &quot;intranet&quot;. I'm also not free to choose the protokoll. But maybe it is a good idea for future. <br />
At the moment I find it more anoying, that everybody with access to the servers, can see the passwords. <br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<br />
no there is no special login for ftp. Hope I understand you write. As I already wrote to Kozure, it's not that critcal, because we are on seomkind of &quot;intranet&quot; (I hope). At the moment everybody is satiesfied with the solution we have. I just thougt... perhaps there ist an easy way to entcrypt.....<br />
<br />
Anywas I keep your proposal in mind!!<br />

I know it will not stop a root user, but at least everybody else can only execute the ftp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
good idea. But before I have check if a job, only with execute permissions, can run the script. <br />
I think I never tried to run a script with only execute permissions. Most the times read permissions are included ;-)</div></div><hr />
