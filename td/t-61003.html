<br />
I had to make a compex report, so I needed to make a temporary table where I put all the data.<br />
Program works correctly if only one user uses session, but there are confict if several users need to run some report.<br />
I tried to uses appl.lock, and if works correctly.<br />
Furthermore, I needed addiotional reports, so I made a new session, and I wanted to use the same temporay table.<br />
Does anybody know how to use table lock in code?<br />
<br />
Thank you for the help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use function db.lock.table (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_db_operations_db_lock_table) to lock the table. I have never used this function.<br />
<br />
According to me, using application lock would be a more preferable in this case. <br />
<br />
May be I would suggest you to set the application lock for the temporary table in both the sessions as soon as you start processing &amp; release it when you finish your processing.<br />
<br />
Or else you can even add two fields in it, 1st = session ID &amp; 2nd = user ID.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th August 2011, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">When I use a temporary table I use to include key fields to make the records unique - so not only can multiple users run the report, but the same user can run it multiple times.  I used to include something like userid and process id as part of the key. Then you just need to make sure the records get cleaned up.  I don't think I do this any where at this time - I know I have some temp tables, but not for users any more.<br />
<br />
I have used appl.lock to make a session single user at a time.  I just set a lock and do not remove it until the user exits.  I don't think this is what you are looking for in this case. Yes - you can lock individual records or group of records, but you still need a key on the temp table that allows others to work or run the session - based off your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">17th August 2011, 06:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Ditto what Mark said, but I also add a date field to the record.  The standard exit function for the session(s) using this table removes records created by the current user (by unique key including user &amp; timestamp) and any records more than a week old by any user.  This ensures that old records from an abnormal exit don't stay around too long.<br />
<br />
If there aren't a lot of fields involved, you might want to look into using dynamic arrays and the QSS functions.  I normally use dynamic arrays when reporting or calculating, temporary tables when the outcome is presented in an inquiry form.</div></div><hr />

I already tried to do it the wayyou suggest, and it goes fine in most cases, but sometimes program does not unlock correctly, so I have to remove appl.lock manually. That's why I thought it might be better to use table lock, but I have never seen anything similar in any code.<br />
