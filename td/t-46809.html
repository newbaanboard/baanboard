I am working with BaaN IV b2.  <br />
  <br />
I am doing a query on tfgld106, but There isn't index that work for me. I was looking for in BaanBoard Threads and I found Index hint. I have tried on Baan V and this works well, but on Baan IV b2 I don't get that works well for me.  <br />
  <br />

order by table._index#<br />
will generate the hint at the DB level.<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Ok, but the problem is that I don't have an index that I can use. Then in the original post I said that I looked for in the BaanBoard Thread and I found the index hint topic.<br />
<br />
I want to ask for an field and it isn't in any index.<br />
<br />
Does the hint can use to improve the yield in this???<br />
<br />
this is correct???</div></div><hr />

so if there is no index on the fields that you are using to narrow down your query then no amount of hints will help you.<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
That is to say the only thing that can help me is create a new index.<br />
<br />
Is there  some other way to make it without I have to create a new index?<br />
<br />
