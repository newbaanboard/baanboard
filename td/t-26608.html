<br />
In baan 4, i have been using this session all the time.<br />
If i want to export one session with all the reports, forms and scripts, I just enter the session name into this session. It ONLY export components for this specified session.<br />
<br />
But when i tried to do the same in LN, I see in dump.l that many other sessions and objects are also exported as listed in dump.l<br />
<br />
Why do these extra objects/components from other sessions also get exported. Is it a bug in LN?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

Note<br />
This session is meant for internal use only. It is not intended for the distribution of software to customers. Software deliveries to customers should be done in the form of a patch or, even better, a PMC (Product and Maintenance Control) solution. Refer to Patch Codes (ttiex4500m000) and Procedures for the distributor of solutions for more information.<br />
To export components:<br />
Enter the settings for the export process in the Environment tab, e.g. the VRC from which components must be exported, the language code of the components to be exported and the directory on the SSA ERP Server where the dump files will be stored. Specify whether the export is based on Sessions. If so, you must specify a session range. Refer to the online help of the fields on this tab for more details.<br />
Only if the export is notbased on Sessions: select the components you want to export in the Components 1, and Components 2 tabs. Select which types of dictionary and software components must be exported, and specify a selection range for each selected type.<br />
Optionally: specify selection ranges for additional components, such as SQL Queries and Customization projects, in the Components 3 tab.<br />
Click Export to start the export process.<br />
<br />
Export based on Sessions If this check box is selected,, you can only specify a range of sessions to be delivered. The system will also deliver the dictionary data, needed by these sessions, such as forms, reports, table definitions, domains, messages etc. In this case it is possible that also software components of other packages will be delivered (unless &quot;Only components in package itself&quot; = Yes).<br />
If the check box is cleared, you can specify for each type of software component, a range to be delivered. So in this case it is e.g. possible to deliver forms, without sessions.<br />
IMPORTANT If &quot;Export based on sessions&quot; = yes, then it is possible that also software components of other packages will be delivered. The flag &quot;Update&quot; = Yes is not applicable for these other packages, which means that the software components of previous VRCs will always be delivered (Update = No). <br />
It also depends on the setting you are using. This option can make a big difference -<br />
Compared with VRC If this check box is selected,, you must specify a package VRC in the next field. Only changed components, in comparison with that VRC, are exported. This is useful, e.g. when you want to deliver customizations, that are developed in a separate VRC, to a customer.<br />
If you clear this check box, components from the underlying VRCs (i.e. the VRCs that are in the derivation path of the VRC to be exported), are also exported.<br />
Example<br />
You want to export components from the tcB61O_a_cus1 package VRC. This VRC is derived from tcB61U_a_stnd and tcB61U_a_stnd is derived from tcB61_a. Suppose the following:<br />
the Compared with VRC check box is selected and tcB61U_a_stnd is specified as &quot;Compared with VRC&quot;. Only the changes in tcB61O_a_cus1, in comparison with tcB61U_a_stnd, are delivered. No software components are exported from tcB61U_a_stnd and tcB61_a.<br />
the Compared with VRC check box is cleared. Software components of tcB61U_a_stnd and tcB61_a are also delivered, if they are not present in tcB61O_a_cus1.</div></div><hr />

Through ttiex4100/ttiex4110 can we export sessions with reports,forms and script ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, never export based on sessions, very unpredictable.<br />
