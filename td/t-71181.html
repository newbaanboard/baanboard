<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">27th June 2018, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone.<br />
<br />
I know the topic PDF conversion was discussed a lot.<br />
I already searched the forum for a solution but couldn't find one.<br />
<br />
Here is my problem:<br />
<br />
I took the idea (amongst others I think Vamsi was the most markable) of an own conversion script instead of ttstpconv to generate PDF files. It works really fine if you do it this way:<br />
ttstpconv --&gt; PS file --&gt; ghostscript --&gt; PDF file<br />
or <br />
some TXT file --&gt; ttstpconv --&gt; PS file --&gt; ghostscript --&gt; PDF file<br />
<br />
BUT!<br />
<br />
We have some User Fonts in some report layouts.<br />
The reports for customers and suppliers look .... special.<br />
Like bigger font for &quot;Purchase Order&quot; or other things to make the layout and look and feel of the business reports nicer.<br />
Additionaly it could happen that a report layout has eg. UserFont5 but a field within the layout could have UserFont3.<br />
When we print this to a printer the report looks fine, but as soon as we use ttstpconv to TXT, RTF or PS the report looks horrible. So converting to a PDF always needs a special report with NO UserFonts.<br />
That's to know the background...<br />
<br />
Now I thought if I make PDF files I want it <br />
1. to look like the ones we print out<br />
2. get rid of extra reports especially for the PDF conversion<br />
Sounds good so far.<br />
<br />
So I found a tool called &quot;gpcl6&quot; which is a Ghost PCL to PDF converter.<br />
I used that in my baan conversion script and at a first glance it looked good.<br />
The PDFs really look nearly identical to the print outs.<br />
Now I have a conversion like this:<br />
PCL --&gt; gpcl6 --&gt; PDF<br />
<br />
Besides the problem that you cannot copy and paste the text of this PDFs I realised another big problem: We need german umlauts!<br />
But in the files some umlauts are written and others are &quot;hacked&quot; with other letters or cryptic signs.<br />
Further analysis showed that the umlauts are correct in layouts with UserFonts.<br />
And on the other hand umlauts are not correct in layouts without UserFonts. In this layouts Baan uses just Small/Middle/Large for a font height and width definition. But I read somewhere that in this case an ANSI-font is used with the lack of german umlauts! :(<br />
<br />
Has someone already had this problem and solved it? :confused:<br />
I want to avoid to edit all layouts of all documents that could possibly be printed via PDF printer and change all this fonts to a UserFont and test it on some devices afterwards to see how it looks!<br />
Is there a possibility to just add a standard font WITH umlauts?<br />
<br />
How can I get rid of this problem?<br />
Please advice...<br />
<br />
P.S.: When it's all done without errors I post my script in &quot; Code &amp; Utilities&quot; forum.<br />
<br />

In 4v4 we have print driver files out that there were you could possible go play and change what small/middle/large do.  Basically an escape sequence I could play with to change fonts on.  I only played with ghostscript once but was told we could not use it.  That was years and years ago so not really sure how it works anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using HiDox should solve the Problem.<br />
<br />
Maybe try another tool : pcl2pdf<br />
<br />
https://www.componentsource.com/product/pcl2pdf-unix/prices<br />
<br />
HiDox is full integrated in BIV , LN<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">11th July 2018, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your answers. Finally the answer was so easy as always...<br />
<br />
You just have to specify a font in the driver file in $BSE/lib/printinf/&lt;letter&gt;/&lt;driverfile&gt; .<br />
In our driver file there was no specific font for the three print sizes large, middle and small. So I specified a font:<br />
<br />
OLD: small=\E(s0p16.67h8.5v0T\E&amp;k7.0H,<br />
NEW: small=\E(12U\E(s0p16.67h8.5v4099T\E&amp;k7.0H,<br />
<br />
For now all the details and stuff that have a small font in its report layout defined are printed in Courier. Perhaps I change it sometimes...<br />
<br />
But the main problem, that no special font is defined and gpcl takes an ansi font without Umlauts, is solved. Now I have Courier in those layouts and gpcl takes Courier also. WITH Umlauts!<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the only left disadvantage of pcl2pdf is that the text is not copieable and not searchable! :(</div></div><hr />

Are you saying you cannot search the pdf file it creates?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">11th July 2018, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Its a known issue of gpcl6. Cause pcl was never intended to create a text or pdf file but just to simply print files on a printer. If you want to search a string in this pdf files, than it wont find it. Also you cannot copy text. Tough in my case it's broken.<br />
<br />
There might be  solution which I don't know yet.<br />
For example I found this tool which says it produces searchable pdfs from pcl:<br />
http://www.visual.co.uk/pcl2pdf.html<br />
<br />
If anyone has a solution for this in linux. And pls do NOT suggest any tool to buy ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th July 2018, 20:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not know that about ghostscript.  Before converting could you use another type format besides PCL?  Not sure what formatting differences there might be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">13th July 2018, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried considering iText library? I have designed several reports with foreign languages using simple Java programs. Just another option. Never tried gpcl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">17th July 2018, 08:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I know. iText is the state of the art converter library. Perhaps I try it out. Infor and many others ( FreePDF  I think ) use it too ;) <br />
Look in $BSE/java<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help. I'll find a solution now...</div></div><hr />
