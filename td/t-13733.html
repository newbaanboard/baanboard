<br />
I'm confused. I want to add a conditional (after.field) layout to an existing report: cisli22001000 [print invoices]. I noticed that the report script AND the layout (because the condition is defined in the expression of the layout) are some times called and some times not...!! In other words, if I will debug the report (which is being called for each invoice printed), then for some invoices I will get the debugger popping up, and for some (the majority :( ) not...!! The result is that on some invoices I get my extra layout, and on the majority I don't!!<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me out please???<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />

Could it be that some invoices are printed in another language?<br />
<br />
It is a fact that your reportscript section is not executed as well is your after.layout section if the layout expression outcome is false.<br />

Han, I simply overlooked the other languages. Made my adjustments in one language (system language) but didn't think of bothering for the other three... <br />

Sorry, and thanks for the response... <br />
