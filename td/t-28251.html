I had developed one report session for Role &amp; Responsibility matrix. so for Roles I was picking up description of corresponding roles from tgbrg810 table which was maintained in English Language. It was working fine :) till user maintained those description in chinese language, now when i print the report it prints the junk :( values at the place of description. But the Standard Baan Role Session tgbrg8110m000 based on the same table tgbrg810 gives the description in English :confused: .<br />
Can any one help in this regard, either converting the Chinese description in English or by what way the standard session tgbrg8110m000 is showing english description although description is maintained in Chinese.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

I have checked the locale settings and tried to change the device data for <br />
notepad device &amp; tried various combinations but still it is taking junk characters from whatever locale character set we choose for the device for ex. previous locale character set was Simplified Chinese - I changed it to western europe 8 bit (ISO-8859-1) &amp; also tried Eastern Europe (ISO88592), but still it is not working :( . Thanks again.<br />
all suggestions are welcome.<br />
