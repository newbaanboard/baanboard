<br />
We noticed that the field was added to the table when we were viewing from ttaad4100 but from i-series the field did not exist.<br />
<br />
Now when we try to start the session we get the  fatal error message 401, A configuration file is corrupted.<br />
<br />
Any idea of how to correct it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you can check in bse/dict whether the table defination is actully getting updated.<br />

In bse/dict we see that the new field does not exist although at the ttaad4100 is there.Any idea of what is happening?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand what you want to say with the term 'but from i-series the field did not exist'.<br />
But in any way to me it seems that you mix up two different package combinations.<br />
If you can see the field in the file $BSE/dict/ddPACKAGECOMBINATION/dtfgld/dtfgldxxx then you will see the field with ttaad4100 IF (!!) you are in a company attached to PACKAGECOMBINATION.<br />

I don't know about the detailed behaviour of BAAN/SSA on AS400 (ref your profile). But can there be something left in shm. Is there some &quot;resetting&quot; on the iseries connection  (a high level statement, I don't know much about iseries, pls don't ask me how to do it) thet could be fruitful from this aspect. And/or &quot;resetting&quot; of the baan dict as such.</div></div><hr />
