I have a table I created that stores seconds.  Is there a function that converts these seconds back to time?  The only function I have seen that deals with time is time.num() which would give me what I already have.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Even third party report writers require a lot of messing about to get it to work, as anyone trying to write a time based report in Safari will probably remember with great pain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I faced this kind of problem recently and made a function which helped me to do that.<br />
<br />
I dont  know your purpose, but my purpose was for the time stamping and logging, where I had the difference time between the start and end timers in UTC and I got the diff time in seconds and I needed to convert those seconds, into hours, minutes and seconds.<br />
<br />
I think we might extend the functionality for days, months and years too. <br />
<br />
Let me know if thats the kind of function you are looking for.</div></div><hr />

   This is a function, it does not have any object.<br />
   To use these functions, you have include this in your script like...<br />
#include &quot;itfgld0032&quot;<br />
<br />
The functions are...<br />
<br />
1. function long itfgld0032.num.to.time(domain tctime trans.time)<br />
    This converts seconds to time in hhmmss<br />
2. function domain tctime itfgld0032.time.to.num(long trans.time)<br />
    THis converts time to seconds<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably you have already solved your problem converting time to num and vice-versa. But, I would like to offer to you a dll designed by myself. I developed some functions to work with &quot;time&quot; in Baan. With my functions you can convert any variable with seconds to selectable output format like &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;hh:mm&quot; or just &quot;hh&quot;, and more, there are functions to make calculates with time. Some examples:<br />
<br />
long hold.time<br />
string time.1(08)<br />
string time.2(08)<br />
string result(08)<br />
<br />
hold.time = time.num()<br />
time.1 = convert.to.time(hold.time, 1) <br />
   |# Format 1 returns a &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; string<br />
   |# time.1 may contain &quot;08:34:13&quot; for example<br />
   |# You can also do the following:<br />
<br />
result = calculate.time(time.1, time.2, &quot;+&quot;, 2)<br />
   |# the last &quot;2&quot; identifies the input/output format<br />
   |# If time.1 = &quot;10:00&quot; and time.2 = &quot;25:00&quot;<br />
   |# result will contain &quot;35:00&quot;, itÂ´s useful for package like<br />
   |# ts, ps, ti, etc.<br />
   |# or just use it to do a simple subtraction to get how many<br />
   |# hours a task took to be made:<br />
<br />
result = calculate.time(time.1, time.2, &quot;-&quot;, 2)<br />
   |# where, for example, time.1 = &quot;09:00&quot; and time.2 = &quot;07:00&quot;<br />
   |# result would contains &quot;02:00&quot;<br />
   |# now, you can return the string to long like that:<br />
<br />
hold.time = convert.to.long(result)<br />
   |# now result would contains the long number 7200 that is<br />
   |# equal to &quot;02:00&quot;<br />
<br />
So, these were just some functions to manipulate time that I developed, there are some others in the dll, if you need functions like these ones, ask me for my dll and I will send you as soon as possible for free ok</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the offer of sharing your dll. We have a Code &amp; Utilities (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=33) forum for this purpose. Would look forward to your posting the dll in that forum.</div></div><hr />

Can somebody tell me the exact path at board from where i can download the dll, i tried searching, but could not find it.<br />

I do not see where they posted a formal thread in the code and utilities forum, but you should be able to use the code on the first thread.</div></div><hr />
