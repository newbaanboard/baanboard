<br />
I have wrote a session that has a lot of code to go through (in worktop it works for 30 seconds or so). When I run it from webtop, webtop hangs for around 10 seconds (The cursor is changed to a busy mode and I cannot start any other session or do anything in webtop) and then it returns normal (and the session gives the correct results). However, I have discovered, that while the client side looked busy, the server side was still active! (for example if I was writing a file on the server it was updated during these 10 seconds that the client side was stuck)<br />
<br />
I have playing a lot with my code, and discovered even if my code was only suspend(15000), webtop will hang! I even tried to run the code from another wrapper session, that should not wait (modeless) for this code, with different functions (start.session, activate), but webtop will also hang!<br />
<br />
My question is: Why!? Why doesn't webtop just run the session, let it work in the background and allow me to continue working on other stuff. Is there a workaround? lets assume my code is simply:<br />
<br />
function main()<br />
{<br />
   suspend(15000)<br />
   message(&quot;hi&quot;)<br />
}<br />
Any tips?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">25th September 2013, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Look like the session has no gui. This is a known issue with webtop. Try this standard 3GL function:<br />
<br />
<br />
Syntax:<br />
function void tc.ignore.process  (boolean flag [, long processno])<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
This function indicates if the WebTop should ignore this session (process). By default, the WebTop does not ignore a session. Therefore this function should only be called from a 3GL session which does not present a User Interface. When this function is not called from such 3GL session, the WebTop will seriously delay when such a 3GL Session is started. <br />
<br />
<br />
Arguments<br />
boolean flag true when the WebTop must ignore this session, otherwise false.<br />
 <br />
[long processno]  The process number of the session to which this function applies. When omitted this function is applied to the current session <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Context<br />
This function is implemented in the 4GL Engine and can be used in all script types.</div></div><hr />
