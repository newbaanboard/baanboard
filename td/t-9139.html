<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigJohn</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
   I have been reading up on Baan V. I had couple of questions.<br />
   I don't have access to Baan V to check them out.<br />
   Hence was wondering if you guys/gals can help me out.<br />
<br />
1. In Baan V, you can bookmark records and add it to the task list.<br />
   When would I want to use this? <br />
<br />
2. WebTop - What are the disadvantages of using WebTop vs a regular client?<br />
   Does WebTop provide anything other than access to Baan via Internet Explorer?<br />
<br />
3. In Baan V, how are the reports (Seagate Info) distributed? <br />
<br />
4. In Baan V, is it possible to change the color of the Title Bar? Or is it just the <br />
   verbage? <br />
<br />
5. In Baan V, we can change the alignment of a field on the form at runtime.<br />
   When would I want to use this?<br />
<br />
6. Has the debugger been enhanced (wrt to Baan IV)?<br />
<br />
7. Any info on Query Processor will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
8. Has the exchange module been enhanced (wrt to Baan IV)?<br />
<br />
9. Advantages of using Dynamic Forms?<br />
<br />
   Thanks in advance.<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, quite a handful. I can only shed a little light on some of your questions<br />
<br />
5. You can change the width of the column in real time in BaanERP. This is useful, for example, when you want to reduce the width of the item column (47 digits usually) on the fly, because it is wasting too much display real estate, especially since your items are using only 6 digits<br />
<br />
8. On the surface, Exchange doesn't change much. One thing I noticed is the ability to import using Data Access Layer (DAL) (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_dal_overview)<br />
<br />
9. With dynamic forms, you don't have to manually lay the fields out on the form. You can also maintain multiple forms of the same session in one dynamic form. To change the &quot;view&quot; of the form, simply play around with the index usage of the session. To manage the content of each form (which is called group in dynamic form setting), just mention which fields you want and in what sequence, group the fields in the form if you want, adjust the property of each field a bit (input/display, zoom, etc.), and the form is done.<br />

<br />
The DAL is supported only from Baan 5 c onwards.<br />
<br />
As to the Debugger : I found no major differences between Baan IV Debugger and V debugger.<br />
