<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bartman</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
there's a report in manufacturing after which we have to fill-out and print an ms-word document with data like production-order, description of work-steps,... This document is processed and signed by our production-workers.<br />
The document has variable data like production-order,... and data that does not change like the description of work-steps.<br />
I want that document to be filled out and printed with the report.<br />
I tought about using a (macro)-overlay but we just have one font for printing our company logo and i don't want to use another one for that.<br />
Is there a way rather then the overlay...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 13:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We modified print production order to give us what we need.  Of course we did not need a logo and we use report operations complete as our sign off as you mentioned.  For reports with logos we use the overlay method that ~vamsi mentioned in the code and utilities forum.  Is that what you are looking for an alternative for? Or are when you mention macro-overlay are you talking about a word macro?</div></div><hr />

yes I am looking for an alternative to ~vamsi's method. His method works very fine! - but so you would loose one printer font for every overlay.<br />
I'm thinking if it's possible that the top of the page contains some report fields, and the rest of the page would be filled with pdf-data (I mean the non-changing data).<br />
Printing a PDF from a report should be no bigger problem but to print report fields and PDF-parts on one and the same page seems impossible, isn't it?<br />

<br />
I don't understand your question, but perhaps some ideas:<br />
<br />
This word document ist static? It has always the same text? (Rather strange that the 'work-steps' don't change) Or are there n different word documents and you choose the one fitting?<br />
In either case you could a) add this text(s) to the report or b) create (a) new report(s) which you call from the session.<br />
The static text can be entered as such in the layout and you are free to print all the fields used in the original report too.<br />
If you have different texts, you can choose which one to print by using the field 'output expression' in the report.<br />
Feel free to mail me if you have further questions:<br />

<br />
BTW: it's rather easy to work with different overlays, but I don't understand why you would want to use overlays in this context.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />
now I see your problem.<br />
Well, the overlay file has to be sent to the printer, so if you would convert your pdf-files to overlay files, you could take care (in the report script) that the correct one is used.<br />
How to use pdf-date as report detail(-footer, or whatever) .... no idea.<br />

<br />
That is all I see you using is one overlay for the logo.  The rest of the data would be built into the report itself.  So report layout 1 would have the logo field used by the overlay and then the rest of the layouts would have the variable fields or the hardcoded text.  So I must be missing something.  This is how we do purchase orders.  One overlay and then a bunch of other layouts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bartman</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey norwim,<br />
of course it would be the easiest way to build of the word-document in the report :) But the doc has a defined layout - so it is still not possible.<br />
So the easiest way for me would be a page containing 1/3 report-fiels and the rest filled with pdf-data. It's only one pdf-file I'm talking about - so I wouldn't have the problem to select the &quot;correct&quot; one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bartman</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">This report still does not use the company logo. <br />
Now we have a report which prints data from a production order like &quot;work-steps&quot; (or &quot;processes&quot;, that are required to build someting) with a barcode. People working on this production order scan the barcode - so time-information will be gathered.<br />
And for any production order we have to fillout and print that word-document on which is described how to do something. Every &quot;work-step&quot; on that document has to be signed by the person proccessing the step.<br />
<br />
The layout of this word-file is still fixed. So i can't rebuild it in the report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
since you don't use the company logo on the report, why don't you indeed convert the fixed pdf or word document into an overlay file and use the font usually reserved for the logo-overlay?<br />
This would solve all your problems, deliver the desired layout and, best of all, can be done with minimum effort.<br />
<br />
