<br />
does anybody know if it is possible do a layout.again() of more than 1 layout?<br />
If yes, how?<br />
My problem is that maximum layout length is 23 lines, but my layout needs more than 23, so I have to split it in 2 layouts: detail.1 and detail.2. I need to repeat them several times, so I need a layout.again() functionality, but for 2 layouts.<br />
<br />
If layout.again() is not possible, do you know any other solution to my issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

I have done somthing similar of this way because I ned one after field of indeterminated length but very large ( about 100 lines )<br />
<br />
after.aeedm998.item.11:<br />
before.layout:<br />
        string.scan( proy.pcs(1,i1), &quot;%s|%f|%f&quot;,print.cprj, print.qrd1, print.qrd2 )<br />
after.layout:<br />
        i1 = i1 + 1<br />
        if not isspace(proy.pcs(1,i1) ) then<br />
                layout.again()<br />
        endif<br />
<br />
Suerte / good luck</div></div><hr />

Hi Steve, a version of your above code has been working fine for a year or so now.  However we have upgraded the dev box to SP27 with newer portingset (6.1c.11) and now the report won't compile saying:<br />
Unresolved reference to function r.s.detail.10 and rs.detail.11<br />
<br />
I've tried downgrading the repgen to the older version but this is not compatible with the rest of the portingset, complaining about shared memory issues.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

change<br />

to<br />
r.10.s.detail()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">6th May 2010, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Steve, thanks for the rapid response - that's definitely fixed it!  What are weird change to have made (and not documented)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th May 2010, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">On SP27 did they change something in the report compiler or what ever component to change the subroutine calls?<br />
<br />
Man - with all the problems I see people having it makes me dread going to SP27.  And maybe I should not call them problems, but changes.  I know I have code that calls report subroutines like this and I hate to have to think that I will have to search them all out to fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steveauckly</div><div class="date">6th May 2010, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We noticed this particular problem going to SP26.  We haven't installed SP27 yet.  And yes, this one seems like a problem more than an &quot;upgrade&quot;.  Why change a layout call like this?</div></div><hr />
