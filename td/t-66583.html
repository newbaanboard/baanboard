<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">26th June 2014, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to check and see if anyone know/aware of a third party Baan client for Baan IV? The issue we have is that most of our users are been migrated over to Windows 7 64-bit and the current BW client (75) that we have is not compatible with Windows 7 64-bit. We tried to install it with a workaround and it is unstable and most of times errors out with “Fatal error : object XXXX in process XXX inconsistency”.<br />
<br />
We currently don’t have Baan support and in order to get the latest BW client we have to get back on maintenance with Infor. Just wondering if anyone knew of a third party Baan client or any other workarounds for this issue.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any feedback,<br />
Thanks,<br />

Then have users use that.  I am not aware of a third party client.</div></div><hr />
