Through query extension, the number of actual occurrences differs based on the view part of the form.<br />
So the first record may have 1 occurrence, the next 15, the next 2, etc.<br />
<br />
Works great, but when I go from record 2 to record 1, (unused) occurrences 2-12 still display the values of record 2.<br />
<br />
What is the proper way to clear these unused occurrences?</div></div><hr />

I think there is something like refresh.all.mocc() - or is that a Baan V command.  I wish I could remember where I was having something leftover in the form like this, but not with query.extension, and I had to do execute to get it to rebuild the info on the form correctly.  I think I used execute(find.data) - I will try to look for this tomorrow, because I really can not remember what I did.<br />

Right.<br />
<br />
This form field is a table field?<br />
Yep.<br />
<br />
have you tried the typical refresh?  I think there is something like refresh.all.mocc() - or is that a Baan V command.<br />
It's refresh.all.occs() and it doesn't work. Neither does the regular refresh.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't think this was going to be such a hard question. I'm painfully reminded of the fact that in 10 years of Baan programming I have done precious little 4GL. <br />
<br />
In a twisted way it is comforting that the solution is not as trivial as I thought it would be ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are trying to accomplish something like the Sales Order Lines session, but those are actually 2 different sessions in Baan IV, and that type of screen layout was removed all together in V+.   It's not standard Baan 4GL, and if you try to do something not standard according to Baan, you will be fighting the 4GL engine.<br />
<br />
Should be possible though, with lots of experimenting - I see you are up for that :)  <br />
<br />
What type of form have you declared this as, and what fields are those on the form vs. on the main table...is there an Order Number / Tracking Number relationship in the main table?   I am thinking you would want a Type 3 form if that's possible with your table structure....?  <br />
<br />
If possible, post the code for the the queries and refreshes that you have running, and maybe background on the table relationships and session / form setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">16th March 2005, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I should add, since you are this far, maybe if you put in a call to reset all the values before you re-issue the queries.  something like<br />
<br />
<br />
do.all.occ(reset.values)<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
functions:<br />
function reset.values()<br />
{<br />
   form.field = &quot;&quot;<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably need this in several sections, as Klaas suggests, but in the 'before.choice' sub section.  Just be careful nothing gets saved as blanked over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">16th March 2005, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The case: Baan sales orders only have a single field to hold a tracking number. When shipping FedEx (and potentially other carriers), each box in an order has its own tracking number. Although there is one 'master' number, there is no way to recover shipping status of individual items from the FedEx website without knowing the individual tracking numbers.<br />
<br />
My mission: Create a table in Baan that holds all tracking numbers per customer order. Then create a session where the warehouse staff can scan the FedEx labels into the new table.<br />
<br />
Famous last words: I'll have that done tomorrow.<br />
<br />
I started out writing a synchronized session (like sales orders), but it didn't work right because I am really only using a single table and with the pointers bouncing all over the place it became impossible to keep the two sessions in sync.<br />
<br />
So plan B was this simple type 3 form (see screenshots above), with 1 master field for the order number, 1 input field for the scanned label, and 1 multi-occurence field for the tracking numbers per order.<br />
<br />
My form code currently looks like this:<br />

I think the do.all.occ() alternative is the way to go but I was thinking that there should be a more elegant solution since I'm staying well within the boundaries of 4GL (not?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">16th March 2005, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say, no, not standard 4GL, because you are writing the insert into the main table yourself, and trying to filter/mimic the Type 3 session with the query extensions.  Your main table for this session has Sales Order / Tracking Number as the key, right?  Standard would be to just have that sales order number at the top, then when they want to add a box, they just choose 'insert', and go to the multi occurance to insert.  If they are scanning, you can program the scanner to auto tab, so they immediatly go to the next field, ready for input of another tracking number.  When done they choose 'save'.   If you need to filter out what gets scanned with what you want to save...is that what I see there?  Do it in the after input section.<br />
<br />
If you have the key for your table to be Order / Tracking Number, Baan will take care of checking for duplicates as they enter.<br />
<br />
For the query extensions to work mid-code, you need the rebuild.query call, or otherwise you have just modified a string that has no affect on the underlying query.  Really, I see no need for your query extension, you are asking for all the records where the orno = the orno.  Let the Baan Type 3 Form handle this.  When you move to a new order number, it will automatically grab the tracking numbers from that order only (If orno is your view field, all of these are tccom979 fields, and you have a type 3 form...) You need to leverage the 4GL to do your work for you, instead of fighting it by writing your own inserts and data reads.<br />
<br />
If you table is just Order Number / Tracking mumber, with that as the primary key, try a standard generate session with a type 3 form and and see what else needs to be changed.<br />
<br />
Or try the do.all.occ, if that works :)</div></div><hr />

I followed Lisa's advice and auto-generated a similar session. Much to my surprise it did the exact same thing......after I changed the svia field to 'Display Only'.<br />
<br />
I always wondered what the difference was between 'Display' and 'Display only'. Now I know....Diplay Only messes up your form  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">16th March 2005, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I always wondered what the difference was between 'Display' and 'Display only'. Now I know....Diplay Only messes up your form<br />
<br />
We do not have the &quot;display only&quot; field type in DFE now, its called &quot;display on demand&quot; field type.<br />
<br />
Here is more info about it -<br />
<br />
Field Type:<br />
Indicates the form field type. <br />
The following options are available: <br />
Display: Normal display field, input not allowed. <br />
Input: Normal input field <br />
Display on Demand: Display is only possible on this form field if the Baan 4GL <br />
function display &lt;field name&gt; is used in the program script. <br />
<br />
Input on a form field is also dependent on the input expression. A form field <br />
can be a temporary display field if the attr.input is filled with the value <br />
false in the before input section of the field in your program script.<br />
  <br />
Which means that is you choose Display on Demand the value in the field is only displayed after the function display(&quot;&lt;fieldname&gt;&quot;) is called.<br />
<br />
Suppose we have package te with module tst and table tetst100.<br />
Create a details session tetsttesting with tetst100 as maintable and with <br />
script tetsttesting. In the DFE add all table fields. For field tetst100.dod of <br />
the select field type &quot;Display on Demand&quot;.<br />
In the UI script add the following:<br />
function extern dod()<br />
{<br />
 display(&quot;tetst100.dod&quot;)<br />
}<br />
<br />
Add a formcommand that runs function &quot;dod&quot;.<br />
If you run the session you will see that the field tetst100.dod doesn't display <br />
and value, until you execute the formcommand. If you navigate to another <br />
record, the field tetst100.dod will still display the old value until you <br />
execute the formcommand again. So the the field tetst100.dod is not refreshed <br />
by 4GL Engine, the programmer has to do this him self in the UI script.<br />
 <br />
Note that this feature is only rarely used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">16th March 2005, 23:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy Crypes - never use Display only :)<br />
<br />
The meaning is the same as the new description in LN  says 'Display on Demand', same thing it looks like, just a (MUCH!) better description.  Can't tell you how many people have thought.   Hmm.. Display Only, yes, that's what I want, only display.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th March 2005, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like refresh worked - good thread.  I finally chased down the sessions where I thought I had the problem - in one I used execute(first.set) like Klaas suggested and in another I did a execute(find.data).  In the one where I did the execute first.set I had a very ugly query I build to drive the session - I can not remember why query.extension did not work, but I had my reasons.  I will have to look at this more - the script was scary. :)<br />
<br />
In the second session I recall processing the records and it leaving something showing and a find move it to the next batch of records.  I also recall that when I deleted one record from the end it might leave something showing and the execute find seemed to clear this up.<br />
<br />
Glad to see you got it resolved - will have to keep this in mind.<br />
