I have customised a session type - single occ + main from a customised table which got 15 fields.  I have maintain field order in the form for all the form fields.<br />

When we insert first records, there is no problem in feild flow and this is as per form field order, for successive insert of further records say second record the cursor got jumped from 7th field to 12 field.  <br />
<br />

It is possible to control the field entry order in the script.<br />
<br />
If you have the script, check there or post for us to see.  If you do not have the script..is it a standard session?  Let us know the name and someone can check for field control in there for you.</div></div><hr />
