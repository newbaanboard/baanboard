Appreciate if anyone of you can help me.<br />
I'm a SSA ERP LN6.1 user.<br />
How to use the Input/Ref. Expression for table field other than main table?<br />
Description:<br />
Using DFE to edit Form for cprrp1110s000, I inserted a field (tdsls400.orno) below existing field cprrp110.peor. <br />
Why? Phase 1: To test whether the same Sales order number displayed by cprrp110.peor will also be displayed by the inserted tdsls400.orno. <br />
If Phase 1 is ok, then Phase 2 is to have Customer Order field from tdsls400 to be displayed but should be index 4 (for Customer Order)<br />
Alas but the Phase 1 is NOT OK.<br />
<br />
Refer my attached file:-<br />
Phase 1:<br />
I inserted a field, tdsls400.orno in the middle picture .I key-in cprrp110.peor for the field name, tdsls400.orno in the right picture.  In right diagram, why the REFERS_FROM did not displayed under Attributes? Is it thats why it not working?  <br />
(note:Ctrl+Shift+7 to get the Show XML tree)<br />
<br />
Phase 2 :<br />
How to have Customer Order field from tdsls400 to be displayed but should be index 4 (for Customer Order)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...<br />
Regards,<br />

If the ref expression evaluates to true, you are allowed to input this field.  If it is not of the main table, it will not be saved. (unless the program has added logic)<br />
<br />
You need to have a field in the main table reference the order table for this to work properly.  Place a 1 in the input/ref expression on the form.  This will be a display only field.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
But why some can use the Inp/Ref on a form to draw data from another table and display in on the screen.<br />
Refer (search keyword: Inp/Ref) to a thread dated 21 july  2004 by Mick Andrus on the title: Using Inp/Ref Expres to display fields from other table :-<br />
<br />
&quot; I have on two occasions, used the Inp/Ref function on a form to draw data from another table and display in on the screen. For instance, in the standard Baan production bill session, the component's description is not displayed. I've created references from the tibom010 table to the tcibd001 table to retrieve the component's item description from tcibd001 by declaring the reference in the Inp/Ref Expres setting. .......&quot;<br />
<br />
So, can the Inp/Ref be used to draw data from another table and display in on the screen?  And How to do it?<br />
<br />

It states that a reference has to be made to the primary index.  Since I am not familiar with LN I am not sure that is the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do those existing standard form able to have &quot;REFERS_FROM ..&quot;  appear under Attributes (refer to my earlier attached document)?  <br />
Is it automatic referenced or what do I put in the input/ref expression?<br />
How do I learn to do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th January 2006, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but I can not help.  I have no experience with LN.   Hopefully Lisa or someother LN expert will pick up on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th January 2006, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, the input field/ref expression rules have not changed in LN.  That is, the same as the 'refers to' clause rules.  You can only build the reference chain if there are references defined in Maintain Table Definitions / Field References.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you able to get the field from other table? Any solution for that?</div></div><hr />
