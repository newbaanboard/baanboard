a session.   We are using Baan IVc4 and the B40c.051 windows client.<br />
<br />
To return data from the zoomed to session, in some cases they<br />
can just &quot;Double Click&quot; and in others they must select the<br />
item to be returned (check appears) and then &quot;Save and exit&quot;.<br />
<br />
My users would prefer to just double click, but I cannot see<br />
why one works and one doesn't.   We have examined these sessions and both are subsessions, both have &quot;Auto accept&quot; selected on the form field, both are the same type of session, both have the same zoom type , etc.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain the difference in functionality ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Some are just list of items while other are single occurence sessions.  Usually for a list you can double-click, in the single occurence sessions that probably wouldn't work and you'd have to use the save/exit option.</div></div><hr />

Our zoom sessions that we are questioning the functionality of are all Lists. <br />
<br />
The session that we can not double click  from does not have a program script.  The one that does have a program script, Type 1/2/3 (With M.Table), we can double click from. <br />
<br />
Would having a script vs. none have anything to do with the<br />
functionality ?<br />

If you don't have the source, can you give us examples 1 each of which sessions work for you and which do not?<br />
<br />
Also, I'm running BW B40c.62 and have not updated in a while - .051 is probably very old.  You should update your bw.</div></div><hr />

Hi everyone.<br />
<br />
I also have this question for a long time and, because I've been developing some new sessions in the last few days, I decided to post this.<br />
<br />
So, if you have a Type2 zoom session you developed, how can you control if the session returns the value just by double-clicking a line or you if have to mark it and use the exit button?<br />
For simplicity, let's suppose all the sessions have source code (they do not use the standard code), even if the script is empty.<br />
<br />
In my case I have some that accept the double-click an some that don't. I could never discover a parameter or some code I could use to control this behavior.<br />
<br />
Any inputs?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
Fred</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th August 2008, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan IV , all forms have default ok , cancel , continue buttons . If developer ticks that , it becomes visible. When user double clicks, default button gets executed which in turn executes  end.program and through which a marked records' return value is returned by standard program to the calling program .<br />
<br />
All this is managed by zoom.to$ function, it's return value, it's zoom name   , standard program and zoom.from.on.entry / on.exit section code in zoomed session and finally value of exit.val$ in zoomed session .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmorais</div><div class="date">19th August 2008, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Hitesh, for the prompt answer.<br />
<br />
Just tried it and you're 100% right.<br />
You have to activate the ok button for example (you can even fill &quot;none&quot; in the default button).<br />
<br />
The only problem is that the form will have a button on the right.<br />
<br />
Details are everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
