<br />
Is it possible to create multiple worksheets/tabs (in one single excel file) output from normal Baan session? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Don't know.   For me it would be easy since we use excel macros to format the report.  I would just change it to create multiple sheets.  I am sure the ~vamsi code under the code and utlities forum could be modified to support multiple work sheets.  I do not know about tools like nasdaq.  I do not think you can just run a report and have it go to multiple worksheets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even the older versions of Excel have 256 columns. It would be hard to output that many columns from a Baan report - so I am assuming that tools like BaanXL (see my sig) are out. What is the use case you are trying to solve? Do you propose to write your own session to accomplish this task?<br />
<br />
Finally what version of Excel?</div></div><hr />

Hi Vamsi,<br />
<br />
I have a report session for which the output will be a excel file with multiple tabs format. Is that possible to do using direct baan session or we need to use any tools to achieve this?<br />

<br />
Please provide us a better understanding of what and how you are trying to accomplish for us to help.<br />
<br />
In this case - is it a Baan report that already exists. If so, what is its format. Are you trying to extract certain columns into a sheet, other columns into other sheets?<br />
<br />
Or are you writing a new session which is totally under your control.<br />
<br />
It is possible to skin this in multiple ways:<br />
Mark's solution. Use Excel and a macro to parse the output of Baan and place the columns into multiple sheets<br />
Use one of the new fangled XML formats that Excel supports and write to that directly from Baan. Assumes that you are creating output directly from Baan and not from a Baan Report. This is where the Excel version becomes important.<br />
There are other possible ways to create Excel workbooks.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
