<br />
Hope someone can assist me. See attached file 'screen1'. I changed one of the formfield.Afterwhich i did a 'generate formdump'.<br />
Later the screen was shown as in ' screen1'.   The 'continue' button is no longer there - replaced with 'to' , don't know why?<br />
<br />
I was later told i should be clicking on the 'dump' button (see screen2 )<br />
<br />
So i went to 'Maintain Form Buttons'(see screen3) and rekeyed back the details.<br />
The i clicked on 'dump'.<br />
<br />
But the display is still the same.<br />
What should i do?<br />
Pls advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />

<br />
What happens if you replace the Button, dump the form, and change back to the Continue-Button?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th December 2004, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">You might want to try create runtime data dictionary on both the form and the session.  I have problems before where things get out of sync and this seems to clean it up.  I have not had exactly the problem you are having.  And remember to log off and back on.  Not sure this will help, but something to try.<br />
<br />
Also since you changed only one of the formfields you can always try deleting the form, re-copy it to your test vrc, dump the form - then check it out.  Notice I did not say change it.  Once the dump works and the continue button displays correctly then you can try changing the form again.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.<br />

<br />
My tactic thusfar consists of plenty of fiddlefarting until the form submits to my will. If somebody can give a conclusive answer to this one it would be a blessing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply guys,<br />
<br />
As mark_h suggested, the first option did not work.<br />
I guess i've to try the second one now.<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
