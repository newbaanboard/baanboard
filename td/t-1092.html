<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanqry</div><div class="date">18th February 2002, 21:31</div></div><div class="posttext">We developed a Form type - 3 session for sales order entry that has only essential fields user(s) usually need. Item and quantity are multi-occ fields.<br />
<br />
Now the problem is - <br />
whenever user enters item code( say 20) - hits tab and immediately enters quantity ( say 25), what they see on screen is - Item code 220, quantity of 5. Essentially first numeral of qty got prefixed to item code. However on saving Item code becomes 20 and quantity of course remains at 5. So when they expect to see 25 qtys of Item - 20 what they get in the system is 5 of 20, totally erroneous order entries!!<br />
<br />
My initial suspicion was on the time taken during checks done on Item code. But the same situation persists even w/o any checks. <br />
<br />
Also, I noticed Baan reacting the same way in any form type 3 when you 'tab' through swiftly between multi-occ fields. When I say Baan here I mean - Baan IV c3.<br />
<br />
And the users we are dealing with here are - data entry operators with huge volume of orders to enter everyday. So the option of asking them to slow down is - not practical and therefore unacceptable.<br />
<br />
Did anyone come across this situation before? Any solutions / work-arounds?<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you need more details.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Can't you use the debugger with a trace on your itemcode? So maybe you will be able to find out, where/when the wrong code is filled in.<br />
<br />
Soory, this is the only idea I have at the moment<br />

<br />
However the problem is - <br />
<br />
Program always reads item code as what we keyed and that is how it saves too. During the interim time period (after we 'tab' on item code &amp; enters quantity and before saving) visually we see a wrong item code. Since the right item gets saved eventually, the transient abberation can be put up with but quantity is irrepairably messed up. ( as I mentioned in my example earlier - 5 of item 20 instead of 25).<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

In Baan IVc the ASCII Interface is still available.  Not as pretty, but just as functional.  It may act differently/better with the quick fingers.  I still think hard core data entry types would like that interface better.  Less clicking and more keyboard short cuts = faster data entry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">22nd February 2002, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">We are also on BIVc3 and are experiencing a similar problem.  And it seems to be happening more often.  Also in Order Entry we are tabbing through the fields and the price reset's to zero or to what is in the item master.  We have not been able to debug it so far.</div></div><hr />
