<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">On Table tccom012/013 (Customer Postal/Delivery Addresses), there are two indices available<br />
<br />
1. Customer, Address Code<br />
2. Country, Zip Code, Customer, Address Code<br />
<br />
But on session Display Customer Postal/Delivery Addresses (tccom012m000/tccom013m000) only first index is available. When I added the second index as well and tried to do a search after picking the second index, it still displayed the fields from first index as a search option.<br />
<br />
I guess it is due to the Form Type 3 with view field as the second index did not have the view fields as the first two fields of the index. Actually I tried to find a session with form type 3 and multiple indices and couldn't find one as an example. So I guess there is kind of restriction on how the multiple indices can be put on a session of form type 3 (and it makes sense too) but would appreciate any feedback that you might have on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Did u check whether the order by shows both the indexes and if no goto maintain sessions and maintain indices in special menu check the second index also.<br />
<br />
For the search option to show the secondary index you have to be to select the second index in order by or you can even start the session by default with second index.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">4th February 2005, 05:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I can see the second index in 'Order By' and even can select it. After selecting if I try to do a search.. it will still show me the two fields that are part of first index.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that you need to have 2 forms with different index. Look at session ticst0101m000 you have two forms and two different selection. But to do this you need to have access to the source and insert in the before.form.x an instruction to.key(x)<br />

<br />
if you want to use the second index for search you have to put the fields &quot;tccom012.pstc&quot; and &quot;tccom012.ccty&quot; on your form with field type &quot;Input&quot; (although they are just display fields).<br />
Now you will be able to search by their values after sorting by index2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">4th February 2005, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes the fields should be of type input. Otherwise you can manipulate in the choice option also.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">4th February 2005, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys. By setting the fields as Input, the search option properly displayed the fields to be search on when index 2 was selected.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the session started behaving strangely and one couldn't scroll through records as one normally would do. <br />
<br />
But thanks for the tip.</div></div><hr />
