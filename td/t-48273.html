<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">17th February 2008, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I am developing a conversion session that will take a string from a table and then call a unix script. That unix script will process that string and put the returned value into a file that my Baan script will read back. Every thing is working fine but after certain number of transactions, I start getting Error 11  EAGAIN No more processes whenever I try to read the next file back from the UNIX script. Here is the core of this script.<br />
<br />
selectdo<br />
	fp.out = 0<br />
	filename = FILE_NAME		<br />
	ret = SHELL(&quot;/usr/local/scripts2/CCTest/StoE.sh&quot; &amp; SPACE &amp; strip$(tctst016.strn) &amp; SPACE &amp; strip$(filename), SHELL_NO_OUTPUT)<br />
<br />
	fp.out  = seq.open(filename, &quot;r&quot;)<br />
<br />
	if  (fp.out &lt;=  0) then<br />
		message(&quot;Unable to open %s&quot;,filename)<br />
	else<br />
		write.value = &quot;&quot;<br />
		ret = seq.read(write.value, 80, fp.out)	<br />
		tctst016.rets = write.value<br />
		ret = shell(&quot;rm &quot; &amp; filename , SHELL_NO_OUTPUT)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
	db.update(ttctst016, db.retry)		<br />
	commit.transaction()<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is what is in programming manual about this Error.<br />
<br />
Error 11 EAGAIN	No more processes: This indicates that a fork has failed, either because the system's process table is full or because the user is not allowed to create any more processes. <br />
<br />
<br />
I checked to make sure I have unlimited processes in my Baan profile but still I keep getting this error. As I am getting this when I am opening the file for reading the value back, I am thinking may be there is a better way to do this without handling files through seq.xxx functions. It could be some  UNIX settings that I am running into but I thought I will post it here to see if I can get a feedback during the long weekend :). <br />
<br />
Also once I have received this error, I can't open any other session and I get 'Can't read from dump' error whenever I try to open any other session. So for sure there is some memory or number of processes issues. Either so many shell commands or file open commands are not clearing themselves out and causing this problem.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I also think that you should wait for each shell to finish its work.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

At least do a seq.close on the file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried the shell command with '0' option but still got the same problem. I will wait for our UNIX admins to have a look at it.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">18th February 2008, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">As mark said, You must also close (seq.close) all the files you are using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">18th February 2008, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Great catch Mark! <br />
<br />
I never thought about it. I added seq.close() and I am running my script now and it seems to have gone beyond the number of transactions it will normally error out on.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />
