<br />
I have 3 customized sessions.<br />
<br />
First session is a Maintain session through which temp. table get populated and unique key is &quot;Invoice no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Second session is a print session which does printing based on the Invoice No. specified on the form.<br />
<br />
and Third session is a display sub-session ( Form Type 2 ) which is attached as zoom to the Invoice field on the Print Session.<br />
<br />
Now my doubt is that i want to show only those Invoices which were created by the respective user. So to be more precice user &quot;X&quot; cannot see the Invoices created by user &quot;Y&quot; in the display sub-session.<br />
<br />
So question is how can i prevent all the Invoices to appear for every user ?? I want to show Invoices to the current user which he created and not the invoices which other people created. <br />
<br />
<br />
This display sub-session, i generated through standard session &quot;Generate Session&quot; and haven't written any code for this.<br />
<br />
Any help/hint would be helpfull.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">One way would be to keep the USERID of the user that enters the invoice and then only display invoices created by the current USERID.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the user who created the invoice would be the user stored on the history table (tdsls051 on Baan IV).  Record type = 3 is for invoiced.    So, (in theory) you could add a read to that table for the invoice number / record type = 3 / user = logname$ to a query.extension for your new sub session, then it would not select the records not of your logged in user.<br />
logname$ gets the userid too, I haven't used USERID, probably the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well yes i am capturing the user name in my customized table, i wrote the following code in before.program of my display session<br />
<br />
<br />
string curr.user(20)<br />
query.extension = &quot;tdsgf005.user  = curr.user&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
With the above piece of code it throws error as soon as i zoom to this display session as &quot;Query expression not correct&quot;.<br />
<br />
and if i do the following changes <br />
<br />
<br />
string curr.user(20)<br />
query.extension =&quot;tdsgf005.user  = 'curr.user'&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
cur.user is treated a string and the value inside that variable doesn't come up .<br />
<br />
How to solve this, should i hard code the user names  ?<br />
<br />

<br />
1.  I had to make my variables external to use in a query extension.  No idea why.  So declare curr.user as external in the declaration section:<br />
<br />
extern domain tcmcs.str20    curr.user<br />
<br />
2.  Use the colon in front of curr.user when checking:<br />
<br />
query.extension = &quot;tdsgf005.user  = :curr.user&quot;</div></div><hr />
