<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmathew</div><div class="date">24th August 2012, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I have a client machine which has Windows 7 and working on Baan ERP LN FP7 package. I did install Scite editor and made necessary changes to the properties file and it opens up, but the Baan language and data from Baan api file are not considered and hence not highlighted.<br />
When I in the editor and when I try to comment a set of lines, also it gives an error message &quot;Block comment variable 'comment.block.' is not defined in SciTE*.properties!&quot;<br />
Can someone help me on the above issues. <br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th August 2012, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) Do you have the baan.properties file in the scite directory?<br />
(2) Is your sciteglobal.properties file correct? Baan is specified in several spots.<br />
<br />
Under options you should see baan.properties.  This file needs to be in the install directory and then the sciteglobal.properties file should include some baan options. You should be able to get both of these files from the code and utilities forum.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind - if you use scite.properties or sciteuser.properties they will go into a different directory.  On my win 7 desktop they point to c:\users\username - username is how I log into the desktop. We do not use these two files everything goes into the sciteglobal.properties file - we have scite installed on network drive.  This way we can go to any desktop and edit code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have the file baan.properties and sciteglobal.properties in the scite directory. However, when I open the script it open scite editor, but in Options I do not find baan.properties listed. Can you please help me further on this issue.</div></div><hr />

You will get features like syntax highlighting, code completion, open declaration, etc. out of the box.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cant box comment in my scite, The Error comes as<br />
&quot;<br />
Box Comment Variables 'comment.box.start' 'comment.box.middle' and 'comment.box.end' are not defined in Scite *.properties.<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
 Although i downloaded and save all the three files in my c:/Wscite Directory<br />
(The files are SciTEGlobal.properties,baan.api,baan.properties)<br />
<br />
The Editor also doesnt show Open Baan.properties in the Options Window.<br />
<br />
Somehow the Scite doesnt seem to have read the Baan files.<br />
<br />
What i am missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th June 2016, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at the sciteglobal.txt file I attached in a post above.  Make sure you scite global properties has the import baan under the import all language specific properties files.<br />
<br />
If you put the .txt (really sciteglobal.properties) I attached above in c:\wscite you might have to edit to point to the correct api files.  The way to check if you are opening the right file is to use options open global options file.  Search for baan and make sure everything looks okay. Don't for get toward the bottom it should have import baan.<br />
<br />
Once you see baan in the options you should be able to now open the baan properties file.  Then you can search on the comment.block.baan , comment.box.start.baan, comment.box.end.baan, or comment.box.middle.baan - make sure they are |'s.  Or you can just set the variables.</div></div><hr />

Thanks  a Ton.It worked.<br />

Had a question in my Mind. I saw in SciteGlobal.properties file, they just had an import all * statement and this is supposed to be the latest version whereas your file had all the import languages specifically and your post seems to be few years old.<br />
<br />
Why doesnt Scite have that in latest version?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Admin rights not required for scite. scite was installed into %TEMP%\scite folder, where there is always write permission. Then <br />
Control Panel--&gt;All Control Panel Items--&gt;User Accounts--&gt;Change my environment variable and added %TEMP%\scite to the PATH variable. Using this method without admin rights, for quite sometime...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scite added imports.include/imports.exclude and &quot;import *&quot; since version 2.29. currently it is 3.3.6. Around 2.29, scite no longer loaded baan as default, as it was added imports.exlude list in the downloaded global properties file. Explicit declarations worked through out.</div></div><hr />

Did not try to install to the temp directory - but any install I try now requires an admin account and password on our machines.  I can't change environment variables.</div></div><hr />
