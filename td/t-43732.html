Currently I am trying to read files from a local directory from Baan. Our Baan Version is Baan IV C4. To do so I am using the function app_start. However, I am not able to fetch the file names in the file file.txt. For some reason it is always empty. However, from command ****pt if I do the same operation I am able to get the file names in file.txt file. Please find below the statement that I have used to achieve the result.  <br />
<br />
local.dir = &quot;C:\Baan\NewFolder&quot;<br />
<br />
ret = app_start(&quot;cmd /c dir /b &quot;&amp;strip$(local.dir)&amp;&quot; &gt; file.txt&quot;, strip$(local.dir), &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;)<br />
<br />
Let me know what is it that I am missing out here. <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the client OS windows XP/2000/98?</div></div><hr />

<br />
localdir = &quot;C:\Program Files\Baan\tmp&quot;<br />
rc = app_start(&quot;cmd /c dir /b &quot;&amp; chr$(34) &amp; strip$(localdir) &amp; chr$(34) &amp; &quot; &gt; &quot; &amp; chr$(34) &amp; strip$(localdir) &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; &quot;file.txt&quot;&amp;chr$(34), &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;)<br />
<br />
I think I needed the quotes.  Let me try your code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">31st October 2007, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Your code worked for me. We are on XP professional SP 2.  I had to create the c:\baan\newfolder directory(plus I put a few files in it).  It ran without any problems and I got file.txt with the list of files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">31st October 2007, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this:<br />
<br />
From the client, click on &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Run...&quot; &amp; type the following command<br />
cmd /c dir /b c:\Baan\NewFolder &gt; c:\Baan\NewFolder\file.txt<br />
Does it work?<br />

I tried your suggestion. It does not work for me. <br />
<br />
Mark: I wonder how it worked for you. I guess OS has got something to do with this.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

I have tried with another option. Earlier I tried with following path which didnt worked. It was C:\Baan\New Folder.<br />
<br />
Now I have removed the space in New Folder name. The path I have used now is C:\Baan\NewFolder. It works. I mean running the command form the local machine. <br />
<br />
I shall try the same in Baan and get back to you.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the support.<br />

<br />
You will have to find the command that works from the &quot;Run&quot;.<br />
<br />
After finding the write one you should add it to the &quot;cmd /c&quot; and try again from your Baan script<br />

First your local dir should match what is in the code - it sounds like the code had no spaces and the folder had the space in the name.  If you are going to have spaces in the folder or directory names - then you will have to put quotes around it like I did in the first example I posted, without the quotes it acts like an end of command or something and then errors out.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the feedback. It was quite a learning experience. Currently the issue is resolved. <br />

Thanks again,<br />
