<br />
In Exchange: is it possible to determine/change the ascii file path for import &amp; export during runtime? Reason for asking this: I want my simple users to be able to start Exchange schemes (via a customized session and by using AFS). My only issue is the fact that the ascii import &amp; export file paths are fixed in the Exchange schemes. What I want to achieve, is to give the user a pop-up screen in which the user enters the file location (for import the source file location, and for export the destination location). I know there is the predefined variable ascii.file.name, but I don't know if (and if so, then how and where) this variable can be used to allow the user to pass an alternate path during runtime.<br />
<br />
Any tips are much appreciated!<br />

I think it is part of the compile, but I don't know this for a fact.  I would just ask the user the import directory and file name, then just move it to the correct location to process it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was indeed going to be my alternative solution. Will do it that way.<br />

Thanks anyway,<br />

Refer to my screenshot. Yes you can have exchange scheme for different companies/paths etc if you use the global environment variables. The only issue we encountered if 2 different company's jobs run at the same time, then the logs are messed up. Our job activation script populates the custom environment variables.</div></div><hr />
