<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">13th December 2004, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">We're trying to print some inventory tags from Baan. We've generated the tags using a customized report. The tag stock we're using was designed for a different system and we have 90,000 on hand so we cannot use a different tag.<br />
<br />
The form length (per tag) of each tag is 4 inches (or 40 lines). The width is 8.5 inches. We're using an IBM 6400 series line printer. <br />
<br />
Here's the problem: Regardless of what we do, the 6400 seems to think there are 66 lines-per-page. We've adjusted the page length of the Baan report - many times - and attempted creating new paper types. So far, with no luck.<br />
<br />
If anyone has experience with this process, we'd appreciate some help.<br />
<br />
More information is available upon request.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">14th December 2004, 00:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure: On Device Data for our printer in question, there is a setting called Form Feed Every Page. <br />
<br />
For reasons we do not understand, this forces the report to form feed everytime it will overflow the printer's own page-length setting. When we uncheck this, the printer page-feeds when the report tells it to page-feed and not based on some hardware (or firmware) setting.<br />
<br />
Just another trick to put in our bag, I guess.</div></div><hr />

We had several reports that would overflow onto the next page - we use HP's at all sites, but ours was the only one with this problem.  This was three or four years ago. I now set this on every printer I create for my site.<br />
