<br />
We are want use Webui for develop and debug. When i try to open script webui, the error occurs;<br />
<br />
--Session ttadv2130s0000 is not supported in this version of LN UI-<br />
<br />
I searched that error in Infor Extreme and someones also faced that problem. They said, you need LN studio for edit/view scripts.(https://www.inforxtreme.com/espublic/EN/AnswerLinkDotNet/SoHo/Solutions/SoHoViewSolutionC.aspx?SolutionID=1676984&amp;FromWP=1&amp;kb_is_archived=0&amp;kb_accessed_from=KBFavorites) So, does the LN Studio any requirements like tool version or something else? Does anyone have experiences with LN Studio?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on a good way to approach this?<br />
<br />

Serkan</div></div><hr />

You can't use WEBUI for Development. However, you can use WEBUI for debugging by following specific steps.<br />
<br />
Though Infor suggests to use LN Studio for Development, you can use BECS for development. This is much easier than LN Studio. <br />
<br />
To use LN Studio, you need to have little knowledge about ECLIPSE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see your point, but  why they said you need LN studio for that in Infor Extreme. Beside that  we cant debug also in webui. <br />

<br />
1. Run Connector Daemon (ottstpcondaemon) from your Worktop/BECS.<br />
2. Click on Listen<br />
3. Note down the port number<br />
4. Open WebUI using a slightly different link e.g.<br />
<br />
Instead of http://&lt;WebUIAddress&gt;/webui/servlet/login use http://&lt;WebUIAddress&gt;/webui/servlet/debugLogin.<br />
<br />
Now, just open the session which is under debug and it will work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Refer the KB 1495758 on InforXtreme for more details about the procedure to debug the sessions running inside Ming.le/LN UI.<br />
<br />
Coming to your other query on Development using LN Studio, though Infor Suggests to use LN Studio (Which is a Standardized Platform for Development), you can still use BECS for Development. <br />
<br />
Let me know if you need more details.</div></div><hr />

I found these knowlodge base  from Infor Extreme (KB 1666332, KB 1495758,KB 809503). But after the configured the deamon session,when I changed the link with debugLogin, i see HTTP Status 404 page. Do we need to do more things for see the debug page in webui mode?<br />

<br />
Are you closing the Worktop/BECS after you run the Daemon session? You have to keep it running in the background when you try to access the WebUI Link. Once the page gets opened up, you have to put the port number you get on your session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srkndnsn</div><div class="date">21st November 2017, 07:45</div></div><div class="posttext">No I dont close to deamon session. After the session start to listen, i entered the debugLink then 404 not found. I have searched from Tomcat engine, this page not serviced or i cant find it.<br />

<br />
You can leave your server name details off from the link. May be the link you are providing is not right.</div></div><hr />
