<br />
I have an Exchange schema which currently exports records from the item master.<br />
<br />
Part of this export includes the price for each item in the item master. For a range of items I need to set the price in the export file to zero. I'm struggling as to what syntax I should use in a condition script to acheive this.<br />
<br />
I currently have the following condition script which is taking the price from the tdsls032 table for every item in the export file. How can I change the script to say if the item is in range A to C then enter a zero price?<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
table ttiitm001<br />
table ttdsls032<br />
domain tcitem item<br />
domain tcpric pric<br />
domain tcdate tdat<br />
domain tccplt cpls<br />
domain tcpric price<br />
<br />
     select tdsls032.item, tdsls032.pric<br />
       from tdsls032<br />
       where (tdsls032.tdat &gt; date.num() or tdsls032.tdat = 0)<br />
       and tdsls032.cpls = &quot;001&quot;<br />
       and tdsls032.item = :tiitm001.item<br />
     selectdo<br />
<br />
            price = tdsls032.pric<br />
<br />
     selectempty<br />
<br />
            price = 0<br />
<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
return(price)<br />
<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

As far as I understood your problem, I would rather first export all item whose price is to be set to zero. By Defining the Range for that particular Exchange scheme(make sure you have checked the range checkbox in Export Table Relation to make ranges applicable). Then as a second step, importing the same data after setting the price to constant zero.<br />
<br />
As far as your current script is concerned, I think if you change you code from<br />
&quot;and tdsls032.item = :tiitm001.item&quot;<br />
To <br />
<br />
&quot;and tdsls032.item = :item&quot; <br />
your problem should get resolved, but make sure you pass item as parameter. <br />
<br />

<br />
As far as I understand it, simply write a if condition:<br />
<br />
selectdo<br />
	if tdsls032.item &gt; A<br />
	and tdsls032.item &lt; C then<br />
		price = 0<br />
	else<br />
		price = tdsls032.pric<br />
	endif<br />
selectempty<br />
<br />
<br />
Or am I false?<br />

<br />
I came to the same conclusion as you.<br />
<br />
<br />
selectdo<br />
<br />
        if tiitm001.item(1;5) = &quot;CS011&quot; then        <br />
            price = 0<br />
        else<br />
            price = tdsls032.pric <br />
        endif<br />
selectempty<br />
<br />
<br />
This set all items starting with CS011 to zero price.<br />
<br />
One thing I came across during testing, which confused me, is if I specified a particular item in the condition script the price would not be set to zero. <br />
<br />
<br />
if tiitm001.item = &quot;CS011-000000-1&quot; then        <br />
            price = 0<br />
        else<br />
            price = tdsls032.pric <br />
        endif <br />
selectempty<br />
<br />
<br />
This item existed in my exchange export but it would not have it's price set to zero. if I wanted this logic is the syntax different?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

Seems to me one time I did something like this I had to use strip$(tiitm001.item) = &quot;some part&quot;.  Not even sure I have that old exchange scheme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">2nd March 2010, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Somebody else, whose post has disappeared, suggested the following which is along the same lines as yours.<br />
<br />
<br />
if strip$(shiftl$(tiitm001.item)) = &quot;CS011-000000-1&quot; then<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end my condition script was -<br />
<br />
if (tiitm001.item(1;6) = &quot;DS1105&quot;) or (tiitm001.item(1;6) = &quot;DS2105&quot;) <br />
then        <br />
            price = 0<br />
<br />
        else<br />
<br />
            price = tdsls032.pric <br />
<br />
        endif       <br />
                 <br />
<br />
     selectempty<br />
<br />
            price = 0<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks to the &quot;Baanboarders&quot; for their help. <br />
<br />
I'm not a natural programmer and only know the basics. But it's great that I can always come to baanboard.com and find lots of people willing to help.<br />
