<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gous99</div><div class="date">16th June 2004, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">On form 2, the field called &quot;Nr. of Multi Col.&quot; This should be the solution. Go and look at the help for that field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bansalajay</div><div class="date">16th June 2004, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried that by keeping the field as horizontal order but the data is still not getting printed in the way i required as asked earlier. <br />
<br />
I have taken the multi-coloumn as Horizontal and reduced the detail layout as well but of only of some use.<br />
<br />
If you can elaborate and help me with some more tips.<br />

U need to use aggregate function adn expression for each data value with same report field.<br />
<br />
If  the column headings are not pre-defined and it's number is not known at design time , u can still do so but with spool functions and variables which is very cumbersome and time consuming (not an easy task)<br />
<br />
In any case the number of characters on a line of the report will be limited to 260 characters.</div></div><hr />
