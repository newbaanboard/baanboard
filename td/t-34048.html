<br />
I have a customer with a Triton 3.1 ERP system. They have some problems with creating sales and purchase orders for repairable items. It takes a lot of time to create all the orders.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about automating the creating of these orders. As I am not a Triton/Baan expert I am wondering if this would be possible.<br />
<br />
I have been searching this forum and found tools like RMCgen, Qkey and Rush. I find it hard to determine if these tools would fit my needs. I have emailed with Fullscope about QKey but they told me that it wouldn't work for Triton 3.1. I also tried to get in touch with RMCis, but they don't seem to respond (is this company still alive?). <br />
<br />
Does anyone here know if there is a tool I could use to automate the creation of orders in Triton 3.1?<br />
<br />
With kind regards,<br />

<br />
just for my understanding:<br />
is qkey some SW to emulate keys pressed by a user? If this should be the case I can only warn you to automate processes this way - I had a project of this sort many, many years ago - it was horrible. Error handling got more and more complex - I got it to run in the end, but I wouldn't do it this way any more.<br />
Is the customer using finance module? If not I would think that generation of orders by directly writing to the Baan tables concerned with a Baan proggy couldn't be sooo difficult<br />
<br />

<br />
QKey does not emulate keyboard input as far as I can judge. <br />
<br />
It would indeed be a good idea to just input sales orders in the Oracle tables, but I am afraid that they do use the finance module. And even if they wouldn't, I am a bit hesitant to omit baan logic by inserting orders directly in the database...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">12th April 2007, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">You can think of RMCgen to do what the API's do in Baan IV and up - allow you to make callable libraries out of a Baan Session, and pass the input fields.  You do not need source code, and it will mimic all the logic of the Baan session automatically.  I do believe it is by far safer than updating the tables yourself.<br />
<br />
Our company is alive :)  Our sales person tried to send some info, but it must not have gotten through.  I've asked them to contact you through your BB account.<br />
<br />
We have not even started up our Triton system in a while, so that is some of our delay, we don't yet have a pricing on that far back.  <br />
<br />
Also, from your previous email to me, you indicated that you want to call the writes to the Baan Sessions from outside of Baan, perhaps through VB scripting.  The Perferred VB access methods, OLE or even OpenWorld, are not supported back to Triton, so you may need to get creative there.  Maybe you can write out a file, then trigger the Baan call from the OS that reads the file, and writes out a response file, then pick up the response.    We have also worked quite a bit in this area, if you need advice or assistance, but for Triton there is no canned process to communicate through VB, that I know of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I received a reply on my email yesterday from Kathy. <br />
<br />
You have to excuse my silly questions, but I have really no experience with Triton (which will change soon I hope). I do have some programming experience and that's where my question is coming from. You say that RMCgen creates callable libraries. On the other hand you say that interfacing with VB is not possible. My question is, how do these libraries work? And where can I call them?<br />
