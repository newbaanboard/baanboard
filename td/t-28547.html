We have a customized process, which creates new batches and posts in tfacr200 and tfgld102 etc. The standard Baan session is then used to finalzed these records. This seems to work fine. However, since a software update 6 months ago, there seems to be the following problem:<br />
<br />
The transactions are being finalized without a problem, i.e. all records from tfgld102 are transferred to tfgld106. However, when printing a trial balance (session tfgld3402m000) the total of the amounts is printed as non finalized. When looking directly in the table, for instance tfgld201, indeed the entire amount of those transactions appears as non finalized! <br />
<br />
Can anyone give me a tip? What could be the problem? Anyone knows the software logic used for determining whether an amount is to be categorized as finalized or non-finalized? <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance!</div></div><hr />

The object otfgld1213 is the one who deals with the process of the finalized transactions and updates the History-Transactions by ledger account.<br />
<br />
If you done a software actualization, this will be my main suspect that is not doing his job.<br />
<br />
As a try, I will replace this object, as well as the otfgld1211 and otfgld1212.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
