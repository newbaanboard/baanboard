<br />
I've just tried to develop the report using the MS reporting service, i've managed to create some simple report using it.<br />
<br />
but i have some question...how to delete the report that already deployed to the webserver? it seems if you already deploy it to the server, the report cannot be deleted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
