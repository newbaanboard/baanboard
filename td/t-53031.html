<br />
Can anyone tell me that why do we need to re-login after doing Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary? The changes we make in table def or in domain are not directly saved in Runtime Directory? ASAP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">16th July 2008, 14:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes the changes are done, but the RTDD is read at the login time only... It cannot be other way, imagine if a user is logged when you change the RTDD, by example adding a field in the table he is using...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">16th July 2008, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several reasons, why Baan implemented it like this:<br />
<br />
a) Performance: The runtime information is read once at login and then cached in memeory by the bshell. This way, a lot opf IO is avoided.<br />
<br />
b) Consistency: During a RDD the DD on disk is until completion ina partial inconsistent state. For example a domain might be added, but the defintiion of the table not changed yet etc.<br />
<br />
c) Survival (lacking a good description for this): If the changes would take effect imemdiately, then this might even kill the bshell of the Administrator executing the RDD himself, for example when patching in tools.<br />
<br />
d) Quick undue: If something goes wrong, the Admin might at least be partial able to revert quickly the changes by simply restoring an old DD. I know, many this will result in several problems, but a 50% running system might be better then none at all.<br />
<br />
There might be more good reasons ...<br />
