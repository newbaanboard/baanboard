<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walleye</div><div class="date">18th December 2006, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I have (2) text fields on a table. Let's call them text1 and text2, and are located on the table accordingly.  There are multiple sessions and forms used to maintain this table. The first session is a multi-oocurrence form, and when you hit the text button, they show in sequence as text2 then text1. The other forms (which are single occurrence) all show in the sequence as located on the table text1, then text2. I don't really care which is first as long as it is consistent. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to control the sequence of selection for text fields?</div></div><hr />
