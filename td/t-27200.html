<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest contacting Baan - it looks like a tools update or patch is needed.  I could be wrong, but when it effects all the form type 3 sessions that is my first thought.  I did just notice that you say developed - I take it the standard Baan sessions with form type 3 are not impacted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baancust</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">thanx for the reply mark.The problem is observed in all sessions standard as well as customised.I also thought there could be some problem related to a patch.just wanted to know if anyone else has faced the same problem before and if possible could explain me why this happens.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually my first thought was a patch or update of some sort - almost like the component or library that creates the scroll bars is corrupt.  I have not seen this exact error, but Baan usually has something for us quick when we get big failures like this. I have seen the same patchset cause different problems in our different test servers so I am not sure if it can be explained.  As a matter of fact I found a bug about two weeks ago in one of our test servers - only in this one test company. I can not select a report from a zoom(in maintain customization parts).  At that time we had the same tools patches in all companies.</div></div><hr />
