<br />
I have done the select statement to print out a report giving all the data in the table for the selection chosen in the form.  I know just need to get it to only print duplicates.<br />
<br />
I seem to have stumped myself and cannot seem to get my head around how to do this, I have tried using some nested If statements but have hit a dead end.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the right direction?  Sorry if this is a stupid question.</div></div><hr />

You can try this code : ofcourse it need lot of optimisations <br />
<br />
temp.count = 1<br />
select tdpur402.*<br />
from   tdpur402<br />
where  tdpur402._index2 inrange {:sono.f,:pono.f,:seqn.f} and<br />

<br />
I have tried the option your gave me to use and everytime I run the report it gives me the &quot;connection lost&quot; error and shuts down Baan.<br />
<br />
Is it our porting set or something like that or the code I am using that could cause this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayoobi</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">looks like a problem in the code .  I will investigate and get back to you .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayoobi</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">i think i have found the problem but i still could not test it out . <br />
<br />
Revised Code<br />
temp.count = 1<br />
select tdpur402.*<br />
from tdpur402<br />
where tdpur402._index2 inrange {:sono.f,:pono.f,:seqn.f} and<br />
{:sono.t,:pono.t, :seqn.t}<br />
and :temp.count &lt; (select count(alstdpur402.*) <br />
from tdpur402 alstdpur402<br />
where alstdpur402._index2 = {:tdpur402.sorn,:tdpur402.spon,:tdpur402.sseq}<br />
group  by alstdpur402.sorn,alstdpur402.spon,alstdpur402.sseq )<br />
selectdo<br />
|#print record<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Explanation : The subquery was returning more than one rows whereas the main query was expecting one value . Bshell could not take this bouncer and u got this problem . i am sorry for it . <br />
<br />
You can try this code too which i think is little bit improved code (combing hitesh's and my solution) :<br />
select tdpur402.*<br />
from tdpur402<br />
where tdpur402._index2 inrange {:sono.f,:pono.f,:seqn.f} and<br />
{:sono.t,:pono.t, :seqn.t}<br />
and exists in  (select count(*) <br />
from tdpur402 alstdpur402<br />
where alstdpur402._index2 = {:tdpur402.sorn,:tdpur402.spon,:tdpur402.sseq}<br />
group  by alstdpur402.sorn,alstdpur402.spon,alstdpur402.sseq<br />
 having count(*) &gt; 1))<br />
selectdo<br />
|#print record<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your solutions.  I am having a problem though.  I tried both your options and I get an error when I compile each time saying &quot;Syntax error 'group' not expected&quot; I need to have the group option in don't I otherwise it will crash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">It may be that the synatax in line before group may be incomplete e.g. the closing braces may be missing.<br />
<br />
Further the : is not needed in the subquery for tdpur402 fields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jvenderb</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you try the proposal of Hitesh Shah:<br />
This should work. You can extend it.<br />
So it would be something like:<br />
<br />
<br />
select tdpur402.orno, tdpur402,pono, tdpur402.seqn, count(*)<br />
from tdpur402<br />
where tdpur402._index2 inrange { :orno.f, :pono.f, :seqn.f }<br />
                                        and       { :orno.t, :pono.t, :seqn.t }<br />
group by tdpur402.orno, tdpur402.pono, tdpur482.seqn<br />
having count(*) &gt; 1 <br />
selectdo<br />
<br />
endselect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayoobi</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a problem in the code again as i did not compile before posting .  in the subquery , i had not selected the group field , hence the compilation error. but in a subquery , you cannot select more than one field . <br />
I have changed the code completely and this time i did compile it :<br />
<br />
	domain	tcorno	sono.f,sono.t, als.sorn<br />
	domain	tcpono	pono.f,pono.t, seqn.f, seqn.t,als.spon,als.sseq<br />
	<br />
<br />
	select alstdpur402.sorn:als.sorn, <br />
	       alstdpur402.spon:als.spon,<br />
	       alstdpur402.sseq:als.sseq<br />
	from tdpur402 alstdpur402<br />
	where alstdpur402._index2 inrange {:sono.f,:pono.f,:seqn.f} and<br />
				       {:sono.t,:pono.t, :seqn.t}<br />
	group by alstdpur402.sorn,alstdpur402.spon,alstdpur402.sseq<br />
	having count(*) &gt; 1<br />
	selectdo<br />
		select  tdpur402.*<br />
		from tdpur402 <br />
		where tdpur402._index2 = {:als.sorn,:als.spon,:als.sseq}<br />
		selectdo<br />
			|#print record<br />
		endselect<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Note : As far as i understand correctly , you would like to print all the duplicate records not just sales order number , position and sequence of the duplicate records . otherwise , hitesh's code will work just fine . <br />

Good Luck !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">16th September 2002, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Ayoobi and guys for helping me out with that problem I had.  I managed to get the report working showing all the duplicate entries in the tdpur402 table that have suplicate purchase orders for a sales order.<br />
<br />
The new problem is they want me to exclude cancelled orders off the tdpur401 table.  So if there were initially 3 entries for a sales order it needs to check if there are any cancelled orders.  If there were 2 cancelled then it should not show it on the report. ie, the count must be &gt; 1 still.  I am trying to use a nested select statement and I think I would need to run another count and loop it to check for cancelled orders?  I hope this is the right idea?  Or should I be trying to do this in the report script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">16th September 2002, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
Sorry for all the questions.  Using the code above I need to only include orders that are not cancelled in the tdpur401 table.  Could I do the following.<br />
<br />
function read.main.table()<br />
{<br />
select 	tdpur401.*<br />
from 	tdpur401<br />
where	tdpur401._index1 inrange {:orno.f} and<br />
				 {:orno.t}<br />
and	tdpur401.clyn &lt;&gt; tcyesno.yes<br />
<br />
selectdo<br />
	select	alstdpur402.sorn:als.sorn, alstdpur402.spon:als.spon, alstdpur402.sseq:als.sseq<br />
	from 	tdpur402 alstdpur402<br />
	where	alstdpur402._index1 = {:tdpur401.orno}<br />
	group by alstdpur402.sorn,alstdpur402.spon,alstdpur402.sseq<br />
	having count(*) &gt; 1<br />
	selectdo<br />
		select 	tdpur402.*<br />
		from	tdpur402<br />
		where	tdpur402._index2 = {:als.sorn,:als.spon,:als.sseq}<br />
		as set with 1 rows<br />
		selectdo<br />
			rprt_send()<br />
		endselect<br />
	endselect<br />
endselect<br />
	<br />
}<br />
My thinking is that by selecting only non cancelled orders initially that the rest of the query will only use that data to run its select statements with?  Am I right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayoobi</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 04:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Slight modification is required to the code . I have just added position and sequence in tdpur402 select . This is to ensure that cancelled order lines are not selected again in tdpur402.  if you just give order range then those lines would be selected , thus nullifying your efforts in the outermost select. <br />
<br />
Also i did not understand the reason for as set with 1 rows in the innermost select . Do u want to print only one of the duplicate records ? <br />
