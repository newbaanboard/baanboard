<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">22nd April 2005, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to hide some of the display fields on my form when certain conditions are true, but I haven't been able to find a way to do this.  I tried attr.echo in the before display section, but that didn't work.  Most of the fields are strings so I can hide them by blanking them out.  However, one of the fields is numeric and defaults in a 0 which will show up on the form.  Does anyone know a way to hide display fields.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

One thought, since you are already blanking strings....If it's just a display field, try making the field on the form a string, then in the before display section for that field, fill it with the string value of your numeric value - str$(numeric value), then you can control in the script if it's blank or filled.  That would be ugly if it's a maintainable field.</div></div><hr />

Using attr.echo = false in the before display section worked.  Sorry and thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />
