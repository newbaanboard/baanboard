Hello,<br />
<br />
the modes are used in references as :<br />
<br />
1.) Mode for referenced table<br />
2.) Reference controll in update<br />
3.) Reference controll in delete<br />
<br />
<br />
In a table definition, it is possible to set restrictions on update and/or delete actions for records that are referenced by other tables. These restrictions mean that you cannot delete and/or update the primary key that is referenced by another table. This function checks whether there are references to the current record with delete and/or update restrictions. This function can take a long time to complete if no reference counter is kept (lookup mode). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;mode&gt;<br />
<br />
 A mode indicating system action if reference does not exist; possible values are:<br />
<br />
SKIP If a reference cannot be found, the record is skipped. <br />
CLEAR If a reference is empty or absent, the referring record is filled with spaces or 0 (numeric). <br />
SETUNREF The value of an undefined reference is filled with an 'undefined reference' sign, defined in the data dictionary, or with 0 (numeric). <br />
CLEARUNREF The referred record is filled with spaces or 0 (zero) when reference fields are empty. When the reference is undefined the referred record is filled with an 'undefined reference' sign. <br />
<br />
Depending on the reference definition in the data dictionary, the default reference mode is:<br />
<br />
reference mode in DD       UNREF mode <br />
mandatory                     SETUNREF <br />
mandatory unless empty  CLEARUNREF <br />
not mandatory                CLEAR <br />
 <br />
<br />

can I use If I don't run DD for the reference table?  <br />
  <br />
For example:  <br />
  <br />
tdcpe100.orno -&gt; tdsls400.orno  <br />
  <br />
I don't want to run DD for tdsls400 table, because it is a very big table and We would take a lot of time. <br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
dont't built a table reference.<br />
<br />
Realize your reference logic in sessionscript.<br />
<br />
tdcpe100.orno index1 = orno (tcorno)<br />
tdsls400.orno index1 = orno (tcorno)<br />
<br />
No reference in table definition<br />
<br />
Session:<br />
<br />
select tdsls400.*<br />
from tdsls400<br />
where tdsls400._index1 = {:tdcpe100.orno}<br />
<br />
.............<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Disadvantage:<br />
No checks by DB-System<br />
(no check when a record in tdcpe100 is deleted)<br />
<br />
If you built references between tables in &quot;Maintain Table Definitions&quot; you always have to run DD.<br />
<br />

Hi Bernd   <br />
  <br />
That is to say in any way I can make a reference without I have to run DD for the table reference (in this example tdsls400).</div></div><hr />
