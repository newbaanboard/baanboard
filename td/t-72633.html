<br />
We have a requirement of data upload using a file, and also validate those fields by maintaining  those fields in custom session using field details along with sequence. In addition to this any changes in the custom table session fields need to reflect dynamically in the upload file.<br />
<br />
For ex: if i am uploading x,y,z table fields in the file, we will maintaining these in field custom table also. And if a new field is &quot;a&quot; added to the table as well as in file also.Program should able to upload this by validating the data.<br />
<br />
Can any one can help me on this logic.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
