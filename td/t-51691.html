<br />
There is an Item which is treated as Subcontracting, given that item type, it has subcontracting rates.  In the Item Master, there is a separate Purchase price (tititm001.prip) and also looking on table Display Subcontracting Rates, there is a column for its rate.  Making a test, we issued Production Order for Subcon Item, after releasing we generated subcontracting orders.After which, we maintained Purchase Order.  When we checked the price in PO Lines (tdpur041.pric), they got it on subcontracting rates.  However, in the Price Level (tdpur041.plev), the ones reflected was &quot;Item File Price&quot; instead of &quot;Supplier Item&quot;.  Does it has something to do with the setting or any idea how did it happen.<br />
