We canceled the Baan support agrement with Infor. After then , they sent us <br />
a file which includes illegal scripts according to Audit program. They claim that<br />
all scripts in the file are illegal and out of the licence agrement. But I checked the scripts and I saw that some of them are my own scripts not Baans standart.<br />
and I belive that others are also not correct. <br />
My question is that How their audit program works (algorithm of program)?<br />
Do you have any experience like mine ? If yes , What did you do ?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Best Regards,</div></div><hr />

I just responded to my manager on the list.  A couple were sessions the support center put into our environment.  I am not sure how they responded to infor - but everything listed belonged to us.  Quite a few were qkey sessions and I responed as such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure and it does not look like it works completely.  Some of the sessions were in a module called UDI - our own module.  Did not make sense to me.</div></div><hr />
