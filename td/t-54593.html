Audit trail and audit host settings<br />
Before you can create an audit trail, the following information is required:<br />
? The size of the trail files (sequence files) that are created. Define the trail file size in the Audit Trail File Sizes (ttaud3135m000) session. Because the maximum number of sequence files for each table/company combination is 999, and you cannot delete the currently active file, you must choose a file size that enables you to delete old files, while keeping at least the currently active file. The trail file size must be large enough to store the audit trail of a large transaction, otherwise, the transaction is stopped.<br />
? The path to the directory where the audit trail files are stored. Define the paths in the Audit Trail Paths (ttaud3136m000) session.<br />
? The security settings for reading, maintaining, and deleting the sequence files. Define the security settings in the Audit Trail Security (ttaud3137m000) file.<br />
? The audit host settings: Define the audit hosts in the Audit Hosts (ttaud3130m000) session. You can define audit hosts for each company. Defining audit hosts is optional. If no host is defined for a company, the local system is used as host. If your system uses a master application server, and one or more other application servers, for best results, be sure to define audit hosts. Otherwise, the transaction IDs in the audit trail might not be successive.<br />
Note<br />
To activate these settings, you must use the Create Runtime Audit Definitions (ttaud3200s000) session, with the correct check boxes selected, to convert the settings to run time. Only the security settings are effective immediately, and must not be converted to run time.<br />
<br />
