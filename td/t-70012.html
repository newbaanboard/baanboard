<br />
I have a requirement that I need to skip the setup in ttaad1105m000 for one particular session in a module that otherwise will open in logistic company.<br />
<br />
Is there a way, I could bypass the switch to logistic company before my session is opened, so that it opens in the current company of the user.<br />
<br />
If not, is there a way I could know what was my current company before the switch happened, so I can call the switch.to.company() in before.program section of the session.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jatin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where curr_company is the get.compnr()..</div></div><hr />

That was the first thing I tried. But, the current company is already changed even before 'before.program'.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

That can be the most closest to accurate.. But if the User has changed the company before running the session...This condition will fail..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, that is an option I thought of..but it may fail in our situation where users are shifting between companies.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to find out how ERPLN stores the current company for a user? It must be storing it either in a table or some global variable in one of the 'tt' objects that are called in the background.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Not sure it will exactly show you what you are looking for, but might mention some tables or show something that helps.</div></div><hr />

I tried with debug Bhell but it didn't give any results as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this method. Saves you trouble of spending a lot of time on trying things. You can keep looking for alternatives.<br />
<br />
I guess, bshell does it's work even before.program and switches the company and hence, there is no way to tackle that. This is just a though of how it might be working. <br />
<br />
So, what you can do is, copy the existing session and make a new one. Now, call the duplicate session in before.program of the current session and kill the current session.<br />
<br />
This way, you can easily deal with the switching thing.</div></div><hr />

So had a doubt in this, Are there three companies in this set up? Current company, Logistic Company and Finance Company?</div></div><hr />
