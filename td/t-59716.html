I've many fields in which the user should enter a number from zero to nine. It is very uncomfortable when you have to enter a &quot;TAB&quot; after every input. So i want a routine that automaticaly change to the next field after the user enter only one of the numbers between 0 - 9. I've tried every after.input, before.input, etc. but always I have to press the TAB key to change to the next field. Do you know a possibility to do this? I don't want to use the ASCII-Mode, all users are working in Baan-GUI.<br />
Thx,<br />

<br />
after.input:<br />
to.field(field)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th December 2010, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">You still have to hit a key to get to the after field event.  When I was looking for something like this I could not get it to move to the next field automatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">18th December 2010, 00:24</div></div><div class="posttext">In ASCII mode, since field to field navigation was by Carriage-Return, there is a facility to 'emulate' auto-tab feature. I suppose because of the way the GUI systems works under the hood, they had to do away with the feature.<br />
It seems TAB is the only mechanism that 'transfers' the value entered in the field on the form into the program script. I tried various field events (when.field.changes, after.input, on.input) and all of them expect the TAB before being triggered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">23rd December 2010, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I have worked on field inputs where pressing special keys like CTRL + E, we open zoom session different from the session which come on normal zoom sessions . Mechanism is like this . When user presses CTRL + E  and [^E] is specified as no wait character (ie keys for which not carriage return or tab is required )  baan pre-defined variable g.in.ret or in.ret gets it's ascii value 5 . This value can be trapped in on.input section . And in on.input section can get the value of the key pressed . And that can be used to initialize the field and also to generate an automatic tab (check code tab() in thi forum ) .<br />
<br />
In ur case , u can define no wait characters  as [0-9] OR [0123456789] . And it should work !!<br />
<br />
All the best .</div></div><hr />

So the aforesaid workaround will not work for printable characters like 0 to 9. <br />
<br />
So there appears no solution in normal standard program flow  (as advised by many others ).</div></div><hr />
