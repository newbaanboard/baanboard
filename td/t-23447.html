<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">batmush</div><div class="date">15th March 2005, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
I have customized report based on the tfacr242111000 standard report. In customized one were added sales order and purchase order.<br />
The tfacr242111000 standard was fixed several times by BaaN but not my customized one...<br />
If I print in customized report two customers that have numbers different by one only (20044 and 20045), the last invoice of 20044 customer &quot;jumps&quot; to be the first invoice of the 20045 customer. If I print two customers separately, this invoice appears in 20044 customer.<br />
Attached report sample.<br />
Does some one know what should I change?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

It looks like something is changing the customer number for that invoice or the sort order is incorrect.  In debug mode you can watch it read in and print each record.  This should help you isolate where the problem is.  Make sure it is reading the records in correctly and nothing changes the customer number in the report script.<br />
