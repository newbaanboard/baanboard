<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th October 2017, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure I get the question - typically barcodes are scanned into the system.  So no function needed.  I mean we create(or receive barcoded items from vendors) and just us a scan gun to read them in. The scan gun setup was the key. So maybe you can clarify the question.</div></div><hr />

As you told, first of all we can scan the barcode by using scan gun... I want to know that how to give the input which one read by the scan gun into LN table. Could you please assist me for store the inputs those are read by the scan gun into LN...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th October 2017, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">All of ours are hard wired scanners.  So basically they bring up a session and scan data - they can type or scan.  I have a suspicion that you all maybe using wireless scan guns that may gather a bunch of data and now you want to process or move the data into LN.  Can you confirm that?  If that is the case you will need to wait for others to reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">14th October 2017, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what he means is - User scans a barcode and LN detects that the barcode has been read and processed. <br />
<br />
I don't see any inbuilt function to identify the barcode scan in LN. It can just generate the barcode for you but cannot detect whether it has been scanned or not. What you can do is, you can trigger a store procedure or something like that to update LN table when the barcode database table is updated. That will be an integration you can think of if you want this functionality.<br />
<br />
Other that any such integration, I am not sure if you can do it just by using LN Tools.</div></div><hr />
