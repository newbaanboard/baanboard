<br />
We have Baan IV C4 with Porting Set 6.1c.05.02 on a Unix machine.<br />
<br />
On certain Baan reports like Sales Invoices, we want our Company Logo to appear on each page. <br />
The company logo can be in a GIF/Bitmap File.<br />
<br />
Is it possible in Baan Reportwriter itself ? Or the only option is to make use of external report writer like Crystal Reports ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

You can refer to this thread for the document on logo printing by clark( Very good one)<br />

Here is one (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1194&amp;highlight=Logo).<br />

<br />
I had been through the links you specified and also, the global search on &quot;font&quot;, &quot;logo&quot; across baanboard.<br />
<br />
Most of the postings have a mention of creating and using a user-defined font, then registering that font on each of PC and then, making use of &quot;bwprint&quot; utility of Baan.<br />
<br />
But at our end, we do not make use of bw environment; every login is ASCII (ba).<br />
<br />
Is there any way by which Baan report can recognize the Image files in Unix environment ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th October 2002, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I missed this post.  Yes there is a way to do this. What we do is put this in the report script for each report that gets a logo.<br />
<br />
<br />
printer = tolower$(spool.device)<br />
shell.command = &quot;/usr/bin/lp -d&quot; &amp; strip$(printer) &amp; &quot; -s $BSE/lib/barcode/font/IMAGE.BIN&quot;<br />
shell(shell.command,1)<br />
<br />
<br />
The report then has a field put on it with &quot;  &quot; as the field and the font defined as user font 14. Then user font 14 has pfont14=\E&amp;f0s6y2x1S in it.<br />
<br />
I did not set this up so I am not sure what is in the IMAGE.BIN file. We also use nothing but HP printers.<br />
<br />

<br />
I hope, the solution should work. <br />
We are also using HP Printers.<br />
<br />
I believe, the IMAGE.BIN can be replaced by any GIF file.<br />
<br />
Let me try it and I will post the findings.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not as simple as your assumption. Please look here for a solution. Be warned it is not for the faint of heart :)<br />
