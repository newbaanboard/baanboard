I make a report and want to save it onto local PC. I use:<br />
  ttstpconv<br />
  ascii: %s<br />
  D:\something.txt<br />
So far ok. Just I do not like that 'notepad' opens when a file is created.<br />
And the problem is much bigger because I run this session with a job  every 10 min. After a while my screen is fulfill with notepad windows  :mad: <br />
Is there an argument (of ttstpconv or notepad) that I do not know?<br />
THX for any suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">16th September 2005, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The ttstpconf functionality needs to send the report somewhere, that is why if you do not specify a program, your local PC will handle the file extension according to what was setup for the type of file you specified (in this case, open .txt files with notepad).<br />
Jobs are not supposed to send data to clients (that's why they are jobs, so that they run unattended in the server side), I don't know why you are sending job outputs to a client instead of saving them in the server. It would make more sense to save to a file in the server side and then pick up the reports thru ftp or other way.<br />
In any case, save from server to client, etc. has been discussed already (you should have searched first), start here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=12500&amp;highlight=save+file)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have and ASCII device setup using ttstpconv and ASCII in the argument.  Currently when a user uses this device the file goes to the server in the \\server\baan\tmp directory along with EVERY SINGLE OTHER tmp file that gets created by the Baan program.<br />
<br />
I used to work in a UNIX environment and each user had it's own directory on the server where files like this would go.  Is that a UNIX thing or can Windows be setup that way as well?  Would that have been done on implementation of the software?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info!<br />

On our system the ASCIF device first creates the Baan report in $BSE/tmp.  I would expect the same on the windows environment.  Next in converts the file to ASCII into the spool.fileout location.  Of course the spool.fileout location is somewhere on the server.  What is going into your spool.fileout?  Of course I really do not know windows server setups.  I would expect that you could specify another directory on the server in the output file.<br />
<br />
Other devices we have like excel will take the file download it to the client and launch excel(or word).  The download text file is in the client $BSE/tmp directory.  If you want something to just download the file to the client with out lauching the file then I would write my own device driver.  You can see this in the code and utilities session.  All you would need to do is use ttstpconv to convert to ASCII, then server2client to download it.</div></div><hr />

I was successful in finding some good documentation on this wonderful board though that does some thing like you mentioned and I created my own device driver that I call in the device.<br />

Thanks as usual for your response Mark you are always helpful.<br />
