<br />
I was wondering if there is way that I can edit the main menu.<br />
What I mean is that I want to add another whole new menu with sub menus to a maintain sessions. <br />
<br />
For example, I want to add my menu after the help menu and call it &quot;view&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know how to add some options to the special  menu. But I want to add a new menu. Is that possible?  :confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks allot,<br />

Hope u people are not talking about creating a extra toolbar.<br />
With the function create.extra.toolbar()....one can easily put the image he wants &amp; then on click of that could write a code that will execute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can this extra tool bar be in all session?! without maintaining all the forms?<br />
<br />
The idea is to create a menu/toolbar that works from all sessions without maintaining all session.<br />
<br />
How can I add a working tool bar to all sessions?<br />

<br />
Well maintaining forms is not required for this.<br />
<br />
As this is created using the standard function which is called in the Program Script.<br />
<br />
May b u can write this as a external function/dll ... but that too will require calling this function in all yr session.So u would require source codes.<br />
<br />
This function normally is called in &quot;init.form&quot; section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">28th June 2005, 12:46</div></div><div class="posttext">So we have to edit all the source codes? for all the sessions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beginer</div><div class="date">28th June 2005, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes ... <br />
If u want to follow this u hv to edit all the source code with atleast 1 line...<br />
which will call the customized function/dll in init.form section &amp; which in turn would call the create.extra.toolbar() function with appropriate arguments (Name &amp; name of gif file associated)....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">28th June 2005, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, But I am looking for an easier way. I want it to work without changing so many things.<br />
<br />
If you read all the thread.. I have managed to add a menu and in the menu I put the &quot;Field Help&quot; option. I can put any standard Baan option. I am looking for a way to put any option I want. for example open another session.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th June 2005, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is something you can think about trying - currently on the tool bar is ottstpcalc(under tools).  What you can try is writing a 3gl script that gives the user the choice of running the calculator or running someother option.  You can test the 3gl script first. Once you are sure it launches your session and the calculator correctly then what you can do is rename ottstpcalc to something like ottstpcalc1.  Then change your script to launch ottstpcalc1.  Compile it.  Then copy the resulting object into ottstpcalc.  <br />
<br />
I do not know what issues this may cause internally to Baan.  There may be some sessions that use the calculator or call it directly.  This was just something I just thought of.</div></div><hr />

Thanks again for your advice.. but it didn't work :(<br />
<br />
I got the attached error when I renamed the calc object to my object.<br />
I even tried to replace the calc with the calendar object it didn't work and I got the the same error<br />
<br />
I replaced the object that is found under $BSE/tools/ttB40_c4/ottstp<br />

any other ideas?<br />

<br />
Actuaully I still didn't find a way to link a different object to existing<br />
menu command and/or create new menu command and make it <br />
enabled (with some existing object).<br />
<br />
There's a way to use an existing menu command and replace<br />
its object to another object (customized)...<br />
for example, replace &quot;Calculator&quot; (ottstpcalc)... after backuping the <br />
original object (ottstpcalc), to compile (bic6.1) the new script<br />
to object &quot;ottstpcalc&quot; that will replace the old calc. <br />
Then each time you choose &quot;Calculator&quot; (you can change its <br />
name in &quot;Master Data&quot; of course) the new object will run.<br />
<br />
That's all folks.</div></div><hr />

But the calculater is used in baan by users (I know the can use the windows calc) &amp; maybe by other Baan internal functions, no?<br />

Is there a nicer way to do this??<br />

Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Thanks again for you reply.<br />
<br />
I tried what you said and now ctrl+F1 activates my session. But I couldn't insert it in a menu! I have the menu but it is disabled. I tried to maintain ttadv4172m000 but it didn't work. How can I let it be in my new menu?<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
One more problem I have with this solution that in this way I can't know from what session my session was executed! I need to know the fields of the session and more stuff.. from the other solution ( overwriting the calc object) I could know from what session my session was executed, but know I can't :(<br />
<br />
I guess if my session was executed from any session's menu it will know from where it was executed, no?<br />
<br />
Thanks again...<br />

Hii,<br />
<br />
from what I could understand from your messages you posted (you and mark)<br />
and among a lot of words (some of them are grammatically incorrect or<br />
mistyped).. <br />
first of all the &quot;key grouping&quot; and &quot;mapping&quot; is a nice thing, though <br />
it's for global calling from anywhere, but it won't help you, George7a,<br />
cause you want to know your father no? the session that called <br />
you (but when you press something it's you the keys that<br />
called the process... not the session itself).<br />
<br />
You can replace any object in baan's menu and use it for your own <br />
goals (hacking the system), but adding a brand new object as new menu <br />
command, I doubt it.... at least in Baan4c4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hii,<br />
<br />
These kind of sessions (and Global Replace of Form Data)<br />
is for replacement not adding new things into Menus or Forms.<br />
But you, or any good tools programmer, can write a script<br />
that adds whatever you want to the Forms/Menus<br />
through TT tables... and then run Create Runtime DD (Forms and Menus)<br />
manually or better using AFS. In this case you add/change<br />
anything in range of Forms/Menus (Baan's Menus) in one strike.</div></div><hr />

I also do not think ttadv3260m000 is what you are looking for.  I think you are still looking to add something to drop down list or on the toolbar.  I was not aware of the fact that you needed session fields from the child session.  Back to the drawing board.</div></div><hr />

I can add something to these text files and it will be added to the menu (I couldn't add a new menu field before! Until now, I could just change the name of the Calc option.). But still I can't find the place to link the new menu with my object/session<br />
<br />
Any idea? :confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
interesting stuff I could read in this thread. I tested to insert a new menu in the menu bar including some standard form options (next.frm). It worked!<br />
<br />
Standard form options are stored in ttadv470. The option number (e.g. 27) is linked there with an option code (next.frm), which is used also in program scripts.<br />
<br />
For choices like &quot;calculator&quot; there has to be a place where the link to the executable session (ottstpcalc in this case) is stored.<br />
I could not find any tools table with this link so maybe it is stored in any text file and could be expanded with own links.<br />
<br />
An other possibillity would be to find an other option than calender and calculator which starts a baan session too but is not realy used by users. Does anybody know someone?<br />
<br />
And one idea more: has anybody practice with bucket messages? With this feature sessions can be started. And there exists a form option &quot;bms&quot;. Maybe this could be used in any way.<br />
<br />
I hope anybody can pick up some of my thoughts and find a way....<br />
