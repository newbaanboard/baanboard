<br />
2 finance users have errors showing on the servers.<br />
<br />
1.	Whilst trying to match purchase invoice with receipts it will throw the user out with no error message on Baan, but when we look at the application server even log we can see an 850 error.<br />
2.	It has taken 1 day to run the select invoices for payment session, now the user is going throw the payment advice and trying to delete off invoices, on the face it looks like it has worked but when you go back the invoice is still showing and there is a 522 error on the application server event viewer.<br />
<br />
Our other users are experiencing the system running slow and any 3rd party apps that are using SQL views are timing out.<br />
<br />
Can anybody point me in the direction on what to look for.</div></div><hr />
