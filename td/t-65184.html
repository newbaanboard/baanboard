<br />
We are building an interface through webservices, using Business Studio.<br />
<br />
We were deploying BDEs, importing a system table and using default interface definition and method List to provide the requested data about the table.<br />
<br />
But now I'm facing an issue: A specific method must provide as response repeatable informations, like purchase order and respective lines...<br />
<br />
How can I define in Business Studio that an atribute or group or component is repeatable?<br />
<br />
I was using the data type atribute dimension. But it makes the repetition number static, what is an issue for further methods...<br />
<br />
Also, I know that is possible to define the multiplicity between components, but couldn't find out how can it help me to return repeated nodes... :confused:<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
