<br />
What is the difference between 3GL and 4GL, he only thing which I could figure out from the tutorial is that 3GL is procedure driven language where as 4GL is a event driven language.<br />
<br />
Is there nay other difference ???<br />

So the event orientation is certainly one of the baan 4gl features. However, I would also count the language that Baan calls &quot;3GL&quot; under the 4GL languages, because of the inline sql and very tight integration between the 3GL languages features like variables and the database accessing. Writing smething like temp=tiitm001.item for getting the value of a database record field into a program variable is already 4GL in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Technically, the difference between a Baan 4Gl and a Baan 3GL script is that a 4GL script is treated by a special precompiler first. This precompiler translates it into a Baan 3GL script, which then is compiled into the final baan object. The sections of the 4GL script are mapped to functions in the 3GL script. During runtime, that script gets linked to a standard DLL which does the basic user interface handling and calls the methods of the created object.<br />

Not necessarily though in most cases 3GL script can also be run stand alone. We have some session wherein we have attached 3GL scripts to session because we don't need and forms and form events associated with it for such sessions. Such sessions run in the background without form (as a startup session and gets logged out when BW is closed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">From the help manual -<br />
<br />
Event-driven programming<br />
4GL scripts are event oriented. They consist of one or more event sections in which you program actions to be performed at particular states of execution of the 4GL engine Â– for example, when a session is started, before a group of fields is activated, when the value of a field changes, and so on. It is not necessary to program all sections, only those for which the 4GL engine does not provide the required functionality. <br />
<br />
In simple words, in a 3-GL script, you have to code your own event handling, window creations etc.</div></div><hr />

Hi Hitesh,<br />
<br />
Please correct me If I am wrong. I think our replies are matching.<br />
<br />
Not necessarily though in most cases 3GL script can also be run stand alone. <br />
<br />
I am agree with this, as we are also using 3GL standalone scripts but it doesn't mean it has forms.<br />
<br />
We have some session wherein we have attached 3GL scripts to session  <br />
<br />
Please give me example here. As I wrote we are running standalone 3GL scripts.<br />
<br />
Hi Prashanth Sir,<br />
I am fully agree with you.<br />
<br />

Only sessions are allowed . In such cases u have to link 3gl  program to session only and maintain the same as sessions. And this is allowed . <br />
<br />
Thus  3gl  programs can also be linked to sessions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If 3-GL is attached to a session you can see that in the session info.<br />
<br />
I am not sure in your BaaN version.</div></div><hr />
