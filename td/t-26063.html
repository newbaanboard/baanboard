<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">12th January 2006, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a typical spread sheet type of problem where I need to create a list of employees. The employees are selected by date and department.<br />
<br />
Using this list, the data to be displayed and other data to be updated across the row comes from several source tables, and in most cases, some fields are a total of all several row fields of secondary tables. <br />
<br />
For example, I would sum the tihra100 hours accounting records to provide a total of hours worked in one field on the row. To the right, in another field, I would allow an input to allow a new correction value.<br />
<br />
There is no single table to control the output/input as in a multi-occurence update from a specific table. <br />
<br />
Can it be done easily? That is with standard Baan multi-occurence form mangement (Baan 4c4)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">12th January 2006, 10:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it can be done easily. Although normally Baan expects non calculated table fields in a multi-occ session, yet you can calculate (sum, etc) fields and display them in two ways:<br />
<br />
1) you calculate your fields into a variable which is being displayed on your form<br />
<br />
2) if it's a lot of puzzling and caluculating to get your data together, it is recommended to work with a temp table. You gather the data, insert into the temp-table, and the form displays the table records. The big advantage of this is the ease of use, totally Baan standard way.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. If you need more help, please give more details on your exact requirements, and we will try to help you further.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />
