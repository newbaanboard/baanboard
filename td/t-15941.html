<br />
If you want to save the old versions of each script, you create variants.  To use variants when you want to modify a script:<br />
<br />
- Find the script you want to update and choose 'Copy'.  You should be prompted with 'Copy to a variant' - answer Yes.<br />
- This creates the next Variant in the sequence, consider this the backup copy, don't edit this one.<br />
- Find the 'Main Source' version, usually using Prev. Var.  Make your changes there.  You have to document it by hand, where in Baan V the SCM does some of the documentation for you.<br />
- Note:  The 'Main Source' is what should be running (In my humble opinion), but in reality whatever version you compile will be running.<br />
- If you need to go back to a previous version of the source, find the 'Main Source' and choose 'Next Var' until you come upon the version you need.  Compile it and it will be the version running.<br />
<br />
This is only available for scripts / libraries/ functions.  Other components like Forms you have to back up yourself.<br />
<br />
You can always check what version is running by running the 'ttstpsessinfo' program (File / Run option on the main menu) for your session, the Idents will tell you the version if you have marked them correctly.</div></div><hr />
