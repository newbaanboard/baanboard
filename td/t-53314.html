We are working SSA LN 6.1  <br />
  <br />
We are going to up information to LN from other systems. We will use AFS functionality, but We are going to use a intermediate layer ( websphere IBM Message Broker). This is going to send a XML message to BaaN with the information needed, but this xml message could be until 4 megas. I had investigated and the UNIX SO permit me environment variables of 4 megas.  <br />
  <br />
My question is baan permit me using environment variables until 4 megas?</div></div><hr />

Based on these notes, Open World is a better choice for the solution.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
I know that the function getenv$()  from the Tools programmer's manual does not mention any limits, but my question is focused a  programming baan restriction, that is to say, getenv$() return the value to any string variable   <br />
when I receive the value of the environment variable until how much information can I receive in this variable?  <br />
 and   <br />
Which data type should be the variable.?  <br />

Refer to - Known limits (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_misc_known_limits)<br />
maximum string buffer size is 4K – be careful when concatenating strings with '&amp;' sign<br />
From the Release notes of Porting set 8.4a<br />
DEM impact<br />
ERP LN 6.1, ERP 5.2a and ERP 5.0 customers using DEM are advised to<br />
add the following line to $BSE/lib/defaults/all<br />
bshell_max_strbuf_size:131072<br />
Not setting this resource will lead to ‘string stack overflow’ problems, resulting in bshell crash. UI symptom in BW: &quot;Connection with server lost.</div></div><hr />
