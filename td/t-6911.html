<br />
Iam trying to figure out how to load data using exhange from one host1 in baan to another host2 when the exchange scheme is in the host1.<br />
<br />
One of our hosts has application server and Database server separated, when Iam trying to create the directories its not allowing me to create the directory (not bcos of permissions, i checked it), When i try to save the exchange scheme it is throwing an error that unable to commit the transaction.<br />
<br />
Please help<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th September 2002, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">The good news is that we also have an application and database server.  And exchange schemes do work in our environment - we used some exchange schemes during the initial load.  The bad news is that I have never used exchange schemes.  I would recommend you check permissions(but you state you already did that) and make sure it is not trying to create directories on the database host.  But these are just guesses since I do not really now how you setup exchange scheme or the servers.<br />
<br />
And last but not least only one post is necessary in the forums - saves me time from deleting duplicate posts. You have to be patient for the experts, not everyone can be logged on all the time.  Besides Friday is usually a slow day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">28th September 2002, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly just more questions - <br />
What version are you on?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about your directories - can you post what how you are entering them in 'Maintain Exchange Schemes'?  If it cannot find the path, it should say 'Not a Valid Path' or some such...Does it not?    Usually, the following is valid for NT and Unix:<br />
     $BSE/exchange/obj<br />
     $BSE/exchange/err<br />
     $BSE/exchange/seq<br />
     $BSE/exchange/def<br />
<br />
For not being able to save the scheme - make sure you tab through all the fields and see if an error comes up.  <br />
<br />
Are there any exchange schemes from before that you can compare to?   <br />
<br />
For moving from Host to Host, you must have an Exchange Scheme on both sides.  An Export Scheme on one side and an Import Scheme on the other.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I did know to check permissions and to exchange between hosts we must have the file available in the host, but was wondering if data from one host can be directly pulled into another host via an exchange scheme , which i think is possible in BAAN.(Let me complete my research to answer it).<br />
<br />
I apologise for posting two times , I did that without knowing I posted already.Iam Sorry Again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway the problem was solved after we found out that there was no Space on the Host!!!.Did anyone come across such a situation, I never Did.<br />
<br />
Thanks you all again<br />

I think our admins use that as a signal to clean up stuff. Usually the first clue is that our Unix printers stop working and we are unable to vi files(of course I do not have that problem since I use the scite editor:)).<br />
