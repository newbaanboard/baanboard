It seems that in Baan V only MODAL and MODELESS are available. I need however to have an overview functionality while still being in MODAL mode.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can use it.<br />
<br />
Here is a sample code-<br />
<br />
function	extern	start.user.data()<br />
{<br />
string	sdum<br />
sdum = start.session(MODAL_OVERVIEW, &quot;ttaad2500m000&quot;,  prog.name$, sdum )<br />
get.updated.info()<br />
execute(first.set)<br />
}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th October 2003, 09:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Np, I had already tried that, but received a compilation error 'modal_overview not declared'. That's what made me think it is maybe not supported in Baan 5(.0b).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">16th October 2003, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">NP, have you ever tried MODAL_OVERVIEW in Baan 5.0b? Anyone knows maybe if it used to work? And if there is another way to achieve overview mode in MODAL subsessions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">16th October 2003, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">En, I have been working on Reger-5.2 version from 2 years and worked on BaaN-5 series from 1998-2000, so I dont remember much if I used it then or not.<br />
<br />
I can say that the online library on the BaaN Board is very up to date with the Reger/Gemini versions, so everything might not work in the older versions. But I can suggest you some alternatives which you might explore more -<br />
<br />
wait.and.activate() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_processes_wait_and_activate) <br />
<br />
act.and.sleep() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_processes_act_and_sleep) <br />
<br />
activate() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_processes_activate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">20th October 2003, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried wait.and.activate(), but noticed the following two problems:<br />
1) The predefined variable 'background' stays on 0 in the called program, and the calling program does not 'wait' (like by 'MODAL' when the calling program is frozen till the child is exited).<br />
2) the zoom sections are not being called in the called program (I need to perform some actions in case zoom from the specific session).<br />
<br />
How come???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please post your source code here will make it easier to find the issue.<br />
1) The predefined variable 'background' stays on 0 in the called program, and the calling program does not 'wait' (like by 'MODAL' when the calling program is frozen till the child is exited).<br />
You can use the sleep() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_processes_sleep) command with the pid - current process id and then activate the other sessions, when you exit out of the other session then you can reactivate() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_processes_reactivate) it.<br />
2) the zoom sections are not being called in the called program (I need to perform some actions in case zoom from the specific session). <br />
I believe the before.program section is executed in the called program, if the background variable is not set, then you can trap from which is the calling program and then do some additional processing/checks etc.</div></div><hr />
