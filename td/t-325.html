<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a session that updates a table.  On the form I have a start date.  It was all working fine till I included the start date in the index.  Now I cannot enter data into the field.  I did not realise this would happen when adding the start date to the index.  Is this the case, or have I got something confihured incorrectly somewhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose you have checked the screen field properties yet and it allows inputs. Is it a session of maintainment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 13:55</div></div><div class="posttext">yes I also have an end date field and that works perfectly as did the start date before I added it to the index.  They are both input fields.<br />
<br />
Not sure why it does this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I suffered the same problem some months ago but I can't<br />
remember right now how I solved it. I'll have access to this old<br />
session in an hour, if I happen to remember then I'll contact you.<br />
<br />
Although, I think you'll not be able to change just the index<br />
preserving all the other fields displayed in that session.<br />
Why don't you create some auxiliar variables and a new record<br />
so you can save your data on those variables, delete the old<br />
record and later dump your data on the new one ?<br />
<br />
That's the best I can think before lunch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks TSanchez<br />
<br />
I have created another field, sequence number and based the index on that field and taken off the start date, just means the user will have to enter a sequence number now.<br />
<br />
If you do remember how you solved it please let me know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that I had lunch I see everything clearer. You just can't<br />
browse through several records, stop over the desired one<br />
and change its index. I think it would cause a conflict between<br />
the record current position and the position it should occupy<br />
due to its new index. I'm glad you finally found an alternate<br />
solution for this problem. I hope I've been of some help anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Read you soon.<br />
