<br />
Hello,<br />
as you said, it's an own dev. report. This is difficult to say where are the problem with your report.<br />
Try to analyse the DB performance with b-shell runtime debug options to see where the query spend the time.<br />
<br />
The trace file should show you the time consumption.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th August 2012, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also say check the indexes in both companies for the tables.  Using the debug options as bernd suggested will help.  Of course as also mentioned - the amount of data can also be the cause, especially if indexes are not used correctly. So you may want to make sure the data sets are about the same size.</div></div><hr />
