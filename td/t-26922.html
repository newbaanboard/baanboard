Just insert a new session and go from there. There is no 'generate session' session anymore.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">21st April 2006, 21:29</div></div><div class="posttext">True.  To further, it's been broken apart some.  When you insert a new session, you get many of the pieces from the original generator.  Including 'generate script' at this point. <br />
<br />
From the detail of Sessions (double click on your session), you can find the drop down option for Generate Reports, again very similar to the old options for that.<br />
<br />
The form gets created when you choose 'Edit Form' from the Session overview.  Obviously, you need the new Dynamic Forms Editor installed on your PC for that to work.  From there you choose &quot;Insert All Table Fields&quot; to get everything.  It has some intellegence.  If this is a report or update session, it will put the key fields as To / From ranges instead of the table fields.  Check the DFE help file for detailed explanations.</div></div><hr />
