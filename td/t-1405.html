<br />
Has anyone got a decent audit analysis script/report?<br />
<br />
I was looking for something that would show all records for a given key and also that would show records where a field changed to a given value.<br />
<br />

Or more end-user (unix system), create a filter-device (with ttstpconv) which executes a shell, in that shell you can filter the lines with a grep order like:<br />
cat $1 | fgrep -f /cgl/filtre.txt &gt; /tmp/filtrecgl<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">18th March 2002, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only done this subject theoretically, but I do remember there are two sessions (in BAAN IVc3) for printing audit logs: <br />
<br />
- Print Range of Audit Files                     (ttaad4461m000)<br />
- Print Range of Audit Files (Multi Lines) (ttaad4463m000)<br />
<br />
I was wondering if these would cover your requirement.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, if you wish to develop everything from scratch, the BAAN Tools on-line help gives very detailed information about the formats of the sequence files in which the audit data is stored, with the help of which it should be possible to create customized shell or 'awk' scripts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Originally I was printing to file and doing a grep - however my tdsls401 is creating 2 audit files a day!!!  That poses the problem of time and diskspace.<br />
<br />
Neither of the standard session allow you to define a a value that a field changes too, nor all enteries for a given key.<br />
<br />
I guess I will have to write my own - I was hoping not to have to reinvent the wheel so to speak.<br />

Thanks<br />
