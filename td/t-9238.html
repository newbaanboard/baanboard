<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We raise a sales order that has more than one line of the same item [these items are usually spare parts]. Each line of the same item has a different delivery address which corresponds to a machine to which the parts are fitted. All lines are shipped at the same time. The purpose of this is so that we can tell our customer by periodic report how much they have spent on each of their machines.<br />
<br />
However, on the sales invoice we only want to show one line per item, with the total quantity of the item shown. How do we achieve this by modifying the report layout or setup in some way? <br />
<br />
Normally the same item lines with have consecutive positions on the sales order - but there is a chance the order entry may not always achieve this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might want to change the sort sequence for the sales invoice to:<br />
inco, Ascending, 1<br />
tdsls045.orno, Ascending, 2<br />
tdsls041.item, Ascending, 3<br />
tdsls045.dino, Ascending, 4<br />
tdsls045.pono, Ascending, 5<br />
In addition, you need to make quite a few adjustments to the sales invoice layouts<br />
<br />
By doing it this way, you'd only change the appearance of the sales invoice without changing the standard sales invoicing business process in BaanIV<br />

You don't mean to have a new invoice number for each line. If this is the reqmt then you have to change the program script or do in some othe fashion. We are doing sales invoice by picking list.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">17th March 2003, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your suggestions - I will get and try them soon.  <br />
<br />
p.s. Arvind,  the requirement is to have one invoice line per item.<br />
<br />
example, if on the order it says:<br />
<br />
POS  ITEM       QTY<br />
<br />
10   ABC           1.0<br />
20   ABC           3.0<br />
<br />
And they are all delivered at the same time.<br />
<br />
I want 1 invoice line to say &quot;4.0   ABC      Â£XX.XX&quot;</div></div><hr />
