<br />
I've made a new table with a reference to tcmcs010. Now, when I use to fill the tabel via my Session, I get the BW Message:<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; Error: Unknown Reference from 'llsls010.ccty' to 'tcmcs010'<br />
&gt;&gt; Error: found 1 errors during scanning/parsing .. Stopped.<br />
&gt;&gt; Fatal error: Error 301 (Query not correct) on SELECT<br />
&gt;&gt; Fatal error: Can not continue in llsls0110m000 in DLL: ottstpstandard()<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I controlled my query and it's correct (it's a a BaaN-generated Session and script via Session ttadv1135m000). May I have to look to the tcmcs010-table?<br />
Does anybody know, what I have to do???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">26th July 2002, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Is your llsls010 table new?  If so, did you run a create runtime data dictionary (ttadv5210m000) on tcmcs010, too?  I've found that sometimes this is necessary if you have created a reference in another table (sometimes, it seems to be taken care of by using a wide open convert to runtime (ttadv5215m000).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lli-baan</div><div class="date">29th July 2002, 09:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried it and now it works. I thought I already made it, but I don't!!!<br />
<br />
Thanx!!!</div></div><hr />

any other ideas?<br />
I'm referencing in a new table the tiitm001.item field and after adding a new record on my new session and trying to tab to the second field I get the same error message..<br />
I'm almost convinced to do a manual query to bring the item description.. but it should work..<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You might also want to make sure that tiitm001 is not in shared memory, if so stop and restart shared memory - not an app manager so I am not sure if this is possible.  Also do not forget to logout of Baan, then back into Baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">24th February 2016, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">So what is it exactly? Is it rebooting the shared Memory through BW or through Unix ?  Or by either of them as it doesnt matter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">24th February 2016, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the shared memory on the server - essentially the table definition is still loaded there until you remove it and so you will continue to get the error 301 until you undertake that task.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So how does the system admin operate the shared memory manager, Through BW or through the OS ?<br />
<br />
Dont know in practise about Shared Memory Manager much. Havent used it .:confused:</div></div><hr />

Refer to the latest -<br />
Infor Enterprise Server Administration Guide<br />
Document code U8854O US<br />
Release 10.4<br />
Publication date December 12, 2014<br />
Chapter 19 Shared Memory<br />
The shared memory is a part of physical memory intended for common use. Programs communicate with each other through shared memory. Shared memory results in faster access to the components loaded in shared memory. To enhance the performance of your LN system, you can load program objects and report objects into the shared memory. Before you set up and initialize shared memory, you should verify that the hardware and internal memory is sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">25th February 2016, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Our system is quite old (and soon to be retired as we are moving to a different ERP product) being Baan IV on Windows, the shared memory manager is inside a server component called Baan NT Manager. Inside that the tool is Shared Memory Manager.<br />
You can unload domain &amp; table definitions using that instead of having to stop the service as a whole.</div></div><hr />
