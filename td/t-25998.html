The same thing for brp.close()<br />
<br />
We try with other report that have brp.open() and brp.close() and it works fine.<br />
<br />
Where we can see something?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />

rprt_open() --&gt; immediately opens ttstsplopen dialog; enter a device and continue --&gt; immediately opens the report; step by step shows that code in function main() is executed until r.main() is called --&gt; now rprt_open() returns and session and report run in parallel.<br />
<br />
=&gt; For your symptoms, I could only imagine that the report does a long action in the before.program section.<br />
<br />
=&gt; I remember that on our system rprt_open() in general was very slow, because $BSE/tmp had *lots* of files. This is because tempnam() limits.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">oK thank you. We go to clear $BSE/tmp to try if this is the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">But don't forget that you need these files to reprint reports!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, ok. Then I'll wait until this night to clear it.<br />
Thank you very much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">4th January 2006, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We've deleted the tmp files and now it print quickly. But we need to know if the counter of tmp files is in some table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuple9i</div><div class="date">5th January 2006, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, thought I would put in my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
I have a cleanup script that cleans up the %BSE%\tmp directory and removes temp files greater than 7 days old. That is arbitrary and could be changed to a smaller time period, but you have to be careful that you don't remove a temp file being used for a long running session (although I can't think of anything that should take longer than a day or so).<br />
<br />
If you want the script, holler and I will post it - although it is probably on the site somewhere else. I can't believe that I am the only one who scripts solutions to admin functions   :D</div></div><hr />

I also do not know if this removes the temp files.  Like tuple9i our UNIX admins clean out this tmp directory on a recurring basis.  Then once in a blue moon I run ttaad3221 to clean out the device queue table.</div></div><hr />
