<br />
Can i execute job from my 4gl program?<br />
<br />
On the click of button i want to execute job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What have you tried? Check this (http://baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=109184) thread for a way. Another way you can try is through AFS. Also, if on windows, you can create a task scheduler for the required job and then execute the task scheduler through your 4GL script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sachinbaan</div><div class="date">11th January 2017, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
My requirement is to merge three files in to one, i have one &quot;.exe&quot; which merges all 3 files in one file, i.e, 3 excel file in to 1 excel file (3 tabs).<br />
<br />
I used app_start() which executed on BECS, but i want to execute same on LN UI.<br />
<br />
I tried different functions like, run.prog(), but it is not working.<br />
<br />
So if i run the session using job, there won't be any LN UI specific problem.<br />
<br />
I wrote AFS but at the end of the program, the session which gets open using AFS is not closing hence, AFS is also not working, please check if there is anything wrong in AFS, I have attached code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th January 2017, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">My question is - if &quot;on a click of a button&quot; it executes a job - why does it have to be a job?  Why not let them click a button and it calls a library, a session or something else to combine the 3 files.  I think that might have been where Bhushan was going with the AFS, but I could be wrong.  I have not written any AFS code to run jobs - so not much help with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">12th January 2017, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure, but a shot in a dark would be - it's a permission issue. <br />
<br />
Few questions - <br />
<br />
1. Are you on Windows Server?<br />
2. How did you use run.prog()?<br />
3. Is the .exe executable to the everyone/all users?<br />
<br />
You can try passing the output to an error file and see if you can catching anything there. Calling an external utility through Baan/LN has always been more of a trial and error thing. It all depends on the implementation of the external utility.</div></div><hr />

@mark: i want to execute &quot;.exe&quot; which is working fine from BECS, but requirement is to execute same thing from LN UI and i am not getting any LN UI specific function to execute &quot;.exe&quot;, so if i do it using job there will be no question of LN UI.<br />
<br />
@Bhushan: <br />
<br />
1. Yes i am on windows server<br />
2. run.prog() : i have created a bat file and same path is been passed to the function, if same function i execute on BECS it executes properly, but on LN UI it gives return value as 0 (Success) but nothing is happening to the files.<br />
3. Yes, .exe is executable to every user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th January 2017, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking at the AFS code - on you baan version can you actually execute thru ttaad5500m000?  I know on my 4c4 session I would actually go straight to ttaad5203m000 and execute it there.  So my code would look something like below - what I am not sure of is after the continue I would have to wait for it to complete.  I know at times for my afs code I have to use suspend to get my code to pause to give the session I called time to complete cleanly.  Also I could not use the exec command for continue, but just copied your code.<br />
<br />
<br />
function extern tccom.runjob.execute.job(domain	tcmcs.str32 i.job)<br />
{<br />
	i.main.session = &quot;&quot;ttaad5203m000&quot;<br />
<br />
	stpapi.put.field(i.main.session, &quot;ttaad500.cjob&quot;, i.job)<br />
<br />
	o.return.value = stpapi.find(i.main.session, o.error.message)<br />
<br />
	if o.return.value = 1 then<br />
			stpapi.form.command(i.sub.session,  5, &quot;exec.cont.process&quot;, o.error.message)<br />
	endif<br />
	stpapi.end.session(i.main.session)<br />

I have written below afs code to execute job through session:<br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;ttaad5203m000&quot;, &quot;ttaad500.cjob&quot;,  f.job2)<br />

              ret = stpapi.find(&quot;ttaad5203m000&quot;, error)<br />

This code will execute session linked to job, but it goes to before.program/field section, but not going to continue option. Please Help?</div></div><hr />

My question is what do you mean it goes to before.program/field section section.  Is this code in another session?  so when you debug this code what is happening on each statement?</div></div><hr />

While doing AFS, you need to handle every message that pops up along the way properly, otherwise the program will hang. That might be the reason for why your AFS is hanging.

Can you see what code is being executed in the before program section before it jumps to print/continue?  Is there are variable or something that is not getting set thru using AFS process.  I know before I had to set some variables in my code - then use qkey (source extension) to get the variables imported into the called program before it would work.  Not sure if that is the case here or not.</div></div><hr />

There is a big difference between the Business Requirements vs Technical Design. The business/end users do not tell you how to Design the Solution, to use exe's, functions or DLL's etc. but the Technical Lead/Architect does. <br />
