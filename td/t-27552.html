It seems like you are modifying a report script. Please post your report script so that it it is easy to track the error.Most probably your are missing a subsection declaration.<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

<br />
There seems to be no problem with your report script. I vaguely remember facing such a problem some time back. I would suggest you to follow steps below,<br />
<br />
1. Create backup of your existing report script.(Very Important)<br />
2. Delete the existing report script &amp; create a new report scipt(blank).<br />
3. Start copying small sections(10-12 lines forming logical set) of script from your backup report script to the newly created report script, Compile simultaneously till error occurs.<br />
<br />
In my case , it was a unnoticable character which was accidentally typed in the script. The character(i think it was a single quote ') was missed by me and was caught only after this painful exercise.<br />
<br />
Your script apparently doesnt seem to have the character but there is no harm in trying above method.<br />
<br />
Let us know your findings and start hunting :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are all the programmed sections (i.e. before.gbb035.brnd.1 etc) in fact also existing report layouts? <br />
Are you sure no relevant files have been removed/adjusted on disk?<br />
<br />
And last but not least: If I understand correctly, this is regarding an exisiting report which worked fine until your last modifications. Can you please post us your exact modifications?</div></div><hr />
