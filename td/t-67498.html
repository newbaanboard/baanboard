<br />
I've changed an Infor Report by adding a &quot;question&quot; (ask.enum (&quot;question titel&quot;, yesno.no)) before starting the printing. <br />
It works in my development environment but after deploying it to the user. They get the following error as shown in the screen shot. Is there something special I have to consider? Like privileges, compiling or deliverying also these questions (but they are stored in Company &quot;000&quot;)?<br />

The fatal error doesn't seem to relate the Question usage in the report. Are you sure the fatal error occurs due to the question code? Is the domain properly set? Debug your report to verify where exactly the fatal error appears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for fast reply. Meanwhile I've found the reason.<br />
We create a Project for any Change. After the Report Change we make a package for this Project an distribute it to the user VRCs. <br />
But when I analyzed the error I found the question was not part of the package. <br />
So I created the &quot;question&quot; manually in the User VRCs. <br />
Afterwards the Report run as it should.<br />
<br />
Sorry for not answering imedately.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Bernd</div></div><hr />
