<br />
I need to know if exists any best practice when I have to use the commit.transaction() instruction, As far as if I know open severals &quot;for update&quot; when I use commit.transaction() all &quot;for update&quot; are closed, but sometimes this isn't work fine for me, becuase I need to do it for each table.<br />
<br />
The solution is sending commit.transation in the end, but is it correct?<br />
<br />
If I process a lot information and only at the end send commit exists any problem?<br />
<br />
what should I do in this case?<br />
<br />
Thank's</div></div><hr />

<br />
Size of database transactions<br />
Problem<br />
<br />
For optimal performance, database transactions must not be too small and not too large. However they must always be logical transactions.<br />
Large transactions will also have relatively long locking times. Depending on the frequency of updates done by other users, this can cause locking problems.<br />
Other problems can also occur, for example, run-time tools (bshell, driver, and so on) consume more memory and CPU, more rollback segments are needed in the RDBMS.<br />
<br />
Transaction management<br />
It is recommended that transaction management is in the 4GL GUI script. The reasons are:<br />
Printing and raising questions relates very much with transaction management. <br />
For customization, possibly only the UI / 4GL script must be changed and not the lower layers (DLLs, DALs, INTDLLs). Commit.transaction() in the generic functions of lower layers will disturb transaction management. <br />
Foreign applications define logical transactions in the foreign application, which may not be disturbed by commit.transaction() in a lower layer.<br />
<br />
Database handling<br />
A good Functional Design and a good Data model are prerequisites for error free code.<br />
Some ideas to think about:<br />
Are relations normalized ? <br />
Is the naming of tables and table fields logical ? <br />
Is the naming of tables and table fields in line with other modules, packages (e.g. a table should be named Purchase Parameters instead of Purchase Configuration or Purchase Setup) <br />
Is the primary key really unique (a UTC date, time domain is not unique even when expressed in milliseconds). <br />
Transaction management (database) must be correctly implemented, this means that:<br />
You must know that Transaction management is typically performed by the standard program (BaanERP: 4GL Engine) (Session type maintain) or in the GUI script (Session Type print&amp;script type 4, update&amp;script type 4), and where the standard program defines the retry.point and places the commit, and when the programmer must handle it, based on its environment, performance and so on. <br />
You must know what a logical transaction is, and what can be separated. For example, if a function returns goods to a warehouse and closes a project, the return of goods may be successful and closing is allowed to fail. In this case, apparently two logical transactions exist. <br />
Code works with retries, think of variable values, printing to reports, and so on. <br />
User interaction within database transactions is forbidden. Also zooms, suspends, or process communication (in general scheduling caused functions) are not allowed due to the bshell CPU bonus ticks functionality. <br />
Wildcards in select lists should be prevented as much as possible. <br />
Technically it is possible to use db statements (e.g. db.update instead of dal.update) in BaanERP , however if the session relates to a DAL with checks and related actions they are not performed. So db.statements can be used when: <br />
No DAL is present for that session <br />
Performance is at stake and you are absolutely sure that no checks or related actions exist and will ever exist on the fields you update e.g. a description. <br />
Recursion could take place <br />
Records of the same table are with checks interconnected <br />
When you neglect the rules the effects are huge, table relations can be missing (e.g. no warehouse orders created for a production order), illegal input in the database etc. <br />
It is not allowed to use db.next/gt etc in BaanERP. The use of SQL is mandatory, because SQL is more powerful, offers better readability, gives better performance for level 2 driver which results in less calls in Baan software. <br />
Since database records are often stored in global variables, a select within a select may corrupt the values of the first one. You can work around this, using the following order of preferred solutions:<br />
Binding/aliasing, change the function <br />
On main table, change the calling <br />
Save the record pointer, change the calling <br />
Set oriented, using function sum()</div></div><hr />
