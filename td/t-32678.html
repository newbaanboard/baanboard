I have got an issue which says that session performance is very unpredictable like sometimes It works fine and sometimes It takes a huge time may be whole one day.<br />
It says that updates are done to the early in the processing, but the Oracle cycles continue for a long time after the updates are complete.<br />
So can you please suggest me how to go ahead for analyzing such issue and If you could share some document to analyze such performance related issue then that would be very much helpful to me.<br />
[Session is customized one but uses only standard functions and dlls]....<br />
Sytem details are as follows:<br />
BaaN IV C4<br />
Unix<br />
Oracle<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
