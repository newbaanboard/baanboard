The error is in the log file that the baan generates when uploading the table. They have told me that if they are between different servers, this does not work, is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th December 2022, 23:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not done between database versions - I have exported tables on production server using |'s and imported to a different company on our test servers. Depending on what I was doing - 1 table or multiple tables I would complete the pattern matching on form 2 for table names.  I do not recall the error I would get if I did not get everything lined up correctly.  But I would always use | delimited files.  In my case I always made sure the table exist in development company and was usable.  I typically did this only on home grown tables, but should work on baan seeded tables also.</div></div><hr />
