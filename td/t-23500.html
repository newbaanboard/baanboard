<br />
Is there anyway, I can have attachements to the Baan sessions like Fixed Asset master and have their jpeg associated to it.<br />
<br />
I must point out here that my company does not want a third party product but wishes some customisation (there are only 2-tables/ session that require this functionality).<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be surely helpful. Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st March 2005, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Search this forum for attachments.  There have been several posts on this and how people accomplished the task.  It seems to me one method was a button that would launch the associated application and pull up drawings or even JPG's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ash_ruh</div><div class="date">22nd March 2005, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I have checked the forum for attachements but there ain't any, though a lot is discussed on the e-mail functionality. <br />
<br />
About the button funtionality to launch the associated application, are you referring to the product from Nazdaq?<br />
<br />
Would be helpful if anyone can help me in this regard.<br />

<br />
look for app_start, it gives you the functionality to start an external application(like WORD, EXCEL, IE) from Baan.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd March 2005, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">As nikos1 stated app_start is the way to do this.  The search was a little tougher than I thought - this is one post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7407).  Another search on &quot;word document&quot; turned up other posts, but most of the threads centered around app_start or run.prog.<br />

<br />
We have something similar to this and we have managed it in Baan IV c4. We have a session customized in Baan quality management system (QMS). This is for calibration history. <br />
<br />
After calibration of an instrument on a given date the calibration sheet is scanned and uploaded to a seperate system other than the server or client as an acrobat file. This uploading is done by one person and the naming criteria for the file name is set as the instrument name (underscore) and the date of the document.<br />
<br />
Later on any user having access to this session in Baan can go to the record and mark the record and click on the button available. The system then copies the acrobat file corresponding to the record selected to the local machine and then opens the acrobat file in the client system.<br />
<br />
We have implemented this 6 months back and working fine and were able to reduce paper wastage and avoid manual filing and maintenance of paper in this area. The document is also now available to all users having a Baan access online. This was a good improvement and appreciated by the users of Baan.<br />
<br />
I have given the sessions dump and the code that is used for the same. Hope this will be of help to many. Baan has got a lot of functionality, but it needs to be explored. The first session is for upload and the second is for viewing the data from any client machine.<br />
<br />
Please let me know your views on the same. Any clarifications please let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
John Mathew.</div></div><hr />
