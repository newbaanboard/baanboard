ttstpq0111<br />
Save difference between entered date and system date?<br />
<br />
If you say yes and have put a date of &quot;+5&quot; then it will save the default of 'today +5' rather than the exact date displayed when defaults are saved.<br />
<br />
Problem is, in a custom session I have created it doesn't ask and saves the exact date entered.  I've looked in the form field definition and it looks the same as the standard session that works.  What am I missing?</div></div><hr />

It does save the date in defaults but it hardcodes the date entered - not the difference from system date.</div></div><hr />
