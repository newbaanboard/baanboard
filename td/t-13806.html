<br />
I need to refresh a session in program script, but a different session, not the current one, nor a parent or child.<br />
<br />
I.e. <br />
- Session a, b, c<br />
- a is zooming to b [so in b the predefined variable parent indicates the pid of a]<br />
- then b zooms to c, and c imports the pid of a. <br />
- Then c closes b through kill(parent), then updates data, then closes itself (execute(end.program). But before leaving c (end.program), I want c to refresh a (because c updates data currently displayed in a).<br />
<br />
In refresh() I can pass the window_id as an argument. Which value is the window_id, it is not the same as the process_id, is it? So, I would need to import the window_id of a into c, instead of the process_id.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />

Try refresh.parent(-1)  <br />
<br />
if that doesnt work -<br />
<br />
use - refresh()  (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_char_b_win_refresh) <br />
<br />
You can get the window id from -<br />
<br />
pstat(pid, progname, info)<br />
winid = ps.mwin(info)<br />
<br />
You can also check the function - wrebuild()  (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_char_b_win_wrebuild) <br />
<br />
0 All windows are refreshed. <br />
1 The screen is cleared and all windows are rebuilt.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your suggestions. <br />
<br />
However, non of them worked for me :eek: <br />
<br />
- Refresh.parent(-1) : no result<br />
- Refresh(winid) fetched by pstat() with ps.mwin(info) didn't work.<br />
- Wrebuild(0) : didn't work<br />
- wrebuild(1) : didn't work<br />
<br />
I don't understand though why refresh(winid) didn't do anything. I have never really tried using refresh for a different process, but it doesn't seem to work well. Anybody experiences with that??</div></div><hr />

I am guessing you are zooming from a field, then you can try to explore using -<br />
<br />
after.zoom:<br />
The actions programmed in this subsection are executed when the zoom process on a specified field ends. You can use this subsection, for example, to redisplay any field that has changed as a result of the zoom process. <br />
<br />
<br />
field.abc:<br />
after.zoom:<br />
     execute(first.set)<br />
|* or try refresh() here</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not zooming from a field. I am zooming from both session a -&gt; b and b -&gt; c via form-command (Specific/Form button).<br />
<br />
Have you ever used refresh for a session different from the executing session?? Logically it should work, because I do get the win_id passed along the sessions (from  session a till c) but just the command refresh(winid) doesn't seem to do anything...<br />
<br />
This is quite important for me...<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
Refer to the link - Section for Form Commands? (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9569&amp;highlight=choice.zoom) <br />
<br />
Then you can use a refresh() in the after.zoom section.<br />
<br />
Else, if you can try to use the form command options and 2nd form tab execution -</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">NP, Thanks for your attempt to help, but my whole problem is that when session b is still active, the data of session a has not yet been updated. The updating of the data for session a is done by session c only after session b has been killed by session c. <br />
<br />
I am including the piece of code that handles it. <br />
<br />
<br />
zoom.from.tssoc2121s000:		<br />
on.entry:<br />
	get.screen.defaults()<br />
	from.service = true<br />
	import(&quot;winid&quot;, service.winid)<br />
	import(&quot;tssoc220.orno&quot;, service.orno)<br />
	import(&quot;tssoc220.lino&quot;, service.pono)<br />
|	message(&quot;service window: %s&quot;, service.winid)<br />
	runnumber = &quot;SC&quot;<br />
	oorg.f = whinh.oorg.service<br />
	oorg.t = whinh.oorg.service<br />
	orno.f = service.orno<br />
	orno.t = service.orno<br />
	pono.f = service.pono<br />
	pono.t = service.pono<br />
	pradvice = tcyesno.no<br />
	prshortage = tcyesno.yes<br />
	display(&quot;runnumber&quot;)<br />
	display(&quot;oorg.f&quot;)<br />
	display(&quot;oorg.t&quot;)<br />
	display(&quot;orno.f&quot;)<br />
	display(&quot;orno.t&quot;)<br />
	display(&quot;pono.f&quot;)<br />
	display(&quot;pono.t&quot;)<br />
	fill.order.prio()<br />
	kill(parent)<br />
	execute(user.2)	<br />
|	first.window(service.winid)<br />
	refresh(service.winid)<br />
|	wrebuild(0)<br />
	execute(end.program)	<br />
<br />
this is in session whinh4200m000 (process outbound). I am zooming here from serviceorders-material-costs (tssoc2120s000). The entire warehousing part is  done automatically by hitting the button from tssoc2120s000. <br />
<br />
Technically I must close (kill) tssoc2120s000 before processing the outbound, so that's why I use kill(parent) before processing outbound. I need to refresh the session a, which is session tssoc2520m000, the overview session of material-costs. I need the delivered quantity to be updated with the new value. The window_id is correctly passed on from the parent session. However, the refresh(service.winid) doesn't seem to do anything. I also tried using wrebuild(0), wrebuild(1) and refresh.parent(-1) and even first.window(service.winid). No result so far...<br />
<br />
Would still appreciate very much an idea for resolution. Maybe I can achieve the desired issue in a different way??<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
