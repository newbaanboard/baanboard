I have finished designing automatic PO matching in LN. Earlier, I did the same customization in Baan IV. There are two routes- using AFS and other is using tfacpdll0060 which takes XML input. and both of them have their own intricacies. I designed it using third route of knowing what tables and GL accounts get hit and how to look for them. The PO matching is a simple process as it needs registering of invoice and then matching it to receipt.  Once I match the invoice, standard Baan session of Approving takes care of it. In Baan IV I had designed the approving part too. <br />
<br />
This customization can take a PO invoices through a file and match  all of them in same batch. <br />
My experience in Baan IV and ERP ln, is that LN is little easier to program as  DAL takes care of some part of business logic. <br />
I thought of sharing this. <br />
This forum have been very helpful to me and I thanks to all of the members here.<br />
