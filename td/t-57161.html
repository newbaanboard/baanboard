We customized Purchase Order report to meet with company requirement. The customized report is ok but we having a problem when the printing page is more than 1. The next page will be skip in 1 line and the problem clearly shown when we have a PO for more than 2 pages because the 3rd page will be skipping for 2 lines. Because of that the PO total is not printed in the preprinted form box for the total.<br />
<br />
We are using Epson LQ2180 printer and nothing wrong with the printer setting.<br />
<br />
Please advise how for me to resolve the printing issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
seems the settings paper-length of printer (no of lines) and these of your report are different.<br />
<br />
if lines for printer are set to 64, the number of report lines should be the same !<br />
<br />
