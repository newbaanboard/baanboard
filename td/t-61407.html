<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ailisee</div><div class="date">31st October 2011, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish to customize a report from a LN standard report, but the field i need to set as GROUP (before.field) is not the input field of the standard report, tried to insert it at input field but the field didn't show in the report.<br />
<br />
my scenario is:<br />
<br />
1. Duplicate a standard report &lt;tfacr243813000&gt; to a new customize report.<br />
2. Add in field &quot;tfacr200.dim1&quot; in &lt;Report Input Fields&gt;, and set it to &quot;Presorted&quot;.<br />
3. Set field &quot;tfacr200.dim1&quot; as &quot;Before.Field&quot;, insert the field in report layout.<br />
4. Add the report to be printed from session &lt;tfacr2438m000&gt;.<br />
4. Run the report, &quot;tfacr200.dim1&quot; not show in report. <br />
<br />
We don't have license for viewing and amending the session script, so, i am guessing whether the field &quot;tfacr200.dim1&quot; is not selected from the print session script, thus, it can't be shown and set as before.field in the report?<br />
<br />
In this case, how should i do to amend this standard report for grouping the report by tfacr200.dim1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">31st October 2011, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - it can be done.  See performance dll (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=28569) or this this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=55850&amp;highlight=Add+sort+fields+reports) - post by me. Never really used the performance DLL and the one we used here is not exactly the easiest to work out. In my case we had to look up a field, add to report datafile, resort the file and then print it.  Not easy to do.<br />
<br />
Seems like there was another solution somewhere, but I did not see it.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
you can choose every(!) table field as input field, so that's not the point.<br />
 <br />
If the session does not support (fill) that field, one typical work-around is to read the data within the report. That is done very often. But sometimes it can be very tricky, e.g. if you want to sort on such a field. In that cases see my thread &quot;advanced report customization&quot; already noted by mark.<br />
