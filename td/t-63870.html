<br />
I found this forum http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=8357  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=55395)about the same problem which I am facing. But with a few add-on's.<br />
<br />
What is the problem?<br />
<br />
I have created a new session, which is at the Sales Order Lines Specific.<br />
It imports the values like tdsls400.orno,pono,seqn,pric and displays in my session.<br />
User needs to enter a few additional details against these fields.<br />
I have a company 700. When I try to run this session in the same company, everything goes well.<br />
<br />
But when I try the same session with same script, everything same, but its says &quot;Record Already Exists!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I have gone through whole forum as mentioned above and made the changes accordingly but nothing helps. I have done a CRDD on my session, and on my table as well.<br />
<br />
I had 2 indexes and have deleted 1, but the problem is still there.<br />
<br />
Except company 700, the problem is seen in every other company.<br />
<br />
I am stuck and confused! Is this a kind of bug or something?<br />
<br />
Please Help!!</div></div><hr />

When you run it in another company run it in debug mode and before the update or insert make sure the record is not there.  Go into table maintenance or LN equivalent to make sure the record is not there.  These other companies are not sharing this table with company 700?  Thought I would ask since we just had a situation where one company thought the table was in another company on the same server.  Had to specify this table was in the same company - I think during the refresh this setup piece got lost.</div></div><hr />
