<br />
does anyone have experience with connecting a web site to a baan server. I would like to create some web pages for the customer information, e.g. order status, or sales functions in the next step.<br />
Is there a chance to connect to the baan backend server? What about using Java? Or Webservices? <br />
At the moment we are running the old baan esales system. We want to change to an open platform website, so I think the old bois are not going to run anymore. <br />
I have got the examples for Java Code, but they are not running at our system. We do have bck, but I donÂ’t know how to use it.<br />
Any ideas welcome!!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks, Thomas</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basicly you can use all your knowledge that you probably allready have about baan (developing). With webtop you can access baan via a browser. Create some simple sessions that deliver the information you need, build a menu assign it to the user -&gt; ready?<br />

Thanks for your Information. Do you think it is possible to embed webtop sites to other websites? I need to connect from the web to baan for our customers. <br />

Yes, we know Openworld from another project 2 years ago, I can remember that it is really hard to use, isn't it. I don't know the new version, only the pretty old one. And we are looking for something like freeware...<br />

I am not sure if sockets work in your Baan Version. Refer to the link - Interprocess communication (cross-platform) overview (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_interprocess_communication_cross_platform_overview) for more information. You can write some socket programs listening on certain ports and the external programs can read/write at that port. <br />
<br />
Note -  Sockets are not supported in all the BaaN versions. You have to test the latest OW software compatible for your BaaN version.</div></div><hr />

However you probably want to use the full screen/new window because of all the data. (Menu and application are in one window)<br />
Furthermore webtop on IVc is not for free (as far as I know).<br />

<br />
Which Database are u using as backend for baan.<br />
<br />
why don't u go for web development in Java and then what ever info u need you can connect to backend thru JDBC and fetch info from baan on the web pages.<br />
<br />
i woked on one same scenario where the e catalog was java based web pages and for placing orders or tracing their order status or other payment related details, JDBC connectivity was done and then info was fetched from Baan and was displayed on website.<br />

I have worked with tool developed from Fullscope. It allows to call Baan DLL from their ERP adpater (which is Java based). One can also write Baan SQL statement and it will nto use any Baan License. Its a pretty nice tool. I woukd prefer to Open world an day. I think OPen world will consume Baan License.</div></div><hr />
