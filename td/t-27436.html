I have a question on how to write a BaaN SQL statment that will allow a group by on item, sum(qty), sort by sum(qty) desc and select only the top 'N' rows.  I have been unable to make this sql work.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your assistance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't think of a way to write it in one query, because you cannot group on the calculated sum-field, therefor you can not sort correctly, and nor can you then set N records to be fetched (since you don't fetch them in the right order).<br />
<br />
So alternatively I suggest:<br />
a) if this is for reporting purposes, then just fetch all the records, and sort the report fields correctly [i.e. sum(qty) = desc 1, item = asc 2 etc], and check with a counter if the maximum nr. records have been reached, and set attr.input = false. <br />
b) if you need this for displaying on a form or so, then I would recommend to use a temp-table in which you store the desired records. You then display the records of the temp table onto the form..<br />
<br />
Let me know if this is satisfactory for your requirements..<br />
<br />

I'll try to use the method of examining the records as they are passed to the report handler and not printing once I have received the specfied number of records.:)</div></div><hr />
