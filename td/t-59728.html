             I have created a main session in Baan V. I can able to run the session by right clicking it and clicking on &quot;Start Session&quot; but however when i tried to run it through &quot;Run Command&quot; its not allowing me to run the session and a message has been thrown &quot;Session can be only activated via other session&quot;.<br />
<br />
I really dont know whats the problem is, Please try to resolve it.</div></div><hr />

On baan iv there is checkbox that must be checked to make it a main session. This could be different in baan 5.</div></div><hr />

           Yes we have checked the check box &quot;Main Session&quot; in Baan V while generating the session. But after that we made some changes to the forms and to the session. Then we compiled it also, after that only its not getting invoked from the Run Command.<br />
<br />
So I then called the session &quot;Create Runtime Data Dictionary&quot;(ttadv5210m000) and created runtime for this session. Now the problem is resolved and I can able to run the session in Run Command.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your response Mark.<br />
Thanks for all who have visited this thread.</div></div><hr />
