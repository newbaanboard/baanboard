<br />
We are havin a session to export some data from baan to excel. There is a string field of length 3 called &quot;Revision Number&quot; in our report. The excel file is delimited by pipe (|) symbol. When we delimit (text to column) this file the leading zeros of field &quot;Revision Number&quot; gets truncated. We want the record in excel must be as it is in baan table.<br />
<br />
Example: Revision No. in BaaN table is 001, 010 etc. but in excel it's showing as 1, 10 respectively. We want the output as 001, 010 in excel.<br />
<br />
Quick response would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is a feature of excel (automagically formatting the imported data).<br />
You have to declare the column as &quot;text&quot;, then leading zeros will be kept.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">23rd July 2010, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you are manually 'importing' the data into EXCEL, Norbert's suggestion is better - mark each column and specify what type it should be.<br />
<br />
But the following will also work - but requires you to modify your session: if you enclose the field which has leading zeroes with a =&quot; and &quot;, then the leading zeros will be 'preserved'. <br />
<br />
For example, if your output file is as follows:<br />
<br />
=&quot;001&quot;| 001<br />
=&quot;A001&quot;| A001<br />
<br />
This has two columns. Save this as a text file and try your 'import' steps on it.</div></div><hr />
