<br />
My problem is this that User wants if in one shipment, only one item is there with multiple lines. Then only one line should be printed with all the values clubbed. And if there are two items with multiple lines then only 2 line should be printed.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if anybody can help me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st June 2011, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - so you have a report that prints all the individual lines.  All you need to do is move the layout from like the detail layout to an after.item(or some other sort field) layout.  Make the qty a total field.  Of course without knowing the report I cannot talk about what needs to be done.  You just need to figure out the correct place in the report to put the new layout.  Then once that is done you can disable the detail layouts.</div></div><hr />

First of all thanks for the reply. <br />
Actually what exactly the user wants is this that, if in a sales schedule there ar 5 lines suppose.<br />
Now 3 line are of item A, and the remaining two of B.<br />
Printout required is such that A should be printed once and B should be printed once too. with the corresponding data.<br />
<br />
I hope that i was able to explain it in a better way.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

             What you can do is , go to report layouts and duplicate detail layout as After.field and Insert item as field Name and delete your detail layout.that's it.<br />

Yes - but you need to add a sort by item onto the report.  Then you can add an after.field layout onto the report.</div></div><hr />
