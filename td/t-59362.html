<br />
See if anyone can feedback on whats going on here. I would appreciate it.<br />
<br />
We're testing out MSSQL 2008 R2 with MS Server 2008 SP2 with porting set 86a03.<br />
<br />
I installed it and forgot that my windows user installation account had no password while the LN user has a password. Both are the same usernames.<br />
<br />
So when I changed the Windows user account password to match my LN user account, it gave me the following errors. This is kinda of the first time working with MS Windows 2008, so we've seen a ton of errors turn up due to the wrong porting set and the MSSQL 2005 Backward Compatibility. I'm hoping this was just a mistake due to my user accounts being out of sync instead of LN FP6 not being compatible in this environment.<br />
<br />
Or is there some permissions or something like that i've left out. This is meant to be a workgroup server and not part of an Active Directory.</div></div><hr />
