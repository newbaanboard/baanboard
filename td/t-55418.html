I have a mantain session which has a date as part of the sorting index. The user wants to use that index to look at the data but, also wants to be able change the date, which is greyed out (which is normal). I am trying to find out a work around.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th March 2009, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there an index where date is not part of it?  Maybe let them change the index, then change the date.  I have never tried this - usually I make them zoom out to change index fields with a sub-session(only had to do that maybe once or twice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">19th March 2009, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, there are several indexes but, none of them will give them the sort they need, only the one by date. But now that you've mentioned to zoom to another session. That could be an idea, where they can select the records by the order they want and then zoom to a sub session with only those records.<br />
<br />
I'll see.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

Setting pre-defined variable modify.prim.key to true users can modify the key values .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I put it on the before program section, init form section and works fine once. When I refresh the form, I believe is reset it back to false and no more updates to that field can be done. Where is the best place to set this variable up?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Earlier long back I had set a trace on this . If i recollect right , it was some display section setting  it false .So I had set it right there . Further before.modify.set also is  a right choice to place this assignment .</div></div><hr />
