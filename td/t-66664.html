<br />
We are planning on updating from BaanIVc4 to InforLN10.3. I have a few questions maybe some of you can answer.<br />
<br />
1 - I've seen something in the menu calles Workbench application - What is it and how does it work?<br />
2 - Are the texts handled the same way in InforLN than in BaanIV?<br />
3 - We built Excel load with AFS calls within VBA in Excel in BaanIV. Connection to BaanIV is done through the BW client. With InforLN, we will be using WebUI or Ming.le (Sharepoint) for end users to login, users won't have BW to login anymore, how will this work? Will it work?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alternate way to develop components through WebUI/Ming.le since some of the standard development sessions (still available in worktop) are not as robust in the web-based interfaces.<br />
<br />
2 - Are the texts handled the same way in InforLN than in BaanIV?<br />
<br />
Yes, text numbers stored in table fields linked to tttxt001/002/010.  Migrating texts is one of the trickiest part of data migration.<br />
<br />

3 - We built Excel load with AFS calls within VBA in Excel in BaanIV. Connection to BaanIV is done through the BW client. With InforLN, we will be using WebUI or Ming.le (Sharepoint) for end users to login, users won't have BW to login anymore, how will this work? Will it work?<br />
<br />
Instead of using VBA from Excel to perform the AFS (which requires BECS), I have developed new sessions to handle the functionality directly or using AFS in LN after reading the spreadsheet on the client.  Session asks for spreadsheet location/name, converts it to .CSV (can be done with one or multiple tabs), sends it to the server, reads the text file and performs operations that were previously done from the VBA script.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tools are available for data transfer from 5c or lower versions of LN to the current LN version.  Baan4 to LN is more difficult since the table structure is so different - less available to migrate from Baan4 but the target table is often different.</div></div><hr />
