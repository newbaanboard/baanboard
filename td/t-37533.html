I create a report with some amounts fields.<br />
When I choose the &quot;D&quot; device, the amounts fields (details and sums) are rigth aligned. But when I chose a &quot;PDF&quot; device, theses same amounts are left aligned in the PDF file...<br />
The tool I use to convert from ERP ln to PDF format is a convertor released by SSA and called in a 3GL script linked to the device:<br />
the command is:<br />
run.app = &quot;java -cp ${BSE}/java/xml-apis.jar:${BSE}/java/ssa-bml.jar:${BSE}/java/xercesImpl.jar com.ssaglobal.bml.BMLConverter PDF &quot; &amp; &quot;${BSE}/tmp/Fileout.&quot; &amp; str.num &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; local.path<br />
<br />
A this time, I managed to left align the amounts by creating a report script and making a conversion like this (example):<br />
domain leftalignstring amount.str<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
amount.str = str$(amount)<br />
where amount.str is a report field rigth aligned (in the report editor)...<br />
I'm not really satisfied with this solution, because I must realise manually then sums on all amounts...<br />
<br />
Does anybody knows if a simple solution exists?<br />
Thanks for all ;)</div></div><hr />

i don't have an answer for but I am very interested to know what exactly you are doing there. I mean calling java an all that! Please share with us your secrets! I'm sure I'm not the only one, who finds this interesting :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

:D  hum.... I was looking for help only :p <br />
I didn't personnaly made this development, so I can only give a global explanation:<br />
* I use a device PDF with a 3GL attached (script provided by SSA) and containing the code I wrote in quote mode.<br />
* SSA provided the java classes listed in the line (Standard java like &quot;xml-apis.jar&quot;, &quot;xercesImpl.jar&quot; and custom java &quot;ssa-bml.jar&quot;).<br />
* The tmp file generated by the report (in xml format) is copied (in the 3GL) in the spool.out file.<br />
* And then, this file is converted with the java classes...<br />
Unfortunally, I don't have info on the source code of this classes (in particular the SSA java class). So I can only give principles... ;)</div></div><hr />
