I assume the problem you posted has to do with the marked blocks which are printed twice.  Did you verify your report layouts, are you sure this information is not stated on two different layout lines in your report?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freeppy</div><div class="date">23rd September 2009, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,jpadders<br />
    Pls see the attachment ,the report layout is this,pls help.Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">23rd September 2009, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you state me in which layout the payment terms are located, as multiple orders can be printed within the same report I would put this section in the after orno section. As I'm currently on Baan IV I don't have the exact tables available. Check the standard report to determine on which LN field the order break is set!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freeppy</div><div class="date">23rd September 2009, 09:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, jp.aalders  <br />
   the payment terms are located the table tcmcs013.dsca(Terms of Payment).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">23rd September 2009, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi freepy, I know where the payment terms are located but that's not what I ment.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
- Go the the standard purchase order report from Infor<br />
- Check in which layout in this report the totals are presented ( fi. after.orno.10 )<br />
- Use the same field and layout line in your custom report to present your payments<br />
  conditions and remarks.<br />
 <br />
It is not recommended to put remarks of payment conditions in the after.report because you could print multiple purchase orders in the same report, this would cause to print the payment details and remarks only for the last order.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
<br />
