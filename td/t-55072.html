<br />
I am attempting to configure and test application studio 8.5.  I have set up all the connections and am able to create a development environment, application, and project.  However, when I go to create an activity, it requires and assignee, and I have nothing in the list that comes up for assignees.  Even if I try it without sharing, it won't assign the owner since the owner is not in the assignee list either.  Has anyone ran into this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

And even then, it is not needed to specify an assignee, because the activity owner is an assignee by default.</div></div><hr />

It apparently still looks for the assignee list to be populated so that the owner of the activity can be populated as the assignee for the activity, and the list is not being populated at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">19th February 2009, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">That's where the problem is; without having an assignee, the finish button is not available, so I can't create the activity.  I have an inquiry submitted to see if there's a bug or I missed something in setup.  I was just hoping that someone on BB might have experienced something similar.  Thanks for the quick responses!<br />
