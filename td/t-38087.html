I want to restrict the no. of users simultaneously running a customised session.<br />
I'm thinking of achieving this by keeping track of users in a table or file and then checking this values before starting the session.<br />
<br />
Is there any other direct way of achieving this?<br />
<br />

You can use the application lock.<br />
functions appl.set(...) and app.delete(...)<br />
(tables ttadv998, ttadv997)<br />

Thanks for your reply. However im looking for functionality wherein only a selected no. of users (&gt; 1) can execute the session. In the appl.set() only one user will be allowed , im looking to restrict only 5 users from simultaneously running the session.(if sixth person tries to execute session he shouldnt be allowed to do so)<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

<br />
storing the user in a field of the table processed would only work if you cleared this filed whenever the user finishes the session - and if this table contains many records, you will have to read all of them to count the &quot;uncleared&quot; user fields (giving the number of sessions active atm).<br />
If you have the date as a keyfield, this might be okay, but I tend to use a seperate &quot;lock&quot;-table in similar cases. When a user starts the session, you count the records here, if less than five, create a new record and allow further processing, otherwise exit (perhaps showing the active usernames).<br />
On exit after processing delete the entry in the locktable.<br />

<br />
This is precisely what i've done now and it works fine.<br />
However in cases of network problems when the connection is lost the record is not flushed (similar to standard record locks - session ttstpdellocks)<br />
<br />
I was wondering whether there is any direct method to find the no. of users actually using the session at any given time.<br />
<br />
I have also tried bshcmd6.1 , but it is very slow (there are 100 users in my system an any given time) and also found out that it is unreliable.<br />
