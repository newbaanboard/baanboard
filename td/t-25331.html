<br />
Is there a function or any other way I can import session/report dumps ? (like ttiex1285m000 does)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">just for my understanding: in what way does it have to differ from ttiex1285m000? What is wrong with ttiex1285?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 10:29</div></div><div class="posttext">1) I will be able to import more than 1 dump in 1 click<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">So use AFS... Of course, I must warn you that especially with tools sessions you should be prepared to deal with unexpected problems using AFS, but it's for sure worthwhile trying...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I know a little bit about ASF. I will give it a try...Do you know where can I find more information about this topic?<br />
<br />
So there is no function or internal command to do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<br />
I don't know of any function to be used. But I think anyway, that the best way is to follow the standard Baan procedure, which is session ttiex1285m000. Like this you are sure of correct results and no undesired surprises. <br />
<br />
Btw I think it is possible to import pultiple dumps using ttiex1285m000, by just specifying the main folder containing all the dumps. Didn't try this, but won't it work...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to do that in Baan IV but I got an error.. it is looking for components file under the main directory and didn't go in the other sub directories..<br />
<br />
Is there a way to do it ?! that will solve my problem, Can I somehow write a components file that will help this session to do the job?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so another option: how about you write yourself a little script which browses all dump/component files under a specified directory and copies/moves the necessary files neatly into a new folder. Then you can run ttiex1285m000. <br />
<br />
You still have to check if this will not cause errors; i.e. by having multiple dump/component-files in your selected folder. If this will be a problem for ttiex1285m000, you can still try to merge all the files into one new file.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes...<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I can try it but before that .. Just one question..<br />
<br />
If I want to import 2 dumps .. both have the same files! same names!.. I opened the components file and it had<br />
<br />
components<br />
dumpd01<br />
dumpt01<br />
dumpf01<br />
dumpo01<br />
dump.l<br />
dump.e<br />
<br />
<br />
I have two of those so shall I merge them with different names &amp; rename?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I cannot guarantee you that this will work, but I think it's worth an attempt... :<br />
<br />
1) rename all the duplicate files except for 'components', 'dump.l' and 'dump.e', where the only thing you change is the digit: 1, 2, 3 etc. Don't change anything else!!<br />
<br />
2) Add the new component names to the existing 'components' file (i.e. stay with only one components file!) <br />
<br />
3) Add the new component names to the existing 'dump.l' file (i.e. stay with only one 'dump.l' file!) <br />
<br />
4) stay with only one 'dump.e' file, the rest shall not be copied.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me know the results..<br />

<br />
We use customizations and I have a directory called &quot;dumps&quot; under my home directory.  This contains a copy of each of the customizations I have created.  Couldn't you just read each of these sub-directories for the import?  Maybe I do not understand something about this session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can do that .. I have a main directory called dumps and many subdirctories in it .. Many .. it gets updated every now and then .. I want to do them all in one click .. <br />
<br />
I can create runtime dara dictionary for more than one session in one click.. I would like also to import them fast..<br />

<br />
It works :D<br />
<br />
All you have to do is put all the dumps in one folder &amp; write their names in the component file thats all!<br />
You can forget about dump.l &amp; dump.e too .. it is just some information for the user<br />
<br />
Thanks allot ;)<br />

It was my pleasure to assist, and am happy my suggestion worked. But you know, it ain't free of charge... I expect 50% discount on my next Nazdaq support bill... <br />

The problem with ttiex1285m000 is, that you cannot let him select all subdirectories of the given folder. The program is looking for all the files directly under the specified folder, but not in subdirectories. Since George has a lot of dump folders under one main folder he wants to find a shortcut, which will spare him from having to import one by one.<br />
<br />
And George,<br />
<br />
how did you get all the files in there correctly, did you do it manually or did you write a script? If you wrote a script, please post it here; someone else may want to use it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't write I script .. when I do, I will post.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you can save yourself the time to create a script (this would indeed have to be done using AFS) and instead consider using the ttiex4100m000 session in order to create a Patch on you development machine and add all required components to it (if you want, from different packages in Baan)<br />
Then, import the patch on the target machine using ttiex1284m000.<br />
<br />
Isn't this what you essentially want ?<br />
