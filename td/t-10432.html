<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">19th June 2003, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, probably because you opened in append mode.<br />
<br />
You an also use function seq.rewind, which is equivalent to what you coded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe you want to open the file with mode &quot;w&quot; rather than &quot;a&quot;. <br />
<br />
Opening a file in &quot;w&quot; mode, makes the file size 0 and overwrites the existing contents. You will loose the file info.<br />
<br />
Hence, if one likes to check the file existance one need to use -<br />
<br />
fp = seq.open(dumpfpath,&quot;r&quot;)<br />
if fp &lt; 0 then<br />
	mess(&quot;zmadms0036&quot;, 1, dumpfpath)	|* File Opening Error: %1$s<br />
	choice.again()<br />
endif<br />
<br />
But if you like to check if a file exists and it can be write-able <br />
<br />
fp = seq.open(fpath, &quot;a&quot;)<br />
if fp &lt; 0 then<br />
	mess(&quot;zmadms0036&quot;, 1, fpath)	|* File Opening Error: %1$s<br />
	e = seq.close(fp)<br />
	choice.again()<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Nico is correct -<br />
<br />
For seq.rewind to work, you'll have to open it with a plus added to the mode, like &quot;a+&quot;<br />
<br />
Refer to - seq.open() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_directory_file_operations_seq_open)<br />
<br />
&quot;a&quot; Open for writing. The file is created if it does not already exist. The current file position is placed at the end of the file. <br />
The file position is placed at end of the file before every write statement, even if the previous file action was a seq.seek(). <br />
&quot;a+&quot; Same as &quot;a&quot;, but the file can also be read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunkw</div><div class="date">20th June 2003, 07:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Experiment 1 <br />
I tried using &quot;a+&quot; instead of &quot;a&quot; but it did not worked<br />
It gave same effect of appending the string to end of the file<br />
<br />
Experiment 2<br />
I tried using  &quot;w&quot; instead of &quot;a&quot; but it did not worked<br />
my file was overwritten with just a string present in the file, thus I lost all my previous content of file<br />
<br />
Note: that the below code is equivalent, I got return.seek as sucess &quot;0&quot; (i.e Now the file pointer is at the begining of the file)<br />
but effect is not seen in the file that is processed<br />
		return.seek = seq.seek(0,0,write.file.number)<br />
		return.seek = seq.rewind(write.file.number)<br />
<br />

You tried the others you should have tried &quot;r+&quot;. :) Sorry bout the earlier post I should have read the help close. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thieuf</div><div class="date">20th June 2003, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">How about this,<br />
<br />
read the file and copy the lines into a temp file, unlink the original file and recreate the file starting with the first line you want to put in and reading the rest from the temp file.<br />
<br />
If you can rename a file then you only have to write the first line an read and add the lines from the original file. then delete the original and rename your temp file. (but i don't know if this is possible in Baan ....)<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunkw</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I have file which is very very large in size. so much that I can't edit it in vi or notepad<br />
I have to append two of my own string at the start of the file<br />
Now since I had/have faced lot of problem In doing that.<br />
I am using other suggestion of creating a temporary file append my string first and then the whole content of the file on it<br />
<br />
I am using this code to do it<br />
<br />
	long					read.file,flat.file,temp.file<br />
	string					first.line.file.rec(50)<br />
	string					second.line.file.rec(50)<br />
            extern domain tcmcs.s999m		read.line	|* string of length 999<br />
<br />
	temp.file = seq.open(path&amp;&quot;/&quot;&amp;file&amp;&quot;stamped&quot;,&quot;a+&quot;)<br />
	if temp.file &gt; 0 then<br />
		e = seq.puts(first.line.file.rec,temp.file)<br />
		e = seq.puts(second.line.file.rec,temp.file)<br />
		e = seq.close(temp.file)<br />
	endif	<br />
	flat.file = seq.open(path&amp;&quot;/&quot;&amp;file,&quot;r&quot;)<br />
	temp.file = seq.open(path&amp;&quot;/&quot;&amp;file&amp;&quot;stamped&quot;,&quot;a+&quot;)<br />
	if flat.file &gt; 0 then<br />
	while not seq.eof(flat.file)<br />
		e = seq.gets(read.line,2048,flat.file)<br />
		e = seq.puts(read.line,temp.file)<br />
	endwhile<br />
		e = seq.close(flat.file)<br />
		e = seq.close(temp.file)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
I want to know if this is fool proof. I am asking this because<br />
my file size are too large to view in vi or notepad.<br />
Please advice<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help guys <br />
and golden quote from &quot;NPRao&quot;:The file position is placed at end of the file before every write statement, even if the previous file action was a seq.seek(). <br />
is infact a key or should is say hindrance to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Anyways help me and advice me <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Nevertheless interesting thread... :)<br />
<br />
I think we should rename the thread from &quot;Unable to append a string at start of the file &quot; to &quot;How to prepend a string at the beginning of the file&quot;.<br />
<br />
I had a similar problem and I couldnt get a direct solution and I had to use 2 files to make it to work.<br />
<br />
Arun,<br />
<br />
You are now in the right path. I made a temporary file, put 2 lines of text and then read the other file and put all the text into this and move the new file over the old one.<br />
<br />
Theif,<br />
<br />
If you can rename a file then you only have to write the first line an read and add the lines from the original file. then delete the original and rename your temp file. (but i don't know if this is possible in Baan ....)<br />
<br />
This is very much possible in BaaN tools using - Directory and file operations synopsis (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_directory_file_operations_synopsis) <br />
<br />
Juergen,<br />
I would prefer not to use the &quot;cat&quot; or OS specific commands if I can have alternatives in BaaN tools to make it OS independent code.<br />
<br />
Refer to - Cat two files (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9996&amp;highlight=append) <br />
<br />
Mark,<br />
<br />
This worked for me:<br />
<br />
This actually does not work. Here is an example-<br />
<br />
&gt;cat np<br />
hello1<br />
hello2<br />
<br />
Here is the code-<br />
function	main()<br />
{<br />
long	fp<br />
string	buffer(256)<br />
fp = seq.open(&quot;np&quot;,&quot;r+&quot;)<br />
if fp &lt; 0 then<br />
	mess(&quot;zmadms0036&quot;, 1, &quot;/home/bsp/np&quot;)<br />
	|* File Opening Error: %1$s<br />
	exit(0)<br />
endif<br />
e = seq.seek(0,0,fp)<br />
buffer = &quot;test-1&quot;<br />
e = seq.puts(buffer,fp)<br />
seq.close(fp)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;cat np<br />
test-1<br />
hello2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaapzwaan</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Note that the above code only works if all lines have equal length.<br />
If the file contains the following lines:<br />
<br />
hello<br />
hello2<br />
<br />
then the result will be like this:<br />
<br />
test-1<br />
ello2<br />
<br />
This is because files are not regarded as lines, but just characters where the newline is not special.<br />
So if N represents a newline charachter:<br />
helloNhello2N <br />
will be replaced by<br />
test-1Nello2N <br />
I hope this is clear.<br />

:o I had already tried out the options of using Unix commands of <br />
cat, mv etc. to achieve my task. and it works very fine in unix.<br />
But my stubborn customer did not accept the steps I had prescribed to him,<br />
He blindly refused :rolleyes:  saying that he doesn't want to execute any steps manually<br />
because of security reasons, and lot of reasons such as taking up risk and responsibility.:confused: <br />
That was the reason I had to develope a new program for him in baan.<br />
I am keeping my fingures cross, till the time he exectues it.<br />
You guys have helped me a lot.:) <br />

I want to append a size of the file at the beginning of the file. I am getting file size from file.stat(), but appending it to the beginning of the file is becoming tough .

<br />
You can't start writing simply at the beginning of the file. That will overwrite existing data.<br />
IMHO you should write a new file with your value and add the content of the original file to it. After closing the file you can rename the new file to the old file.<br />
