<br />
We use 5.0b on NT. To my opinion it must be possible however maybe the positioning could be hard to realise.<br />
<br />
My customer would like to know if it can be done before we are allowed to develop the report.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

We use Streamserve to generate the checks. But I am pretty sure you will be able to print the same with BWPrint. I know there are truetype fonts available to purchase for E13B. One can buy a E13B gauge that shows if the positioning / alignment / spacing are all correct. Do not do any development without having possession of this device. Usually costs between 30-100$. Do a search on the net. Also realise that you will end up customising the registry to make this work. Hopefully you will not have a requirement to print checks at many computers. Maintaining registries on multiple computers can be painful :).<br />
<br />
And finally for the question that you asked. No, I have not done this :).</div></div><hr />
