<br />
I have problem in &quot;copy components&quot; from one VRC (test/development) to another VRC (Live environment) on the same machine. I used session ttadv6265m000 to copy components from one VRC to another, selected following components in range  :<br />
<br />
Session, Reports, Form, Program scripts, Table &amp; domian.<br />
<br />
all components copied successfully, no error in process. In the second step when tried to compile the program scripts and libraries, I got errors like<br />
<br />
No definition in definition file for sopen(F_BRDD:dtcais002, dtcais002)<br />
ptcais04010(  13): Error: Can't read dd for table 'ttcais002'.<br />
<br />
I also tried to create tables in session ttadv4520m000, it give error as <br />
<br />

You need to do that first before the new VRC will recognize the tables.  Then the compiles should work.<br />

Yes I ran the &quot;create run time data dictionary&quot; on the tables &amp; domains, but still the table definition are missing. I tried to acces the table informaion using the session &quot;Display general table information&quot; (ttaad4500), I got the error as <br />

Any idea and/or suggestion?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Senthil - I was talking about session ttadv5210m000.  You can pick tables, sessions or domains.  I typically pick domains and then run a specfic table.  What you all might want to try is in the VRC where the new table is located, make a change to it. So change a label, then change it back.  The do the convert to runtime.  I have see this before in somecases, making the change and then changes it back lets baan know that a table change happened and needs to be converted.  I have seen cases where moving from one VRC to another does not trigger it to actually make the change.  Once you actually see the convert work, log out and then back into Baan.  Then you should be able to allocate the table.<br />

<br />
I tried what u suggested, but still its not work. Also I manually created the same table in the target VRC, and created the runtime data dictionary for that table, then logout and login. Now the error is changed as :<br />
<br />
&quot;can't read dd for table tcais002&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also in session session &quot;Display general table information&quot; (ttaad4500), I got the error as :<br />
<br />
&quot;Data definition ttcais002 not present&quot;<br />

Any idea/suggestion<br />

The surefire way to do this is reboot the server.<br />
If you cannot do that, you need to run Shared Memory Manager &amp; refresh it in there.</div></div><hr />

On our system the dict level is located the same place as the bse.  Under the dict directory you should see a dd file - for example on ours it is ddB40C_prd. Under this you should see something like dtcais.  If not make sure the ais module has been created in your production VRC.  Go into the dtcais directory and make sure you see a file like dtcais002. Ours has rw permissions for the owner and the group.  Make sure bsp is the group.  We just had a case where my user id was changed from bsp group to another group.  Everybody received errors except me when trying to access the new tables.  They also received &quot;data definition not present&quot; errors.<br />

<br />
Other suggestions:<br />
<br />
Did you copy the table definitions to the new vrc?<br />
Are there other users in the Package Combo when you converted/created runtime?<br />
Try running convert followed by create runtime.<br />
Is the package vrc in the structure that your user connects to? or is it on a different branch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">26th July 2004, 08:58</div></div><div class="posttext">hi mark, toolswizard and others,<br />
<br />
Directoy dtcais and file within the directoy &quot;dtcais002&quot; is existed. Package ais is successfully created, other scripts &amp; sessions which are using the existing tables of baan are compiled and running error free, but only those session and scripts which are using that new table &quot;tcais002&quot; having that problem. <br />
<br />
Thanks toolswizard for your time, I have already checked/done those points which you mentioned. I dont think so that this is the problem of &quot;package vrc in the structure &quot; or like that.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">26th July 2004, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
One thing I forget to tell, I dont know it could be the cause of prblem or not, I tried the &quot;Export/Import process&quot; when the user where working with Baan. but the package &quot;ais&quot; is totally new for the Live environment. When I tried that &quot;Copy procedure&quot;, there were no user login into Baan. <br />
<br />
I dont know it could be the reason, becaues I tried to create the table manually and created run time data disctionary. While I compile the session which is using that table, I am getting error as <br />
<br />
cannot find table definition ttcais002 <br />
<br />
Also in session session &quot;Display general table information&quot; (ttaad4500), I got the error as :<br />
<br />
&quot;Data definition ttcais002 not present&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Can you try 1 thing?  In your new VRC, try and copy that table in Maintain Table Definition to a new name.  Convert to runtime, exit, come back, can you create the table now?<br />
<br />
If so, you need to remove the other version all together, delete the table def in maintain table definition, and remove any references to the DD in the OS.  Run a convert with everything gone, exit and come back.  Then copy back to the right number from your backup.<br />
<br />
If you still can't create the table under a new name, maybe there is some real problem with the table def.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks every one who spent time. <br />
<br />
lbencic, I tried the same as u suggested and problem resolved. In the maintain table session, when I tried to access the table, it asked that <br />
<br />
&quot;file is not alocated, do you want to alocate?&quot; (Yes/No)<br />
<br />
I said Yes, and problem resolved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again to every one.<br />
