When i run the session tisfc0220m000 ( Backflush material and hours), this window keeps getting the focus back. This only happens with the latest windows xp pc's and not all windows xp pc's.<br />
For eg: if i start this session and try to open Microsoft word and begin typing, focus is lost from this window back to the Baan session. In effect only thing that can be done is wait for the session to complete before anything else can be done on this pc. The closest thing that happens which is similar to this problem is running exchange schemes, which also keeps bringing the ascii window back into focus.<br />
<br />
Has anybody experienced this problem ?? Any help with regards to this problem is appreciated.<br />

There is a flag in the registry that can be changed. Once the flag is changed windows will no longer open in the background.<br />
<br />
Sadly I cannot tell you which flag it was since I left the company.<br />
<br />
Sorry</div></div><hr />

That was the window registry that i had to change but i had to change it to  to 30d40 (hex value) from 0. This resolved the problem. Here is my current registry settings:<br />
<br />
[HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Desktop]<br />
&quot;ForegroundLockTimeout&quot;=dword:30d40<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop]<br />
&quot;ForegroundLockTimeout&quot;=dword:30d40<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">29th November 2004, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">be careful as making this change to the Registry can affect how Worktop opens windows (they end up in the background = v.confusing)<br />
<br />
PS - An easier way to adjust the Registry is to use 'tweakui' for XP, available from the microsoft download area...</div></div><hr />

Thanks Andy for the microsoft tool suggestion.<br />
There is still a problem after my registry setting and/or using the microsoft utility (tweakui), the problem is fixed with all applications except for outlook. In short, i cannot do anything with outlook while i am running tisfc0220m000. Outlook keeps losing focus.<br />
<br />
Any ideas???<br />
