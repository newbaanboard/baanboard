I m using session ttadv2290(BaaNERP 5.0c) and selecting the option to generate script along with Run session option. While running the session, it comes out with an error &quot;Cannot read session or object !!!!cannot determine location!!!!&quot;. I saw on the OS level, scripts are getting created but objects are not there in the folder. I tried compiling the objects thru session ttadv2530 but still objects and not created. Any suggesions ???<br />

I have to confirm this only after getting the new bic.exe and std_gen.exe files from BaaN. But, i m sure that the bug is from these 2 files.<br />

<br />
I myself found the problem as well as solution also. I had installed BaaN 5.0c in my test server and the folder which i created for baan was d:\program files\baan. After installation, was trying to develop some new maintain session and print session. I was able to generate the session, but while compiling the Program scripts, it was not generating the objects, but was able to generate objects for report scripts. I reported this to baan and they said, i have to validate the server for new developments and then only the objects will be created. I was remembering that, i had already done the developments in baan 4c4 using demo lic, but baan people were not getting convinced. I validated my system and was retrying but the problem was same. Finally, i started looking for the sol and found that, if i compile the program scripts from command prompt, the objects were getting created. Finally, i found that, while compiling scripts(program or reports), it creates a temp file in $BSE\tmp folder, but bic.exe and std_gen.exe was not recognizing the folder d:\program files\baan\tmp as a single folder. while compiling the script from command prompt, i was using temp folder as &quot;d:\program files\baan\tmp&quot; and was able to generate objects. When i saw while creating report scripts, the session ttadv3530m000, uses temp folder within &quot; &quot; but the session ttadv2530(program script) doesnt take temp folder in &quot; &quot; and was not able to take d:\program files\baan\tmp as a single folder. This is standard bug in baan b'cause even in baan ivc4, the session ttadv2130(maintain program scripts) doesnÂ’t take temp folder in &quot; &quot;. Now, i have created a new folder in e:\ drive and have changed the location of $BSE\tmp folder from d:\program files\baan\tmp to e:\baan\tmp after modifying the registry and the env var of my server and it is working fine. I have already reported this to baan.<br />
<br />
hope it will help u all  while installing baan s/w.<br />
