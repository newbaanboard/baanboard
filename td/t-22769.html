<br />
I have two functions (below) that I am trying to get the same results as querying inside the Display Purchase Order Line Status session.  I can't seem to get my script query to pull the same data.  <br />
<br />
I have a bad case of the flu and just can't see what I'm doing wrong.  Can anyone offer help - my brains ache.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance!<br />

<br />
1.you may try to utilize the index with status as the key field.<br />
  I know tdsls045 has one, assuming tdpur045 has one too.<br />
  Think of a display session for the same data with query.extend.<br />
<br />
2. you may utilize the &quot;as set with 1 rows&quot; after ordering by<br />
   index1 desc to get only the latest seq. or where receipt qty &lt;&gt; 0.<br />
<br />
Get well soon. you are lucky to have some Baan work :-)</div></div><hr />

I was however able to derive the information I needed in a little different manner and that worked!<br />

Thanks for your suggestion.</div></div><hr />
