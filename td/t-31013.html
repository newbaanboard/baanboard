Another reason is we are also support application issues.<br />
<br />
The weekly Shutdown/start up task moved to System group from Business system. Due to this segregation we no longer access event viewer logs from server immediately, we have to email/phone the system folks and they send us the screen shot or you could see the screen once they logged into the server. This becomes really a pain to debug certain issues.     <br />
<br />
Anyone gone through this kinda issue ?<br />

<br />
We faced similar kind of issues initially, but successfully resolved.<br />
<br />
Earlier we had Windows NT systems which doesnt support remote desktop feature, also we dont want to install third party software on server.<br />
<br />
Our server setups are very much scattered (10-20km), instead of moving physically just to monitor eventviewer we have automated sending evenviewer by mail.<br />
<br />
For more info. refer to - http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=14300&amp;highlight=event+viewer<br />
<br />
We then later able to configure as an when required eventviewer and event based alert email for Windows and Oracle too.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<br />
We did similar of what you have mentioned. We do have an apllication called MMAGIC which has the same capability. It sends email to every 5 minutes. My worry is it might over load lotus notes application. <br />
<br />
Is it possible to see event viewer in text file though intranet? Based on the information I have, it is not possible to view without certain editor. I did try by downloading application called &quot;Event Log Explorer&quot; but it is unable to open copy of the event log. It returns error &quot;1500:  The event Log file corrupted&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read referred thread there are two phases one for downloading Event Viewer and Second for sending mail.<br />
<br />
So dont run second, Create a short-cut for accessing network file, which can be open in Notepad/Wordpad.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
