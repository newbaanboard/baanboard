<br />
Our current BaaN IV server running on Windows 2008 32 bit,  as Microsoft announced Windows 2008 support will close March-2018,  we are planning to shift from windows 2008 to “Windows 2012 R2 64 bit”<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell, is it compatible BaaN IV with Windows 2012 R2 or anyone having experience please share it<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th April 2017, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Changing from IV to another version is a major conversion.  This is a question I would ask infor.  I know just by upgrading our Solaris and moving to a newer server is going to require us to install the new licensing module.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">18th April 2017, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely possible.  Considerations are, as Mark mentioned, having to move to SLM if you're not there already, a portingset upgrade to a version that supports Windows 2012 R2 (again, if you're not already on one), and any potential tools solutions required to support the above two items.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bilmaa</div><div class="date">19th April 2017, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Actualy we are migrating from windows server 2003 32 bits to windows 2012 r2 64bits and from oracle 10.2 to oracle 12.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of changes, for example the porting set now is universal for all Infor products, the SLM is new for us, the FTP feature disappear and we need to use CURL, the fields into de BD change from char to varchar...<br />
<br />
But is posible the changes.</div></div><hr />
