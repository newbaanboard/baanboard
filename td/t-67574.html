What are you trying to achieve?<br />
<br />
Try assigning the value to a variable in your report script and then try using it in after.report. May be somewhere your field is getting initialize. Debug and check for inconsistencies.</div></div><hr />

i hv done summation in after.field and then would like to carry the amount in after.report on report layout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th April 2015, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">You should be able to use the same field name in after.report as you did in after.field.  So for example in after.field you use total.inv with aggregate function set to total for a supplier or customer sort - then in the after.report you could use total.inv also with total as the aggregate function.  In this case the after.report would have the total value for all customers or suppliers.    If there is something different you are doing then you will need to explain it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bpanda</div><div class="date">8th April 2015, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are using standard Aggregate function on report layout then it will work as per Mark.<br />
<br />
If you are doing calculation on report script for summation then assign the value to another variable on before.layout (just after calculation) of that after.field and use that on after.report.<br />
<br />
One thing check if you have that variables declared on report script,<br />
if declared on report script then that should not be in the report's input field list. This will initialize the variable. Only those variables not declared on the report script can be added to input field list.<br />
<br />
Check these things you will get what you want.<br />
