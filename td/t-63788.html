<br />
The customize report output is very slow taking to much time to run with erp normal user but when the same report is run by superuser the duration for the output report is okay. <br />
<br />
we are facing this problem from the last two days.<br />

Once as a super user and once as a regular user.  I can't imagine a setup where the run times would be different - unless maybe the regular user was remote and having some network latency or something.  Have you tried doing some tracing or debugging to see what might be taking so long?  I have never seen anything like this that did not have something other than baan to cause an impact.</div></div><hr />

Is your user in LN a so called normal user? If, are the tools authorisations setup that he/she is authorized for certain data only? I am asking because data authorisations are evaluated during runtime which can cause these kinds of problems.<br />
