<br />
i want to change the sort on a display session.  The index of my table is by employee number and date.  When i go in the display session, it's showing me all records for an employee number sorted by the date (ascending).  I want to see all records for an employee all records sorted by date but descending.<br />
<br />
Is there any way without changing the structure of the table?<br />

But you shoul define new index ti your table. After that in display session use change index option on display form . I used it and works well !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">v_chandra</div><div class="date">17th November 2005, 13:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I think new index will be date and employee number, but even this will display employee numbers with date as ascending, but as per PB's requirement he need it with all employee number with date as descending. <br />
<br />
Does this creating new index with Date and Employee number would resolve his problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards</div></div><hr />

What's your idea?</div></div><hr />

Yeah - how would you do this without altering the table or creating a new table in Baan 4?  And I do not think the query extension functionality available in Baan 5 has been ported to baan 4. <br />
<br />
I did something like this by creating a secondary temp table where I selected the records as descending, then inserted with a serial number as the key.  This allowed me to display the records with the users sort requirements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i do have the source code but how do you do it with a filter? <br />
As for the new index, i need it to be by employee and date, the date still have to be descending.  Is it possible to set an index descending?<br />

<br />
However as u say u have the sources , all u need to do is to update the date as inverse of a larger number say 999999 (before.write / rewrite, in the database and in the UI show it again as the inverse of 999999  (before.display), it should work .<br />
<br />
But in GTM (ie ttaad4100/4500)  u will never be able to c the real date .It will be the inverse only.</div></div><hr />
