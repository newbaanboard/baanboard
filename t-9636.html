I agree with what you say.  There's no logic in adding a &quot;find&quot; statement.  I just added it as an afterthought and because of an error that kept popping up.  If I didn't have the find statement I kept getting the error message &quot;Printed not allowed&quot;, although the session itself went through the whole execution(printing the wrong set of invoices though as I had stated in my problem).  With or without the find statement,  the session always behaves in one way: prints all the sales orders waiting to be invoiced.<br />
<br />
This is very puzzling for me.  <br />
<br />
Punitha:confused:</div></div><hr />

Other than the find I thought everything looked okay.  If you own source I would recommend putting the session in debug mode and stepping through it to see what it is doing.  You may even want to check Baan support for the latest object for this session.  Sorry this is not much help, but it is all I can think of.<br />
<br />
Mark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Punitha</div><div class="date">15th April 2003, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank You Mark.  I appreciate your responses.  <br />
<br />
I checked with Baan support yesterday.  They are equally puzzled too.  Because they find nothing wrong in my code either.   I am able to print packing slips, order acks, etc.  The problem I am having with are the sales invoices.  One thought that did occur to me and Baan support also suspected was &quot;could this error be caused because the session is not api compliant?&quot;.  However I do not find that line of reasoning very convincing because almost all the print sessions are not marked down in black and white on the Baan knowledge base that they are api compliant.   And as you had suggested I had also thought along the lines of getting the latest object.  But from what I checked ours is the latest object.   Anyway, I am going to double-verify about the object as per your suggestion.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you Mark,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Punitha</div><div class="date">30th April 2003, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan Support has helped me in sorting out this problem.  <br />
<br />
Baan Support uncovered the following problems in my program:<br />
<br />
1.  When setting the enumerated values, I had merely stated the enumerated value within quotes which is of course, wrong because the value within the double quotes will be passed as a constant:<br />
<br />
ie.  The original statement <br />
            stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdsls4404m000&quot;, &quot;printed&quot;, &quot;tcyesno.no&quot;) <br />
SHOULD BE CORRECTED AS<br />
    stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdsls4404m000&quot;, &quot;printed&quot;, <br />
                     str$(etol(tcyesno.no)))<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Also the statement to set the report should follow the selection values.  <br />
<br />
ie.  I had originally programmed as follows:<br />
            stpapi.set.report(.....<br />
            stpapi.put.field(....<br />
            stpapi.print.report(....<br />
<br />
THIS SHOULD BE CORRECTED AS:<br />
           stpapi.put.field(....<br />
           stpapi.set.report(...<br />
           stpapi.print.report(....<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I downloaded the latest components for &quot;ttstpapi&quot; to make sure that I didn't get into any other problems.  By downloading the latest components, I was also able to get rid of one of the errors which originally caused me to put a find statement just before printing the report. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Baan Support and to Mark who posted replies to this thread,<br />

So all suggestions mentioned before applied, still all invoices where printed. <br />
After removing the user defaults for session tdsls4404m000 everything went fine! Obviously the session is overwriting the values passed through the AFS with the user defaults.<br />
Logged a case to BaaN, will keep you informed</div></div><hr />

<br />
In script ptdsls44040 in section after.input of field printed, function get.screen.defaults() is called, based on the value of form.curr. Since forms are not used in AFS, the function might be executed.<br />
Baan can easily make this api compliant by adding if not api.mode then.... to this part of the script.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FoxZapper</div><div class="date">22nd December 2004, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Klaas/Peter/Punitha/Mark,<br />
<br />
I had the same problem with the Print Sales Invoice Session-tdsls4404m000.<br />
And we had even installed the solution that Klaas mentioned.<br />
Even then, for some reason the user defaults were always applied.<br />
I actually wound up printing all the invoices waiting to be printed even though I had selected a specific invoice!! Luckily, it was in a test environment.<br />
<br />
My recommendation to anyone trying to write an AFS for tdsls4404m000, please delete the user defaults for the user (using ttstpdeldeflt) under whose login the program is expected to run.<br />

I ran into those issues but with the latest AFS/API objects there is a new function to do that for you -<br />
<br />
Clear All fields<br />
SYNTAX<br />
void stpapi.clear(string session)<br />
ARGUMENTS<br />
Session Name of the session this command is executed on.<br />
DESCRIPTION<br />
This function fills in an empty value (unset) for all input fields of the form.<br />
EXAMPLE<br />
stpapi.clear(dtfsa1101s000)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;dtfsa1101s000&quot;, &quot;dtfsa101.seno&quot;, str$(i.seno)) stpapi.put.field(&quot;dtfsa1101s000&quot;,<br />
&quot;dtfsa101.name&quot;, name)<br />
retval1 = stpapi.insert(&quot;dtfsa1101s000&quot;, true, error.msg)<br />
if not retval1 then<br />
retval2 = stpapi.recover(&quot;dtfsa1101s000&quot;, recover.msg)<br />
endif<br />
Explanation:<br />
Before you execute the put.field actions, you first make all fields empty using<br />
the clear function.<br />
USAGE NOTES<br />
Function in dll created by creatdll:<br />
Function extern void &lt;fs-name&gt;.clear()<br />
Note<br />
In early versions of Functionserver, you required this stpapi.clear function to<br />
clear the put field buffers. The newer versions will after an action such as<br />
insert automatically reset the put field buffers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really, I should have done a lot more research before putting that post.<br />
Thanks for the info anyway.<br />
<br />
In case anyone wants the AFS scripts for any specific BaaN IV Distribution session, please let me know.<br />
