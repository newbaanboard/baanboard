Crystal Decisions and Baan have combined to give you the capability to send any Baan report into Crystal format. Crystal Enterprise is the only product they offer that allows you to create reports off their native Baan driver. Their other tool, Crystal Reports is a stand alone product, and while it can report off of many data sources, it is not licensed to use the Baan driver. That doesn't mean that you can't report off your Baan data. If it is in MS SQL  server then it is accessible that way. Crystal is a separate development environment from Baan. For more info you can contact Crystal at www.crystaldecision.com and they will be happy to talk to you.</div></div><hr />

This driver works through the Bshell to access your database from both Crystal Reports and Crystal Enterprise, but is only sold with Crystal Enterprise.  The driver provides many features when developing reports in Crystal Reports such as enum conversion, table and field discriptions read from the Baan dictionary, Baan text handling.<br />
<br />
Only the ability to push standard Baan reports into Crystal Enterprise requires Baan IVc4 SP9 then giving forms software functionality to improve the layout of standard Baan reports.<br />

For more information or training please contact myself.<br />
