<br />
Need your assistance:<br />
<br />
Our senior management in Middle East want to have a dashboard level view of key performance realted KPIs (such as inventory aging, order to delivery and other financial KPIs).<br />
<br />
We have bought Cognos for reporting purpose and is getting implemented. But even today we are using Crystal for financial reporting. <br />
<br />
In the long term future senior management want to implement six sigma based performance monitoring.<br />
<br />
Has anyone got experience with Baan and Dashboard level reporting? I need assistance in finding out if we need to implement additional modules and if work flow software that we use can interface with Baan.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
