<br />
I'm very new to BAAN, so excuse me if my questions seems stupid !<br />
<br />
I've found that I can use automation with C# or VB to remote control BAAN. That seems great, I'm able to create and close a session... but where can I found the API documentation for BAAN IV C4 ? <br />
<br />
Does someone have samples on how to create a purchase order through automation ?<br />
<br />
Can I do that only with automation, or do I need to have some functions developed inside BAAN ?<br />
<br />
I've read a lot of things about DLL and AFS in that forum. Is that part of the standard BAAN package ? I suppose that the DLL are not the same as the &quot;.dll&quot; in windows world, and that it works also on Solaris.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any information that can help me !<br />

I recommend searching on the session name that you want create API code for.  I have not seen any directions for doing this from VB or C#, but there might be some on the baan support site.  There are really two ways to do this (1) VB code (you can find examples in this forum) or (2) a DLL where you pass the data, which then runs the API commands to control the sessions involved.  AFS and DLL's are part of the Baan standard package.  I do not know about windows DLL's, but I do believe they are the same.  Libraries that can be linked to different sessions.  The difference is that on my windows client I know I can execute some commands to call the Baan DLL or library on our UNIX server.</div></div><hr />
