How can I maintain prices in tdsls0104m000 through AFS for a new record (new view and new record). Because when we say new group after filling Pricelist, Item, Container &amp; Disc Level session pops up another session automatically as soon as we tab out of disc level field. How can we handle this scenario? I am able to insert record if I don't have to insert a new view record but for altogether new view and record I am facing issue. Please let me know your thought or if possible a sample code.<br />

So you would put all the fields just like a normal insert, but add a stpapi.handle.subproc right before the insert.  Hopefully this would give you control of the subsession that pops up.  Then you could complete it and end the subsession normally.  Just keep in mind this does not always work this way - sometimes the subsessions do not start or they start and you can not control them.  I have had to work around these issues and the solution can hard to find at times.  Since we do not use these session I do not know a work around.</div></div><hr />
