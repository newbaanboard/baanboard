Then I asked my user to sign in so that I could make sure everything functioned with his/her UID and it did NOT.<br />
<br />
When I click continue, there was no hour glassing at all.<br />
<br />
The nature of the change is a new session that uses api commands to call tdsls4404m000.  I have provided permission for the new session.  Are there special permissions that I need to set when a session calls the stpapi commands?  Perhaps a setting that I already have access to because I work in tools so much?</div></div><hr />

Is the api session in shared memory?  Did she logout and back in?  Are the file permissions okay on the object?  Just some wild guesses for now.  Did you actually run it in production with your ID?  I was wondering if all the changes made it to production.<br />
<br />
The first thing I would do is compile in debug in production and then run it from her ID.  See what it actually did.</div></div><hr />
