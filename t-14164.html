<br />
I was just going through some of the posts related to AFS, and learnt that latest objects are required before procedding with the development <br />
<br />
I have to develop AFS for tfgld1101m000 and it's sub-session, assuming that i have 2 servers<br />
<br />
FIRST SERVER<br />
Production Server<br />
Service Pack - 10<br />
<br />
DEMO SERVER<br />
Service Pack - 12<br />
<br />
<br />
Now since my Production server is running fine with sp10 for normal baan sessions, what if , if i just create a dll for the above finance sessions using ttstpcreatdll on DEMO Server which is on sp12 and then import it into Production server, will it still require my Production server to be on sp 12.<br />
<br />
So basic doubt is will this solution will work ??? i.e. bring the objects from demo server having sp12 and import it in to PRODUCTION Server instead of installaing sp 11,12 on Production Server.<br />
<br />
If no, then why not ??? since my Sessions will utilise the latest objects .<br />

I am not sure how good an idea that is, but it should work.   Just remember that not only do you need the latest session objects, but the tools objects also need to be current.<br />

I would certainly check ottstpapihand, the scripts in question.  I am not sure how the other tools objects play into everything. And then again it may just work on the SP10 server. <br />
