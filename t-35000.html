<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">efector</div><div class="date">27th April 2007, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello. We are using BaaN 4c4 with the servers being HP-UX 11.11 w/Oracle 8i. The biggest issue that we are having is in our remote offices. Our remote offices are connected to the home office via site to site vpn's(T-1's)(Juniper Netscreen NS-50 FW's). Remote users will be in BaaN sessions, and sometimes while a user is typing, they have to stop to allow BaaN to catch up with the typing.<br />
<br />
Its prohibitively slow sometimes for the users in the remote sites. Where can we look to check to see if we are optimized correctly? The users really dont have issue surfing the web(and they come back to our proxy server to connect, so I know its not the T, which is causing the issue). <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Port numbers, Ports priority settings and configuration to access the BaaN App and database servers.<br />
2. Network Switches.<br />
3. Check with your VPN service provider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just for suggestions, please check on the followings:<br />
<br />
1. Port numbers, Ports priority settings and configuration to access the BaaN App and database servers. **what do I check and where?**<br />
<br />
2. Network Switches. **there are no issues with any other services other than Baan**<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Check with your VPN service provider. *we are our own vpn service provider*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">29th April 2007, 02:04</div></div><div class="posttext">when baantechy is talking about port priority i guess he means do you have quality of service on the link. QOS allows you to set priorities for types of traffic so you could for example reserve 40% of you bandwidth to baan traffic.<br />
<br />
when you say other services are fine what types of services are we talking about because something like web browsing is very different to a baan client access session.<br />
<br />
If you really want to have good performance, I wouldn't run a baan client directly in this situation I would deploy baan over citrix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">2nd May 2007, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Darren. BW Baan 4 was not desiged to run on from a home office. Especially the amount of transfers can kill you. Don't mixup an web application with an office application. I bet that if you use the ASCII interface, users will not see many issues. For BW Citrix can help you a lot.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

I mean using BaaN w/Citrix? WHY would I invest in yet ANOTHER app to get BaaN working correctly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Works fine for me/us over wan with citrix vpn via internet also via public DSL and even witk 56k dialup it usable.<br />
<br />
I don't think baan is the problem per se.  <br />

By default 1 TS cal exist in Windows OS . U need to buy more licenses for these too if u have more users.<br />
<br />
In terms of functionality (remote printing , local drive sharing , bandwidth compression , security etc) citrix is better than MS RDC .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">23rd May 2007, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used Baan4 and later versions for years and not found the problems mentioned above - OK on 56k modem it can be a bit slow, but VPN from home using 512k-2mb broadband has never given any performance problems.  Before going down the Citrix route, I would look into an alternative to your VPN provider...<br />
<br />
There is a 2nd cheaper option for occasional remote users who have a desktop in the office and that's to use something like logmein.com to gain 'PCAnywhere' style access from home to their office PC through their browser, the great thing here being that you can disconnect and reconnect without being thrown out of sessions as they remain running on the office PC - you can try it for free and if you pay a little more it unlocks remote printing and file transfer functions - just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We use Baan from a remote factory over a broadband-based VPN using Juniper/Netscreen firewall/vpn box.  There are about 8 remote users on a standard 8Mb broadband connection.  We use standard BW client.  There are no performance issues.<br />
<br />
However, I would recommend that you send the web-browsing for the remote users by another route.  That can generate a lot of traffic and slow up the VPN .</div></div><hr />

Dear Pradeep,<br />
<br />
It is better to start your own thread so we can help you better and keep this thread for this topic. It would also be nice if you spend some more words on the problem(s) you face.<br />
<br />
best regards,<br />
