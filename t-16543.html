Does any one has an idea of streamserve princing? I will appreciate overview of its pricing and, if possible its licensing model (e.g based on number of users or some other ...).<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and help.<br />

we bought the full streamserve package 5 years ago. I can only recommend this tool. I'm not sure how much we acutally paid. I thought is was around 80000 CHF or USD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the reply. It would be nice if you can give some more overview. Did this cost include unlimited user licesnses, or was based on a certain number of users?. Further, what was approximately included in the full package (as it was 5 yrs back, so I think price  now may be even higher?)<br />
<br />
Has it been very useful for document delivery automation (fax/email directly from Baan), or did you face any problems?<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your time.<br />

We have partnered with StreamServe in the past, and have assisted several Baan customers with StreamServe implementations. The cost can be substantially lower than this. <br />
<br />
If you would like, I can put you in direct contact with a StreamServe sales representative who can give you an accurate quote based on the specific needs of your company.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in this, please email me directly at kbarthelt@rmcis.com.<br />

sorry that I cannot answer your question about the licences since I am not working for that company anymore. What I can tell though is that we had no problems at all. It is a very powerful tool that I can only recommend.<br />
<br />
We use the E-mail, PDF and Document Output. We even made created an interface that every printed document gets automaticly archived.</div></div><hr />
