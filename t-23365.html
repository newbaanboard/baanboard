<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">I.Benini</div><div class="date">7th March 2005, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
I have a problem in printing report via AFS. Session A launchs via AFS session B: session A prints a report and session B prints a report, too. The second report is printed correctly, but when the execution goes back to session A at the statement stpapi.end.session(&quot;B&quot;) then a fatal error occurs:<br />
&quot;Use of null pointer on ' '. Can not continue in B in DLL: ottstpapihand&quot;.<br />
If I skip the report in session B everything is ok. I can't find out the solution: when the action goes back to session A all spool variables seems to be correct (spool.device is filled with the right value, spool.report is filled with the right report name), or at least they are all filled.<br />
I looked for a solution here in Baanboard, but I didn't find any. Just a doubt: solution 217484 &quot;Use of null pointer error during end session&quot; (dated 2003-12-12 )in ttstpapihand could solve my problem? I can't acces to Kowledge Base of BaaN support (it seems out of order now), so if someone could explain the above mentioned solution it would be great.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I check ottstpapihand and the last ident string is &quot;DF213495, 2003/05/09, Small changes related to starting session&quot;, while I saw in a thread (&quot;API requirements&quot;) also the string &quot;DF217484, 2003/12/12 Use of null pointer error during end.session&quot;.<br />
Thanks for help</div></div><hr />

Do you think that the &quot;Use of null pointer error in end.session&quot; can be definitevly resolved installing the above mentioned solutions or do you think that something is wrong with my scripts? In other words, is it possible to print a report in a session that calls via AFS another session that prints a report, too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th March 2005, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">What sessions?  We can always check your code. The patch may help, but I can not promise that it will solve your problem.  I do have it installed into one of our test environments.  I also think this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=23355) may be related to yours.  Currently I can not think of any code that I have written that calls a session that prints a report and also runs a sub-session that prints a report.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">I.Benini</div><div class="date">7th March 2005, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">The sessions I defined as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;  aren't BaaN standard session. I attach (part of) session A and B scripts. Note that the spool.device is set to &quot;D&quot;, and its spool variable are filled in choice.print.data (on.choice) in session &quot;B&quot; (spool.device = &quot;D&quot;, spool.report = &quot;tipcs912311000&quot;, and so on). When the action goes back to session &quot;A&quot; before executing stpapi.end.session(&quot;tipcs9123m000&quot;) the spool variables are set to the &quot;original&quot; values set for the tipcs9233m000 report (spool.device = &quot;W-ULTRAEDIT&quot;, spool.report = &quot;tipcs923311000&quot;, spool.fileout = &quot;D:\....&quot;. The only different value is spool.time. Can it be?)<br />
session A: tipcs9233m000<br />
session B: tipcs9123m000.<br />

I hope you could help me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th March 2005, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hoping it was some standard sessions.  Not sure I can help - I do recommend installing the patch and testing it.  I noticed in the session A script that print.record ( usually used with open.report) is used instead of rprt_send() - the last time I looked at this (several years ago) this was what was casuing my null pointer error.  I traced through the session I was playing It was also before this solution was available.  Sorry but I do not think I can help.<br />
