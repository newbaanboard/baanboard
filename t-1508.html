I borrowed the idea of using [Bookmark] feature I found on the net. <br />
<br />
Created MSWord Template (as a .doc file) <br />
<br />
Created Book marks in the template,where data from Baan will fill in the blanks . <br />
<br />
create the output from Baan as follows: <br />
1*Path of output file to be created in the Win-PC-Terminal <br />
2*Path of the template file which should be located in the pc <br />
3*Header, Detail, Footer Indicator <br />
4*The book Mark to be located in the template <br />
5*The value to be placed at the bookmark <br />
<br />
The paths[1,2] are captured in the Report Session's Form <br />
<br />
The above 5 fields are separted by &quot;|&quot; <br />
<br />
The above output file <br />
will be sent to a batch file residing in c:\windows say Baan2Word.bat <br />
<br />
Baan2Word.bat will invoke a VB6 program Baan2Word.exe. &lt;&gt;Baan2Word.exe will open the template file <br />
&lt;&gt;Locate the bookmarks and fill in the blanks. <br />
When it senses the line type is detail it will handle the table row in the template file iteratively. <br />
it will save the output doc file as suggested in field 1. <br />
<br />
It can handle any number of output files to be created. <br />
<br />
Finally it will create a batch file with a Start FileName.Doc for the user to see and print the output. <br />
<br />
If you would like to try it <br />
open ms-word <br />
place cursor at some point <br />
Insert+BookMark, provide a name <br />
close the window. <br />
Create as may BookMarks you need. <br />
To view the book marks <br />
Select tools menu, options check bookmarks on ok. <br />
The placed Book marks will be visible as 'I' <br />
<br />
<br />

Note: <br />
You must ensure there is a &quot;footer&quot; line type <br />
after (all of the) detail line type. The footer bookmark value may also be filled with &quot; &quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">11th July 2002, 21:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick question, when you say that you then allow the user<br />
to see the doc and print it is the printing something they<br />
manually do, or is this automated ? eg. Using word macros ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sitarammani</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 04:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The user prints the documents manually.<br />
No macros defined anywhere in the document.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dstuchly</div><div class="date">7th December 2004, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Your solution sounds interesting. To test it, the executable Baan2Word.exe ist needed. I am not able to build it from the VB source (I have only Office XP installed but no Visual Basic). Could you help, please?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sitarammani</div><div class="date">7th December 2004, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sorry it would be very difficult for me to send you the compiled exe.<br />
I am sure someone around should be able to help out.</div></div><hr />
