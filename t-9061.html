<br />
I am using Seagate Info 7.5.2, Database - Oracle 8i<br />
<br />
When I run a report in &quot;Info Report Designer&quot; it runs fine with the expected output.<br />
<br />
But when I schedule the same report in Info Desktop, it fails.<br />
The error message given in the properties of the failed report is nothing but the &quot;path&quot; where the Seagate report is saved on the server.<br />
<br />
Any idea on why the report fails?<br />

Are you running this report using the Baan driver or ODBC to Oracle. Also, try this too, when you schedule the report, on the logon tab, check the checkbox at the bottom left called: Test connectivity only. This might give you a more meaningful message to see if you have any data source connection issues. What format are you trying to publish the report in: Crystal, Excel, Rich Text, etc. I have found that the layout on some reports will fail if sent to Excel because it can't resolve them.<br />

<br />
I am running this report using ODBC to Oracle.<br />
<br />
I checked the &quot;Test connectivity&quot; checkbox when scheduling the report. The report gives status as &quot;DB Tested&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am trying to get an &quot;Excel&quot; output of the report. However, the report layout is quite simple. It has just the table, formula fields being displayed.<br />
<br />
One thing I'd like to mention about the report is that it uses 4 subreports. I don't know as to whether this should cause problems cuz I have 3 more Seagate reports that are using 4 subreports and they are running fine in Info Desktop.<br />
<br />
I have checked the &quot;Set location&quot; in each of the sub reports for correct &quot;Server Name&quot; and &quot;User ID&quot;. It seems to be okay.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">28th February 2003, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had occasions where some reports would not generate into Excel due to a change in the report layout. Crystal Decisions web site has some helpful documents and one of those is: &quot;Exporting to Microsoft Excel&quot; (scr_exportexcel.pdf). I'm sorry if I can't be more specific, but I don't know what your report looks like, and why this sometimes happens, other than it does. I don't think your subreports are an issue unless there is some alignment problem from the data being returned by those subreports. <br />
<br />
If the report generates to Crystal Report format OK, then examine the layout of the report. Use the document I mentioned as a guide for this. Best of luck and let me know how it turns out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sheetalj</div><div class="date">6th March 2003, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem in the report was solved by the arrangement of the sub-reports. Previously, all the 4 sub-reports were in the same section. Now, 2 sub-reports are placed in one section, and the other two in a separate section.<br />
<br />
The report now gives correct output in Excel format.<br />
<br />
However, I am still not clear as to why this should make a difference...but it worked!! <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
