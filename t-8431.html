But Baan Germany should know, probably you can ask them directly.<br />

<br />
I know that the intent of this question is from a functional perspective...are universities using Baan for their business needs.  My point is that Baan should be giving the software to business and computer science departments within universities.<br />
<br />
For example...Michigan State University's Business School was awarded a grant and software from another ERP player...JDE I believe...Baan should have done this...especially considering the proximity of Baan's GR facility to the MSU campus.  Michigan State's Supply Chain Management program is ranked #1 in the US (ahead of MIT, OSU, PSU etc...) and many potential software purchasing decision makers will come out of that school with a predisposition to select JDE based on familarity.<br />
<br />
This is a great marketing ploy that Baan should have taken advantage of.  They still should.</div></div><hr />
