<br />
I'm looking for a product or program which will do the following:<br />
<br />
Take a current invoice form(which was created in wordpad) and overlay it when the user prints an invoice. Also would like to have the invoice program to automatically create pdf's by invoice no in a desired directory.   <br />
<br />
Would like to do this for po, bill of lading, or any other report in Baan.<br />
<br />
We are currently using Baan IVc4.   <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
