<br />
As we have to customize and print Invoices with Crystal, we are trying to modify Baan reports with Crystal Reports.<br />
<br />
In the report script, we use the &quot;layout.again&quot; instruction (see example below):<br />
<br />
after.layout:<br />
	if i.boucle.lot &lt;= nb.comp.lot<br />
	then<br />
		layout.again()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
But when we print via Crystal, only the last evaluation of the layout is printed. The &quot;layout.again()&quot; in an &quot;after.field&quot; seems to be wrongly interpretated in Crystal. <br />
<br />
Have you any idea on the subject? We cannot change the Baan script and we don't know how to carry on with this issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

It is however not the ideal output and document management tool. Go to the english pages on www.versionone.nl and see the Baan integration that is presented as part of the solutions<br />

Hope that helps<br />

You're both right, and we knew Crystal used in &quot;push&quot; mode was not the ideal tool for that purpose. But we have here to face to a customer wish ... it was part of the contract ...</div></div><hr />
