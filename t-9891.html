<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sujoy.sen</div><div class="date">6th May 2003, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">While trying to write an AFS routine for tisfc0520m000 / tisfc0120s000, came across a problem with one of the questions that is asked in the session(s). There are three questions asked when I run the session(s) manually. I want to take the default answer for all three. The first two work fine, but for the third question, the default answer is not being taken. I tried to force the answer to the third question through the code, trying both session codes in the argument to stpapi.enum.answer but nothing seems to work. The fragment of code where this problem is happening is:<br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tisfc0520m000&quot;, &quot;tisfc001.pdno&quot;, prod_order)<br />
	ret1 = stpapi.find(&quot;tisfc0520m000&quot;, error_msg1)<br />
	if ret1 then		<br />
       		ret2 = stpapi.synchronize.dialog(&quot;tisfc0520m000&quot;, &quot;modify&quot;, error_msg2)<br />
       		if ret2 then<br />
               		stpapi.put.field(&quot;tisfc0120s000&quot;, &quot;tisfc001.qtdl&quot;, qty_deliv) <br />
		|	stpapi.enum.answer(&quot;tisfc0120s000&quot;, &quot;tisfc01021&quot;, tcyesno.yes)<br />
		|	stpapi.enum.answer(&quot;tisfc0120s000&quot;, &quot;tisfc02029&quot;, tcyesno.yes)<br />
			stpapi.enum.answer(&quot;tisfc0520m000&quot;, &quot;tisfc02023&quot;, tcyesno.yes)<br />
			ret3 = stpapi.update( &quot;tisfc0520m000&quot;, true, error_msg3)<br />
		|	suspend(10000)<br />
       		endif<br />
	endif<br />
	stpapi.end.session(&quot;tisfc0520m000&quot;, error_msg4)<br />
<br />
The Baan question code that is causing the problem is tisfc02023. I could work around this problem by invoking and executing a different session but I was wondering if there was a way to make this work without doing that. I'd be interested to know if anyone has run into a similar problem and how they resolved it.</div></div><hr />

I would have expected all three to be for tisfc0120s000 - was this just a posting mistake? Or maybe it was just your last test.   Anyway  - the one time I had a sub-session not accepting a default answer I changed the code to use the main session.  I never really spent time trying the sub-session.<br />

I commented out the first two questions because they were working fine without any code being necessary. The third one wasn't and I was toggling back and forth between the main and sub sessions in the call to see if it would make a difference: it didn't. <br />

I would expect all three questions to have a stpapi.enum.answer. Do you have the source where you could put it in debug mode?  May not be worth your time if you can code it another way.<br />

<br />
How did you know that it is the third question that was failed to be handled by AFS? Was it because all the details went in but the backflushing wasn't done? What's the content of error_msg3?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sujoy.sen</div><div class="date">7th May 2003, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">The first two questions are:<br />
tisfc01021 - Preceding operations will be updated! Continue anyway?<br />
tisfc02029 - Process Inbound Procedure automatically when activating Warehouse Order Receipt Line?<br />
Both of these have their default answer set to Yes. According to the documentation, stpapi.enum.answer must only be used for questions where the default answer needs to be overruled. I assumed that meant that for questions where the default answer is acceptable, stpapi.enum.answer would not be necessary. The first two questions seem to bear this out. I know the default answer (Yes) is being taken for both, by checking Preceding Operations and the Production Orders Inbound Lines after running the AFS routine.<br />
<br />
The third question is:<br />
tisfc02023 - Backflush materials/hours immediately?<br />
The default answer for this is Yes, too. But I know it is not being taken because materials and hours are not getting backflushed. If I run the session manually, and click Yes on this question, backflushing does happen. I tried to force a Yes on this question using stpapi.enum.answer and I tried it with both the main session and the sub session in the call but I can't get it to backflush. <br />
<br />
My alternative would be to backflush using tisfc0220m000 and I would need to write in the appropriate AFS calls in the code to make it happen. However, I was really curious why the backflushing wasn't happening through tisfc0520m000 / tisfc0120s000 and I wanted to see if there was something that I was missing.<br />
<br />
The content of error_msg3 is &quot;U&quot;. I put my code (the library with calls to the STP API Handler) in debug mode but that hasn't helped very much so far. We'll see, I guess I'll have to go with the alternative approach. Thank you all for your help. Appreciate it.<br />

Wanted to give you guys an update on the AFS routine that I was writing. My code now looks like this:<br />

		stpapi.put.field(&quot;tisfc0220m000&quot;, &quot;compl.oper.only&quot;, str$(etol(tcyesno.no)))<br />
		stpapi.set.report(&quot;tisfc0220m000&quot;, &quot;tisfc022002000&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, error_msg7)<br />
		stpapi.form.command(&quot;tisfc0220m000&quot;, 5, &quot;proc.backflush&quot;, error_msg5)<br />
		stpapi.end.session(&quot;tisfc0220m000&quot;, error_msg6)<br />
	endif<br />
	<br />
	return(true)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
The good news is that everything works the way I would like it to :) .  However, I did go back and tried overriding the answer on the second question (as a test), and I was not able to; and this was after my unsuccessful attempts with the third question! I am not using stpapi.enum.answer in this code anymore (it's all commented out). <br />
<br />
I am kind of new to AFS and my question would be: is using stpapi.enum.answer to answer questions usually a problem while using AFS? Is it just this particular session or is it just me? Should I be doing anything differently to make this work? Are there functions other than stpapi.enum.answer that would accomplish the same objectives more consistently? Any insight would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Sujoy.</div></div><hr />

I can not even recall what that sub-session was - in all other cases it has worked.  I have had to change the default answer to delete records.  You may just need a new object for the sub-session, but that may not work also.<br />
