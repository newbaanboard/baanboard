<br />
We want to create and update items. We think that we have to synchronize dialogs between multi/single occurrence sessions.<br />
<br />
Is there a stpapi function in BaanERP that can make this ? We have heard about the function stpapi.synchronize.dialog. But our BaanERP 5.0c, service pack 5, does not contain this function in the dll file ottstpapihand.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

Just set the child session not as a main session and on the parent session set it as a Synchronized session and then tell it which session (the child session you created) to synchronise with.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps?</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to Baan this function should be used, and our experience is that not using this will result in big trouble. <br />
<br />
If you get the latest version of the standard program from the Baan support site, you will also get all related components (one of these is ttstpapihand) and this will contain the stpapi.synchronize.dialog. On the Baan support site you can also find the latest document on using the api-functions. This contains examples of how to handle the synchronization of multi- and single occurrence sessions. <br />

Thank you for your answer. <br />
<br />
Could you please tell me what &quot;the latest version of the standard program&quot; is. Do you mean service pack 6 ?</div></div><hr />

could you please also tell me where to find on the Baan support site the latest document on using the api-functions and the name of the file.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Updates of standard program (and related components) are published quite often on the Baan support site. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how I found the document on the applicaton function server which contains the description on how to use the ttstp.api functions, but as I have the document I attached it.<br />
<br />
Success</div></div><hr />

<br />
we tried to install solution 121657 on top of SP5 but have not been lucky. After the installation of the solution 121657 we had to restore our system, because a lot of sessions have been corrupted (we lost a some buttons (OK, Continue, Close, ...) in a lot of screens and therefore the system could no longer be used). <br />
<br />
Do you know another solution that contains the  stpapi.synchronize.dialog and can be installed on SP5? <br />
<br />
Or should we first update to SP6 and then install a solution ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Youp2001</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several solutions that should contain this function. Whether they can be installed on servicepack 5 I don't know. <br />
<br />
I checked our 5c system and it does not contain recent tools-solutions. We had problems synchronizing sessions in 5b (sp10)and for this we have installed solution 119947 as latest solution. <br />
<br />
I will try to test things on our 5c (sp6) system shortly and let you know if I find anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">depp_baan</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">That means the next step will be to install SP6. Thank you again.</div></div><hr />
