<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yogrind</div><div class="date">21st April 2004, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone,<br />
I have now read some of the forum concerning AFS and 'AFS Developer's Guide'. <br />
<br />
I would be pleased to hear comments on the following:<br />
<br />
1 no extra BaaN DLLs have to be written in order to control sessions<br />
2 when used through AFS, sessions perform same validation, table updates etc as if used through BW client (manually entered data)<br />
3 can you 'record' AFS script like eg you record excel macros?<br />
4 can BaaN get unstable if AFS script fails?<br />
<br />
I would like to take control over some BaaN sessions in order to automate data entering into accounting statements.<br />
<br />
Any opinions/suggestions, links or examples are more than welcome.<br />
<br />
I am sorry if this post sounds stupid.<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

Please note that not all sessions are API friendly and sometimes owning source code helps.  Some work arounds can be difficult.<br />
<br />
(2) Yes it does use the edit checks from the session.  Please note that not always do all events get called.  This can result in some problems, but again usually you can work around this.<br />
<br />
(3) No not that I am aware of.  I run the session manually and just keep track of what it does.  <br />
<br />
(4) Not sure about Baan getting unstable, but you can run into problems with patches.  Also if you put bad data then it can cause problems. Example you want to transfer 4 in a bin to bin and you send 6. It works but you caused the problem.<br />
<br />
These sound bad but I use API function servers all the time.<br />
