<br />
I have never tried it, but we started an archiving project at a b4 installation September 2000, and during the project pre-study we decided to migrate to c4 before archiving. <br />
The reason was that Baan couldn't give us any references on archiving with b4, and they also adviced us to migrate before archiving.<br />
We set up the archive company after the migration, and we didn't have any problems at all. We followed the standard procedure from Baan, described in a White Paper called &quot;Baan IV Archiving&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zaidlaz</div><div class="date">8th January 2002, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently trying out B4C4 archiving. Our Baan is with SP4. The required patches for Baan Archiving showed solutions links to SP6. Due to the seriousness (data integrity related) of the patches I think I have to perform a service pack upgrade (from SP4 - SP6) prior to Baan archiving. My question is :-<br />
1) Is SP upgrade necessary if one have only SP4 in order to do B4c4 archiving?<br />
2) How stable is SP6?<br />
<br />
I hope someone have answers to this qustions . Thank you.<br />

<br />
I will advice you to uppgrade to SP6 before you start your archiving project. I can't tell you why, I'm just refering advices given by Baan.<br />
I have done an archiving project on SP6, and we didn't have any problems at all.<br />
My knowledge regarding SP6 is from Norwegian Baan customers, and I do think that most of them have done an uppgrade to SP6, and they are pleased with it. <br />
One and a half year ago I did a migration project from IVb to IVc, and the plan was to install SP4. We did, tested and decided to go for SP5 (that was a misstake) because of to many bugs in SP4. At last, we ended at SP6, and it worked exelent.<br />
My advice is:<br />
1) Install SP6,<br />
2) Archive<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
