<br />
I have been succesfull in implementing Archiving and Archiving data for more than a year in Baan5.0 c environment.<br />
<br />
Due to changes to some of the common tables (Business Partners, Address, etc.,) I thought it is good to share these tables between Archive company and Non-Archive company. Since these tables sharing I have experienced problems where the program wipes out Parent Business Partner field in related Business Partner tables (tccom100, tccom110, tccom111, tccom112, tccom114, tcccom120, tccom121 and tccom122).<br />
<br />
I don't see any documentation by Baan where they mention not to share these tables. Have any of you encountered this problem ? If so what was your remeial measure. Can you tell me which scripts are responsible in updating the above mentioned tables. Is table sharing a bad idea, if not do you think this is a defect and Baan has to fix this problem.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your response.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Though I have given the necessary information to you, I am posting here for other's sake.<br />
<br />
While setting up archiving companies, you should NEVER shared the general data or master data tables between live companies and archive companies.<br />
<br />
For example, in the Business Partner table, there is a field which refers to another Business Partner. We call this reference as cyclic reference. Assume there are BP A, B and C, where BP A has reference to BP C in its record.<br />
<br />
While archiving the BPs for the first time (where there is no BP entry in Archive Companies), if the BP A is copied as it is, there will be reference error because BP A is referring to BP C in Archive Company, which is not yet present in the Archive Company.<br />
<br />
Hence, while archiving the tables with cyclic references, Baan first copies the records without any reference. In our case, BP A will be copied to Archive Company without reference to BP C. In the second pass, it will copy the exact record to Archive Companies. At this point, BP C is already present in Archive Company and hence there will be no reference error.<br />
<br />
In case if you have shared the tables, during the first pass, Baan will remove the reference and saves the record in Archive Companies. Because of table sharing, when the system updates the BP record in Archive Company, it is actually updating the record in Live Company and you end up loosing information.<br />
<br />
Note: For simplicity sake, you should NEVER share master data between Live Compaines and Archive Companies. But if you know the tables that have cyclic reference (check tccom.dll0026 DLL), then you can share the master data tables, excluding the ones having cyclic reference.<br />
