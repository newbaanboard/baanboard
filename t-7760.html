When defining an aggregate function in a report field, the report compiler internally assigns a variable for it (eg. &quot;total..1&quot;).  So, you may do calculations in the report like value = total..1 / total..3, but this is generally not advisable, since the field names are likely to change if you introduce new report fields.<br />
<br />
This could easily be overcome if one could enter a variable name that should be used for such an aggregate field. The report compiler would then use that particular variable name instead of a generated one.<br />
<br />
With this litte enhancement e.g. percentage calculation on total fields would be much faster to implement than today.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">21st November 2002, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure I could (and actually I have to do this right now, because there is no better way). But were talking about enhancements here, and it would be a great enhancement if I wouldn't have to code such a &quot;standard&quot; functionality from scratch each time I need it. And I need it a lot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">21st November 2002, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.  I see your point.  It doesn't seem like a big deal to me because I don't have to do it that often but if I did, I can see how it would get a little tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g√ºnther</div><div class="date">13th May 2004, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been programming lots of &quot;high sophisticated&quot; reports for our controlling department. The typical demand is exactly what ulrich likes.<br />
<br />
I guess that *lots* of reports out there do their own total calculation, again and again. <br />
<br />
If you are familiar with other reporting tools (e.g. Crystal) you know that this is really a pain.<br />
<br />
Another examle:<br />
Imagine a user wants to see the total on the first line, and then the details. How would you do that in Baan; 10 Lines of Code, 100 Lines?</div></div><hr />
