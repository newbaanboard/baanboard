<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomasm</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for a way to automate Maintain Receipts for via EDI received Early Shipment Notices.<br />
<br />
When using EDI you maintain your receipts based on records in table tdpur400. What you do is in the session tdpur4120m000 go to the field form.dino and zoom (in the field) to open session tdpur4580s000. This session displays the records in tdpur400. Then you select a record and exit. This will create the receipt and insert all the lines for the packing slip. Now you can update the delivered quantity and save.<br />
<br />
What is important here is to pick the records from the table tdpur400 via the zoom, because this allows for the (EDI) invoice to be automatically matched later. Just creating the receipts manually does not give you the invoice matching.<br />
<br />
So basically what I think I am looking for is a way to zoom from a field in AFS. How is this done?<br />
<br />
Other ways to get the EDI functionality working, as an alternative, would also be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know of a way to force a zoom on a specific field.  Which session actually does the work - tdpur4120m000 or tdpur4580s000?  Is tdpur4580m000 an option that you can use?  Since we do not use EDI, I just thought I would ask.  Do you own source for tdpur4120m000?<br />
<br />
One thing to try is to clone tdpur4120m000 to a new session like tdpur9999m000.  Then copy only the form from tdpur4120m000 to the new session.  Change the form.dino field on this session to be an automatic zoom.  Then see if you can control it or activate it by executing a insert or something.  It might take some time to figure this out and I have never tried it.<br />
<br />
Or you could try adding it to the special menu and use stpapi.application.option to try to activate it.  Just not sure if there are some before or after zoom sections on the field.<br />

<br />
As we do not own the source I am a bit limited here, but I have an old copy laying around that I can look into for information.<br />
<br />
You are right about it being tdpur4580s000 doing the actual work. So one way could be to build a maintain session around the script tdpur4580, to be able to call Continue (where all the action is). A somewhat dangerous choice, but it could be a start for a proper customisation. It will also need some extra work to keep track of what have been done in the different sessions.<br />
<br />
But first I will try playing with the automatic zoom in the field.<br />
<br />
If I succed I will let you know.<br />

I can call the subsession but it needs to be zoomed to for everything to work.<br />
<br />
So then I changed strategy and it turns out the EDI does not require any special way of handling receipts, which i initially thought. So I will build a solution based on a select from the table tdpur400 (holding the early shipping notices) and use the data to maintain receipts the 'normal' way. I will then simply delete the records from tdpur400 as I use them. I have tested it manually and I have also confirmed with Baan Support that no special handling of the tdpur400 records are needed.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

The thing that lets you use the interim table for Dispatch Advice is through EDI using the message 856, Advance Shipping Notice (in). Once you processed the message, it automatically updates the table and by then you can use the zoom function for packing slip upon receiving. :)  :)  :)</div></div><hr />
