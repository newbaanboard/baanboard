<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smiffy</div><div class="date">3rd January 2002, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently developing a session in baan, which uses stpapi functionality.  It has become necessarry to perform an execute(add.set) command in the called session.<br />
<br />
To achieve this, API.MODE must be set to false temporarily.  However, this means that the screen is displayed (in black), and user intervention is required if a message should be displayed.  For a particular instance, I can detect if my new session called the session and not display the message.  This particular session has many instances, where it is possible that a message could be displayed.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to set a flag or something in baan to stop messages being displayed, rather than putting a condition around each message ?<br />

thanks</div></div><hr />

I haven't tried to use the same text I was defining within the definition (but you could try it), but you could always make up a DLL call that actually issued a mess() command.  For example:<br />
<br />
#define mess(...)<br />
^ if API.MODE then<br />
^     mydll.callmess(...)<br />
^ endif<br />
<br />
Obviously, it would be nicer/cleaner if line 3 could just be mess(...), but I don't know if that would cause recursion problems :eek: .<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />
