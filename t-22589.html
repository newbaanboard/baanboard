The latest released version is ipack6.0 (+ow 2.5) but the rumor is that this is not an industry wide spread version. It seems nobody is actually live with this one. On the other hand our consultant says some bugs are in ipack4.1 and when he reported them with SSA support before they said to upgrade to 6.0<br />
<br />
Can anybody share some info or a light on this matter? Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />
