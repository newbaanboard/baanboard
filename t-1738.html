Or am I just to silly to use Crystal Reports?<br />
<br />
I have one group: tccom010.nama<br />
and a second group tdsls040.orno<br />
<br />
They are sorted like this, first Customer name, then Order number.<br />
<br />
However, my output is always sorted by order number, and I get a new Customer header for each order (not sorted by name, but by the orders).<br />
<br />
What am I missing here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">18th April 2002, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">First, have you tried contacting Crystal Support? They have always been able to resolve issues for us.<br />
<br />
Second, check your &quot;File - Options - Database&quot; and see if you have &quot;Grouping on Server&quot; checked and also check to see if it is checked in the &quot;File - Reports Options&quot; as well. There is an issue with passing grouping control to the Baan driver which does not seem to perform it. Since Crystal thinks that the grouping/sorting is already done on the returning data, it does not do any further sorting or grouping at the local level. When we disabled the Group on Server it immediately resolved the problem.<br />
<br />
Third, I'm sure this is not improving your opinion of Crystal and the Baan driver. Crystal Decisions very much cares about customer satisfaction and improving their products. They do listen to their customers. I know, because they have listened to me.</div></div><hr />
