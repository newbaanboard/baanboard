One area is automating Baan sessions. Could you folks give me some examples of what Baan sessions you have automated ? such as maybe printing an order ack after the user has created an order etc.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd March 2004, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done lots of them with still more to come. Do you want actual sessions?  If so I would probably be a while.  Anyway Inventory transfers, inventory adjustments, creating purchase orders, Receipts, Maintain Appovals, Inbound(Production and Purchase Orders), Completing production orders, creating MDDs (complete load for our sim company).  I am sure I am forgetting some and I did not mention all the sub-sessions that get controlled along with them.  One good example is storing a production order.  The inventory person would have to compete the operation, complete the order, maintain inbound and then release inbound.  My session has 4 inputs and runs all those sessions for the user.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">2nd March 2004, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark, thanks for the reply.  What I am after is more of a functional description.  ie - in order to cut down on the time it took to process a sales quote we used AFS to generate the sales order as soon as the sales quote was confirmed....this sort of thing.... I am looking as mainly Distribution and Finance related sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd March 2004, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently working on using Baan Finance.  A few API sessions have already been created.  I am sure more will be created eventually.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this helps, but for our Inventory Stores session we previously had 2-3 people doing receipts and several doing the stores.  We had a 3 day store window for parts and was not meeting that time frame.  By automating these sessions we have reduced the number doing receipts to 1 fulltime and 1 part time help.  Not sure about the stores piece, but from looking at the charts they presented last week we doubled the number of receipts will reducing the staff.  We are also now meeting if not exceeding the 3 day store window. There has not been a reduction in force because of this, the staff is being used in other inventory functions.<br />
<br />
We have processed thousands of inventory transfers and adjustments.  This prevented the user from having to enter the transaction,locations and other info thousands of times.  This is probably the oldest API session.<br />
<br />
In all cases I can justify a savings on just keeping the user from having to manually enter data on 2/3 baan sessions when one session with only mandatory input is used(or using file input).  It may only be minutes per transaction, but after hundreds of transactions this produces some noteworthy savings.<br />
