Does anybody take AFS control on ttaad4100 session?<br />
Thank's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure that would work.  If I was going to work on a table I would just do it through a select with update.  Maybe if you could explain what you are attempting someone else will have a better idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to uncertain nature of fields and ASCII interface there is high probability that AFS will not work on ttaad4100 . <br />
<br />
Probably dynamic query can server ur purpose.  <br />
<br />
Also u can try a ttaad4100 like session setting pre-defined variable main.table$ in before.program section of a program (don't change this through-out the program). Normal main table io will be taken care by standard program . For mass changes (like choice 4,5 , 6, ) in GTM , u need to write dynamic query .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">GTM is a 3-GL program and as far as I understand AFS can be used if only you have a 4-Gl Session Interface.<br />
<br />
From the AFS guides -<br />
<br />
AFS-DLL A Baan ERP DLL, which contains the calls to the API-handler for a specific <br />
Baan 4GL application session<br />
API Application Programming Interface<br />
API-handlerThe program, which serves outside the application to call the functionality <br />
of the Baan 4GL application sessions<br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
The preferred method of integration between Baan IV and Baan ERP<br />
systems (Baan IVc, Baan ERP 5.x and Baan ERP 6.1) and third party<br />
products is by means of Business Object Interfaces or BOIs. BOIs provide an<br />
Application Programming Interface (API) for the Baan ERP business logic.<br />
BOIs are executed in the context of BCBE, OpenWorld or OpenWorldX<br />
Adapter.<br />
The high level interfaces provided by the BOIs cannot be used directly<br />
against the Baan ERP business logic due to the Baan ERP architecture. The<br />
business logic is implemented by means of sessions, which are primarily user<br />
interface based. Programmatic access to sessions is provided by means of a<br />
low-level message protocol. This message protocol is encapsulated into a set<br />
of function primitives called the Application Function Server (AFS); these<br />
functions are located in the API-handler. The BOI code accesses the session<br />
business logic by means of the AFS. The public, high-level interfaces<br />
exposed by the BOIs are internally translated to the low level primitives<br />
understood by the AFS, which then communicates with the session logic by<br />
means of the message protocol.<br />
<br />
The sessions started by the AFS must be 4GL sessions. 3GL sessions<br />
(without a form and a script of type 3GL (Without Std.Prog)) cannot be<br />
carried out with the AFS.<br />
<br />
So my Q is - why do you want to take AFS control on ttaad4100 session?<br />
You should explain your requirements clearly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">16th August 2004, 08:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you<br />
I've just interested in did anybody an extraordinary thing or not  :) <br />
The idea was to have possibilities to automate ANY (not only 4gl but with tools sessions and other) manual operations and if it possible to use AFS for this purpose.<br />
Unfortunately, it is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">16th August 2004, 08:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what exactly u meant. AFS on 4GL session (including tools session) is possible. U can definitely automate manual tools session like print user history , print GTM log etc if  that's frequent and u know the selection parameters in advance. So  unique sessions like ttada4100 , ttstpqbf , ttstperrlog, tgbrg process editor , chart browsers  etc may be out of the purview of AFS .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">16th August 2004, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hitesh Shah!<br />
No (any) limitation to use AFS with 4gl (ordinary) tools sessions?<br />
Baan does not provide any (maybe license and so on) restriction, does it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">16th August 2004, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">All u have to have is Baan tools development license. U can check for AFS on tools (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=8338&amp;highlight=AFS+tools)</div></div><hr />
