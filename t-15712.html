I just started using the above system variable. In the Baan docus I found that it is set to true, if a session is called from AFS. But if I check in the debugger, api.mode is set to &quot;2&quot; not &quot;true&quot;. True is IMHO &quot;1&quot;?<br />
<br />
What values can this api.mode have?<br />
<br />
(I'm on Baan 5.0 c)</div></div><hr />

I ran a couple of tests and when I ran the session manually it was 0.  In afs mode it was 1.  I checked the new document that Baan sent me, but it just said the variable needs to be declared as extern long.  It never mentioned what values it could have, but all the tests used it like a boolean variable.<br />

<br />
what you described is, how I expected things should be. But also strange all the code with api.mode I found was realised in that way &quot;if api.mode then....&quot;, or &quot;if  not api.mode then...&quot; so that there is no difference of api.mode equals to one or to two.<br />
I will keeping watching it. Trying to find a case where api.mode equals to one on our system.</div></div><hr />
