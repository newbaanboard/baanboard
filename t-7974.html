<br />
Is there any change to call a subsession that is listed in the zoom menu for the session?<br />
I have a session (still tdpur4120m000) that has only one zoom option for it. <br />
That zoom option in turn calls a menu that has 5 subsessions available.<br />
I need to call the 3rd session.<br />
<br />
Reading the afs doc it seems I should use:<br />
<br />
<br />
  stpapi.handle.subproc(&quot;tdpur4120m000&quot;,&quot;tdpur4131s000&quot;,&quot;add&quot;)<br />
  stpapi.handle.subproc(&quot;tdpur4120m000&quot;,&quot;menu_name&quot;,&quot;3&quot;)<br />
  stapi.zoom.option(&quot;tdpur4120m000&quot;,1,&quot;tdpur4131s000&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
It always hangs during the zoom.option() call. Doing a ps in the shell I can see it opens the first subsession listed in the menu and not the one I requested for.<br />
Did anyone work with this type of menu yet?<br />
I found out the menu name in the  &quot;maintain menus&quot; session under the name of tdpur00009030. <br />
I tried using that name, also I tried the Baan codification &quot;mtdpur000090301&quot; to no sucess.<br />
The document I use for AFS reference also has Baan V functions listed so maybe I can't do this in Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

I just do a stpapi.zoom to the other session.  I have never zoomed to a menu and am not sure how that works.  Do you have to zoom to the menu to see the session?  You may want to search this forum - I think Lisa posted something about zooming to menus not too long ago.<br />

<br />
I have to open the subsession through the menu. <br />
The session dropdown just displays &quot;zoom CTRL+B&quot;. It then displays the menu where I have to select the subsession.<br />
I think that option is controlled via code since it displays that menu or zooms directly to a subsession depending in the phase of data entry.<br />
I tried not to call the zoom session but it seems the only way to add more lines to the receipt. I just need to be able to add more lines to finish it since I can already do a complete reception (including lots) for one order line. :cool:<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th December 2002, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if you could get the data from the tables rather than the subsession.  I just went and did a test - on our system when I zoomed to the sub-session it looks like it just returned data to the main session.  So is it possible for you to lookup the data in the tables and just do put fields on the Maintain Receipt Session? I am not an expert, but it looks to me like you could just add the records to the receipt. <br />
<br />
Also in both cases when I zoomed the session was right under the application button. I was wondering if you could just add this session so that you see it under the drop down on application.  Just something to try.  On our system you see 4 sessions, then zoom.  You select zoom to get the menu which has select receipts.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
I tought of adding the subsession to the application dropdown before but I was afraid it didn't return the correct values. <br />
I have this bad habit of trying everything first using code and then touching the sessions ;) (except in reports). <br />
I just had a closer look to the subsession and you're right. It just returns values to the session. I wanted to use that subsession because it lists depending on a status field and I'm not really sure about that criteria yet.<br />
So I will try to add it to the application dropdown to see if it works.<br />
This one is really tough (my second AFS, the first was employees)but I'm learning a lot of new things because of it. <br />
<br />
Thanks once more,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you check in your screen for the session tdpur4120m000 what is the code of the user option user.* used to call the select receipt subsession? The ones I tried didn't work.<br />
<br />
I also tried to change the menu order so as to make select receipts the first in the list. It worked but zoom.option still calls the old first session in the list. I also followed your suggestion of inputing the fields directly into the main session but I'm missing something. When I call insert, it creates a new receipt instead of adding a new line to the one selected. In our system the insert line button is greyed out in the toolbar. When I try update it updates the first line inserted. Do you have any idea on how to insert new lines in a session like this?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I don't have source code for tdpur4120m000 or tdpur4131s000.<br />
Maybe I understood you wrong but didn't you say you have tdpur4131s000 available in the application options? (I mean that can be called by stpapi.application.option())<br />
Maybe the only option is to insert directly into the main session but I can't do it.<br />

So it is not directly under applications.  I thought you might be able to add it there, but it looks like the way they have it setup you need the source code in order to add this as a user option. I have the source for tdpur4120m000, but not tdpur4131s000.<br />
<br />
I though since I was going to have to develop one in a month or so I would start on it.  So I did this just to see if I could do a receipt.<br />

 	stpapi.browse.view( &quot;tdpur4131s000&quot;, &quot;last.view&quot;)<br />
 	stpapi.browse.set( &quot;tdpur4131s000&quot;, &quot;first.set&quot;)<br />

 	stpapi.end.session(&quot;tdpur4120m000&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I did this a test function server - it works the first time through. If I run it twice it locks up on the 	stpapi.browse.view( &quot;tdpur4131s000&quot;, &quot;last.view&quot;).  In effect I can not even create two receipts for the same PO.  The last view gets a supplier that has three records.  Not sure what to do at this point. I will look at it some more next week.<br />
<br />
You did mention that you could do mutliple receipts, but it appears that does not work for me.  Is there a reason you have to do one receipt? In my last inventory meeting I talked with our users about this and what they do is everything gets a new receipt. So I will be lucky in that respect - of course I have to get it working first.<br />

<br />
They want orders with different numbers to be on different receipts but orders with the same number and different line numbers should all be in the same. <br />
Maybe I have to convice them to change that. I tought of another thing. If it was possible to mark several records it should them be easy to add multiple lines.<br />
<br />
The only reason I might see for it to lock up the second time out is that maybe the zoom.option() is not opening the subsession and so the next command on tdpur4131s000 just freezes. <br />
You might want to check if the second iteration is really generating a new receipt number because if it isn't the main session might behave in a different way if it works like mine (new receipt - change.view() opens tdpur4131s000, old receipt select - change view opens lot control).<br />
Also if you use a PO line in a receipt it might not be available the next time out because the status field for that order changes. That status field depends on the slip quantity and received quantity in some way I didn't quite understand yet because I don't have the source.<br />
<br />
This one is a pain :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I never did see you mention tdpur4224s000 - does your system bring up that session?  All it asks for is the order number.  When I enter that, do a continue, and return to the tdpur4120m000 session all of the order and lines are in the receipt.<br />

It would only find the first record.  You might want to try stpapi.application.option(&quot;tdpur4131s000&quot;,1,1,err) with tdpur4131s000 - it says it would mark all records.  It did not work for me also, but who knows you may have a more current object.<br />
<br />
Glad to see you have it working. :)<br />

<br />
I had a bad experience with browse and this session. It would only mark my first record in the list. (I guess it just works ok with find).<br />
The application option works for me but it doesn't really help me because I can't filter i.e. display just the lines I want with find (for every situation). Example: orno: 120001 and lines 10 &amp; 30.<br />
<br />
About the tdpur4224s000 session. Our consultant told us that this session can't be used with SP and c4?<br />
<br />
Maybe you could try it with find?</div></div><hr />

It still locks up when I try to modify a receipt and add a line - but I will not have to worry about that. So it looks like you actually solved your own problem and save d me some time - so thanks. :)<br />

We are getting ready to upgrade to C4 and A&amp;D 1(they changed this and I am not sure the actual number now).  At the same time we are doing a Baan finance conversion and some Inventory Automation.  The next year should be interesting.<br />
