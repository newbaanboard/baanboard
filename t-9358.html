<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frank holland</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all !<br />
<br />
I am trying to execute the session tdilc4201m000 (Generate Outbound Advice) through AFS (DLL tdilcf4201m000, BaanIVc4).<br />
<br />
Everything seems to work fine, except for one thing:<br />
the reports (outbound advices / shortages) are not printed.<br />
<br />
I have debugged tdilc4201, and found out that the following event is not executed:<br />
<br />
choice.print.data.on.choice <br />
<br />
so the report(s) is/are not opened.<br />
(the event print.data.before.choice is executed).<br />
<br />
I have had this problem before, when you forget to set all<br />
reports with set.report. However, in this case I do.<br />
<br />
Did anyone have this problem before ?<br />
Could it be that our version of API-handling is too old ?<br />
Does anyone have a working example of starting tdilc4201m000 ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help,<br />
Frank Holland</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not all Baan sessions are API &quot;compliant&quot;. The session you mention is one of them. API sessions that produce reports must open and close the reports in the choice.print.data section, or they will not accept the passed report parameters. <br />
<br />
All you can really do is put in a request to Baan, to make the session API compliant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the rule of thumb concerning handling reports !<br />
<br />
I have noticed before, that sessions with a special treatment of reports may not work with AFS.<br />
<br />
The only thing I do not understand: why does Baan deliver a AFS-dll for this session (tdilcf4201m000 in B40U_c4_stnd) when it is not AFS-compliant ?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
