<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th November 2003, 00:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the answer is yes.  The problem is I am not sure what it would take to get it working.  I do not know enough about the libraries - where they are and what they are called.  Anyway I figure C++ and VB would call these libraries.  I do not know where the attached document came from or even if it works, but I think someone could try this in C++.  Problem is someone needs a whole lot more client, VB and C knowledge than what I think I know.  My thoughts for the day. :)<br />
