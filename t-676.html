<br />
Can some one help me by explaining how to use DDC module with a small example?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

[list=1]<br />
 Pick a function server session.  These usually end in bxxx.  For example, tdilc4202b000 (Release Outbound)<br />
 Enter this into the function server list using Maintain DDC Function Servers (tuddc0120m000)<br />
 Run Query/Update Function Server (tuddc1212m000).  This creates the functions and fields in DDC.<br />
 Run Test Function Server (tuddc2530m000).  Pick a function.<br />
 Enter values for fields and choose continue to run the function server<br />
[/list=1]<br />
Obviously, there is much more to it.  You can attach middleware and then add handhelds, custom function servers, etc.  It really can be very powerful.  We have a number of customers running a variety of custom function servers, including: Hours Accounting, Maintain Receipts, Cycle Counting, Inbounding, Picking for Outbound, and several more.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.  Let me know if you need more information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for that info. It cleared many doubts.<br />
<br />
I was trying to test the Release outbound Function server. In the session tuddc2530s000 &quot;Test Function Server&quot; I gave the values for Item, Warehouse, Run No and Order No and then press continue. It gave me the following error.<br />
<br />
Can't read session or object (otuddcmonitor)<br />
<br />
What is this? It comes separately from BaaN?<br />
<br />
What does the session tuddc9201m000 &quot;Function Server Generator&quot; do?<br />
<br />

<br />
I got the object from baan support site. soln 1436stnd<br />
<br />
I tested the function server by giving item,order no etc for which outbound exists. I got the message DDC request processed succesfully but I am surprised to find the outbound for this item, order no is not released from the system. What i should do next to release the outbound from the system?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">28th December 2001, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;DDC Processed Successfully&quot; message should indicate that things performed as expected.  That could mean that it correctly did not release the outbound.  This would be similar to the situation you get when running the standard session and receiving the &quot;No data found...&quot; message.  Try releasing the outbound in the standard session.  If it works, then there is probably some problem with the standard function server.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if things have been cleared up lately, but Baan's standard function servers were notoriously buggy in the past.  That's why my company has written our own versions of these (as well as some sessions without standard function servers) and even combined some to streamline the process even more.  These seem to work well for our clients.<br />
<br />
The Generate Function Server session is used to convert an existing session into a function server.  For example (not that you would ever want to do this:) ), you could run it on the Maintain Warehouses session to create a function server to, well, maintain warehouses.  My experience is that this is usually a good starting point, but that you generally need to tinker with the code to get things the way you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much. There was some problem with the order. Now I created another order and the &quot;Outbound&quot; is released perfectly.<br />
<br />
Now can you tell me how the data comes from the Shop floor to the system? What are the drivers needed and what products are avbl in the market?<br />
<br />

<br />
Many companies have handheld devices or other data entry terminals (e.g., Intermec, Dolphin, Symbol).  These are linked via an RF system that is tied in to your network.  There is middleware that sits between the remote devices and Baan's DDC.<br />
<br />
There are many, many different function server applications that can be run on the handheld on the floor as I mentioned in a previous post.<br />
<br />
If you would like more information or specifics, please let me know.  My company, RMCis, offers a wide range of products and services in this area.  [My apologies for donning the sales hat :D ]</div></div><hr />

<br />
you need the source script of the session, the form and the session must also be in your development VRC so that the generate function servers works correctly.<br />
<br />
Therafter you can clean up the generated code., removing unused fields or function, setting fixed value etc.<br />
<br />
