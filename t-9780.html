The balance of the data would be moved to an archive company.  I am new to this end of the business, I have always created this data never worrying about how to dispose of it when it is no longer required.  Is there a standard methodology for addressing the tables.  I have been unable to find an archiving session for all of the affected areas.<br />
For the record, Baan IVc4, NAS, Informix, HP-UX.</div></div><hr />
