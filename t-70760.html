<br />
I am having a problem about AFS.<br />
I use stpapi.put.field() to put values into the mandatory fields.<br />
After that, I use stpapi.insert() to insert the record.<br />
I normally do something like this and all the works I have done can perform just fine.<br />
However, this session (tfacr1110s000) doesn't.<br />
After running the AFS code, it gives error pointing that a mandatory field is missing even though I just put it in before the insert line.<br />
After a while of investigating, I suspect that this stpapi.insert() clears the field itself and then gives error because it cannot insert since the field (it just cleared) is empty. I think because a field here has a default value for the field to be empty and it overwrites after the AFS had just finished its script.<br />
Am I misunderstanding anything?<br />
If not, is there a solution for this issue?<br />
Please help.<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Thana</div></div><hr />

Hard to say exactly what might be happening but it sounds reasonable.  In a couple of situations like this our solution was to use qkey to modify the source code - assuming you do not own source.  Other times I have done a save followed by an update.  I think even in one place I had to do an update with the update flag set to false before I could get something like an insert to work.  Not familiar with LN or that session so just relating some of the stuff I have done in 4c4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">17th January 2018, 04:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I will try what you suggested and let you know if the solutions work.<br />
By the way, please tell me more about QKEY and how can I get it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">17th January 2018, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried your solutions except QKEY and all of them did not work.<br />
Using Save and then Update results in &quot;Command Disabled&quot;.<br />
Using Update with flag set to false and then Insert results in the same error as I had before -- the field is empty.<br />
I really want to try QKEY. Please advice.<br />

<br />
Qkey is no longer supported or available.  Qkey is basically a source extender like what ~vamsi posted in http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=559 the code and utilities forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">18th January 2018, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I explore every reply in the link you gave me. I came up with a method to stpapi.put.field() only on tfacf200.itbp and then insert. It can actually insert the record to the database. After that, I put other fields in and update, and I found that field tfacr200.dued causes the issue. So, I put in every field other than tfacr200.dued and it works just fine now. I will try to update the field later but it is easier than before now because at least it is inserted into the database. <br />
Thank you so much for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th January 2018, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad you found the solution.  I know I do that exact same thing on my PO session - I create the PO then go back and update 1 field (and I actually use a select/update) to get it updated.  For some reason it would never update thru stpapi - I think it was buyer.</div></div><hr />
