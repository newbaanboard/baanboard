<br />
we use a &quot;stpapi.change.view()&quot;-call in an application. Retval of this functions tells us there is an error.  But when I ignore that error, an let the programm continue, everything is done right. <br />
Sometimes (not all the times), if I stop in debugger at the line, with the function call no error is returned. If I let the program pass this line with &quot;normal speed&quot; I mostly get an error.<br />
<br />
If I enter an &quot;suspend(2)&quot; before &quot;stpapi.change.view()&quot; itÂ´seems that everything run right.<br />
<br />
Can anybody explain this behaviour?</div></div><hr />

Since a time-out solves the problem it is probably the latter and what you are looking at here is a performance issue. <br />
<br />
Apparently (?) the put function does not wait for verification, which is probably why it does not have a return value and your code is simply dragging. The time-out command gives the database time to catch up with the program flow.<br />
<br />
Is the table that you insert to exceptionally large? Are the header fields not indexed? I would start in that direction to solve the mystery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
which header fields do you mean? Other fields on the form, which have to be filled?<br />
<br />
The source is not originally from me. I just looks where the problem comes from and find what I described.<br />
The problem comes up since we changed from SP10 to SP14 (Baan5c). Except of the changes caused through the new release there is no differnence in the code. <br />

Thanx<br />

I meant the group fields.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes you just have to wait for the processing to complete before sending more commands to the session. Franseco could be right about the header fields causing the problem in this case, but in some of mine it must just be processing time for the subsession.  If I recall correctly it seems like it usually has to do when I have a main session calling a sub-session, but I am not positive.  Usually when I get an error, but running in debug I do not get the error I just add the suspend statement and then forget about.<br />

agree. But I think somehow should Baan take care about synchronisation of processes.</div></div><hr />
