<br />
Remember when you want to create a path code with the components of a customization parts and then open 4 or 5 sessions do this?<br />
<br />
After that you wanna send the dump to other environment(most of times production) and the next step it's open your FTP client and blah blah blah...<br />
<br />
Well, you got an alternative(but only if you use ERP LN =P)!<br />
<br />
We created a session that generate a Patch Code with a range of Customization part and then give you the option of send the dump for your pc or to another  remote server(another IP, user, server etc...)<br />
<br />
Steps<br />
<br />
 Insert the Patch Code Name(if it is not already created the session creates a new one)<br />
 Insert the range os customization parts<br />
 If the Path Code exists the program will load all values of it, else it will bring the default values of the current user<br />
 Inserting a Local directory, a ftp will be done for it<br />
 On Form 2 you can check the option to transfer the dump for a remote server<br />
 Save your predefinitions and enjoy it =)<br />
<br />
<br />
The pictures are on the file forms.zip(baanBoard do not accept .bmp). The others are verions Ascii and Binary for it<br />
<br />
Hope you like it!</div></div><hr />

Guess that's the reason why no comments have been posted(at least you could send me a warning u.u).<br />
<br />
Well,<br />
<br />
 The source in on the attachments now =)</div></div><hr />
