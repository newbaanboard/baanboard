<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camdaddy</div><div class="date">20th December 2004, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been using Event Manager to automatically run data load jobs for quite some time.  Recently I have been having problems with the jobs hanging.  When looking at Task Manager, the rtdsk50.exe process seems to be hung and using 100% CPU time.  Rebooting the server and running the jobs manually has been our workaround.  This problem seems to occur randomly and I really don't know where to focus my troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced a similar problem or offer advice on how to troubleshoot problems with rtdsk50.exe?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
