<br />
I have a script (AFS) who is calling the session Sales Invoice (tfacr1110s000) to create  Sales Invoice and Credit Note. It is working fine if transaction type is Sales Invoice, but if the transaction type is Credit Note then Document (tfacr200.ninv) is not getting generated.<br />
<br />
May you please help?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
CR</div></div><hr />

You can try posting the relevant code pointing to where the session is having the problem.  You can also try to layout what steps you do manually.  I doubt my 4c4 code would be any help.  You can try searching this forum for the session numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Mark said, every Transaction type has its own Session and Next session maintained. But in your case, Sales Invoices &amp; Credit Note transaction type should have similar sessions. <br />
<br />
First suggestion will be to try to create one manually and check if its working. Also, check the Main Session and Next Session defined for the Credit Note Transaction Type. Check if the series is not full. Once all this is validated, you can have an idea.<br />
<br />
Its best to post your code to get a better help.</div></div><hr />
