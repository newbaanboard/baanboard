<br />
Does anyone know if it is necessary to have your Baan archive company on the same server?  I know it is necessary to have the archive company on the same VRC, but what about the same server? <br />
<br />
If it is not necessary, what would be the implications of putting your archive company on a different server?  Has anybody tried this?  We are evaluating this strategy to reduce IT maintenance costs.  Any advice or feedback would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

We have done only limited archiving but we have the archive coy in a separate oeacle instance.  The database instance can be on another server with out any special considerations. The TWO_TASK variable indicates to baan that it is on another machine and that oracle tns has to resolve the location/address<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

This is due to necessity of space constraints.  When the data is fully removed, the history company will be created on the local server.<br />
<br />
Once set up, it works very well - although there can be perfomance issues taking so much data across the wire.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">14th December 2002, 07:20</div></div><div class="posttext">From a general support standpoint there is no reason why the archive company has to be on the same server.  I encourage people to put the archive company in a seperate instance whenevr possible. <br />
<br />
But, make sure you have a high-speed, dedicated connection between the two servers so that the data transfer does not slow down the archive processes excessively.<br />
