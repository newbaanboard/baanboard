Has anyone archived sales order data before?  I have archived the sales order data in tables TDSLS040, TDSLS041, TDSLS042, TDSLS045, and TDSLS046 through the session &quot;Process Delivered Sales Orders&quot; with the &quot;Delete Order Data&quot; field to &quot;Yes.&quot;  In addition, I have also removed the related integration transactions in table TFGLD410 for sales orders and all related &quot;Financial Transactions.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, I have not removed the sales order history.  What I am wondering is when it is possible to reuse a sales order number?  As I have not reset sales order numbers, I felt that it was not possible to reuse a sales order number with exisiting sales order history still present.  But, I have heard that it maybe possible.  Does anyone know for a fact what steps need to be completed before a sales order number can be reused.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I'm running 4c3 and you cannot reuse Sales Order numbers where a Sales Order exists in history tables.<br />
<br />
What happens if you reset first free numbers to 1 is that the system will look for the next free number where there is a gap in the sequence and no record exists in the history.<br />
<br />
Therefore the only way to reuse Sales Orders numbers would be to remove the records from the history table but I do not know of any archiving sessions that will remove the history.<br />

However you can reset the so number even before doing this . In that case sales order history for old and new order can be distinguished only with date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also pay attention to sls-related packages such as CMS.. <br />
The fact that you can reuse an order series finally depends on how your work with Baan. We experienced the following: after deleting the salesorder and salesorder history the entries in the CMS tables still remain present. After reusing such an odernumber the session did not throw an error such as 'duplicate value in tdcms...'. It simply continued assigning the old relation to the new order. We were lucky do notice this behaviour during some tests. <br />
<br />
A report 'Print References To Parent' (ttaad4229m000) may help to detect other dependencies.<br />

I want to avoid overwriting the existing sales order history, which it sounds like Baan does automatically by seperating the same order number by date.  However, before this happens, I hope to have the history records removed.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

If the Sales orders are not project related, it would not be archived.   Processed Delivered Sales Orders with Delete ON deletes and not archive the sales orders.<br />
<br />
Please correct me if I m wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">21st January 2003, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">.....now a strange thing happens:<br />
<br />
We archived (=deleted) old sales orders upto a certain date.<br />
Only sales orders with all transactions before the specified date are removed by tdsls4223m000, so order1 is removed, order2 is still present because delivery of that order was after the date as set in the &quot;Process...&quot; session.<br />
<br />
Now we re-print an old invoice ('re-execute' of order step &quot;Print Sales Invoice&quot; is set to still be possible after &quot;Process Delivered Sales Orders&quot;, otherwise it would almost never be possible to re-print a sales invoice). Result: a sales invoice is printed without the archived/deleted sales order, so not a exact duplicate of the original invoice !!!<br />
How does anyone else handle this issue ?<br />
