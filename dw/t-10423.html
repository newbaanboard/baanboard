 <br />
I'm a ERP consultant and more or less regularly facing DEM decisions and questions during implementations. I would like to know if there is somebody who can provide me with documentation about guidelines and best-practices to implement with DEM.<br />
 <br />
Any feedback is appreciated,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Many might disagree with me, but I always find it helps to sort out the WHY of DEM before proceeding to the HOW.<br />
<br />
For instance, process design may be very different depending on the relative priority of:<br />
<br />
-  enabling workflow<br />
-  facilitating BPR type process output measurement<br />
-  providing an uncluttered desktop for users<br />
<br />
Typically the standard library of processes falls somewhere between these three stools.   <br />
<br />
In the majority of implementations, DEM is used as a menu  builder rather than a process management tool, and in these circumstances I would go for small numbers of proceses that cover quite wide topics each, and with each role receiving activities from a limited number of processes.  Nothing is worse for a user on a desktop than having to ferret around through multiple processes to do simple tasks; or even worse, for an individual to have the same session with different access levels in diffrent processes because the  role boundaries are badly defined.  A good rule of thumb is that a DEM-driven menu should deliver the sessions to the user with fewer double-clicks than does the menu browser.<br />
<br />
If particular processes are subject to BPPR/SixSigma types of input and outcome measurement, then the needs for controlled process activity steps and known reference points will drive the design (even if this is to the detriment of the everyday user), as this will result in a single DEM process for every controlled business process.<br />
<br />
Similarly if workflow enablement is a priority, then the logical syntax of the process must take precedence over its understandability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might also keep in your favorites list the www.baandem.com address as this one provides today several DEM/Workflow resources and will soon be updated to include an extensive download section.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps your inquiry.</div></div><hr />
