  Our client has the following requirement(nice to have thing).Please suggest a possible solution..<br />
This organisation operates on contributions received from different entities.The contributions are received in Banks and in Baan there are separate ledger accounts for different banks.Each time a contribution is received it is recorded as one entry.<br />
Example Contri 1- 2 Million EUR0  on 10th Dec<br />
               Contri 2- 3 Million EURO on  15th Dec.<br />
<br />
The requirement is like this-Whenever the bankbalance falls below 80% of the contribution(cumulative as on any date),an automatic email is to be send to different employees.In Baan finance ,the ledger balances for a single ledger account is stored in more than one table(In other words there is no single field which has the balance figure).<br />
We are on Baan5c and  is using DEM (thanks to Baanboard help) :p ..<br />
<br />
Please advice whether using Workflow can achieve the above objective or are there any other ways(apart from database triggers).<br />
Thanks in adavance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can answer your question, but only partly. Workflow would be a pefect solution to do all kinds of handling after the business event has been recognized (i.e. the balance falling below 80%). Workflow could send emails, create work items for the receivers (if they are users of the system) and do all kinds of routing/escalation activities and track any required user action or external answers.<br />
<br />
However, still the Baan session needs to report this event to workflow. I am not aware of a way of configuring the session in this way. Maybe there is a chance to achieve this by tools programming? It would be sufficient if an API call could be issued (ideally) or a command line could be called (fallback). Database triggers would be a way to do that, but this is very complex and not optimal from performance perspective, if the value is stored in distributed tables.<br />
<br />
If somebody can answer this second part for you, then you are there. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">23rd December 2002, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">This can be done, but you need to build a Baan 3 GL session, which is sort of polling to check the balance and then when it detects the level on which you want to take action, it then can send a call to the WF database to startup a Workflow process instance, which then can take care of the handling of this exception.<br />
<br />
In fact WF with KPN is used in such a way, also there from an automatic batch handling of salesorders on exceptions WF processes are triggered to handle te exceptions by people through the Cosa WF client.</div></div><hr />

    Thanks for the information and suggestions.I have changed some settings ,so that the field value is captured in one table field(so that technical work can be avoided).<br />
Will get back to your expert advice/opinion during our workflow implementation stage.<br />
