<br />
It depends on what kind of authorization are you using. <br />
If you are using DEM, it is possible to remove the approve command.<br />
<br />
You can also created a role from Role Data session, and attach this role to the users  you want to permit or restrict.<br />
 (You will need to study these authorization types<br />
1. Session Auth.<br />
2. Table Auth<br />
3. Table Field. Auth<br />
4. Library Auth. etc)<br />
<br />
A more advance way is to use DAL on that table, but I suggest not to use it unless it is very critical.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I don't use DEM , I use the Baan User Authorization. By the way, where do you want it? I have tried DEM, and there is an option to remove the form commands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">29th July 2013, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">By editing the process activity within the DEM process, there is an option on the second tab of Properties to remove individual form commands.  Unfortunately it does not give the option of making it role specific in the manner of subapplication authorisations.  Obviously removing this particular command from the form for everyone would stop purchase orders being processed, so is not an option.<br />
<br />
I can see two ways around this; one is to have two versions of the DEM flow accessible to different roles; this means two instances of the sesssion in parallel activities, one of which the form command is removed from.  The other is to create a copy of the session and put it in the process, remove the form command and map some roles to each.<br />
<br />
If you are using webui or workspace as the interface, there is also the option of hiding the option by personalising the toolbar for those individuals that should not be allowed to see the icon/menu option.  Whether this is a good idea would depend on the numbers of users.</div></div><hr />
