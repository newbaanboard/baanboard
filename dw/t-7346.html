<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraja71</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I did copied a DEM version from our test box to production box<br />
using Export(tgbrg1235m000) and Import(tgbrg1245m000)  Dem Versions.  Some of the Session descriptions(session Name) do not appear.it just displays&quot;*****************&quot;.  <br />
 I need some help to resolve it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">just a wild guess. Maybe you are using a Normal user to export and import? Please check authorization. also help text authorization. are sessions main sessions or subsessions? could be a bug too. its been a long time since I use DEM...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as the same sessions exist on both boxes this shouldn't be an issue.  I would suspect authorization problem as benito suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">25th October 2002, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">When you did this in 5.0c it can be a Component Application problem.<br />
<br />
Because from 5.0c on in the DEM architecture there is no direct connection anymore with the Tools session description, but they are taken from the DEM component Application tables.<br />
<br />
You could have had a different Component Application on your source box then you have on your target box.<br />
<br />
Changing the Component Application name in a Version can be done with session tgbrg5220m000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Thanks for the Hint.<br />
 Awever  you are correct <br />
It was component application problem.<br />
The session  Applications by component(tgbrg5155m000)<br />
need to be run for the Component BaanERP and Release B50_c<br />
after I imported in the traget company. It is working fine now</div></div><hr />
