<br />
There is one DEM which is for  process model as &quot;Selling Price Process (PP1000)&quot; &amp; in this DEM 'xor' &amp; some other Process models like PP1006,PP1007 etc. are used. <br />
<br />
After login by (X) user if we click on PP1006 its showing Warn. msg as &quot;You have no authz. for activities in this business process&quot;. I want to give rights of PP1000 to another user (Y) in Finanace &amp; for this I have added Link Roles for this Model as Finance Off. But after login by this (Y) user its allowing sessions of PP1006 &amp; I dont want to give rights of these session (same as (X) user). For this what I should do ? If you need more infomn I will send DEM by email to your people.<br />

Sub Processes are PP1006 and PP1007.<br />
<br />
If you want Finance people having access to PP1000, but not to PP1006 and PP1007, then you can do this in two ways.<br />
Link Finance Role to PP1000 and exclude role on activities which represent the sub processes PP1006 and PP1007.<br />
Or Link Finance Role direct only to those activities in PP1000 for which you want to give authorization. So no link to the process PP1000 as a whole.</div></div><hr />
