We would like to allow certain users to only see purchased items list when he/she executes tcibd0501m000 General Item data. Is it possible at all to start a session with filter, aside from tampering with its program script using query extension? Probably by the use of program argument? Thanks very much<br />

You can use session &quot;Maintain table field data authorizations&quot; to achieve this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">23rd April 2003, 07:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, morpheus, but we're using DEM authorisation which would completely override Tools authorisation (including the table field authorisation you suggested).<br />
<br />
Is it possible at all to achieve this kind of control through DEM authorisation? Thanks<br />

I was not sure, and checked it on my system. DEM does not ignore these authorizations. Check again the way you have defined the authorization checks.<br />
Good Luck!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have several users, which can start session &quot;Execute query&quot;<br />
and then they are authorized for a range of queries (needed by their department) to run.<br />
These are all DEM-users.<br />
They are author. for the range by &quot;Table Data Authorizations&quot; ttaad4134m000.<br />
And it works correct.<br />

I missed the new reply to this thread somehow. Anyway, back to the AMS (Authorisation Management System), we only give our (normal) users the DEFAULT role, which has no table authorisation except for Tools tables. Still, they can work with all the modules we give them access to through DEM.<br />

Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">25th April 2003, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, ok the answers given above do use more of the BaanIV approach... DEM does not listen to AMS at all. DEM has it's own authorisation mechanism...<br />
<br />
But I wonder ... You cannot set up DEM authorisations with table field authorisations? In that case: set up the DEM to start up a menu with only that session ... I think AMS should work correct in that case... never tried that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">28th April 2003, 08:01</div></div><div class="posttext">DEM in Baan V ignores AMS authorizations for sessions and libraries not for database/table authorizations.<br />
<br />
You should however make sure, that you have setup your AMS roles correct and do not use the defaults generated by DEM for your Baan user, that one opens up the whole database.<br />
<br />
So you need to define your own AMS role to arrange for correct database authorization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? That means OmeLuuk, morpheus, &amp; GN are correct?<br />
<br />
I gave all (normal) users the DEFAULT role, which has nothing defined for table and table field authorisation except full access to Tools tables. But how come they can access anything DEM allows them to? Thanks<br />

So you should ask maybe in the Tools thread, how to explain the behavior. Or how to setup a AMS-role for db-authorizations in a specific way.</div></div><hr />

AMS is too complicated to figure out at this time. Beside, by the time we figure it out, we 'd still have to maintain 2 set of roles, one in DEM and one in Tools. We love DEM role system because it is also visual in its presentation and maintenance unlike that of Tools.<br />
<br />
We're just going to make copies of the session each with different query extension and use role-based DEM authorisation to assign the different type of copy to different users. Easier in long term maintenance. Thanks for all the input<br />

Starting a session with filter on <br />
<br />
Yes certainly you can do that. <br />
You have to call - execute(start.query) from the 4-GL choice sections.<br />
<br />
46  start.query  Start query by form  1234  ---4  1234 <br />
<br />
Beware- This works well in the BaaN-5 series as you can maintainly only one filter per session and the tools program used is ttstpqbf (Query Browser).<br />
<br />
This works different in our Reger, BaaN-5.2 version onwards as we can maintain multiple filters per session and the tools program is now changed to ttstp9593m000 (Filter).<br />
<br />
But when you set a particular filter as Default, whenever the session starts that particular filter is automatically picked up.</div></div><hr />
