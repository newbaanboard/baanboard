<br />
Is it possible to set up several completely independent, single logistics, single finance companies but have them share one central DEM company? The sharing of the central DEM company can be taken care of by using Central Company to Store Enterprise Modeller Data, tgbrg0100s000. The companies also will vary slightly in their DEM requirements, but that's already taken care of using version derivation and multiple project models. Please see Central DEM co, different role assignment per co (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7754) thread for more information on our case.<br />
<br />
The problem is, during sharing, the enterprise unit is shared as well since it's in a TG table, tgbrg030. This forces all companies to see only the enterprise unit of the central DEM company, which is linked to its financial company. Hence, all the other companies can't link to their own financial company. How can we solve this? Thank you very much<br />

You need to logically link tables tccom000 and tcemm170.<br />
Then you will be able to link different finance companies.<br />
Although you will see all units through each other.<br />

Would sharing those 2 tables have any complication on the single logistics,single finance company design? Would it somehow mess up and make B5 start to think that it's a multi logistics, multi finance setting? I'm just concerned of the distribution, mfg, planning, and finance (basically everything) implication of sharing these 2 tables. Or is sharing these 2 tables completely harmless? Thanks very much on every input.<br />

You need to make sure, that there are separate E.units in them for the separate companies you use and then there is no problem.</div></div><hr />

But I think having the company numbers from different companies appear in one session will freak out our management. They really want to make sure that the companies are completely separated. Sharing module with no operational numbers at all like TG is still OK, but not beyond that. Beside, the taxation office people here are very &quot;detailed&quot; in &quot;examination&quot;. So, I think I'll just use the DEM import/export facilities and keep them separate. Thanks very much on your every input, Ada<br />
