Having just done the admin for the bloody thing, it makes me wonder why the hell anyone bothered and if they did, what kind of mind must they have had?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's just your point of view.  I agree there is some head scratching involved in setting up the environment and developing a stategy for using the tool, but provided you use it properly it is a tremendous help in linking the business need to application enablement.<br />
<br />
I'm using it in a multi-company, multi-site implementation, driven by business process engineering, and would not be able to cope with the pace of change without DEM.<br />
<br />
Learn to love it!  It's one of Baan's most powerful benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">DEM is a particularly useful tool for those users who have little understanding of Baan but just know the business processes. They can follow the models with relative ease without really knowing what's going on in the background and the steps can be laid out for them in an easy to follow format. This way they only get to see what they need as well and they don't get too much information.<br />
<br />
It has been known that user authorisations have also been limited by not giving them access to run by session and only giving them the DEMs. This is of course not the recommended way of doing things!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Customers who have high staff turnover benefit from this easy interface, but they must let more experienced users progress to normal menus when ready.<br />
<br />
From an admin side, I've found it useful as people's jobs have changed to simply alter their roles and create a new set of menus in minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The DEM process is useful. The methodology forces you to sit back and critically analyse the business, not something that you normally do in any structured way. The Business Control Model then drills down into the related processes, and so there is a unified whole.<br />
This aspect of Baan implementation is quite impressive and compares favourably with SAP's ASAP methodology.<br />
Having implemented, it does take a lot of maintenance, and as has already been commented upon, experienced users will not take advantage of the process flows, partly because the process viewer is slow to load.</div></div><hr />
