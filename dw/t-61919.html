<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">searocket</div><div class="date">13th February 2012, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a role &quot;Purchasing Agent&quot; - this role has access to some sessions in Order Planning DEM process MPL04a - see screen-shot attached.<br />
<br />
But the Purchasing Agent Role is not listed in Roles by Business Process by Business Model (tgbrg3540m000) - screen-shot attached.<br />
Only the planner role is listed here - the planner has access to all the sessions in Order Planning process (MPL04a).<br />
<br />
I want to give the same limited access to Order planning sessions to a new role.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how this is done?<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

If however you only want to allow certain activities (sessions) you would have to do it in the editor.</div></div><hr />
