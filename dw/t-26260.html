<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cookiespin</div><div class="date">27th January 2006, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We are preparing to deploy workflow (6.2 for Baan cIV), along with Worktop 2.4.8 and webtop 4.1.  Worktop, workflow and webtop are all installed on Windows server 2003.  We're looking at the possibility of using MS Cluster Services for high availability.<br />
Has anyone done this already?  Webtop looks like it shouldn't be a problem, and worktop (probably centrally deployed).  I haven't found documentation noting that workflow is a cluster aware application, but perhaps there's another service that we can monitor/cluster to indicate if workflow services become unavailable on the active node and use a script on the secondary node to get everything working if it fails over.<br />
If you have any experience doing this, or can point me to the proper documentation, that would be great!<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
