If the former, just follow the instructions on the CD, they also provide master data for a demo company and the live company. If the RM, unzip and upload the version dump, *.org file into you home directory (root C:/ if it is under Win) and enjoy sophisticated business process management. You will also need to validate the models before they expire with your nearest SSA office. If you encounter any difficulty with validation, please let me know, I might suggest a workabout.<br />

I have a problem with my DEM models, we don't use them that much, but somehow they expired, I can't find License Key (installation was years ago..) <br />
<br />
What possible could happend? A new porting set triggering the expiration? What possible could be a workaround?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
please, let me know exactly what you are trying to open and the accompanying messages. <br />
The new protingset might be the cause. On that event, you need to revalidate the models in due course.<br />
However, if you have done some changes to the models, e.g. have project models with user menus, and the versions are not derived from the purchased reference models, you can export version dump and import it back by neighbouring menu session.<br />
<br />
Give me more details. You can also send me a zipped dump of your models, I will play with them. We will find a solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
