<br />
We delivered a few years ago a beta version of a product called DEM Workbench to a limited number of customers. This session was to export the DEM data, so it could be imported into the DEM Workbench.<br />
The DEM Workbench was a standalone modeler.<br />
Unfortunaly due to Invensys/SSA issues, we never released the product official. And on the short term there are also no plans to do so.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pierre B.</div><div class="date">19th March 2004, 21:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Complementary to Ada's answer (previous reply), I wish to inform DEM users that Stand-Alone modeling of DEM models have been possible since 2001 via a tool called EZ-Modeler. Find below the main features of EZ-Modeler:<br />
<br />
&gt; Modeling (create &amp; edit) of Process diagrams (BPD), Control diagrams (BCD) and Organization diagrams (BOD) is possible for any Baan IV/ERP-5/6.0 users and even non-Baan users (no Baan license required).<br />
<br />
&gt; In addition to DEM (Petrinet) diagrams, EZ-Modeler also enables other diagramming formats (Visio, PPT, ARIS Toolset, etc...) to be merged to DEM diagrams and to be incorporated to the Parent-Child relationships with DEM diagrams, therefore enabling a corporate-wide model covering Baan and non-Baan areas.<br />
<br />
&gt; Enables the import of diagrams from Baan DEM (DEM export and XML formats)<br />
<br />
&gt; Enables DEM native diagrams to be converted to HTML for web-based publishing of complete business models.<br />
<br />
&gt; Can be used in a single/centralized repository mode (GroupWare) where multiples Modelers can perform editing &amp; sharing of diagrams, or used in a single-user mode (on your laptop on the plane).<br />
<br />
&gt; Enables complete employee/roles/process/activities/sessions mapping. Baan sessions layouts are even available to Modelers to facilitate the mappig of these to Process Activities (without connection to Baan).<br />
<br />
&gt; Enables attachement of documents/content/URL to any objects of the Petrinet digrams (BPD activities, control, states, etc  /  BCD functions, external agents, etc)<br />
<br />
&gt; Ability to perform full Diagram Revision Control with diagram lifecycle history<br />
<br />
&gt; Ability to perform Quantitative Analysis and Simulation on defined or imported processes.<br />
<br />
&gt; Already adopted by large Baan customers such as Fujitsu, Herman Miller, Solar Turbines, Conwed, etc ...<br />
<br />
<br />
