We also generate the session authorizations.<br />
It seems like DEM generates much more session authorizations than as used in the DEMS. I know that there are some zoomsessions which will be authorized too in this way.<br />
<br />
But If I setup an user with a very simple DEM with only a display session I already see after generating the menu, that the user has also session authorization for a couple of maintain sessions!<br />
Those maintain sessions can never be reached fromout his DEM.<br />
<br />
So wat is the logic and why does DEM generate more session authorizations than needed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The generate session automatically searches 5 levels below the modeled session for sessions to give authorization to.<br />
That is because for example by Sales Orders you need authorization also for the lines.<br />
You can limit this a bit, by using the option Excl Low level maintain. Then on the lowest level only authorization for display sessions will be generated.</div></div><hr />
