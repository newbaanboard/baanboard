<br />
I am unable to insert a business process in the EME editor of a business control diagram(tgbrg9550m000). I added a function icon and linked it to a business function(by right clicking the function). When I right click, there is also 'insert'-&gt;'processes' which is available in dimmed state and hence I am unable to insert any process in the business control diagram. I am working in Baan Vc sp11.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

A Transformation Rule defines the relation between Business Functions and Business Processes.<br />
<br />
See DEM User Manual for details on how to use this mechanism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. As far as I know, transformation rule can be used to link a business process to a project/reference model based on validity of certain functions. Also we can link a business process without using any rule.<br />
<br />
My problem is with the Business control diagram in the EME editor, altogether at a different place. In fact I found a diagram in the DEM manual where it appears that a B.P. has been attached. <br />

Thanks,<br />

<br />
You are right, they were developed to get the right BP with the BF choosen into the Project Model.<br />
However when you do that Evaluate Rules, after that also the<br />
links in the BCD will be visible.<br />

Best regards,<br />
