<br />
I just joined this forum after reading a lot of topics which might help to solve my problem. <br />
<br />
We are currently looking at ways to get more grip on the timely payment of our invoices. Things like statements of account, reminder letters and such have not been used so far. This we will start doing on short notice, but since our organisation is quite complex, we are wondering how workflow can help us when after a reminder and perhaps even a phone call, our employee at accounts receivable has the option to 'forward' the issue as stated by the customer, to the appropriate department / employee.<br />
<br />
As for example a certain problem code is entered, can that trigger workflow to send our planner a task to investigate and report back?<br />
<br />
I hope my question is clear, if not please let me know.<br />
<br />

In the meantime I found out that what we want is not possible in Baan. Dynaflow (workflow solution) is supposed to be very good, does anyone have experience with this software? <br />
<br />
Also a rough estimation of what the costs will be for what I described for lets say about 20 users.<br />
<br />
Any information is greatly appreciated!<br />
