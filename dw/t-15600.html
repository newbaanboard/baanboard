<br />
    I am working on Baan 5.0 b<br />
    In DEM, if I do 'User Dialog Generation' for a specific Employee, current version for that employee is set, but there is no record generated for version authorization for this employee. And DEM works well for this employee.<br />
    Also, when Dialog is generated, 'u' file in '$BSE/lib/user' is rewritten, but there are no changes as compared to original 'u' file.<br />
<br />
   Whereas, if I don't use option of 'User Dialog Generation', I have to set Current Version for the employee manually which also requires to grant Version Authorization to that user.<br />
<br />
   Could someone please provide some more information on these two approaches and especially 'Why is Version Authorization not needed if we use User Dialog Generation ?' <br />
   <br />
Regards,<br />
Rahul.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You probably have used Baan IV before. DEM in Baan IV used the current version both for end-users as well as for modelers. For modelers to work on models in that version, end-users to let them work with models in that version.<br />
<br />
As off Baan ERP (5), these 2 user-types (modeler and end-user) no longer share usage of the same 'current version' mechanism. The current version setting (in tgbrg1110m000) is only required and relevant for the modeler, to enable EDITING of models. The end-users however are now controlled in a separate table (Baan User DEM Settings, tgbrg8136m000). In that table, the Baan user is linked to a 'default version' (the version that will be initially used when launched a DEM desktop), a 'default project model' and a 'default optimization phase'. Next to that, some specific user settings are defined in that session.<br />
Advantage of this concept is that the end-user can be active in multiple project models in the same company. In his user-desktop, the end-user can switch from one project model to another (if properly authorized) within the same company. For customers centralizing their logistics into one (logistical) company, this concept has it's advantages.<br />
<br />

<br />
Why you have your problems in 5.0b, I would need to investigate.<br />
Maybe over a few days I can answer you.</div></div><hr />
