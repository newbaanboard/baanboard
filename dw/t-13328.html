when this session was clicked the session did open up but with the error message &quot;line item not found&quot;<br />
the same session in some other co was being opened up without any problem that means there was no problem with database authorisation but something linked to the session in the  business process while creating that businesss process.<br />
i tried to export that Business process fro the co the user was able to open the session and then import that BP in the co with overwrite command in which the user was not able to open the session<br />
