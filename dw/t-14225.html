<br />
We are currently evaluating Baan V Demo version . When we try to open the business process editor in the session we get the error message &quot;cannot open diagram, see log file for details&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is the log file that I should see and what could be the error. I had the downloaded the editor onto my client.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

<br />
I had this on a site a couple of years ago.  I think it is service pack/EME and PV combination specific, but that isn't much help if you are on a demo version!<br />
<br />
A workround that usually did the trick was to delete the BW login that you are having problems with and then insert it again.  It may sound silly, but it did work until the problem went away with a more recent editor and service pack.<br />
<br />
The log file, by the way, is a distraction - the error message is inappropriate to the problem.<br />
<br />
Hope that still works<br />
