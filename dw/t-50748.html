<br />
the DEM model I set up works fine as long as the user stays within the startup company.  However, because we are working in a multi-company environment, some users need to switch to other companies.  But when changing companies from the Tools menu and trying to bring up a session, it comes up in the first company not the company he/she switched to.  Where's the problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input in advance,<br />

Check User DEM settings. there is an option to enable /disable switch company.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming you are using Worktop. If so, check the Worktop options: there's a flag in the &quot;Process browser&quot; tab that keeps the DEM company and the ERP company aligned when you change company.<br />
If you are using Webtop there's the same flag hidden somewhere in the Menu bar of Webtop.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

Hi Fabio,<br />
<br />
We are with Baan LN 6.1 and FP5. While the user is using Worktop and having the DEM process browser, the change company is taking lot of time to bring up the session ttdsk2003m000. It takes about a minute for this session to open everytime a change company is to be done. Please let us know if there is any way of solving this. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never found this issue before, but it sounds like a query is taking longer than normal to run or the session ttdsk2003m000 is not in the shared memory.<br />
<br />
I would suggest to first check the shared memory setup. If the tt package is not loaded then you should do it.<br />
<br />
If that does not help then I think you should switch on the SQL tracing. In the command window of the BW configuration enter:<br />
-- -set TT_SQL_TRACE=02200 -logfile trace.bshell -keeplog<br />
<br />
Then analyze the results in the log file: it will show you how long the queries and functions are taking to run so you might be able to find out what is the problem.<br />
<br />
Mind that tracing reduces performances while in use and has the potential to create big log files.<br />
<br />
There's many more tracing and debug options, but I would start with that.<br />
<br />
Best of luck!<br />
<br />
