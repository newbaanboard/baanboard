<br />
It depends a bit in which Baan version you're working. In Baan IV you can delete the role-activity relation only in the project model. Simply use the 'delete' button to remove the role from the activity.<br />
<br />
In BaanERP, you can have the role-activity relation defined in both repository and project model. To verify at which level you linked the role, please go to the Editor (EME) and double click the role-icon. You'll see in the dialog at which level the role is defined. You can only delete the role at that level. Other levels allow to change, but not to remove.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
Kind regards,<br />
