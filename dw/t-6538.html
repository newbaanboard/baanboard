<br />
1 There is EBM for BaanERP. Does BaanIV have same solution?<br />
   If not, how can I establish all business process in BaanIV? <br />
   You should know in EBM there are more than 1700 business processes.<br />
<br />
2 How can I set business process by role? there are so many <br />
   processes, should I set one by one? Who can tell me a <br />
  convenient way?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Baan does provide a list of models for Baan IV, for specific typologies (Assemble to Order, Engineer to Order, Make to Stock etc.) and Industries (Electronics, Pulp &amp; Paper, Chemicals, Wholesale etc.) in different languages. The whole list is quite extensive. From Baan IV to Baan ERP, the modeling concept is changed. No longer different models are created for different industries, but one model is now catering most of the Industries. The customer can select from EBM what is needed for his specific situation. On your request, I can send you some more information/slides. Please contact me at my email or phone below.<br />
<br />
2. Dependent on your requirements regarding security, an easy way of defining roles is to link them to high level processes. The lower levels (nested) processes will be automatically included for that role. So identify the high level processes (in Baan IV the main processes, starting with code Mxxxxx) and relate these to the corresponding roles. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps you further. If I can be of any help, let me know.<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
The major difference in EBM between Baan IV and Baan ERP is that for Baan IV the industry business models are held as Powerpoint documents.  There is a CD available from Baan that contains a number of standard models, each starting with the overall Business Control Model and then exploding to subsets of the functional map in which (usually) the supplied Processes are cross-referenced.<br />
<br />
Obviously in Baan ERP things are much better, with the business modeller integrated fully to the functions and processes.  This really speeds up the development of a working model.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To see the complete DEM Reference Models catalog (for both IV and ERP-5), visit the Public download section of www.dynaflow-dem.com .<br />
