<br />
My requirement is to restrict the specific options of a session purchase order advice in LN. I was able to restrict the sessions but there is a command/button option 'confirm','undo confirm','transfer' which I am unable to restrict.<br />
<br />
Can you please let me know how to restrict this option in DEM?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in advance,<br />

Those form commands have an &quot;authorization group&quot; (display, modify, use...). So if a user has display access to a session, it has access to all form commands with &quot;display&quot; authorization group and so on. In other words: You cannot switch on/off specific form commands by DEM, you can only put them into a particular group using Baan Tools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your reply. I will definetely this option :)<br />
I also noticed an option in the business process editor 'second tab' of the business process activities session that asks for 'select form commands to be removed'. On zoom I can see all the form command options. But it does not let me select the options and on save the changes are not reflected.<br />
<br />
Can you please advice why this option is not working?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your help,<br />

<br />
Download the latest version of enterprise model editor (Version 2.56 or greater). The newer version allows you to disable specific form commands (max 20) for a DEM user<br />

<br />
Thanks for this info.<br />
I have editor version 2.47 and it also shows the form commands to block. However, when I select the commands to block it does not get reflected when I run the session. I can still see the commands.<br />
I guess I will try with the new editor.<br />
