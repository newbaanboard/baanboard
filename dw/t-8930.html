<br />
I have read that this is apparently &quot;Easy&quot; to do but I can't seem to work it out - and as for Baan Help...forget it.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance<br />

<br />
go to tgbrg9140 and define an external program for each document type (xls, doc, etc.).<br />
<br />
tgbrg940.appl must be like &quot;winword.exe&quot; <br />
<br />
then goto your bp repository, then to your bp.<br />
<br />
here you can assign your tgbrg940.extn code (like doc) in field &quot;code&quot;.<br />
then specify your doc incl path in field &quot;argument&quot;.<br />
<br />
when clicking on &quot;run program&quot; then your word doc should appear.<br />
<br />
make sure winword.exe is in your windows path.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
Next to what Jochen describes, it is also possible to use the Web-enabled DEM product to link documents to process/activities and to expose these models to the whole employee base (not only Baan users). Take a look at http://www.ez-process.dynip.com/ezpubdemo/ to see it working. In the left navigation tree, you can browse through models and see all types of attachments, in your browser. Visit www.dynaflow-dem.com for more detailed information.<br />

1. define your Activity as type File based and place a reference to the document in the file-field.<br />
2. define a Component to startup Word and link that component to your activity and specify the file in the argument field.<br />
<br />
When you are working in iBaanERP 5.0b, then you can also use the Helper Applications as explained above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pierre B.</div><div class="date">24th February 2003, 20:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Related to the previous reply, a few questions:<br />
<br />
In the version iBaanERP 5.0c:<br />
   1) Can we link several documents to a single Process Activity (BPA) when using the File type activity or the Component setup ?<br />
   2) Can we link documents to a process without having to create additional Process Activities (BPA)?<br />
   3) Can we link one or several documents (such as training manuals / internal policies) to a Baan type Process Activity?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On training manual &amp; DEM:<br />
We made another copy of our training manual in HTML format, since Word can easily do that, complete with bookmarks to mark the sections. Then we link the correct section of the HTML training manual to each activity in DEM. Now users can just double click the spider web icon beside activity to read the manual for that particular step<br />

<br />
YES- If you want that, then you should maybe have a setup with an activity of type manual and a support application, which contains the reference to the different documents.<br />
<br />
2) Can we link documents to a process without having to create additional Process Activities (BPA)?<br />
<br />
YES-See above, you can do this using Support Applications<br />
<br />
3) Can we link one or several documents (such as training manuals / internal policies) to a Baan type Process Activity?<br />
<br />
YES-See above<br />
<br />
Next to that you can use the URL in the way Paul described.</div></div><hr />
