<br />
I'am having this problem and Baan's reply on this matter has not been to convincing. Hope someone can provide some info.on this matter.Pls advice<br />
<br />
The issue is:<br />
:<br />
 It happens in situation where u have created a user and assigned the relevant authorisation and menu to that person.<br />
Later , say after 1 month or so i want to assign an extra session for this user to use.<br />
<br />
So, i will use DEM method and go thru the same procedure as i did originally.<br />
This seem okay, right?.<br />
<br />
But, this would cause a problem whereby the user will lose acces/authorisation to some other sessions......and this i dont understand why it happens?????<br />
Pls advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
Yours in service<br />

<br />
If they are not the same, you have to run version authorisations by user after the update again. This applies to the copied, as well as derived versions. <br />
<br />
If they are the same, please give a particular instance.<br />

Dear Michail,<br />
<br />
I login as bsp to do this job.<br />
Then under the same version i do the rest(see attached copy)<br />
<br />
I'am unable to access the tgbrg1150m000 .Have asked Baan whats the default password for it. I've never used it b4.<br />
<br />
Do you mean after i insert the correct session for this user, need to run version authorisation then do 'generate dialog' for this user as well.<br />
<br />
What do u mean when u say ' if they are same, pls give a particular instance'?<br />
<br />
Pls advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />

To edit a process you need to copy the original reference model into the new version you created. If you created a new version the user needs to be linked to it.<br />
All you need to do to add a new session on a user's menu is to link the role to the session and the role to the user. After this regen the menu for the user. If the session was not part of the process you need to add it. Should only edit process in current version.</div></div><hr />
