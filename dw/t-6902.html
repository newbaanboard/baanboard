<br />
I'm on BaaN IVc.<br />
<br />
My problem is - I want to write some text concerning BP-flow and attach it to the work for users who have dynamic menu could read it.<br />
<br />
How can I do that? And can I attach different texts for different users (roles)?<br />
And can I write a text for a whole process?<br />
<br />
Thanking in advance,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />

<br />
Working for Baan from 1996 to 2002, I've had this question numerous times. In Baan IV, one can add ASCII texts to processes and activities. In Baan ERP one can use a Multiline editor to add helptexts. This helptext will be converted to either Windows help or HTML help, available for the end-user. There is no possibility to have different texts for different users. Texts are role-independent.<br />
<br />
Please note that since 2000 there is another solution (Baan implemented it also for internal model distribution) called EZ-Process. EZ-Process consist of several modules, but one of them, EZ-Publisher, supports most of what you're asking for. It allows you to add all kind of files (documents, forms, pdf's, trainingmanuals etc.) to processes and activities. And it allows all of the employees to view their model (and all attached documentation) in a browser. Feedback within Baan have been very positive.<br />
<br />
There is a paper available on the EZ-Process product. You can download it from http://dynaflow-dem.com/dl-public1/EZ-Process_Brochure2.pdf<br />
<br />
Nice thing with EZ-Process is that you can take a look in an open demonstration environment. http://www.ez-process.dynip.com/ezpubdemo/ will bring you there. With the EZ-Book entry, you can generate a manual as well.<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />

<br />
Within Baan IV you can standard link helptext to a Business Process and to an activity in a Business Process.<br />
This you can do in the Repository and in the Project Model.<br />
You do this using the Baan multi-line editor.<br />
You will have limited possibilities to make the text fancy (bold, underline), but you can use hyperlinks to for example other texts or labels or session descriptions. (See the help about it in DEM and the DEM User manual)<br />
<br />
This helptext will then be seen, by everybody, who is able to see the Business Process or activity in the Dynamic Menu Browser.<br />
<br />
So it is only role dependent in the way, that is shown, when your role is allowed to see the specific Business Process or Activity.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
It really works - I've tried it before. But...<br />
<br />
1. I'd like to attach text which could be seen not only from Dynamic Menu Browser, but also from Navigator Menu Browser (we use it for our users) - is _that_ possible?<br />
2. I'd like to attach text to the whole business-process (in Project model - model-specific text). Is that possible?<br />
<br />
Thanking in advance,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />

<br />
The helptext within DEM is only visible in the Dynamic Menu Browser and in the Business Process Display Mode.<br />
It is not visible from the normal Baan session Menu interface, even when this is generated from DEM data. <br />
I do not know, what you mean with Navigator menu, but assume that is the session interface.<br />
<br />
There can be connected help to a Business Process as a whole in the Project Model. And yes then it is called Model specific.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you further.</div></div><hr />
