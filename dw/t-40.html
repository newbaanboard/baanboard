Difference in BaaN IV &amp; BaaN ERP (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=88) <br />
<br />
Very informative !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pierre B.</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 05:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Major differences exist between DEM IV and DEM ERP. In a bullet point list, the most important would be:<br />
<br />
 - a total of 6 model views: (the Function/Process/Organization Models found in DEM IV plus the Enterprise Structure Model (ESM - displaying the geographical breakdown of the company), the Business Control Model (BCM - top level decomposition of the functional areas of the business), and last, the Entity Relationships Diagrams (ERD - representing the graphical structure of the data dictionnary of Baan tables)<br />
<br />
 - in DEM IV, the user was using 3 different editors to handle the 3 different views. In DEM ERP, one single editor, more generic, is used to handle the editing of all 6 views (see above)<br />
<br />
 - the editors in DEM IV are coded in Baan Tools. In DEM ERP, the editor has been re-writing using OO components to be portable and use XML diagrams definition. The resulting editor is called the EME (Enterprise Modeler Editor) and needs to be installed on the Client PC of the Baan user. Although all editing tasks will be performed on the Client PC and not on the Baan server, the EME is not fully Stand-Alone and still require the diagrams to be saved in the BRG tables on the server.<br />
<br />
 - the handling of DEM Versions, Reference Models, Project Models are similar from DEM IV to DEM ERP, making the import-export from one to the other possible. It is also possible to back-port from ERP to IV.<br />
<br />
 - although the diagrams migration from IV to ERP is possible and faily easy to do, an important difficulty reside in the fact that the session codes have been modified in Baan ERP. While a Process Activity (BPA) can be linked to a session in DEM IV (Ex. tiitm0101m000), and that this diagram can be ported to DEM ERP, a disconnect can happen is that session code no longer exits in ERP (because of being replaced by other session codes). In a nutshell, the graphical structure of DEM IV and ERP are compatible but the defined relationships to the underlining applications can see some disconnects.<br />
<br />
 - on a Business Reference Models side (supplied by Baan), DEM IV saw a extensive list of industry specific models and extentions (Ex. ETO, ATO, MBI, BPM, A&amp;D, etc...). In DEM V, one extensive model (the Hybrid Manufacturing Model HBL renamed to the Enterprise Business Model EBM) is available, and incorporate many of the smaller DEM IV models content. A &quot;Business Profile&quot; configurator enables organization to select the relevant part of the HBL/EBM model related to their industry segment)<br />
<br />
 - etc...<br />

<br />
thank you for your good and usful information about the differences. I visitied your website www.ez-process.com which is not too bad ;-).<br />
<br />
I'll wirte you from my company to get more information. The best feature I think is that you are able to start the BaaN Sessions from your Browser-based Application. How do you realized that?<br />
 <br />
I think a BaaN ERP GUI on the Client is necessary to do that.<br />
<br />

<br />
Talking about Models, I would like to know if somebody have a list of existing BaaN Models. <br />
<br />
For instance BBI develop several models like the PRI Model(Project Model) but BaaN Business Innovation still exist???<br />
<br />
On other hands we have to take care witch level of the models.<br />
<br />
Peter Schmitt present a very good Procees for Mining, but it was only Level 1, not a DEM MODEL. <br />
<br />
Bien le bonjour<br />

<br />
As some knows already, a great part of the value and benefit of DEM is in the pre-built DEM Reference Models. Since the end of BBI, all of those models were transfered to Baan, including their ownership. The BKC group within Baan is responsible to maintain and enhanced these models.<br />
<br />
More than 80 of these DEM Reference Models exists today, some available in several languages. You can get the updated list of all of them at www.dynaflow-dem.com in the Public Download section, under the DEM items.<br />
<br />
Enjoy,</div></div><hr />
