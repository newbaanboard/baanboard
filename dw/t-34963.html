<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_user</div><div class="date">27th April 2007, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any simple report in Baan DEM which can print which user has access to what sessions ?<br />
<br />
There are standard baan reports which are horrible (Print Activity Authorization by Employee tgbrg4450m000). They run for days and the output is horrible, difficult to understand and INCOMPLETE.<br />
<br />
If not, then I will have to write my own SQL Server Queries to read verious DEM tables and generate a readable report, which will be easy to understand by a normal user.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done any work like this on DEM's before?</div></div><hr />

Also something to be aware of is that the DEM flow does not give the whole story.  One session can add user permissions for 20 other sessions - which the DEM flow does not show.  I am happy we no longer have to worry about SOX.</div></div><hr />

Tools, Microchip, Fujitsu, Bio-Rad, Immucor, Coopervision, Komatsu, Juno, <br />
Herman Miller, Flextronics, Zebra, Telair,etc..., DynaFlow is offering to scan your Baan authorizations (DEM or Tools) to identify all Segregation of Duties (SOD) conflicts. These constitute business risks for your organization.<br />
<br />
It's an automated process that take only 10 minutes of your time (a simple ASCII file to be generated out of a Baan session) and is offered without cost nor condition.<br />
<br />
For more information, visit http://dynaflow-dem.com/DF-NewsLetter_Sep2007.htm .  To request your SOD scan, contact us at SOD4Baan@EZ-Process.com .<br />
