I guess you have added excel as a component and set the activity type to Application, with the path to the Excel executable in the path field.  That will open a new spreadsheet.  If you want to launch an existing spreadsheet, set the activity type to File Based (Client) and put the path to the file in the Argument field.  That will launch the individual file, as the application associated with the file type is held within Windows.</div></div><hr />
