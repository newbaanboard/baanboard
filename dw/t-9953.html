very long time.Upto 2 Hrs. And secondly we find that some of the users<br />
who were working with their DEMs today loose some authorizations<br />
automatically the next day and then their user id has to be generated<br />
again.<br />
 <br />
Also for each user we have to generate his id separately for each Baan<br />
company, even though his authorizations in all the companies may be<br />
identical.<br />
 <br />
Please throw some light on these issues</div></div><hr />

While generating user dialog, if &quot;Enter Session Authorization&quot; is checked, it takes more time. Also, authorizations granted through tools always clash with the authorizations granted through DEM generator.</div></div><hr />
