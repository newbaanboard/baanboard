Does anybody happen to know where the &quot;label code&quot; in several DEM tables (e.g. tgbrg500.clab, tgbrg570.clab) is referring to? Thanks very much<br />

I found the labels in package ed (I was previously looking for it in tg), naturally in company 000. Now I shared several BPD related tables between companies, and all runs well (diagram, authorisation, subappl, etc.) except the labels. But this is funny. The DEM in each company would contain the same label code pointing to the same label contained within a common company 000. Why did the DEM in the other companies beside the original fail to retrieve the labels? Thanks very much<br />

So it is possible to use the same DEM version in different languages, because the description is per language separate saved in the label for that language.<br />
One of the key fields of the label-code is a company-number and that can give problems if your current label-codes are not the same as the current company number.<br />
<br />
In 5.0c you should not share DEM tables anymore, for that the Central Model company concept is introduced and the whole working of DEM is based on that. For example also helptexts.</div></div><hr />

Thanks very much for the information. I didn't know that company number was in there too. But how was it involved? Through the label code itself?<br />
<br />
By the way, we can't make use of the centralised DEM company setting as per our previous conversation in the thread centralised DEM co, decentralised log/fin co (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7779). There are 2 viable ways in our case:<br />
 Share the BPD related tables. All works except the labels are missing from the other companies. I started this thread to know the reasons behind their disappearance<br />
 Export and import. Works perfectly<br />
We're using both methods, but for maintenance we'd like to have a refined first method. Any idea or we're stuck with our options? Thanks<br />

And sometimes this is re-formed at runtime for searching the description instead of the label-code from the table, because this is quicker.<br />
However that causes problems when you are not in the company in which the label-codes are made and so the re-forming uses the wrong company code and doesn't find the right label.<br />
<br />
The only really reliable option is to do the Import/Export, because then the labels are created also for the new companies and so everything can be found.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
