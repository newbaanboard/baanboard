<br />
We used to handle this through AMS while using the Menu Browser but since switching to the Process Browser, this no longer prevents users from logging in after month end.<br />
<br />
Infor, so far, has been unable to assist as they don't believe AMS will work.<br />
<br />
How are other companies handling this? Does no one else prevent operations users from logging in while Finance does their month end thing?</div></div><hr />

How do you prevent users from creating transactions while Finance is doing their month end reporting?</div></div><hr />

We were on an A&amp;D version - not sure that makes a difference or not, but I am sure our billing is probably different than other businesses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As Mark suggested earlier, changing BSHELL name is one way to do that. I've done that in past. We used to set an hour to perform this activity. Kicking out any logged in users, changing BSHELL name, sharing the new name with Finance team and its done.<br />
<br />
They just needed to set the BSHELL name in their worktop/webui configs.</div></div><hr />
