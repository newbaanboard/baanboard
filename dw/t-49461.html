<br />
We have recently replicated our Fin. &amp; Acc. Business process in our newer version from older version. After attaching roles to these processes when i try to login from user ID in session menu browser mode it says &quot;current version not defined&quot; when i change co. from 315 to 350. Also while generating user in user dialog we used 315 co. although co. authorisation is valid for both co. for this user. <br />
315: logistics co.<br />
350: finance co.<br />
<br />
after configuring the user ID in worktop mode, when company is changed from 315 to 350 <br />
<br />
1. It is not reflected on taskbar. <br />
2. sessions of 350 co. can be opened from &quot;Run Program&quot; but not from DEM(Process browser).Pls. Help out.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
check if you have a valid version setup properly in tgbrg1500m000.<br />
<br />
check if your project model have been created and attach with correct version <br />
<br />
check tgbrg0105m000, if both your 315 &amp; 350 company have a valid project model?<br />
make sure is click to main project model.<br />
<br />
than finally since your dem use for both company, one company has to be the main table, let's say 350<br />
<br />
change to company 315 and tgbrg0100s000 put the EDM as 350<br />
<br />
as for authorization have few ways to setup, more information than probably i can help.<br />
