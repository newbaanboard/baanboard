We are also in ln6.1. We are planning to use DEM/Business Process and attach roles to each DEM. If in each DEM there are multiple roles, but not assigned to all defined sessions/subsessions. Example Journal Entry (data entry - accountant, but finalization will be the Controller). We want to segregate duties for data entry and approval or finalization (one requirement for our Sarbox)<br />
<br />
is there any alternative session to define the roles. please reply as soon as posiable<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">23rd May 2006, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">In DEM you can link roles to a BP or to an activity in the BP.<br />
When you link a role to the BP, then the role gets authorization for all activities in the BP and child BP's.<br />
You then can on activity exclude the role for certain activities when needed.<br />
You can however also link a role directly to an activity.<br />
Depending on how many activities you want to authorize you choose your modeling strategy.<br />
When you have for example 10 activities in the BP and role X needs access to 2, then direct linking to activities is most efficient.<br />
When you have for example 10 activities in the BP and role Y needs access to 8, then first linking to the BP and excluding the 2 activities can be more efficient.<br />
<br />
Role linking is described in the DEM User manual chapter 7 and 8.</div></div><hr />
