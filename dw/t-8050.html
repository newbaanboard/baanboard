<br />
Usually when I export/import DEM settings, I only port the front end parts like business process diagrams, roles, support applications. I don't port the rest of the back end even if I can. I usually set up the back end (version, component, application by component, employee, ESM, project model, enterprise unit) manually in the new company.<br />
<br />
Please pay attention to version and component setting between the 2 companies. If they have different versions, then you'd have to specify the receiving version during import. If they have different components, you'd have to rename component &amp; release code in business process &amp; support application using tgbrg5220m000. It'd be much easier if the version and component between the companies are the same.<br />

Install EBM on BaanERP5.0c+SP9. I found there is a bug in SP9 and I fixed it. Now it's ok.<br />
