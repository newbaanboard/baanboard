<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BRADSJ</div><div class="date">17th February 2006, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created an Archive Company and archived an old Sales Order series from Sales History Tables in the Live Company.<br />
<br />
I now want to login as a normal user to the Archive Company directly and access Sales History Inquiries / Print sessions to search through the archived sales order data.<br />
<br />
How to i create / link the user to the archive company?<br />
<br />
Can i set the user up in the Live company and link to the Archive company somehow?<br />
<br />
Do i need to import all the DEM / User data tables from the Live company to the Archive company (which seems overkill) and create the user from within the ARchive Company ?<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated?:)</div></div><hr />
