<br />
the Workflow (wms) in BaanIV is only a Beta-Version (Demo). Except the dynamic coniditions it is working to dmonstrate the functionality.<br />
But in real time with many users the performance is to slow.<br />

:(</div></div><hr />

Baan pulled the engine out of Vc last year.<br />

However,   Dynaflow, a Baan partner in Canada, has developed a WOrkflow product, which is endoresed by Baan and works with DEM.   You can reach them at:<br />

ItÂ´s a great tool and it helps to improve the business processes. Baan has removed some important functionality in the newer Servicepacks. The Workflow worked well with Baan IVc4 and SP5 but not with SP9. We have opened a call at Baan due to this. <br />
<br />
Any help to move this forward is appreciated.<br />

Our advantage is that we are working with Baan IVc4 SP5. We install only single solutions with PMC (if needed), so we have no problems with customized solutions and the workflow. The workflow works very well with all functions. <br />

<br />
we are a BAAN solution provider in Asia. Does EZ-Workflow support double-bytes like Chinese?<br />
and how about the price? We did face the problem of BAAN workflow.<br />
And does it support any other ERP package?<br />
<br />
Thanks with best regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pierre B.</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Replies to Anthony Wang questions about EZ-Workflow:<br />
<br />
  - although not yet double-bytes compliant, our development labs are currently investigating this enhancement following a recent DEM/EZ-Process training performed in China by DynaFlow/ProFlow. Planned delivery: Q1/2003<br />
<br />
  - pricing is not only modular (buy only the optional modules you need) but is also scalable to smaller organizations. Starting in the 20K USD range, it includes Server/Client licenses, onsite installation and configuration, onsite training for technical administrators and workflow managers, and entire documentation. Detailed quote available at info@ez-process.com<br />
<br />
  - beside requiring no installation or application for all the workflow executors (zero-client architecture), the EZ-Workflow engine design is based on a generic technical infrastructure. In addition to be compliant to Baan IV and ERP-5 (but not centric to Baan), EZ-Workflow can also invoke various external applications, not just limited to ERP. A single workflow route can then include some steps that are ERP driven, some that are business application driven (ex.: MS-Office), legacy systems driven, web-based applications, ... and of course, human/approval driven steps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pierre B.</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Since this thread is relating to both the Baan IV demo workflow product and the EZ-Workflow application, I wish to make clear that these are two separate products. The Baan workflow demo, introduced by Baan in its version IVc, has been since discontinued and is no longer supported by Baan. <br />
<br />
EZ-Workflow, part of the EZ-Process Product Suite, is available on the market and fully supported. In addition to be compliant to all releases of Baan, it can also be used to workflow enabled non-Baan areas/tasks of your organization.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">16th September 2002, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Within Baan there is now a new decision to sell the iBaanERP 5.0c Workflow in the USA again.<br />
The software is partly in Baan, but the WF runtime part is the product COSA of the company LEY.<br />
The advantage of this solution is, that you can model it within DEM and it gives possibilities to startup BaanERP sessions in a controlled way. (single instead of multi-occ, with data etc)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pschwind</div><div class="date">9th December 2002, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The exact situation is, that the deliverable within BaanIV is more a demo than a stable product. I do not know much about EZ-Workflow, which seems to be avaliable for use in combination with Baan. There is a third alternative, which I know in deep detail: COSA Workflow. This product has been used successfully in various projects of different scales with and without combination with Baan.<br />
<br />
I have been working as Chief Technology Officer at LEY, the company which has developed COSA Workflow. I have designed its main architecture in the first half of the 90's and gained a lot of experience in developing concepts for optimal use of workflow - and in designing and managing various implementation projects. <br />
<br />
One of my projects was the integration of COSA into BaanERP (Corelli) in 1999, which I have been managing on behalf of Baan Development, NL. At that time Baan actually owned the product. After I have left the project I know that the integration work has continued and that COSA Workflow is now available for both above mentioned versions.<br />
<br />
I myself can provide deep expert knowledge on optimal use of COSA Workflow in various business environments and especially in combination with Baan. <br />
<br />
For additional information concerning myself and my company's ability to assist you in the areas of sales and implementations (business added values, optimal process modelling, business process optimization with COSA), please contact me at ps@schwindling.biz or visit our websites at http://www.schwindling.biz and http://www.cbi-network.com<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sybrand</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">A few weeks ago Baan confirmed to us they will also deliver and support the workflow4baan solution for Baan IV ! This will mean a full WFM engine available to support the business processes as modelled in DEM! The Baan V package is already available, the Baan IV package will be a deliverable per September.<br />
<br />
For the Dutch Baan users: Baan Benelux held a presentation last june on the Workflow topic which is for download at the BWU site.</div></div><hr />
