<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bsyeven</div><div class="date">3rd April 2003, 03:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know of an easy way to get a list of all users(Employees) or all Roles that have access to a certain session via DEM?  I know how to do it by linking several other reports together but it is very tedious and it seems there must be a better way.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bsyeven</div><div class="date">3rd April 2003, 22:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I've used tgbrg5461 - that is what I usually use, but it only gives me the utilities and BPs where a session is used, then I have to find the parent utilities and parent BPs and then find project models where those BPs are used and then find Roles linked to those BPs and then find Employees linked to those roles - it is quite a pain.  That's why I'm trying to find a better way.  Baan Support mentioned session tgbrg4450m000 &quot;Print Activity Authorizations (by Employee) by Role&quot;, however I don't currently have this session in my environment.  I'm working on adding it but there are several prerequisites so it will be a while.  <br />
<br />
No, I've never heard of the tgbrg9000m000 session you mention.  We don't have it in any of our environments (IVc, Vb or Vc) and there is no mention of it on Baan Support.  I'm guessing it is a custom session, especially considering the 9000 code.  Can you confirm?<br />
<br />
Anyone else have experience with tgbrg4450 or tgbrg9000?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions!</div></div><hr />
