<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">In our case we have one instance where customization (all new sessions) 'a' calls 'b' and 'b' calls 'c' using zoom.to.<br />
<br />
The generate authorizes 'a' and 'b' but doesn't get to 'c'.<br />
<br />
All details exist in ttadv237, but the tool appears to stop at 'b' without looking to see what 'b' calls.<br />
<br />
The session flow is as follows: (All sessions are marked as main) <br />
<br />
tdpurc243m000 -&gt; tdpurc244c000 -&gt; tdltcc203c000<br />
<br />
The main/sub indicator is 'c' instead of 'm' or 's' but one would assume this is determined via ttadv200.main.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?<br />
<br />
We're on BaaNivc3 - Unix and Oracle<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

The search for 5 levels deep combined with zoom.to was build in at the end of 1997, but after that other fixes were needed to make the search mechanism correct.</div></div><hr />
