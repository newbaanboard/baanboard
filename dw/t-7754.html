<br />
We have one company in where we've set up most of our DEM needs. If we'd like to use this as central DEM company, for the other companies how do we assign different role per user depending on the company? For example, user &quot;Sariyem&quot; in company 111 is sales staff while in 222 she's distribution key user.<br />
<br />
At the moment, we handle this by disabling the central DEM co arrangement and just share business process related tables.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much<br />

I think DEM is company specific.<br />

You both must have thought I'm on B4. I'm actually on B5 and have successfully share the DEM from that company to few other company using Central Company to Store Enterprise Modeller Data tgbrg0100s000. The companies differ slightly in which some have certain business process some not, and some have certain employees some not. But this is easily taken care of using multiple project model in the central company.<br />
<br />
Now for the case I mentioned in my original posting, I haven't found convenient way to do it. Any idea?<br />

<br />
When you want such a setup, then you need to work with different versions per company in which you make your employee-role links.<br />
<br />
You can leave your BP all in the same version and derive the company specific versions from that one.<br />
<br />
You need also to define different Project Models, per company 1.<br />
<br />
This way it is possible to have a different user menu per company.<br />
<br />
You can even have the same roles in the versions, but then you need different role-business process links in the company specific versions.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.<br />

You're right! It works! I never played with version derivation before. Well now I have and it's a good thing. Thanks very much<br />
