 <br />
My company is evaluating a Baan IV - Baan ERP upgrade. Since I'm responsible for DEM matters, I would like to know more about the implications of this migration for DEM. For example, I've heard about the new Components concept in Baan DEM. Does this new concept have implications for our existing Baan IV model? Although the www.BaanDEM.com documents library does include several DEM documents, I can't see anything on this subject. Where can I find documentation on this topic?<br />
 <br />
Thanks,<br />
David Burr</div></div><hr />

<br />
Related to your question about the new Components concept in Baan DEM ERP-5, I'm happy to inform you that the Components Modeling User Manual, explaining in details this new feature, has been added to the www.BaanDEM.com public download section.<br />
<br />
In addition, you can also find another document (&quot;Model Migration Scenarios&quot; - in the member download section) helpful to plan and execute your DEM migration from DEM IV to a DEM ERP-5.<br />
<br />
Enjoy,</div></div><hr />
