<br />
We are using DEM menus with BaaN IVC4. But last 15 days ago, we receive a message who says that the BaaN IV DEM licence will expire in 30 days ...<br />
Yesterday, it remain 15 days ...<br />
<br />
The BaaN support tells me about the 240436 solution who explain that the DEM model license will expire at the 1 Jan 2010!.<br />
I patched my baan environment and now, each dem user can not connect to BaaN, the message is : <br />
<br />
funtion (sql.bind.input) not defined<br />
Can not continue in tgbrg4260m000 in dll : otgbrg0001 (get.company)<br />
Dynamic link failure function 'tgbrg0034.verify.license.check'<br />
Can not continue in tgbrg4260m000 in dll : otgbrg001 (get.company)<br />
<br />
How can i revalidate the DEM module who works fine before patching ?<br />
Any idea ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help. Luc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pastipet</div><div class="date">16th December 2009, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same problem Luc has and the problem is not the license key. We received a new license key that is valid until 01-Jan-2100 and instructions to install solution 240436. Apparently there is a problem with (some versions?) of DEM that it will not handle correctly licenses that have expiry date after 31-Dec-2009. Installing the solution causes the error function (sql.bind.input).<br />
<br />
Any ideas what should be installed to get solution 240436 working would be welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
