<br />
Hope someone can help me in this .......<br />
<br />
My scenario is such that I have 2 different Models+Version , each having some processes linked to various roles.<br />
Now , for a particular user I would like to combine her Prod.processes with that of those from Purchasing .  Both of these are in different models+versions.<br />
<br />
Though I was able to enter the roles BUT after 'user dialog generation'  only Produc.sessions/menu are shown.<br />
Pls advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
Yours in service<br />

<br />
You need to have the processes for 1 user in 1 Project Model.<br />
<br />
What you could do is to look if the versions could be derived from each other and then make a new Project model in which you combine the processes for that employee (or group of employees)</div></div><hr />
