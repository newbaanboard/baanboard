<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yadav1981</div><div class="date">21st April 2009, 08:08</div></div><div class="posttext">let me take you through an example:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Lets say we have a user who has to perform 3 different tasks<br />
<br />
1.       Print Sales Acknowledgement<br />
<br />
2.       Approve Sales Order<br />
<br />
3.       Process Delivered Sales Orders<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
At any point in time, he has 2 orders pending for printing acknowledgement, 3 orders pending for approval and 4 orders pending for processing as delivered. Currently, the worklist for this user will be like:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
+ Worklist<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
On expanding Worklist, it will be like:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
-Worklist<br />
<br />
  Print Sales Acknowledgement <br />
  Print Sales Acknowledgement <br />
<br />
  Approve Sales Order <br />
  Approve Sales Order <br />
  Approve Sales Order <br />
<br />
  Process Delivered Sales Order <br />
  Process Delivered Sales Order <br />
  Process Delivered Sales Order <br />
  Process Delivered Sales Order <br />
<br />
 What I want to see when we expand the worklist is something like:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
-Worklist<br />
<br />
  +Print Sales Acknowledgement(2)<br />
<br />
  +Approve Sales Order (3)<br />
<br />
  +Process Delivered Sales Order (4)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It means that I want to group the activities in the worklist. Also, number of pending activities in each group should also be visible. Further, on expanding any of the activity, I should be able to see the details as under:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
-Worklist<br />
<br />
  +Print Sales Acknowledgement(2)<br />
<br />
  -Approve Sales Order (3)<br />
<br />
     Approve Sales Order <br />
<br />
     Approve Sales Order <br />
<br />
     Approve Sales Order <br />
<br />
  +Process Delivered Sales Order (4)<br />
<br />
