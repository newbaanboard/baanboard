<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pschwind</div><div class="date">17th October 2003, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear J.Barahona, Dirk,<br />
<br />
my background on this issue is, that I have been working as kind of a Chief Technology Officer in Ley GmbH, which has produced COSA and is now part of transflow, until 2001. In this funtion I have designed COSA's orignal architecture and collected a lot of project experience in different lines of business, where COSA was often successfully used together with various erp systems. During the years 1998 and 1999 Ley actually belonged to Baan and COSA was closely integrated into the erp applications and with DEM. I have been leading the integration project on behalf of Baan development and also had a lot of influence on the integration architecture.<br />
<br />
Since about a year we are operating a firm specialized on technology and strategy consulting around business process management. From this point of view I am still interested in the product (but now from a neutral position and not with a license interest any more).<br />
<br />
On a transflow partner day in february I have held a speech on COSA's benefits for Baan users - and we have also created white papers addressed to Baan users and partner companies.<br />
<br />
The white papers and the presentation slides for the speech mentioned above can be downloaded from our website http://www.cbi-network.com (available in german and english). You will find the white papers in the &quot;Solutions&quot; area. The slides can be taken from our &quot;download&quot; area (you will have to leave your contact informaton for the slides).<br />
<br />
Anyway, we obviously have a lot of knowledge on the product and how/where to use it in a benefitial way. Please contact us, if you have any further questions on this issue.<br />
<br />
Have a nice weekend,<br />
<br />

<br />
I work with workflow4baan (cosa) and it looks fine to me.<br />
There are some diffculties inside this product, but nothing you cannot work with.<br />
<br />
The only &quot;Problem&quot; is the connection over xml to cosa.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions about it please msg me.<br />
