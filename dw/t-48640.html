I have read some postings and it looks like there are some negatives effects and even some companies move away from DEM.<br />
One the plus that I can see is managing roles, which might be visually better as well as organized by processes as oppose to the traditional adding sessions/modules to users.<br />
<br />
Any feedback would greatly appreciated<br />
