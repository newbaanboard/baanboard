The only way I seems to make it work is by starting the menu browser and then start DEM-browser(tgbrg4260m000).<br />
<br />
But I don't want the users to have access to the menu-browser, I want to start the DEM-browser automatically.</div></div><hr />

I believe this show happen when you generate the user's Dem?<br />

  I had the same doubts which got clarified ..Pls see the another post/discussions on 'user authorisations' in this forum.I have some standard documents on DEM browser generation in Baan 5c..If you require the same ,do give your email id.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">invensys user</div><div class="date">10th November 2002, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not very difficult to generate DEM users.<br />
1) First define roles<br />
2) Attach the main processes to each role<br />
3) Create employees<br />
4) link roles to employees<br />
5) run session tgbrg4250m000 (create desktop)<br />
If the user then will log on to Baan, one will go directly in the DEM, not in the menu structure<br />
It is advisable to create a project model first<br />
Tools and DEM authorisations work totally independent of each other and can therefore for sure co exists</div></div><hr />

Here's the thread KPS was talking about. Actually, he's the starter of the thread :)<br />
User authorization (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7257)<br />
<br />
If you like particular treats of Tools authorization that DEM can't provide, and if those treats can be provided by DB authorization, probably you can give KPS choice of DEM+DB authorization combo a try :).<br />
<br />
Oh, and you don't have to generate DEM menu in B5c. Just define DEM authorisation and set up DEM properly and the menu will be generated automatically by DEM. They call it Dynamic Menu Browser. Pretty cool stuff!<br />

<br />
You can use Worktop for this. Worktop is a new User Interface on top of BaanERP (also available on 5.0c) and integrates the DEM browser, menu browser, desktop manager, Process Viewer and more. Within the User Data session you can select in the &quot;Worktop Tree&quot; groupbox that a user has both access to the menu browser and the DEM browser. That way users are able to work with both of them simultanously...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomas Engberg</div><div class="date">11th November 2002, 22:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The only documentation I have around functionality in DEM is a pdf-file DEM_user man.pdf. The code is U7169A US. If you have other documentation for DEM Baan 5c please send it to tomas.engberg@zany.se.<br />
<br />
The reason I asked how to generate DEM-menus for users is that I haven't seen any session that generates DEM-menus. It all works just by following step 1 to 4 described by invensys user.<br />
The 5th step described by invensys user is not possible, the session tgbrg4250m000 is marked as expired.<br />
<br />
The thread user authorisation that kps_menon and Paul P is mentioning is the reason I started this thread. Before I read Ivo Ladages answer in that thread I believed tools authorization was always present.<br />
<br />
Worktop seems nice. But how is authorizations working in there.<br />
Is tools authorizations valid for menu browser but not for DEM? Or how is it working?<br />
Have you got some documentation around worktop?<br />
<br />
But my question that started this thread isn't answered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ivo Ladage</div><div class="date">12th November 2002, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Tomas,<br />
<br />
Using Worktop both authorization mechanisms (DEM and Tools) can be used simultanously. Both the Menu browser and DEM browser appear in one single User Interface, but if you run a session from the Menu Browser Tools authorization is applied and if you run it from the DEM browser DEM authorization is applied (and so Tools authorization is ignored). So i figured this should answer you question, but let me know if it doesn't.<br />
I do have more documentation on Worktop &amp; DEM. I will send it by e-mail since it doesn't fit when i add it here as attachment. <br />

<br />
Yes, it is possible to have tools authorisation + DEM at the same time. If step 5 in my previous mail doesn't work you have to contact your Baan provider since either (some of) your DEM models are expired or your projectmodel phasing is not set correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomas Engberg</div><div class="date">12th November 2002, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">step 5 doesn't work because the session you stated doesn't exist in our version. I get the error message session not found.<br />
But when I look in tools, I see that session with the expired flag checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 07:57</div></div><div class="posttext">The generation of user authorizations is changed between BaanIV and BaanERP.<br />
In BaanIV real entries in the Tools tables are generated using session tgbrg4250s000. (this one is started from the Project Model)<br />
In Baan 5.0b this session is called tgbrg4250m000 and in fact is in Tools tables only changing the startup menu in the User Data. No Tools entries are stored anymore.<br />
In Baan 5.0c the session is called Configure Baan Employees and its code is tgbrg8240m000.</div></div><hr />

        I have attached the user to the worktop tree(also converted to run time) and selected all the options but when I logged on as the user with a DEM Menu, I still get &quot;No Worktop Authoriaztuon has been defined for this configuration&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
