<br />
I have found that this user is linked to the DEM owner (tgbrg300.user) within session tgbrg4100m000<br />
<br />
What are the ramifications of deleting this user? are there other places it could be found within DEM and what is the process for changing it to another 'live' user account</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is would always be best to transfer the ownership to another user rather then just deleting the user itself.</div></div><hr />
