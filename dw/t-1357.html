<br />
In the past some issues regarding the licencing have been added and that might bother you right now.<br />
<br />
If just importing does not work out, try importing the dump in a company with the 'other' software-level. Or the other way around, try upgrading a company on the original server.</div></div><hr />

I have suffered a problem whereby when doing export dumps and imports dumps that the license key is getting corrupt in this process. BaaN Support is trying to solve this.<br />
<br />
Which version of BaaN are you using?<br />
Which sessions are you using for the export and import dumps?</div></div><hr />

         The licensing problems may be because the dump of the version created may be a licensed version, if you try importing a version dump which is licensed , then the version to which it is imported also becomes licensed.<br />
The version errors may be due to the wrong version to which it is being imported, usualy in the session tgbrg1245m000 uncheck the check box &quot;Import model items into different version&quot;. While importing automatically the version in the dump is created in the importing environment.<br />
