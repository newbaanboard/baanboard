<br />
1) We use the BW client software to access a Baan ERP 5.0c<br />
2) Our Server is in a Unix System (Sun Solaris)<br />
3) As you know we have different forms to make that when a user startup BW, a special session of baan to be execute:<br />
  a) putting the name of that session in then command field of a bshell environment page of a BW configuration program, that its ok.<br />
  b) we can change the bshell start program modified the $BSE/ipc_info to execute a unix script to set environment variables and so on, and after in this shell to call a baan, by example:<br />
   exec $BSE/bin/bshell6.2 &quot;$@&quot;  tccom0501m000  <br />
<br />
  that is ok.<br />
<br />
This is correct for user that use the menu explorer. But if the user have a new menu (generated by DEM), and use the Dinamic menu explorer, the sesion called is not executed (the user have permission to execute that session)<br />
<br />
<br />
May you help me , it´s a restriction with DEM ??<br />
<br />
Note: Sorry  for my bad english, but my natural language is spanish.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">31st March 2003, 09:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is a new restriction. Should have been there earlier.<br />
<br />
Because through those mentioned options it is then not possible to check and use DEM authorizations.<br />
And that is what you want, when an end-user is defined to be a DEM user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dsp8481</div><div class="date">4th April 2003, 00:37</div></div><div class="posttext">But....you can use the key maps in tools and the user can start sessions with the F keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">7th April 2003, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds strange to me, because for that you need first to be logged on or not.<br />
You mean in a session F keys can be used, even when the menu options are greyed ?<br />
That seems a bug to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dsp8481</div><div class="date">7th April 2003, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on how you have your authorizations setup.  Here, we use DEM menus but we don't generate session authorizations through DEM. We let tools take care of the authorizations.  It gets complicated but if you take away from all the file, run program option, then the user can not access a session that is not on his menu anyway.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Through tools, once a user is logged into Baan, you can setup key maps, where certain sessions are mapped to certain &quot;F&quot; keys on the keyboard.  Then, once a user is logged in, he can use the &quot;F&quot; keys as shortcuts.  They won't automatically start.  <br />
<br />
through tools, you can also maintain startup sessions which automatically starts sessions upon log on into Baan,  However, the problem with this method is that the session start in the order of fastest to slowest, not in any predefined order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dsp8481</div><div class="date">7th April 2003, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">ooops!! so sorry - was thinking about after you are logged in.  <br />
<br />
However, we also set environment variables before a user logs in as well.  What we do is instead of calling the bshell6.# in the ipc_info file, we call a perl script which sets the environment variables and then from the perl script, we call the bshell6.#.<br />
<br />
<br />
Works well here for DEM and non-DEM users.  Sorry again for the earlier oversight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garias</div><div class="date">10th May 2003, 06:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for yours answers<br />
<br />
I didn´t say the objective that I have  changing the the file $BSE/lib/ipc_info for the users don´t execute directly the bshell6.2, because I want that the user execute a shell script unix. <br />
<br />
first it´s to set an special environment variables, that´s  true<br />
<br />
But I have an special ascii file when I have the name of every user and  a number (the max session of baan that the user can be run). <br />
<br />
With this file I can control how many licenses are using for every user. And I can say also that I don´t want that a user login in baan. <br />
<br />
When the script validate that the user can´t run a baan this present a baan session with a message that say why the user can´t open other sesion od baan, and it wait for a few second and after it logout automatcly. <br />
<br />
This works very fine, but if the user have an DEM menu, the special isntruction to run the baan with a special message session don´t run. That is the problem</div></div><hr />
