I want a User just to see and access two tools Session. I have defined the version, the Project Model, The Business Process, Assigned the Role to the Business Process(which has the two tools session),and Assigned the Role to the given User. But when i started the given User, the changes are not getting affected.He is able to see all the Sessions and not just the two sessions.<br />
<br />
What i am missing?</div></div><hr />
