<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">29th August 2007, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan standard session menus generated with &quot;Generate User Dialog&quot; (tgbrg4250s000) that used to be ok started to show up corrupted. Full sub folders corresponding to a business process/role disappear. Utilities containing sessions that should show up as folders show up as shell commands (they obviously error out when double clicked since Baan tries to execute the utility code as if it were an OS command).<br />
Re-run tgbrg4250s000 for that role and it gets fixed... for a while until it happens again. It used not to be that way but I could not figure out yet what it is that we are doing differently.<br />
To make things worse this particular customer does not have Baan support so installing solutions is not an option :mad: <br />
Have anyone seen this before? Any hints on what might be triggering this problem would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<br />
You must be using Menu Browser for DEM creation....<br />
<br />
In that case, you can backup directory $BSE/application/&lt;your VRC&gt;/mtgxxx2/ where normally the DEM menus are stored. Whenever any user faces a problem, you can restore the menu attached to his DEM (in maintain user data session) and everything will be fine.<br />

Thank you for your tip. It will most definitely be helpful to keep a backup.<br />
<br />
I'd still would like to find a way to avoid the situation altogether if some one has an idea how...<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
