MY EXPERIENCE WITH BAAN WORKFLOW IS THAT:<br />
<br />
THE BAAN IV C4 AND 5 GIVE YOU A WORKFLOW DEMO MODULE, WHO WORKS PRETTY WELL TO MAKE YOU AN GOOD IDEA.<br />
<br />
BUT IT IS NOT FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE THE MODULE NOT ACCEPT 2 DIRECTION DECISION.<br />
<br />
I WOULD AGREE IF YOU CAN DETERMINE AND INFORM  IF BAAN WORKFLOW IS AVAILABLE WITH BAAN V.....<br />
<br />
BIEN LE BONJOUR<br />

<br />
We are implementing the WFM (COSA) under BaaN V (ERP) at a large Telecom providor in the Netherlands. The 1st of Oktober we wil go live with it, at least we are hoping to.<br />
<br />
We will use the WFM for handling the error codes we get from our suppliers. It works as follows: The DEM processes defined within BaaN ERP are responsible for the way the Workflow manager handles and shows its processes. Each error code has its own DEM proces and therefor its ows WFM process.<br />
<br />
All the processes are working fine now (finally!!), but the  WFM is still not stable. E.g. Time to handle the error codes takes a long time and sometimes the WFM crashes! As far as I know there is no other company around that uses the WFM together with BaaN ERP. If there are people who have experience with it , please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thank in advance,<br />

<br />
Sorry, in Mexico, only Mexicana de Telecomunicaciones in Guadalajara  try during the O2 Baan PRI MODEL optimization level of implementation (BaaN TARGET), to work with the BaaN IV c5 and the DEMO workflow module. (year 2000-&gt; http://www.mtnet.com.mx/).<br />
<br />
As you do, we define a special DEM flow for each user.<br />
<br />
At that time BaaN Company plan to have WORKFLOW ready with BaaN V but......  <br />

Bien le bonjour<br />

Do you know this solution????<br />
<br />
EZ-Workflow<br />
Automated Flow Control &amp; User Notifications for Business transactions<br />
<br />
  <br />
 <br />
To complement the EZ-Process family and to support &amp; optimize the daily execution of business transactions, the EZ-Workflow module provides automated transaction routing and network-based tasks notification to users for all steps in route. Very efficient in complex and time-consuming approval processes (Requisition, PO, Expenses, etc...)  or any other human-intensive tasks, it enable significant increase in productivity by triggering each tasks as the one before just ended, eliminating the non-productive delays between them. The web-based feedback and electronic signature enable real-time transaction tracking for each tasks in progress, and enable detailed audit trail of &quot;Who did What When&quot;. <br />
FUNCTIONS &amp; FEATURES:<br />
<br />
EZ-Workflow FlowControl module: <br />
ability to define unlimited customized workflow routes for different business purposes <br />
usage of existing email infrastructure to transmit task notifications to users <br />
automated merge of Baan transaction data into the notification email <br />
once the initiation of the route is performed, all dispatch and completion of steps are automated by the EZ-Workflow engine (server-based) <br />
notification emails can be configured to launch applications or invoke content based on user selection <br />
user feedback performed using web-based form, operated within the user browser (no application to be installed) <br />
supports the user &quot;substitute&quot; concept enabling validated delegate to act upon task notification <br />
each step completion can be accompanied by a user note (free format) kept in history of transaction <br />
real-time monitoring of on-going tasks to identify bottlenecks and inactive transactions/steps <br />
full audit trail for each Business/Baan transaction, including detailed steps information (Who did What When) and the transaction data (Baan or others) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EZ-Workflow integration with Baan: <br />
ability to capture Baan generated Requisition/PO/etc and initiate appropriate workflow route <br />
ability to notify specific user that the workflow route has been completed to trigger a Baan transaction to be executed</div></div><hr />
