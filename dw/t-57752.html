<br />
I'm new in Baan IV and I've been asked to find out if there are any ways to implement a kind of workflow where we can electronically approve our purchase orders based upon the purchase level.<br />
<br />
It would be very helpfull if I could get some tips on possible tools, add ons, third party or just sharing experience.<br />
<br />
Thank you and kind regards,<br />

<br />
thanks for the link. Allthough it looks very interesting it's not really what I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a way to implement an approval rule system where different people have to approve the purchase order based on the total amount on the purchase order.<br />
<br />
E.g.:<br />
&lt; 10 € me<br />
&lt; 200 € my manager<br />
&lt; 10000 € my manager and his manager<br />
<br />
That's really the thing I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
Thanks though! This might help me with another challenge I'm facing:)<br />

Infor has developed IBPM work flow , which serves the purpose u mentioned for.<br />
U can model u r bsuniess requirement and trigger the process based on the transactions happen in u r ERP (B4 or LN)<br />
<br />
It is a very robust and powerful tool.<br />
