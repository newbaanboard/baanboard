<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philpom</div><div class="date">13th September 2004, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused:   Can anyone help put a little light on DEM reporting?<br />
<br />
The age old question.....  How can I tell what users have access to a certain session?<br />
<br />
I need to know not just can they access it via AMS but do they have access to it via DEM?  I can never seem to anwser that question and any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Mark</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not know a direct way either. I always used some queries to get to the requested information.<br />
<br />
In the table tgbrg520 you will find the sessionname linked to a process. With this processes you can than read the roles they are in (tgbrg340). With that information you will find the users linked to the roles (tgbrg820).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  ;)</div></div><hr />

There are lots of options on the print, so it may take a bit of experimentation, and I think you can only print six roles at a time, but you can get a format that shows you all the process activities a user can access, along with authorisation level.</div></div><hr />

So there the AMS tables are enough to look at.<br />
<br />
From BaanERP on that is not the case anymore and you could use the report mentioned by Jeff</div></div><hr />

I am running Baan 4c2,and 4c4 on AIX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">12th October 2004, 08:07</div></div><div class="posttext">You could use Tools session ttadv2431m000.<br />
This because in 4c the DEM authorizations are generated into Tools authorizations, so for an overview you can also use the Tools sessions.</div></div><hr />
