<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerrod</div><div class="date">4th September 2001, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">After exporting a version model from one environment and then importing it into the production environment, there seems to be some strange errors occuring.  When I go into Applications by Components (tgbrg5155m000) some of the Application Descriptions are missing from the associated Application.  When a user logs in to their role, the roles work, however the session displays are blank, but can be seen at the bottom of the menu when you click on them.  Has anyone seen this happen or have some thoughts on where to look?  I have already tried to go under Applications by Components, specific and Import Applications again, but the problem still exist.  Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Labels in DEM are created in one of the tools tables. If you later on export the DEM model from out the correct Package Combo you miss the labels.<br />
<br />
You have to tell your DEM developers to make sure that they work from out the correct VRC and not to change a company whithout using the right package combination!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerrod</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">The VRC is the same in both environments, and even the company numbers are similar.  Is there any additional exporting that needs to be done in order to capture these labels that appear to be missing?  I just used the standard Export Version Dump session (tgbrg1235m000) and took defaults other than excluding the Enterprise Model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case you have to investigate a little. Try to find the labels in the dd and check if they are in the dump.<br />
It looks like you have performed the right steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't say what version of the application you are using, but it sounds like a known 5.0c problem.  When you import the applications by component using tgbrg5155m000, then even though your component and release are correctly specified (the usual convention is BaanERP and B50_c) what gets filled into the cmpt and rele fields of tgbrg520 and tgbrg560 is BAAN and CORELLI due to some misplaced hard coding.<br />
<br />
You can tell if this is the case by going into any process with missing descriptions, open the activity properties and re-selecting the component and release fields using the zoom buttons.  If the activity descriptions appear when you save, this is your problem.  The easiest way to solve it is to run an sql routine that will replace the values in the tables with the correct ones.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerrod</div><div class="date">9th November 2001, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">For those interested or that helped with adding information on this situation that was occuring here.  This had been logged with Baan and I received a solution today (11/9), the solution was 119637.  Here is a brief description of the situation and solution:<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Session descriptions are not always shown.<br />
<br />
Specialy when the session exist in the highest VRC but only in 1 language.<br />
(Not the current language) and for the other languages the session exist in<br />
a lower vrc<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The search for language dependent description for a session is improved so<br />
that it will search via the vrc structure <br />
<br />
Hope this helps anyone else that is noticing this happening.<br />
