<br />
I have a question regarding authorizations via DEM.  We are in a multi-site environment running DEM roles, how am I able to eliminate the ability to change company from the DEM Browser (ttdsk2003m000)?  I know how to disable that session via Tools roles with adding the session then changing Authorization Groups to `No Authorization`.  Also has anyone found a quick ability to restrict sessions via DEM in 5.0c?  For instance, the ability to restrict make job from all sessions to eliminate the users from adding sessions by accident.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I guess you have to be pragmatic in when to use which.  Certain features, like company authorisation and dear old ttaad5102s000 are best blocked by use of a Tools role that contains those sessions that appear all over the place and that the common herd of users should not be allowed to touch.  A simple table level block is quick and effective.<br />
<br />
However, when access needs to be restricted to some users within a department but not others, DEM is the better tool.  By use of role mapping, activity level authorisation mask by session and role, and subsession/subsession by role authorisation, the security aspects are very flexible.  Where DEM really wins out over Tools, though, is that where the security is complex, it is far easier to track back what is causing a user's inability to access a session or option, because the roles are usually meaningful and the location of the problem can be seen from the desktop.  The downside of course is that security is applied at the process activity level, so if a single session appears 50 times in various processes, its security may have to be different each time.</div></div><hr />
