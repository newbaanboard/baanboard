This is working with a product called COSA.<br />
More information about the functionality of that product is present on   www.ley.de<br />
<br />
I attached a Baan White Paper about the integration for this.<br />
<br />
This White Paper was distributed by Baan at the launch of Workflow in 2000. The content is valid for the current interface, but they did not yet update the White Paper.<br />
<br />
If there are enough customers interested for Workflow on BaanIV, then maybe Baan will also release that again :-)</div></div><hr />

For COSA Workflow there is also an integration available to BaaN IVC4 which principally allows all features as provided to the BaaN V environment. I was involved personally in a very succesfull implementation last year, providing a close coorporation between BaaN and multiple other applications in 1 process. Beside COSA Workflow also the COSA Archive module for Document Management and COSA ActivityManager for ad-hoc workflow were implemented with the production pilot only weeks after start!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pschwind</div><div class="date">9th December 2002, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm COSA Workflow's usability in combination with Baan IVc4 and BaanERP 5.0c. I have been working as Chief Technology Officer at LEY, the company which has developed COSA Workflow. I have designed its main architecture in the first half of the 90's and gained a lot of experience in developing concepts for optimal use of workflow - and in designing and managing various implementation projects. <br />
<br />
One of my projects was the integration of COSA into BaanERP (Corelli) in 1999, which I have been managing on behalf of Baan Development, NL. At that time Baan actually owned the product. After I have left the project I know that the integration work has continued and that COSA Workflow is now available for both above mentioned versions.<br />
<br />
I myself can provide deep expert knowledge on optimal use of COSA Workflow in various business environments and especially in combination with Baan. <br />
<br />
For additional information concerning myself and my company's ability to assist you in the areas of sales and implementations (business added values, optimal process modelling, business process optimization with COSA), please contact me at ps@schwindling.biz or visit our website at http://www.schwindling.biz and http://www.cbi-network.com<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pschwind</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everybody,<br />
<br />
recently Baan and Transflow (the COSA Workflow producer Ley GmbH is now a part of this company) have fixed a partnership. Baan has officially announced availability of COSA for Baan (its in their price list now).<br />
<br />
If you need any advice on whether to use workflow or not, in which areas workflow is most profitable and/or on the specifics of COSA Workflow and its integration into Baan, do not hesitate to contact me (see http://www.schwindling.biz).<br />
<br />
There are also some downloadable white papers on the &quot;Workflow for Baan&quot; issue in the &quot;solutions&quot; area of http://www.cbi-network.com. On February 11 I will talk about business cases, added value and benefits of workflow during a Baan partner day at Transflow. I will keep you informed...<br />
<br />
Have a nice evening,<br />
Peter</div></div><hr />
