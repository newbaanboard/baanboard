In the Business Process maintained through the session tgbrg5100m000, can we exclude the specific User or User Roles to the sessions defined in the Business Process ? See the attached file.<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />

<br />
You can use Role (/sub-role) authorizations by Employee (Employee Group) and then link roles to the business process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not a DEM expert and not sure if these options are available in your DEM version.<br />
<br />
1. You can use - tgbrg5106m000 - Roles by Business Process - then change the max authorization level to &quot;no authorization&quot;.<br />
<br />
2. You can change the authorization level in the Business Process Activity level - tgbrg5122s000</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please let us know if you could do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">27th June 2005, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Should be no problem.   Just attach one of the roles to one session and both to the other.  If you have your role mappings at the process level, delete this and replace with mapping at the activity level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree with your advice. I had done the role mappings at the process level &amp; I can delete it. Please tell me the procedure / session nos. that how to do the mapping at the activity level ??<br />

              I am workign on BaaN IV so in that respect i am telling you how we can give the authoriztion on activity level for different roles.so following steps should be followed :<br />
1.Go to the Maintain Business process by Project(tgbrg4160s000).Then select the Business process in which we want to play with the authorization.<br />
2.Then go into the Editor for that particular BP.<br />
3.Now suppose there there 3 session in it let say X,Y &amp; Z and we want to remove the authorization from X for role let say P.<br />
4.Then in the editor if we click on the &quot;Man shaped icon&quot; besides the X we will have a drop down of all the roles attached to it.<br />
5.Now click on P then a session tgbrg3150s000(Maintain Roles by Activity by  bus process by business model) will be opened where we can exclude this role from this session X for this BP. <br />
<br />
So by above process we can remove any particulay role authorization on activity level this is when we have attached that particular role to the respective BP in the session &quot;Maintain Role by BP and by Business Model&quot;(tgbrg4141s000).</div></div><hr />

This adds to my knowledge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanx for your suggestions, but your solutions not reaches my requirements. My requirement is in one Business Process (BP) suppose there are 3 sessions say X,Y &amp; Z and we are having 3 roles as A,B &amp; C. We want to do mapping of authz. as X session can be open only the users of role A &amp; B, Y &amp; Z session can be open the users of role A,B &amp; C. How to do it ?<br />
<br />
Also as per your procedure to exclude the roles for a particular BP there is no need to go into the editor of the BP. Simply select the BP in session tgbrg4160s000, click on Link Roles button &amp; insert the roles which you want to exclude for the BP ie select YES option in field 'Excluded' in the session tgbrg4141s000. See attachment.<br />

<br />
Best is then link role A, B &amp; C to BP.<br />
Then exclude role C on session X.<br />
That should meet your requirements.</div></div><hr />

              as Awever suggested you can achieve your requirement by that..<br />
And ya as you have mentioned the method of excluding the role from BP in that case all the session under that BP will be execluded for that Role.....<br />
So if you want to execlude few of the sessions in a BP then you have to go to the BP editor and execlude it for that particular session....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viplov</div><div class="date">24th October 2005, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">you can do the same by excluding session from the users through ttaad2131m000.</div></div><hr />

I have tried the same procedure by create a new role with same BP and run session tgbrg3150m000 and exclude the particular session.  But it is not working in my case.  It is showing some error i,e &quot;Position number not allowed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kindly let me about the reason behind this error.<br />

Thanks in advance<br />
