<br />
There is a new version of the Hybrid Logistics model<br />
<br />
The linkage between the components (BCD, Function and Process, goes back a little towards Baan IV - the Function bubbles are back, and the use of case components is being abandoned<br />
<br />
There is no longer a capability to do organisation modelling in a diagrammatic form<br />
<br />
'Helper Applications' have disappeared; instead there's a new concept of Components and Applications to configure Baan and non-Baan executables<br />
<br />
The method for generating user desktops has changed somewhat - its complicated to set up but very powerful in controlling access<br />
<br />
The entity relationship modelling now works well, with automatic generation of links for any entities you might wish - its grrreat!<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are other bits and pieces, but I haven't stumbled across all of them yet...</div></div><hr />

Does 5.0c still use subsession authorizations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">11th October 2001, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">not sure I understand the question fully, but it is certainly still the case that the activity or role based authorisation on the main session controls the access to all subsessions and specific options accessible therefrom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DEM Mother Deb</div><div class="date">11th October 2001, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Your response leads me to believe that you're not using Subsession Authorization.  Here's an explanation ... and hopefully, I'm not telling you something you already know!<br />
<br />
Subsession authorization is a detailed way of setting the authorization level for a session that can be accessed from another session by zooming or some other means.<br />
<br />
For instance, from tcibd0501m000 General Item Data, you can double-click on an item and get to subsession tcibd0101s000 General Item Data.  From there, you can zoom out to tcmcs0123m000 Item Groups ... and from this session you can create a new Item Group.<br />
<br />
Well ... maybe you don't want some of your roles to be able to create a new Item Group, so in the Repository, on the activity box for tcibd0501m000, you insert subsession tcmcs0123m000.  You can leave the authorization set to Full Authorization because you want some of your roles to be able to create new Item Groups.  Then in the Project Model you open the subsession session by clicking on the Subsession icon, and you Edit Roles.  From here, you can add the roles that you want to give 'No Authorization' or 'Print/Display' authorization.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you didn't want anyone to be able to create an Item Group from the General Item Data session, you could set the subsession to 'Print/Display' in the Repository.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if the procedure was still the same in 5.0c. because the process of adding all of the possible subsessions to an activity box can be quite time consuming!  Especially if you have hundreds of processes ... the way we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">12th October 2001, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right - we aren't using subsession authorisation as you describe.  We have found that in almost all of our processes and activities there is one of the Activity level authorisation options that gives an acceptable security level for the available subsessions and specific choices.<br />
<br />
However, I've checked, and yes it is there, and I'll probably use it now for a couple of sessions that at present I've got control of only through the co-operation of a Tools colleague.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DEM Mother Deb</div><div class="date">12th October 2001, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad that was information you could use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishy65</div><div class="date">17th December 2001, 22:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard that in Baan 5.0c there can be only 1 project model defined . Is that true ?<br />
<br />
We are currently on Baan 5.0 b and have defined multiple project models for our multiple facilities and will be moving to Baan 5.0c soon. <br />
<br />
vishal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">20th December 2001, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">You can safely heap scorn and ridicule upon whoever told you that!  Of course you can have multiple project models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishy65</div><div class="date">20th December 2001, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your response and I did go back to the guy and asked again and this time I got a different response which is that there can be only one common  list of roles for all project models  in 5.0c . Whereas in 5.0b we were able to define roles by project model and now that feature is taken off. Is that true ?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we don't have 5.0c installed and thats why can't confirm anything . Will appreciate if you can confirm above statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
Well, this time you have got a true, but very limited answer.  The roles are defined not in the project models, but in the repository.  It is the employee code that you append to the project model.  I think that's the same in 5.0b...?<br />
<br />
A difference that you may not be aware of is that it is no longer possible to model org diagrams in the DEM Editor, but the role, employee and employee group functionality is still there.<br />
<br />
Thus the list of roles that you define within a version is available jointly for employees in any project model in that version.  I have faced a similar issue on my curent project;  we have a single finance, multi-logistics setup on a shared server.  The roles are centrally defined and (thus far) consistent in their process mapping.  But when we come to build post definitions from the roles, the different sites vary in their understanding of what a job really means.<br />
<br />
We have devised two ways of overcoming this, both based on use of versions.  The first step was to determine that each site would not only have its own project model, but that the project  model for each site would sit in its own version, all derived from the common version where the process repository resides.  The first method was to define those roles which have variant functionality between sites, and copy them down into the versions where the project models live.  The employees linked to the project model had this as their default version, so since the role to process mapping can be different by project model, employees logging into different logistics companies get their correct desktops.  The other method is simpler, and works well when job boundaries differ between sites.  Then we can leave all the process-linked roles in the common version, and create 'super-roles' in the derived versions to simulate post titles.  The employee is then linked in the derived project model to a single role in the site specific version, which maps to one or more roles in the common version.<br />
<br />
Sorry this has been long-winded, but I hope it helps you get over the 'can't do that' answers which sound more like 'don't fancy the work involved'<br />
<br />
Happy New Year<br />

Thanks Jeff.  <br />
<br />
Does 5.0c still use subsession authorizations? <br />
<br />
A number of Baan V.0c subsessions are enabled for DEM, as they were in V.0b.   Yes, you can establish authorizations for them; however, be sure to check that these are callable as separate sessions.  Not all subsessions are callable in DEM.<br />

<br />
If you have given permission for a subsession, by default that role has access to the subsessions.   The duty here in modeling is to identify which roles should not have access or have restricted access to these subsessions and edit the role assignment to these particular subsessions to restrict that access as noted in the above response.   Be aware that in Baan V.0b, the permission for print/display actually granted full authorization.   You should check the actual authorization in V.0c for print/display.</div></div><hr />
