<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NatashaL</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any way to have one central version and have all companies 'point' to that version?  That is, I want to share all the processes, utilities, roles, etc, across ALL companies.  Any changes I make to the central version will reflect in all companies without me having to export/import to each company. <br />
<br />
Right now, I'm having a hard time maintaining the new version by exporting/importing every small change.  Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

We had this exact same problem during our initial implementation.<br />
We set up 'Logical Tables' (ttaad4120m000) to share the DEM data across many companies.  Logical tables point one company to another company's tables, thus changes in either company will be reflected in both.<br />
<br />
It worked very well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lroeleveld</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">This session is used in the context of parameter settings. Baan DEM allows to set parameters based on the implemented DEM model. Since (most) parameters are company-specific, this session let the customer define for which companies the parameters will be written into the respective tables. You cannot run the Maintain Values by Parameter, Company, and Model (tgbrg9110s000) session, if you have not used the Maintain Companies by Project Model (tgbrg4110s000) session first.<br />
<br />
This session is not valuable when looking at your initial question. If you leave me your e-mail address, I can share some document about table sharing for DEM in Baan IV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Natashal,<br />
We have a setup of single logistic and multi finance (12 finance companies). All companies are in the same PVRC. We have our DEMs in only one Central repository company (that is logistic company # 100) but our users are all over in finance &amp; logistic companies and we share the same processes and utilities and roles all over in these companies from our central repository comp. # 100. Once I set up a new finance company I go to the session tgbrg01000s000 in that company and define the Enterprise Modeler Data company # in that field. Example my companies 110 to 190 (12 finance companies) session values shows the Enterprise Modeler data = 100 (company number). (Because our DEMs reside in company 100.)<br />
<br />
I hope this helps in your issue. Let me know if you still have questions.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mraguthu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lroeleveld</div><div class="date">9th October 2004, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Your reply Mraguthu is valid for Baan ERP5, since the central modeling company is implemented in that version. However, it's not for the Baan IV version. In Baan IV, logical tables can be shared.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
