we are using Multicompany Structure (500,501,502). i am developing the DEM for the Same. I had defined Central company to store Enterprise Modeler Data as 500. i have created components for standard LN in company &quot;500&quot;, and designed some Business Process, employee and generated the User dialog with the option &quot;change Company allowed&quot;.<br />
<br />
1. When i am logging in with the user id, i am getting a screen to choose the company and Project Model. How to Default it ?.<br />
2. If selecting the company and Project Model of 500 it is working fine. If i am changing the company, and opening the session it is again opening the session in parent company.<br />
3. i generated user dialog with company 502 and option change company allowed. .<br />
       This time while opening the session it is showing the message &quot;Could not start application &quot;session name&quot; of component &quot;ERP LN LN6.1&quot;.&quot;<br />
Pl. suggest how to setup.<br />
<br />
** when i am opening sessions in other company, they are opening with 500 company code, we didnot shared the tgbrg tables.</div></div><hr />

1. When i am logging in with the user id, i am getting a screen to choose the company and Project Model. How to Default it ?.<br />
<br />
If you want only 1 company to appear for every user, please remove employee data maintained against Project models in other companies. Else, click on &quot;Default Company&quot; button while logging in.<br />
<br />
2. If selecting the company and Project Model of 500 it is working fine. If i am changing the company, and opening the session it is again opening the session in parent company.<br />
You have to open different worktop documents to open different companies in Worktop.</div></div><hr />
