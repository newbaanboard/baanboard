<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lroeleveld</div><div class="date">28th May 2002, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, applying DEM in a supply chain is really a nice concept. It's integrating the collaboration within a supply chain, even outside the boundaries of your enterprise.<br />
<br />
For the applicability of DEM outside the enterprise borders, you've to consider the following:<br />
- Outside users need to be connected to the (internal) BaanERP system, since DEM is an integral part of BaanERP. <br />
- These outside users need to be modeled in DEM and also have roles assigned to allow them to execute the related BaanERP sessions<br />
<br />
Summarizing, you need to handle and to setup outside users in a similar way as you handle your internal employees. Specific care need to be taken regarding authorization, since you don't want to allow outside users to access sessions that they're not authorized for.<br />
<br />
A nice alternative is offered by applying EZ-Process (already in discussion in this forum). EZ-Process publish the processes on the internet, allowing also authorized external users to access these flows with only a browser. User authentication can be handled in several ways, e.g. using the standard NT-authentication mechanism.<br />
Invoking applications from these 'thin' webflows can be done in several ways:<br />
- easiest integration is for internet-based applications (to be invoked with http://). Be aware that this also can include activities with relations to client-based applications that can be started over the internet (e.g. Word, Excel etc.)<br />
- for Baan sessions, EZ-Process is integrated with Baan Webtop, which means that an external user can invoke in his browser directly the modeled session. For this scenario, the external user need to have a Baan login but doesn't need the Baan Client software. To simplify this, it can also be a generic company login.<br />
- for non-Baan applications, you need to connect and authorize the users to startup these applications through the firewall of your organization. Technical staff of your organization should be able to give you more information regaring this.<br />
<br />
I've done these integrations before in similar type of projects. Feel free to email me: lroeleveld@proflow.nl<br />

Kind regards,<br />
