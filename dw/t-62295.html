We use Baan5 version 5 0 c.<br />
How do I make modifications so its clear for the DEM user in wich enviroment he is.<br />
I would like to make these changes system wide.<br />
<br />
I tried the icons in $BSE/gif/brg  addproc1.gif   and 2,3,4 but they had no effect<br />
<br />
I set the BAAN_WIN_TITLE variable but that only works in menu titles.<br />
<br />
Do you know how to change f.i. the background color in DEM<br />
Or at least the window title.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Gerard</div></div><hr />

<br />

So I am not sure what needs to be done to make it work.  Wait for someone else and they might have an answer.  From what I heard the NAZDAQ tool was simple, but I have not used it either.  I just know in our company we use DEM flows for production, but not as the main entry point for other companies. They test them or launch them, but a lot of users just use the menus.</div></div><hr />
