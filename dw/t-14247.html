I need to import descriptions and notes from language 6 (Italian) to language 5 (Spanish). I've run session tgbrg1237m000 ad it had created files containing the right information I need to import in DEM models. Now I have to use session ttadv6231m000...but I don't know how to use it. Is there somebody who can help me?<br />

<br />
Is the ttadv6231m000 only inside the Development? <br />
<br />
Cause we nearly have the same Problem, transfering Models between english and german. Thanks to SSA we have the german language pack now, but itÂ´s impossible to transfer the models between english and german without ttadv6231m000?<br />
<br />
Does anyone has a good idea how this could work? The ttadv6231m000 is not found on our system cause we did not purchase Development....anyway there should be a solution to transfer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">malutz</div><div class="date">18th October 2004, 07:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently had a Baan-rollout in France. Therefore we had to copy the entire DEM from german into french.<br />
<br />
We exported the entire Version with a german login (including the components). Second step we logged in with a french user and imported the complete Version just using the DEM session.<br />
<br />
We had our Keyuser revising the and translating the DEM processes afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PEMTec_SCD</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for this information, but htere are a few probs with ERP LN at the moment.<br />
SSA is not able to response within 2 weeks to this problem, cause we could switch the language after eporting with ttadv8910m000 and importing with ttadv8920m000, but we are not able to open the models with the DEM Editor in German. I wait for an answer of SSA but it seems like they are not able to resolve this quickly.<br />
We now have all Parts of the DEM Models also avaible in german but only the fields with an manual or business process, but not the fields with an application. They are simple empty however we have installed the full german language.<br />
<br />
Wait and see...but getting angry about SSA........they are not able to support the ERP LN 6.1...i think the support is not trained enough today....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probalby you filled them at the moment, that on your system only 1 language was installed.<br />
When you would run the session to Import ..for Running ERP environment (tgbrg5155m000-&gt; specific -&gt; Import Applications) again at this moment, then it would add descriptions in both languages and then you should be able to see also the activities with comp.appl. in your new language.</div></div><hr />
