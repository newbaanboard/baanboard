How well do they suit for environments with many different business systems (not just Baan) ? And has anyone automated processes using the workflow tool ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">don_m_hmi</div><div class="date">10th May 2002, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I Work at Herman Miller Inc. We make office furniture. We use Baan 4c3 and many other business systems. In Baan we use DEM, and we have 1200 or so users using dynamic menus generated out of DEM in our production environment. We have used DEM in the past to document/configure our Baan system, about 250 processes. These tools had worked extremely well for us with Baan. We decided that we wanted to use the same tools to document some of our other non-Baan business processes. The problem we ran into was that when we did the documentation in DEM, the non-Baan users could not see the process work. Our solution to this problem was to purchase EZ-Publisher. We have had the software running for a year now. It has performed beyond our expectations. We have several totally non-Baan systems using this for process definition. We are even able to run the application that we are documenting from the process maps we have built in EZ-Publisher. Our internal business partners use our process web site, and we are expanding to provide process documentation to our external suppliers that provide our raw materials. Because the processes are html pages we are linking to them from our training web site also. This way when people are learning how to use business systems they can also view the processes that the software is used in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lroeleveld</div><div class="date">11th May 2002, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I worked for Baan from 1996 up to begin of this year, always in the Dynamic Enterprise Modeling area and from there I've experience in working with EZ-Process (www.ez-process.com). Within Baan, we had an extensive catalog of industry specific reference models. EZ-Publisher allowed us to publish these models on the web, to support our sales force as well as to provide (potential) customer insight into the supported processes. Main advantages are that no Baan installation is required for viewing the models, and the models (best practices) can be enriched with additional content, maintained centrally and accessed via only a browser.<br />
The extranet section of this website can be accessed with http://dem-models.baan.com.<br />
Experience with the company DynaFlow has been very good. The installation and support was done in a short time. The work is mainly in enriching the published models with all the content that can be added.<br />
After the implementation for Baan Business Knowledge Center, we also did another implementation at Baan Benelux, mainly to support customer demo's.<br />
Last actions within Baan have been to integrate EZ-Publisher with the Baan Portal and to enable invocation of (Baan) applications via the Webtop framework. This allows start-up of sessions directly from the browser, passing the required authentication and identification parameters automatically through. At InForum, the Baan event in Rome (april 2002) this functionality has been demonstrated to the public.<br />
