<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotjens</div><div class="date">12th January 2007, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">If the new version is derived from EBM37 it is easy enough to copy it. Actually that is the only way a change can be made if the new version is the version you are using.<br />
If the new version is not derived from EBM37 you can consider to use session tgbrg1200m000, Copy Version Data to Other Version.<br />
<br />
As you didn't state your approach or were very specific on the situation I can't suggest anything else than this. Good luck!</div></div><hr />
