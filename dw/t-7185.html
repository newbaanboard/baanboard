<br />
We are on Baan IV c4 with ASCII interface.<br />
<br />
We had tried to implement Baan Authorizations using Menus and Baan Tools Authorizations. Over the years, it has grown very high and has now become really cumbersome to maintain. An addition of a small customization is requiring to modify many menus and many Authorizations in Baan IV.<br />
<br />
If we implement DEM, is it possible to import the menus structure into DEM tables and then, arrive at a model ?<br />
<br />
In prior versions of Baan IV i.e. Baan 3.1 b (TRITON),   there used to be an &quot;Triton Organizer&quot;, which used to build repository from menus structures.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand your question, but to my knowledge this is not possible in the standard Baan environment.<br />
<br />
This would require that it is possible to map a functional menu structure into a process-oriented flow. The business process logic is different from the functional logic, so automatic mapping would be out of the question anyway.<br />
<br />
Still, I would encourage you to take time and investigate what you can win with DEM for your company. The maintenance burden that you've today can significantly be diminished by maintaining your authorization with DEM. I've seen examples of companies with 1000+ Baan users, where authorization and model administration is a part-time job.<br />
<br />
Another approach could be to implement with DEM during a migration to another Baan version. Anyway, in case you need expert knowledge or assessment for such a move, you can contact me.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
