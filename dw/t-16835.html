<br />
Currently in the process of transferring DEM model between two servers.<br />
<br />
Exported model from server1 using tgbrg1235m000 (Baan 4c3 sch0) and then imported into server2 using tgbrg1245m000 (Bann 4c4 ags0). <br />
<br />
All the processes appeared to work ok however when attempting to access the model on server2 we are getting the following message;<br />
<br />
&quot;Licence data for current version is not correct, change current version ?&quot;<br />
<br />
Does DEM need a seperate licence ?<br />
<br />

<br />
Session - tgbrg1247m000 - Revalidate Licensed Version. I think all the BaaN Standard Versions are Licensed so you might need a new license key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davismit</div><div class="date">20th October 2004, 11:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, Try checking table tgbrg100 for you DEM company in GTM.  We had a similiar problem on some of our models after and export/import.  We found that the licence check field was correct but the licence expiry date (form 3, ledt) had not been brought over/had been corrupted.  We put a valid date in (taken form original export server) and found this worked. (Check the licence key to with the origial DEM company too)<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />

<br />
We have got around the problem in a similar manner to your suggestion Dave by removing records in table tgbrg101 prior to import.<br />
<br />
In addition Baan Support have contacted us and told us to obtain a new licence key and run Session - tgbrg1247m000 - Revalidate Licensed Version.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
