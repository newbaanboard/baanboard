 <br />
I would like to know if there is a product that support the printing of ISO manuals. We are in the process to be certified for ISO 9001 and would like to be able to print ISO manuals based on our processes as defined in Baan DEM. We periodically update our processes and would like to avoid duplication of the processes in DEM and ISO manuals.<br />
 <br />
Looking forward to your suggestions,<br />
Kind regards,<br />

Roel</div></div><hr />

you may want to include the external application (that prints the manuals) within your process through DEM. in this case there is a bit of control for duplication. the external application will default to the document when opened. this can be done easily through DEM.<br />
another way is just make sure that you have a good quality control procedure for revisions in documents and processes. i believe these are mentioned in your ISO documentation too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
which version of Baan do you mean?<br />
<br />
In BaanIV it gave an add-on which called &quot;Dynamic Knowledge Modeler (DKM)&quot; that exported the diagramms in a Word-Dokument. But my information is, that this product is no more available because it was a product of BBI (later TriArch).<br />
<br />
In BaanERP (V) the Diagramms can printed in an easy way (without a postscript printer) or export in a Metafile which you can import for example in a Worddocument.<br />
<br />
The new Worktop should give more possibilities but I havenÂ´t try it out.<br />
<br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
It allows you to easily attach a document to any Baan Session, by just changing the Session's Form. <br />
<br />
This document can be an HTML file, PDF File or a Word File.<br />

thnx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pierre B.</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">More and more DEM customers are using the EZ-Process extentions to merge their ISO documentation to their DEM processes, and therefore be able to print them when needed. <br />
<br />
One of modules of EZ-Process is call EZ-Publisher and enable any Baan DEM IV and/or ERP-5 diagrams to be made available to any Intranet employees (Baan users or not) in their standard browser.  In addition to publish in the same models other formats of diagrams such as Visio/ARIS/etc..., it also enable various formats of content (doc, pdf, xls, htm, xml, scm, acad, etc...) to be attached directly to DEM processes and process activities.  The resulting model can not only enable complete web-navigation from the &quot;Parent&quot; diagrams to the &quot;Child&quot; ones (unlimited drill-down levels), but it also provides the users the ability to request any ISO Work Instructions, training manuals, internal policies, etc to be displayed into their browser, without any time comsuming search. As this navigation always display the most updated process and documentation information, it is in my point of view better than printing the manuals.<br />
<br />
When the printing is required, a complementary module, called EZ-Book, is used. Similar to the DKM application referred in this thread, it enable an &quot;e-Book&quot; to be generated specific to a user-role (Ex: Scheduler), a business segment (Ex: Production Planning), a specific model, etc...  Any users (Baan and non-Baan), from their browser, can then request the generation of the customized &quot;e-Book&quot;. This one, including diagram images and all related ISO/Business documentation, can then be printed easily. EZ-Book is certified on both Baan DEM IV and ERP-5.<br />
<br />
A sample online demo of EZ-Book can be tried at www.ez-process.com (EZ-Book section).<br />
