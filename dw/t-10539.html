I am completely new to DEM so I have a simple problem: I have let's say 3 sessions and I want to run them using DEM. <br />
<br />
What I did till now is:<br />
-I changed in 'User Data'- Start up program: DEM Browser<br />
-I installed from Baan Enterprise Modeler the 'Install Client Applications'<br />
<br />
what should I do next????<br />

<br />
Answering your question, requires more information regarding the Baan version you're working with. Between Baan IVc, Baan ERP 5.0a and Baan ERP 5.0c there are differences in how to set up DEM. What is similar in all versions:<br />
<br />
- create process in repository<br />
- copy process to project model<br />
- define role and link it to process (or actvity)<br />
- define employee and link it to role<br />
- generate desktops<br />
<br />
From the fact that you've the session 'Install Client applications', I derive that you've at least Baan ERP 5.0a. Main difference between 5.0a and 5.0c is the authorization structure (in Baan 5.0a you have to define authorizations in the project model, in Baan 5.0c you can do that in the repository) and the component/application structure.<br />
<br />
Changing in 'user data' the startup program to DEM Browser (what you did) is not necessary. That is automatically done while generating the desktop.<br />
<br />

thanks for the answer<br />
That's what I found and used to model processes (I will describe it shortly maybe it will be usefull for somebody else):<br />
<br />
1.Business Processes tgbrg5500m000<br />
<br />
2.Project Models tgbrg4500m000 - Speecific\Business Processes by Project Model<br />
<br />
Business Processes by Project Model tgbrg4560m000 Specific\Import Range of Business Processes<br />
  + Specific\Link Roles to Business processes<br />
<br />
That was OK but I do not know how to &quot;generate desktops&quot;? where to find it? I suppose it prepares DEM-menus.<br />

<br />
Please confirm that you're working with Baan ERP 5.0c (Corelli version). Just to make sure that I've the right perception of your situation.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I work currently with 5.0c version.<br />

<br />
Your description of creating processes in tgbrg5500m000 and project model in tgbrg4500m000 is looking ok. What you need to do next is:<br />
<br />
- verify that you've DEM employee(s) defined (and they're related to an existing Baan user)<br />
- verify that in DEM parameters (tgbrg0135s000) the checkbox 'Use employee - project model link' is UNchecked. (If this parameter is marked, the employee need to be linked to the project model separately.)<br />
- Create an entry in session 'Runtime Version, Project Model, and Optimization Phase per Company'. Make sure you select the version and project model you've created before.<br />
- You can 'preview' the DEM browser from the 'employees' session (specific -&gt; 'start screen employee')<br />
- By running session 'Configure Baan users by DEM employees' (tgbrg8240m000), the DEM settings are written into the user tables of the Baan user. After that, you can logon with the employee you've selected in this session tgbrg8240m000. The menu you should get is the DEM desktop.<br />
<br />
Success!<br />

I followed your instructions and I succeed. <br />
I attached the DEM-menus file that I received, if something is wrong, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanx very much for your help<br />

another issue is:<br />
let's say that I have a session 1 where I can insert a new record or modify one of the existing.<br />
On the basis of the action in session 1, I want to run:<br />
when in session 1 was inserted a new record I want automatically to run session 2;<br />
when in session 1 one of the records was modified by user or nothing was done I want automatically to run session 3<br />
<br />
is this kind of operation possible in DEM?<br />
if yes, do I have to write sth. in the script to let DEM know what kind of acction the user took (insert a new recod or modify)?<br />

No this is not part of the DEM functionality.<br />
DEM cannot react dynamically on the actions of the end-user.<br />
<br />
If you want something like that, it looks more that you want a Workflow controlled process. <br />
<br />
You could then model a process, with a Control activity after the first session, where the decision is placed to go to session 2 or session 3.<br />
<br />
Baan offers Workflow for 5.0c together with a partner Transflow.<br />
<br />
In DEM the only option is to model the process like above, but then still the end-user has to decide what to do.<br />
<br />
Or you could change the session itself, but if that is what you want ??...</div></div><hr />

To Awever:<br />
I don't get your point, what do you mean?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awever</div><div class="date">28th August 2003, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant customizing the session, so it evaluates before closing what is done and then starts up the new session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slawko</div><div class="date">28th August 2003, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">hi<br />
ok, but I do not want to change the session; <br />
I was rather thinking about finding an all-purpose way but if DEM does not offer it, the problem is clear for me.<br />

Speaking of preparing DEM sessions, IÂ’d like to ask if somebody knows how we can change the location of a session in a menu.<br />
For example, at the following pic, I want to move and put the session called Departments (the highlighted session) between Warehouses and Purchase Office.<br />
I tried with Business Processes (tgbrg5500m000) and with Enterprise Modeler Editor (EME) with no success. :(<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
sado</div></div><hr />

<br />
no problem at all!<br />
<br />
If you look at the DEM parameters, one of these controls the display sequence of objects in the desktop.  Select the option for ascending order of external codes.<br />
<br />
Then go to your process in the editor, and give the activity that you want to move an external code between the values of the two menu lines you want to insert it between.  Save the process, and that's it.  Next time users log on, the menu line will have moved.  <br />
<br />
There is an option within the editor to renumber external codes, which will automatically reset them all from the start state through to the end state, but if you have branches in your process the renumbering goes all the way down one, then the other, which might not result in the desktop you want.  Renumbering some or all of the external codes allows you to display the menu any way you want.<br />
<br />
Have fun<br />
<br />

has anyone of you used 'static conditions' and 'rules'?<br />
I don't know how to write the rules in Text Editor in Maintain Rules tgbrg7102s000 (in Baan 4), I mean the syntax of the rules.<br />
<br />
If somebody could post a few examples of syntax, I would be very thankful<br />
