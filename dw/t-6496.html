<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthony_wang</div><div class="date">2nd September 2002, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Would anyone please help to advice how to have DEM levels/structure in DEM browers?<br />
<br />
 We want to have such structure in BAAN system like function repository. <br />
<br />
For example, an AR major process including AR integration, manual invoice, Credit control and collections sub-processes.<br />
And in DEM browser, we would like to have an AR menu item, including sub-processes sub-menu. and each sub-menu contain sessions...<br />
<br />
I have tried in our BAAN IV c4 system. But i find i have to including the sub-process in the project model to have such effect. But then i will have extra menus for the sub process.<br />
And if i delete the sub-processes from project model, althoght i have such DEM browser structure, i can't open the session in the sub-processes(i have linked the role to the sub-processes nod).<br />
<br />
Thanks with best regards,</div></div><hr />

I don't believe you need to link the sub-process to the business model as long as the sub-process is nested within another<br />
process that belongs to the business model and complies with the roles assigned to the user within the business model.<br />
<br />
In our specific scenario:<br />
<br />
We have created a tool that we use in Production to sort out who has access to what based on what they can actually see via their menus or DEMs.  This tool is to be used for change management within DEMs.  We are using this tool to summarize for us exactly how many DEM setups would need to be changed and how many users would be  affected (hence the # of desktops to be generated).  We can now use this tool to accurately measure the administrative impact on customizing/renaming Baan sessions.  <br />
<br />
When trying to explain the report details to our users we have sent a quick tutorial that the desktops are interpreted as Company (business models) -&gt; Roles -&gt; Business Processes (consisting of Activities and/or Utilities and can be nested) -&gt; Sessions.<br />
<br />
To see what exists as far as nested utilities and nested activities you need to do a little bit of multi level querying in table ttgbrg520 | Business Process Activities and table ttgbrg560	| Sessions by Utility (if applicable to your setup).  <br />
<br />
The best way to figure out what's going on is to familarize yourself with icons (eg. people, wrench, etc.) and then grab yourself a more complex DEM setup and work your way back from the session level to the originating role (if available).  If this option is not available then just remember how the DEMs are interpretted and nest based on the desire icons.<br />
<br />
(Keep in mind, DEM setup could be different for each organization, there is no set way).<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

Actually i have solved the problem by setup main process including the process list. and delete the sub process from the project model.<br />
The roles will be linked to all the sub-process from the main process.<br />
Then the user desktop will have such hirancy of business processes instead of all processes list.<br />
