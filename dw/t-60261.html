<br />
I'm running mobile services. When my field service engineer makes a materials request from the warehouse from his PDA/handheld device. The stock is assigned. however if there is no stock in the warehouse, I get a transaction error.<br />
<br />
Error : Transaction aborted for component MaterialLine in business object ServiceOrder (Create) Error occurred in Method 'Create' on component 'MaterialLine' of Object 'tssoc200 ServiceOrder'. Cost price structure of item 16128-4027 not found.<br />
<br />
The cost on this item is $0.00 dollars however if there is no stock it creates this error.( yes the cost price reflects this- I suspect it blows this error due to lack of inventory)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I need to intercept the materials request from the Mobile Device. and have the materials request approved internally before it is issued and assigned back to the Field Service Engineer.<br />
<br />
any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.<br />
