<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Georges Dassesse</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I'm just brand new in this site and let's try it out...  I'm working in a multi-national cpy, where for the European division BaaN 4b2 is beying deployed to all our affiliates.<br />
<br />
Till now, the 'normal way' to implement it is via the DEM, while for the site I'm primeraly responsible for support (our HQ based in Brussels), I removed it and redid it completely via the authorizations.<br />
<br />
2 major reasons for that : <br />
a. the initial DEM's where too restrictive (as often, we don't expect that users go and search for additional info on the system in case of problems...) and we have only 1 person able to amend them (slow, heavy, ...)<br />
b. the managers there didn't like it anymore (after 1-2 years of use) as they realized that it was difficult to share informations, best practice... between themselves as they had different structures, even session names...<br />
<br />
I gave then them back the standard menu, and gave authorisations at session level (not module, too vague and dangerous).  But now (after 1-2 years again), I realize that even if that approach was simpler to put in place and manage, it is too heavy to maintain...<br />
<br />
I'm then trying to find work arrounds and potentially a mix of DEM and authorizations...  Would it be possible that a user would have the standard menu, but having DEM roles ONLY for the authorizations.  The idea beneath it is the following : when I add a new session to the standard menu, everybody sees it, but I need then to add it user per user... while adding it to only one role (for example 'generic financial reports') would be a single operation...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help !!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We also went down the DEM route and got into a bit of mixture of menus. We originally set users up on the DEM Automotive Model which proved to be totally unsuitable.<br />
<br />
We now have desktops in finance (a pain because you have to maintain authorisations and try getting them onto normal menus now), the finance managers have cut down standard menus and are super users. The rest of the site have customised menus which are set up by using DEM.<br />
<br />
Overall I prefer the customised DEM menus as your authorisations are generated automatically (if you have the latest patches loaded).<br />
<br />
Maybe you need to start from scratch identify users who have a certain role / roles and ask them to build up their own menus which you can then set up in DEM.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
<br />
1.You could create some dummy users with the authorisation required and copy the autorisations to the other users required.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2. Create the roles and authorisations via the dem and reset the menu<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
3. Add a (few) default display role(s) to the DEM menu and try to make the utilities uniform in all the processes so everybody has the same sessions for display and/or print.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no simple answer to whether to use DEM or Tools to generate authorisations, but some general guidelines are:<br />
<br />
-  if your DEM flows constitute PROCESS INSTRUCTION rather than just being a collection of relevant sessions, use DEM.  This is because changes in access should only follow changes in procedural instructions<br />
<br />
-  if your role definitions are rigid, incline towards DEM.  If your roles/job titles are based around individuals' capabilities, use Tools.<br />
<br />
-  if a number of people with variable skills are going to be involved in administration, DEM is helpful because it is much easier to work out WHY a user can or cannot access a particular session, and the skill level required before allowing someone to make changes is lower.<br />
<br />
- Avoid Desktops.  Thay are seductively easy to set up, but anyone that can remember Run Program / mtccom000000001,  or mtccom000000002 etc can get back to the full menu browser, so your Tools authorisations still have to be watertight.<br />
<br />
-  To avoid the problem common with DEM of how to access all the things no-one thought about during process design, just add a new process, call it General Enquiries, Miscellaneous, Aladdin's Cave or whatever you want.  Then add lots of activities, and link a utility to each one, and set up as the contents of the utility all of the print/display sessions relating to each topic. Make each one print/display access only, and attach all the roles.  It will take 2-3 days, but then its done forever!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best way to handle these issues with minimum maintenance effort is:<br />
1) Define what roles and subroles you actually have.<br />
2) Build the matrix of roles and subroles<br />
3) Evaluate your model, do the flows truely represent work activities??? By this I mean they are short, concise specific work assignments that real people perform.<br />
4) Rebuild the flows where necessary to reflect 3) above<br />
5) Perform a where used sessions in the model.   Look for instances of sessions which are repeated more than three times.   Theses should either be placed in a utility or subutility or your design of the flows using these is inaccurate.<br />
6) Assign the roles and subroles to the amended flows <br />
7) Attach the utilities (main and sub) where needed<br />
<br />
This should allow you to have the greatest flexability with the least maintenance effort.   If your company needs specific detailed help, I am a certified architect in DEM and have 25 years BPR experienece in over a dozen vertical industries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Georges Dassesse</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to all of you for these interesting replies.... but....<br />
<br />
- one thing I want to ensure is that every user has the same menu, even if in different departments or locations (we often have problems between them as they don't &quot;speak the same language&quot;)<br />
<br />
- the DEM (at least the way we use it here), is managing the authorizations 'by default'.  I mean by this that the idea beneath it is : you see the session, so you can activate it - you don't see it, so no activation possible.<br />
<br />
This last point has been (and still is) an issue : BaaN gives you in a lot of different sessions the possibility to go further by 'zoom' or by 'special'.  These sub-sessions are not only 'display' but as well 'maintain' sessions sometimes.<br />
<br />
Example : <br />
- in Finance, when you enter any type of financial transaction, you can zoom on the ledger account you need, but as well (still by zooming) create new accounts, change the Chart Of Accounts structure...<br />
- in Distribution, when you are maintaining the item master (typically done by Distribution or Brand people), you can go and update the standard cost of it (typically done by Finance people).<br />
<br />
How to deal with this in a DEM environement ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance to you all !!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael Phifer</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">To accomplish this requirement is trickier and takes much more effort.<br />
<br />
1)  You would need to identify restricted, normal and super user roles.   You know what normal and super user already are defined as in Baan.   The restricted role (a normal role where you have eliminated accesses by session) would have access to selected Baan Maintain sessions and subsessions, as defined through Tools.   By not giving access through Tools to the sessions you want to restrict the user from accessing; in the Maintain sessions, they could run the zooms and links but could not access those zoom or linked sessions from the session they were in.<br />
<br />
2) These roles could then be assigned as any other normal roles to the Process flows and the roles to the user.   This would restrict their ability to access via zoom and special what they could access.<br />
<br />
3)  This use of the &quot;restricted&quot; role could allow you to give your users a similar look to their menus, but the ability to enact actions would be different, depending upon the role combinations between normal and &quot;restricted&quot; you have assigned.<br />
<br />
4) Each &quot;restricted&quot; roles could be identified by adding an r to the front or back of the role label to distinguish it from its normal counterpart.<br />
<br />
Not easy, but doable.  It requires a premapping of these sessions against the links they have by zoom and special.   I would strongly recommend that the mapping by session you do to set this up be retained for use when you have a need to modify these &quot;restricted&quot; roles.   No need to reinvent the wheel over and over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">1st March 2002, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt; Ensure the same menu for every user:<br />
- This should typically be handled by DEM. Assign the proper roles and generate the menus. If one of the roles changes, all usermenus using that role need to be re-created.<br />
<br />
&gt; DEM is managing authorizations 'by default'<br />
- This is a good way of handling access, although some EDP Auditors may not like this 'leak in security'.<br />
<br />
- I normally set up user templates in Tools that have the proper authorizations. These templates have a 1:1 link to the Roles!<br />
<br />
&gt; Authorizations on sub-sessions<br />
- In your case you do not set up user templates to 'include' the session-authorizations as you let the user open the sessions from the menu.<br />
You may set up the user templates for 'exclusions' in the session authorizations. This way some sub-sessions are not accessible.<br />
But as always there's also a problem with this way of working: if one role 'includes' a certain session and another role 'excludes' the same one ... and one user has both roles ...<br />
<br />
You still have some decisions to take, good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael</div><div class="date">24th April 2002, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
<br />
We are on BaaN IVc. (And are preparing to start).<br />
<br />
We have business-process model in some specific notation (a kind of simplified UML).<br />
We want to make customized menus for ALL users (to implement restrictions based on business responsibilities). And we want to make very simplified, useful and plain menus (because most users are not familiar with computers at all).<br />
<br />
Now we are to solve two (m.b. three) problems:<br />
1. To set up session authorizations for users;<br />
2. To make suitable menu structures for users;<br />
3. (Optional) To make business-process model in BaaN - to represent actual business-process flow (as I've mentioned we DO have this model in another notation).<br />
<br />
I see 3 ways:<br />
<br />
1. Use only DEM. (Make menus based on BP structure)<br />
Plus: no use of Tools (it is a plus for business model administration); easiness in maintenance.<br />
Minus: In order to make suitable (simply and plain) menus we then will not be able to build ACTUAL business-process model (reflecting business flow). So we must then maintain our UML model as well. OR - if the model of ACTUAL BP will be build user menus will be too complicated.<br />
2. Use DEM for session authorizations, Tools/Menu Management for making menus.<br />
Plus: It is possible to make actual BP model in DEM; make (and maintain) any customized menus user can only wish.<br />
Minus: More tricky way (mainly in maintaining chain of role/user group/user).<br />
3. Use only Tools. (Tools user authorizations and Menu Management)<br />
Plus: ? (it is possible to make actual BP model in DEM but it will affect nothing)<br />
Minus: More difficult to create and administrate, NO correlation between BP model and authorizations/menus.<br />
<br />
So here are the questions:<br />
1. Are there any more variants?<br />
2. Which way is more common (and more widespread)?<br />
3. And the main - Which variant to choose?<br />
<br />
Thanking in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Georges Dassesse</div><div class="date">29th April 2002, 12:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Michael,<br />
<br />
I've got similar questions to yours (not sure what option is the best)... but I had some points to your note :<br />
<br />
- from my experience, the BP approach is VERY usefull for a beginner in BaaN or when a user changes of duties, but not more.  It is then too slow and doesn't give them any value added.  After a few weeks, they were crying to get out of it.<br />
<br />
- you mention that the DEM is managing the session authorizations...   This is partially true : the DEM approach is : you see it so you can activate it, you don't see it, no access.  In general it's valid, but we had a lot of problems with sub-sessions that the DEM is not managing at all (for example a user having access to the Item master but not to the 'cost accounting' part : through 'Special', he can caculate and activate the standard cost...).  There are many examples of that type, and for my point of vue, it's a big issue.<br />
<br />
- using BP and DEM menus is often too restricted : we don't always think about giving a lot of different reports and displays that will help them finding their ways.  In general, it's limited to the direct activity, but a user in Finance working with the integration will need to see a lot of different places (manufacturing, common, distribution, ...) as many things is impacting that area.<br />
<br />
- one point you didn't mention is the commonality of menu structure between users (even in different departments or locations) : having different menus is blocking them often exchanging information or tips and tricks...<br />
<br />
- finally, using only Tools is effectively heavy to administrate, but so far I didn't find any other way to have a good access security.<br />
<br />
Would you find something that satisfies our concerns, PLEASE spread it arround !!!<br />
<br />
Good luck, Geo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael</div><div class="date">29th April 2002, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello George,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your advices.<br />
<br />
All of your warnings are important. Concerning subsessions - I've asked about there restrictioning in parallel thread; the answer sounds sadly...<br />
<br />
One big question - you've wrote that:<br />
&quot;...It is then too slow and doesn't give them any value added. After a few weeks, they were crying to get out of it.&quot;  - Why? And what for do they need extra menues? (My opinion is that there is a business-process in which the user MUST do some steps - let's say using 5 sessions. He/she MUST NOT and MAY NOT do any other steps. What for does he/she need access to any more sessions?)<br />
<br />
The same concerns to &quot;...but a user in Finance working with the integration will need to see a lot of different places (manufacturing, common, distribution, ...) as many things is impacting that area...&quot; What for? Of course he/she needs some reports but just SOME; why isn't it possible to give him such reports in a special menu/utilite?<br />
<br />
We've dealt with such a problem - to get full information (for a decision, for example) user has to look into many reports. We decided to make special &quot;combined&quot; reports. It works - each user needs 5-6 &quot;combined&quot; reports and nothing else.<br />
Do you use such approach?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />
