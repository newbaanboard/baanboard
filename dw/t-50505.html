<br />
We are running an antique verison of Baan IVc2 patchset 0 and I have recently been given the DEM responsibilites.  I am having a problem where I have a role where the sessions do not show up at all after the users have been generated.  But the role heading does show up just nothing beneath it.  <br />
<br />
The business process has been specified, added to the project model, the role has been added to the business process and the users have been added to the role.  Following that I did a generate on the users.  The first time I did it by role, then I found the notes regarding doing it wide open by individual.  So I did a generate on a single use that way.  Still no luck.<br />
<br />
Are there any basic / noob mistakes I should check for?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
