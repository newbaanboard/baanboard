<br />
I work at a company that have recently implemented Infor LN with Ming.le. We performed most of our training in LN using the Navigator (which is the suitcase on the top right of the screen). We are now informed that it is difficult to configure security through the Navigator and is easier to use DEMs. <br />
<br />
I am not sure if I fully understand the difference between DEMs and the Navigator. Is there any reading material that I can refer to on the internet? Or if any of you could provide some explanation?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Not sure about how Navigator works. If it works same as Role Based authorizations i.e. Menus &amp; Sessions, I will go with that. It gives you more deeper security and once you are done building all the roles it becomes easier to handle and make modifications. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, a lot of people prefer DEM authorization as it gives you process wise detailed layout which helps users to understand step by step execution of the session's to help them complete their work. But, sometimes for some aspects there are security limitations and also, it takes time to create DEM Roles.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katiekelley</div><div class="date">31st March 2015, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The simple way to look at it is that DEM creates only the menu you want the person to use and by doing so you only give them access to the sessions you add to this menu.  With navigator it is the full menu and if you modify it you are only going to change what they see not the access they have to the sessions within.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
