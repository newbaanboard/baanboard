<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">3rd June 2009, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if there a better way to do this.<br />
<br />
Current situation:<br />
- we have a DEM 'development' Company<br />
   all modifications are done in this company.<br />
- then, the DEM is exported, rcp'd to the production computer, and then imported into 5 different company numbers. This is to avoid having to maintain the DEM separate for each company, even though the roles in the different companies are different, sometimes not even overlapping.<br />
- thereafter, the DEM User Dialogs are generated.<br />
<br />
What I have tried (and did not work):<br />
- I created the tg tables as LOGICAL tables in one company and PHYSICAL tables in another<br />
- Import the DEM into the PHYSICAL tables company<br />
- attemp to Generate the DEM User Dialogs in the LOGICAL tables company - this fails because the session does not find the physical tables<br />
<br />
What I am trying to achieve:<br />
- avoid importing the DEM Dump into five different companies<br />
- still be able to have the same role-based control that DEM User Dialog provides.<br />
<br />
Is there a solution to this?</div></div><hr />
