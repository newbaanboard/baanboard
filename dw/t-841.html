We print DEM's using ghost script. Initially the Dems were printing all right. However, after loading service pack 7 it is giving problems (though this should not happen). The BaaN logo is printed separately outside the DEM diagram . Also we are able to print the DEM only to the local printer and not across the network.<br />

<br />
This is done in Tools/ Device Manager/Maintenance/Maintain Device Data.   You need to complete the entries for: Device, Description, Device type, Locale, Driver, Device Queue, Paper type, Left margin and Page length.   <br />
<br />
You also need to ensure that the proper entries have been made in: Maintain paper types, Maintain fonts by paper types and Maintain device preference list by user (if you want to set a default printer).</div></div><hr />

Sai didn't give the full details. Let me explain the problem. We are taking the print of the DEM diagram as an ascii file from the BaaN session tgbrg5101m000. For the same diagram before loading the service pack the file size was 10KB and after loading the service pack the file size was around 17KB. That means there must be some problem with ttstpconv program which is now creating extra conversion code which is redundant. So I apprehend a problem with the ostpconv object. Your suggestions are most welcome.<br />

We renamed this object in the update PVRC and the problem is solved<br />
