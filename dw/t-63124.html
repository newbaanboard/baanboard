<br />
I have a query regarding disabling a form command from a standard session. <br />
<br />
We have Process browser defined from DEM Business Process. Now in a particular business process we have purchase order session tdpur4100m000 with full access. <br />
<br />
So when user open the session from this link, it opens the overview session of purchase orders. Then user double clicks on it and we get the MMT session tdpur4100m900 i.e. Purchase order - Lines session.<br />
<br />
In the purchase order lines we have a form command (session) under specific --&gt; Price --&gt; Change price and discount after receipts (tdpur4122m000). <br />
<br />
This option is enabled as soon as a GRN is made and before it is booked in finance. We want to restrict user to have this option. <br />
<br />
One way of doing this I figured out is through the session tgbrg5223m000 i.e. Global Change of Submodel Application, and insert print and display authorizations for this session for all indirect access which is the case here as well. <br />
<br />
But is there any way to disable that form command itself from DEM ? I tried to do it from Subapplication authorization in DEM but then I don't find the session tdpur4122m000 in subapplication of purchase order!!<br />
<br />
I would appreciate some guidance on this requirement please...</div></div><hr />

If you add tdpur4122m000 as a sub-application of tdpur4100m000, you will then be able to control access through sub-application modelling in the normal way,</div></div><hr />
