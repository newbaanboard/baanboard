We would like to use DEM Flows as process flows as interaction of all business functions.<br />
If we use DEM it allows only one sub process per activity box below Main process activity box.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to link number of DEM flows within one activity box.<br />
<br />

<br />
Purely within DEM you can define any number of process layers, so the activity within the sub-process can itself be just a diagram that breaks down to a number of more specific sub-processes.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if you are using IVc or ERP, you could set up Visio or similar as a helper application or component.  While this would only be of use in exploding processes that are not Baan enabled, the diagram produced is not subject to the sntax requirements of DEM.  Whether that is good or bad.....<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

You either perform a sub-process or not. If you have the choice between different sub-processes, you need to set up a decision-box (type = Or / Xor) and have different branches. The flow of those branches is tied together below the different sub-processes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael Phifer</div><div class="date">3rd April 2002, 00:16</div></div><div class="posttext">1) You can create a series of sub-processes and link each one to a specific process activity (shaded) box in your main flow, so that the operations will flow sequentially from one activity (shaded) process box to another in the main process flow and will invoke each subprocess flow in turn.<br />
<br />
2) You can set up a decisipn box with multiple branches to a series of process activity (shaded) boxes.  Each process activity (shaded) box is linked to a complete sub-process flow.</div></div><hr />
