<br />
Wondering if I get any advice here - in the table tgbrg820100 Roles by Employee. Each Employee has a list of Roles (AP/AR/GL etc) associated with their User ID<br />
<br />
Is there another table in ERP LN that specifies what tables they can access with those roles?<br />
<br />
Something similar to the attached picture<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Might need to wait for an LN person.  There was not a table that contained the actual table by role.  What I recall was that once the dem flow was populated and you generated a user it populated all of the tools tables.  We really did not have any specific database tables assigned to people.  You may just want to check the tools tables to see if when you generate a desktop those are populated.  Something to check until an LN user comes along.</div></div><hr />

If using a recent version of LN tools, you can use the enhanced AMS sessions to get what you need.  For each role, you can get users and sessions within the role with permission for each from DEM, including subapplications.  Tables, not so easy since each session may affect more than the session's main table.</div></div><hr />

It seems that AMS process changed a bit. Can anyone help to understand the changes done in the latest version or share any document for this.</div></div><hr />
