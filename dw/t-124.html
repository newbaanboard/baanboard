<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindah</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We are  currently on 4c4 Service pack 7 and &quot;of course&quot; are having a whole new set of problems in DEM's than we had in 4B4.  We migrated just recently and have found the problem of not being able to run User Dialog unless quiet time and users are OFF Baan.  Not good. We are a 24/7 facility, but are trying to work around our employees. Also, it seems when we run dialog on user and we exclude a session from user, user can STILL open and execute session even to the zoom level.  In 4b4, we authorized users session by session authorization - in c4 we authorized user by module and hoped to use exclusion to secure sub sessions etc. This is not working.  Does anyone have any information on this - any work around? We do not have source code.  I am thinking we must revert back to session by session authorization.  Any ideas.  Thank you for fast reply.</div></div><hr />

Authorisations had to be done manually and when generating the user in DEM the flag for authorisations had to be set to no. This was the case in b2glo0 and c4 SP6.</div></div><hr />
