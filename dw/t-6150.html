<br />
is there any Report or possibility to  check the authorizations within DEM, sorted by Session??<br />
<br />
There are four Tables with the .auth Field:<br />
tgbrg520.auth<br />
tgbrg506.auth<br />
tgbrg340.auth and<br />
tgbrg350.auth<br />
<br />
and I`m really get nerved in finding which Authorization get effective in combination with Role (tgbrg810), User and Business Process.<br />
<br />
We need this analysis for an auditing company and it`s very urgent.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if session also exists in V, but maybe the session tgbrg4450m000 will help. Be careful if you also setup the tools roles...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Session does not exist in Bann V.  It seems that the whole authorization thing changed a lot from IV to V.......<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Provided you select the right settings for the report, you can print out for selected roles a list of processes and sessions with an indication of the level of authorisation granted by the process activities.<br />
<br />
The EZ-Process software also provides an option to review access at role level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ran this report with Selection as follows:<br />
Business Process = PUM007<br />
Roles = PU001, A and QSL and please see attached document for the results that i get.<br />
The legend would define the different authorizations but the Authorizations are not explained for the individual roles. Here for example Role PU001 has only print/display for this Process PUM007 but you can`t see this in this report.<br />
<br />
I`m not familiar with the EZ-Process Software, but I will have a look for it.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

Sorry, but I couldn't read from your attachment what was happening.<br />
<br />
If you use the settings for the session as the attached screenshots, you should get some useable information.<br />
<br />

I did the selection in the same way as you did and the result is not very significant. Hope you can open the attachment now.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, yes, now I can see that it's empty!  Have you used a Project Model to map the roles to the processes?  If so, then you should opt for the Business model view, quote your Project Model no. and also your process range.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magast</div><div class="date">19th August 2002, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jeff,<br />
<br />
yes we used a Project Model to map the roles to the processes. Unfortunately I don`t understand your suggestion....does it mean to set the Range in &quot; &quot;? This did not work, only letters are expected.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
Martina</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">19th August 2002, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Martina<br />
<br />
On the first screen, there is a check-box entitled 'Business Model View'.  If you check this box, select Project Model, and enter the Project Model code in the range statement, what you should get is a printout that shows the role mapping as entered to the model.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you!! <br />
This report is a big help. Unfortunately there is no<br />
possibility to analyze the Authorizations by Session in General. We have approx. 50 Roles and more than 80 Business Processes. <br />
<br />
Hoping that nowbody is asking me which employee has which authorizations on special sessions I will work with this session.<br />
<br />
If I would have the possibility to create everything again I would reduce on as less Roles as necessary. Real &quot;Art&quot; is to define everything convenient within DEM - from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Thank you a lot!<br />
