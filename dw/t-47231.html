When i try to add a user to the current version, using the session Current Modeling Version by User (tgbrg1110m000), <br />
I get the message &quot;User 'abc' has no authorization for modeling version 'aaa' in company '111'. &quot;<br />
<br />
I get the same message when using the session tgbrg1211m000. <br />
<br />
What data/steps am I missing. <br />
Thanks for all the help<br />

<br />
I am currently working on LN at client site.I noticed that the business processes are created in a version say 'abd' (can view this through the Business process session in Enterprise modeller) and the project model is in a different project model version say 'def'.<br />
Is this right?<br />
Do the business processes need to exist in the same version as that of the project model?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help,<br />

The logic is the same as VRCs for the software objects - the user exists in a current version (for normal desktops this will be the one used in the default project model).  If the process quoted by the project model is not present in that version, the version it is derived from is checked, then the one that is derived from, and so on until it is found.  If the process is not present in the derivation path, it cannot be seen.</div></div><hr />
