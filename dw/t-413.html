<br />
I have a question regarding generating user dialogue tgbrg4250s00. <br />
I want to be able to select by role and generate for all users attached to that role. However, when I do this all roles are generated regardless of input. Baan are telling me this is standard functionality but I'm not convinced.<br />
<br />
4c4 sp7<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have this problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we've tried to do this in the past I always believed that you could just generate for one role as the session allows for the entry of a role range.<br />
<br />
However we always found this method ridiculously slow so now we tend to individual generate each user for the role as it is a great deal quicker.<br />
<br />
We are running 4c3 heavily patched for DEM.<br />
<br />
What was the official response from Baan regarding this issue ?<br />
<br />

<br />
The &quot;official&quot; response is that although you can specify a range of roles this is only to be used in conjunction with the user range. So if a user was linked to multiple roles you could regenerate for only one (or limited range) of these roles. Just does not ring true for me. This means that I am forced to generate each user individually which is fairly time consuming.</div></div><hr />

You learn something new every day.<br />
<br />
I always wondered why it took so long to run for one role.<br />
<br />
The individual users thing is a pain but it's one we've become accustomed to.<br />

<br />
When the original set up was completed here DEM user names were the initials of the user as it was commonly believed that the role was key in generating and regenerating. Since I have started working with it and discovered this is not the case I have been looking for a &quot;way out&quot;. If this appears to be a commonly accepted problem with generation then my alternative will be to change the user id to make it numeric. This will then allow me to set up logical ranges and get round the individual generation problem. Bit of a pain but will make life easier in the longrun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">22nd November 2001, 11:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I admire your resolve.<br />
<br />
We do have a numeric key to our DEM user names (more by luck than by judgement) and initially this worked quite well as departments were added to the system.<br />
<br />
However as the business reorganised itself this went to pot a little but I do try and stick related users next to each other whenever possible.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your task.<br />

Not sure if reslove or being stubborn is motivating this, there just has to be a better way :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In france we have now created 150 users and i have found a slave to attach DEM roles to them ;-)<br />
<br />
Seriously, we use Baan ERP and there is a session than generate user dialogue form roles attached to them.<br />
<br />
You just have to migrate to Baan ERP :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have approx 170 users in total (Northern Europe) largely all DEM users. A slave sounds like an excellent idea to me though I suspect I may have to change the job title to attract anybody :D <br />
<br />
As for migrating.....One day :) <br />
<br />
How's the project going anyway? Still on track for your live date?</div></div><hr />
