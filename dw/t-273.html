This alliance was triggered by the conviction and experience that Baan customers would take advantage from this solution. Baan did certify the interface and is actively using the product internally. We published recently most of the DEM Models on the intranet, and demo-parts of the models on the internet. Feel free to contact me if you've more questions (lroeleveld@baan.nl).<br />

It has been a great tool for us. We have 1200 active users and about 280 processes in DEM. With EZ-Publisher we can now distribute our business process to all employees (approx.7000) rather than just those with access to Baan. <br />
<br />
We began our implementations 5 years ago, since then  we have implemented Baan at 8 of our logistical compainies. I wish we had this tool when we first began, but I'm glad we have it now.<br />
<br />
We are using DEM to document other business systems that we use and we can now deliver that process documentation to those non-Baan user. <br />
<br />
Also with the business processes being web enabled we are able to use the processes in a WEB training site that we have on our corporate intranet. From the processes it is also easy to hook up task work instruction and other documnets that are releated to the process.<br />

<br />
And thanks again for doing the WebEx teleconference.  It got rave reviews ... just like your BWU presentation.<br />
<br />
The rumor is that we will be getting EZ Process, but I haven't received the 'official' word yet.  The rumor will make Pierre happy, but the 'official' word will be even better, I'm sure.<br />

How are you maintaining your non baan processes ?<br />
Are you putting them in DEM first? Or can you put them directly in EZ-publisher?<br />
<br />
We are already using DEM, but we find it hard to put all non-baan related business processes (like our product development) into DEM. Actually we don't want to do this.<br />
<br />
We are now looking for a system that allows us to maintain and visualize all processes. It must also act as a system to maintain our ISO9002 procedures<br />
<br />
We did have a brief demo of EZpublisher but we felt that it was only usefull for Baan processes/procedures.<br />
Thanks for sharing your further thoughts on this.</div></div><hr />

It works very well! We are using the same tools to document Baan and non-Baan apps. We also use the processes and releated activity based work instructions for our ISO 9000 documentation. Our ISO auditors liked what they saw!<br />
<br />
Dynaflow is also in the process of releasing a product called EZ-Modeler. It has the ability to edit DEM processes without needing DEM. I've seen the tool, in the future this is the way we plan on going. For now we edit and maintain non-Baan processes in DEM and then export to our intranet site. You can also publish Visio, and some Pro-E drawings using EZ-Publisher. People can then view those diagrams without needing Visio Pro-E installed on their PC.</div></div><hr />

It's primary use is for managing revision control for quality documents in support of ISO certification.  We also use it for vaulting and controlling dept./company policies, access request forms, service level agreements, etc.  The biggest advantage is that all documents are available to employees via a web browser and searches can be performed with keywords or by functional segments.  Also, all DEM business process documentation is stored in the EZ-Librarian vault and be accessed directly from the DEM diagrams as well as from the web search engine.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David Burr</div><div class="date">29th April 2004, 10:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Who can confirm the rumor that Fujitsu has selected Dynaflow's EZ-Workflow as workflow management solution? I heard they won that deal via a recent newsletter. It's interesting, as Fujitsu's iFlow product is the official SSA partner product. Anybody out there having more info?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As team leader of the selection process, I can confirm that we made a decision to go with EZ-Workflow.  Although in a workflow-to-workflow comparison, both products are rich in functionality, for Fujitsu Transaction Solutions, the Baan and DEM compliancy issues were critical in our selection.  The ability to integrate with our DEM models and application integration with Baan sessions were key to us.  I might also add that we have used EZ-Modeler and EZ-Book for some time and the DynaFlow track record is excellent.<br />

In addition to the post from Jim Gray from Fujitsu, I wish to inform you that a Customer Case Study is available at http://dynaflow-dem.com/Documents/FujitsuCaseStudy03.pdf about the EZ-Workflow implementation at Fujitsu. Hoping this one answer fully your posted question.<br />
