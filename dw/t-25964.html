<br />
Roles of Sub Business Process may not be found as it is already being attached to the main Business Process.  It will show in the roles untill the same is added to another role.</div></div><hr />

Using in BaanIVc4 session tgbrg4450m000.<br />
<br />
Role print session by BP in BaanIVc is tgbrg4440m000, which is started from within Print option in session roles by BP by Project Model.<br />
You can also print information to Excel based file about Role links.<br />
Go to session print project models, make selection and then you get an option for an Export report. One of them is for roles by activities and BP.<br />
Maybe that helps your info request.<br />
<br />
From BaanERP on, we have a session within the projectmodel to print the role-matrix, which gives you more insights in linked roles to BP's.</div></div><hr />
