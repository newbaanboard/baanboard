<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smehmann</div><div class="date">30th August 2013, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">When I go into the Business Process Editor and add a session, save, and close, the session will disappear when I reopen the Business Process Editor. However I can see the new session in a User DEM. I can also see the session if I open the Business Process with the 'Display Business Process in User Mode'.<br />
<br />
Additionally there are other Business Processes that when they are opened with the Editor, we get a pop up error message that reads &quot;You are working with an old version of the DEM-server. This version is not fully compatible with this EME version and could cause data corruption when data is saved to the server!!! Please contact Infor for a latest version of the DEM-server!&quot;. These will also have the same issue with the disappearing session as described above.<br />
<br />
We contacted Infor and they said to try an older EME version. Tried them and no change. Any suggestions for any of this? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaotto</div><div class="date">24th October 2013, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">This would normally be caused by using old DEM objects that are out of sync with the EME version.<br />
<br />
I would suggest to make sure you are up to date on tgbrg objects.  If the old EME version did not resolve the issue you may have to go back farther in the EME version, or even use the latest depending on the Version of LN/Baan and patch level.</div></div><hr />
