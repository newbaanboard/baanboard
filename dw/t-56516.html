<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">10th August 2009, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a user that must use dems.  In one company,(300) she has access to several finance sessions.  That is her default company.  In 2 other companies, (100 and 200) she needs access to maintain currency rates but nothing else.  Is there a way to do this in Baan IV?  I've tried setting up different a different version from the one in her default company and attaching different dems to that version for companies 100 and 200.  I generate the user in both versions but whichever version I generate last is the dem the user sees.  For example if I generate company 300 last, the user logs into 300 by default and sees her finance dems.  If I change company to 200, she still sees the finance dems but can not access the sessions.</div></div><hr />

Apart from that, you can use User Authorisation to set the access the user should have in each company.</div></div><hr />

It's the same dem no matter which company you are in but the permissions do not allow you to access the sessions in one company.</div></div><hr />
