I found the archiving sessions in Baan are very poorly written, as we have had to modify most of them. It would appear that the development teams at Baan didn't communicate or coordinate with each other, as each module has a different approach on how to archive, and what to archive.</div></div><hr />

It would appear that experienced users probably had to write a project plan and work instructions for themselves.<br />
