<br />
The session (tipcs2260m000) seems to work fine except for the fact that it does not remove records from some key tables on the live company side.  For example, the project records remain in tipcs020 &amp; tipcs021.  All of the pertinent information is moved to the history company, it just doesn't delete all of the records from the live company.   Is there some other session that needs to be run in order to physically remove these projects from the live company so that we can reuse the first free numbers for these projects?<br />

<br />
You have done everything right!<br />
<br />
The tables tipcs020 &amp; 021 are not archived (deleted from your operational company).<br />
The Project code have to remain in the operational company because of references to other parts of Baan (and also if you want to retrive project data from the history company at a later stage). Customized items (pcs021) is not deleted because the data is reqired for rebuilding statistics in purchase and sales.<br />
<br />
Do you actually need the project numbers to reuse them? Isn't it possible to start a new serie? If you need the numbers, I do think you should contact Baan Global support for advices.<br />

Thanx for the post.  <br />
<br />
That is sort of what I thought.  Unfortunately, we are running out of first free numbers for all of our Project series.  We need to free up the Projects in order to reuse the first free numbers.  I have posted a question to Baan in order to see if there are any alternatives, however, we may need to customize this archive session in order to remove records from tipcs020, tipcs021 and some of the tipcf tables.  Luckily, we have no intention of ever bringing a closed Project into our operational company... we are moving this archived data into our data warehouse.<br />

You came across the same problem I had found with our company regarding small projects.  I assumed we were running out of project numbers as well, at least I thought were running out of project numbers.  I logged the issue with Baan Support, and the analyst told me that you can define alphanumeric series as well as numeric series for projects, such as A12345, B00001, C00001, etc.<br />
<br />
You have to set this up in the &quot;Maintain PCS Parameters&quot; as either a one or two digit series first before Baan will allow you to use a series.</div></div><hr />
