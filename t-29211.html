But In my opinion nazdag offers extra-addons for Baan. Especially on old versions. I think their products are reliable and they are known in this platform and Baan ERP world. But you can find alternative solutions for their some solutions.Before all search baanboard detailly. That's All I known.<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I rolled this out to my users about 2.5 years ago and they have been speaking my name in praise ever since.<br />
<br />
Nasdaq is responsive and polite, also, importantly, very nicely priced.<br />
<br />
You get a lot of &quot;Bang for the buck&quot; , so to speak.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
