<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th November 2006, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this topic has been discussed before, but I thought I would ask for any update anybody would like bring up - recommendations, solutions, etc. are welcome.  I won't even mind if vendors post links to their web sites.  I am just gathering options for the moment.  I actually believe we will get around to replacing our current barcode technology and may even have some actual RFID requirements.  We do some simple UID tracking for the moment, but it may also grow to include sub-assemblies.  So any information or recommendations would be appreciated.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">17th November 2006, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted earlier about our work with RFID.  Just to recap: We have incorporated writing to RFID tags into our existing bar code label printing software within Baan.  We have then created applications to run on fixed and handheld RFID readers to interface with Baan and our RMC3 middleware, respectively, to bring data back into Baan.  There should be some sort of press release coming in the next few weeks.</div></div><hr />

Gathered few articles, but I found that all are summarised quite well in RFID Journal FAQ: General RFID information page (http://www.rfidjournal.com/faq/16). You can Google for many RFID implementation stories out there<br />

based in the UK, they supply RF Gateway data capture solution for Baan (Baan4 and Baan5) which is in use at many sites in the Europe and the USA.  The software is RFID-ready, just waiting for the hardware technology to catch up!</div></div><hr />
