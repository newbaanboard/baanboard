<br />
I want to use AFS to perform the following operation.<br />
<br />
Copy a record in the User data and change the primary key to some other value and then save it.<br />
<br />
I am using the following code<br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;, &quot;ttaad200.user&quot;,similar.id)<br />
stpapi.find(&quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;)<br />
stpapi.application.option(&quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;, 1, 0, error.msg)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;, &quot;ttaad200.user&quot;,form.id)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;, &quot;ttaad200.name&quot;,form.name)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;, &quot;ttaad200.uusr&quot;,form.uid)<br />
stpapi.update(&quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;,1, error.msg)<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;)<br />
<br />
Where similar.user record is supposed to be searched and then a copy has to be performed and then the new values are put and saved.<br />
<br />
I have used stpapi.application.option(&quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;, 1, 0, error.msg)<br />
to access the copy command in the form 1.<br />
<br />
But i cannot get the desired result. the result in the above case is that the existing record is updated.<br />
<br />
I have also tried using stpapi.insert in place of update but it inserts record with blank fields.<br />
<br />
Anybody with some insight<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Shinoj</div></div><hr />

If you are just copying a record then just find the record, do some stpapi.get fields to get all the data, then stpapi.put to put all the fields.  As far as I know there is not a stpapi command to do a copy of a record.  The stpapi.application is for only those commands on the application menu.<br />
<br />
Typically if I am doing something like this I just do select/update directly against the table.  Not sure if there is more to this table to than that, but I would try that first. Then you could run ttaad4200m000 and just do a convert to runtime.</div></div><hr />

There are too many fields for the record. So putting all the fields is inconvenient. Thats why i was searching for the copy option.<br />

If i am updating the user data table directly i had found that convert to run time for the user doesnt happen as the conversion to run-time flag doesnt get set.<br />
<br />
Maybe i could copy the record completely and then insert into the new one by using db.record.to.column etc,although i am not sure how to implement it<br />
but this option i would keep if i am not able to implement it by AFS.<br />
<br />
Do you think it would be possible to implement it by AFS?</div></div><hr />

I wonder if using of option number &quot;-32&quot; helps you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th December 2009, 02:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Try what goooch recommended - never hurts.  Also if it was a regular baan session there would be other options.  As for copying at the table level use the record buffer - here is a sample from one of my programs:<br />
<br />
	string		record.buf(1)	based<br />
<br />
			rcd.ttpppc231 = record.buf<br />
			db.set.to.default(ttpppc231)<br />
			rcd.ttpppc231 = record.buf<br />
			tpppc231.cprj = tppro603.nprj<br />
			tpppc231.sern = get.next.tpppc231.sern(tppro603.nprj)<br />
			tpppc231.cspa = tppro603.csp1<br />
			tpppc231.quan = total.quan * somemultiplier	| Quantity<br />
			tpppc231.amoc = total.amoc * somemultiplier	| Total Amount<br />
			tpppc231.amos = total.amos * somemultiplier	| Total Sales<br />
			tpppc231.loco = somelogin<br />
			tpppc231.desc = somelogin<br />
			db.insert(ttpppc231,db.retry)<br />
			commit.transaction()<br />
<br />
This is just a snippet of code and the 	rcd.ttpppc231 = record.buf is actually in a different subroutine, which calls the other subroutine to insert records. I only set those fields that I need to change to insert a new record.</div></div><hr />
