It was posted in the thread: Photo Display on Form (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5825) , by '~Vamsi'. I have just turned it into an easy to use include....<br />
<br />
Simply call it by;<br />
igen0100.display.photo.default(&lt;full path and filename to GIF file&gt;)<br />
<br />
Don't forget to destroy the objects with;<br />
igen0100.clear.photo.display()<br />
either in the choice.end.program and choice.abort.program, or when you need the picture cleared..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Used this function, and seems to work well. Have got one problem though:<br />
<br />
Say I use this in a display session, where the session opens let's say on nearly full screen. In the init.form (tried also before.form) I call the function to display a gif in the top-right corner. This works ok. Then I resize the window (just with the mouse) and make it smaller. The gif's location will not be adjusted accordingly (i.e. recalculate the proportions from the window edges), and as a result the whole window looks clumsy with this gif stuck out there on an unsuitable location. Basically it will be impossible to decrease the window-width smaller than the original size, because this gif stays stuck on the original (width) location.<br />
<br />
Encountered this? Have a solution for it? Would be great, because the way it is now, I cannot apply it.<br />

<br />
Have a look at the function  change.sub.object (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_user_interface_objects_create_sub_object).  You could call this to move and/or resize the picture in the choice.resize.frm section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 06:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if the solution by NvanBeest will work (redrawing the sub-object, when the main object is not large enough, won't work)... It may automatically resize the main object, so will be worth trying. But the best solution, is as he suggested, in the choice.resize.frm<br />
<br />
What you should do, is call;<br />
igen0100.clear.photo.display<br />
<br />
Then call the;<br />
igen0100.display.photo.in.location<br />
function, to recreate the photo, with the new x,y co-ordinates and photo height/width. You may need to determine the x.y co-ordinates yourself in this case.<br />
<br />
Thus, when the user resizes the form, it clears and redraws the image.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">23rd September 2003, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Ruskin,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice. I had already tried the way you described, but received bw-errors. Thought it was as a result. After debugging, I saw that in the function clear.photo.display(), there is a destroy on object.mimg which caused the errors, for there was never an update.object on object.mimg...<br />
<br />
I now use a clear.photo.display() and display.photo.in.location() in the choice.resize.frm after.choice section (and in case of multiple forms -&gt; tabs, it is necessary to re-display also on each before.form), and now it works perfectly.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">23rd September 2003, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">En,<br />
<br />
Could you please post the code with the updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">23rd September 2003, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I made only few little changes.<br />
<br />
Here it goes:<br />
In function init.photo.settings:<br />
function igen0100.init.photo.settings()<br />
{<br />
	long	int.value(MWINMAXSIZE)<br />
<br />
|	if not igen0100.init        or<br />
|	   igen0100.form.width = 0  or<br />
|	   igen0100.form.height = 0 then<br />
|		igen0100.init = true<br />
		igen0100.object.main = current.mwindow()<br />
		get.mwindow.attrs(int.value)<br />
		igen0100.form.width  = int.value(11)<br />
		igen0100.form.height = int.value(12)<br />
|	endif<br />
}<br />
I pipe-lined the conditions, because I want the window attributes to be re-read every time the function is called [in order to get the right location when resizing a form].<br />
<br />
In function clear.photo.display() <br />
function igen0100.clear.photo.display()<br />
{<br />
	destroy.object(igen0100.object.mpix)<br />
	destroy.object(igen0100.object.midc)<br />
	destroy.object(igen0100.object.midp)<br />
|	destroy.object(igen0100.object.mimg)<br />
	update.object(igen0100.object.main)<br />
}<br />
I pipe-lined the destroy.object(igen0100.object.mimg), because there is never an update.object on mimg; therefor it results in a bw-error 'Object %d not found'.<br />
<br />
For the rest I only changed some of the default sizing and positioning, but this is depending on each one's personal preferences. I for instance do not understand why the minimum height+width sizes have to be 100 (any reason Ruskin??), so I pipe-lined this piece:<br />
|	if igen0100.hght &lt; 100 then<br />
|		igen0100.hght = 100<br />
|	endif<br />
|	if igen0100.wdth &lt; 100 then<br />
|		igen0100.wdth = 100<br />
|	endif<br />
<br />
I finally changed the default locations in the default.x/y.position() functions to be displayed default in the far top right corner. So for default x pos I have:<br />
return(igen0100.form.width - igen0100.wdth)<br />
and for y pos:<br />
return(20).<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry I haven't responded earlier, haven't been to the site for a few days.<br />
<br />
You are quite correct, the sub object does not need a 'destroy.object' function for it. Thanks for pointing that out... Also, I found I got some BW errors when destroying the object multiple times, so amended the clear function as follows;<br />
<br />
function igen0100.clear.photo.display()<br />
{<br />
	if igen0100.object.mpix then<br />
		destroy.object(igen0100.object.mpix)<br />
		igen0100.object.mpix = 0<br />
	endif<br />
	if igen0100.object.midc then<br />
		destroy.object(igen0100.object.midc)<br />
		igen0100.object.midc = 0<br />
	endif<br />
	if igen0100.object.midp then<br />
		destroy.object(igen0100.object.midp)<br />
		igen0100.object.midp = 0<br />
	endif<br />
|	destroy.object(igen0100.object.mimg)<br />
	if igen0100.object.main then<br />
		update.object(igen0100.object.main)<br />
	endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
The only reason I made the minimum height and width at 100, was for our photos. At that size they fit on our form perfectly and aren't dis-proportional. It's entirely up to you, whether you use that minimum size or create your own...<br />
<br />
kind regards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">25th September 2003, 10:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Ruskin!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have used Ruskin's function for the past couple of years for displaying of logo's on some customized sessions. I was now working on a good efficient item file as a display session in Baan. One of the requirements, was including images of the item, up-to 5 images per item.<br />
<br />
I wanted to use my existing function (Ruskin's), but saw that the function can actually only handle display of one image per form. I therefor improved the function to be able to handle display of up-to 5 images each time.<br />
<br />
There is an optional argument in the function call, which passes the image number. I have done it in the way of an optional argument, so that I will not have to change all the program scripts which call the function till now... If the optional argument is not filled, then the image number will be defaulted to 1 (for display of one image only).<br />
<br />
Attached is the code...<br />
<br />
If anyone has further suggestions and/or remarks, I'm always here to listen...<br />

<br />
I ve used the script that was provided in this thread and used it in a form to display a gif image on the form.<br />
But when i actually ran the form it showed file not found message on the form.<br />
I debugged it and found that in the following code, r.return equals to false.<br />
In the stat.info function r.mode value is false so r.return doesnt gets assigned to value true so the message gets displayed on the form.<br />
<br />
ret.info = stat.info(	igen0100.phto,	r.size,<br />
				r.mode,		r.inode,<br />
				r.dev,		r.uid,<br />
				r.gid,		r.nlink,<br />
				r.ctime,	r.mtime,<br />
				r.atime	)<br />
<br />
	r.return = false<br />
	if ( S_ISDIR(r.mode) ) then<br />
		|* DIRECTORY SPECIFIED !!!!<br />
	else<br />
		if ret.info then<br />
			|* FILE OR DIRECTORY IS INVALID !!!!<br />
		else<br />
			|File exists<br />
			r.return = true<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
What could be the problem? i have specified the correct path and i tried putting it on server as well as client machine but the problem still exist.<br />
please help.<br />

<br />
I am displaying gif-files on Baan forms, but unfortunately the quality of the images is reduced/decreased. I.e. the actual gif, when opening in any editor or windows-application (Word, Excel, etc) has a much sharper and better quality than when displaying on a Baan form. <br />
<br />
Have others encountered this too? Does anyone know why this is? And does anyone have a solution to this issue??<br />
<br />
And last but not least: has anyone anno 2007 found a solution for displaying jpg-format on the baan forms rather than being limited to gif only...???<br />

Just to let you know that I have found the reason for the bad quality of the images. The rgb values were (128,128,128) which gives nearly every second pixel as black/grey worthless quality. After fixing this and matching the rgb-values to be exactly the same as the screen-colour the images are displayed on, it works like a charm..<br />
