<br />
Is there anyone out there who has used AFS/api on version 4b and 4a before?<br />
What do I need to do or install if I want to use AFS in these two versions?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your reply and thank you.<br />

<br />
See this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=22829) for requirements.<br />
<br />
General advise: Make sure your standard program is up to date and where possible get the latest and greatest version of the sessions you are interfacing. Some of the original IVb (and before) scripts do not have API functionality built in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">17th June 2005, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The wrapper programs (QKey, RMCgen and rush on these boards) would also work for your needs in 4a and 4b, no patching required.  QKey and RMCgen are 3rd party products.  My company puts out RMCgen so, take that as you may.  I can't speak for the others, but using RMCgen you can generate a library from the session, and you can call that library with parameters for the screen inputs.  <br />
<br />
In earlier Baan versions where afs is not supported or feasible to patch to, the wrapper programs are a good substitute because they use the old load_dll functions that were working all the way back to Triton.</div></div><hr />
