<br />
I have installed the baan CRM server and want to install the CRM Client. While doing so the installation procedure asks me for user name, system ID and authority key.<br />
<br />
I wanted to know what is this and from where to get it. If I have to create users and assign ID's to them then how do i do it.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmermans</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, if you are a current Baan customer you can contact support at crm.support@baan.com or at the USA toll free number 800-678-3448. <br />
<br />
Also, this should be covered by the standard documentation. <br />
Anyway, username, system id and authkey are unique values given to each user. Each organization sets this up . These values are used to create unique rows when you add rows in the detached database. When attached we use the system id to create unique rows. The empcode and the system id must be unique.  These values are also used during dbsync to see if the employee is valid to get rows from the server.<br />
If you create a empcode/systemid/authkey as djones/123/123st  for a user Dave Jones while installing  then these values  should be entered on the server database thru the admin screens -Employee and System Users  . In order that this user gets the data he should also be put in a sales territory.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Again you can contact support if you are a current Baan customer and need more help.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
