   We're evaluating different Remote Data Collection avenues for our B5c installation. We're not sure yet which to take. Do you have an article with yourself regarding the differences? Or do you know where I can find such article? Thank you very much<br />

<br />
Do they mean Web Integration?   Handheld / DDC Data Collection?  Mobile Phone Integration?<br />
<br />
Not sure what path you need.  The DDC solutions have been discussed on this forum - we have one, as do others.  These can now hook up to any number of devices (mobile phones, Palm Handhelds, etc), Intermec type Shop Floor handhelds and clocking stations are the most popular.<br />
<br />
For Web Integration, Baan V has Webtop, and you can view the sessions on the web.   Triffit is also available for Baan V, that provides a Web interface....</div></div><hr />

   Thank you, Gordon, for posting my request here. Thanks as well for lbencic for prompt reply. Sorry for not being particularly detailed about the requirements.<br />
<br />
   We're thinking of connecting our warehouses and shop floor to BaanERP. Considering how not as well educated the warehouses and shop floor personnel in this country, we need something really simple. And considering the country current economic condition, the customer also needs an economical solution.<br />
<br />
   I just started browsing this forum and it's been quite helpful. From the bits and pieces that I've found, we think we're going to take this avenue:<br />
- We're going to custom make data collection program that looks very simple and access them through thin client terminals in WH and shop floor.<br />
- We're gonna attach the keyboard emulating barcode scanners to the thin clients<br />
- We're gonna read the data from the RDC system using sessions programmed through Baan API<br />
<br />
   In your opinion, would this be OK or there are other alternatives that can better fulfill the above requirements. Thank you very much<br />
