<br />
Is is possible to transfer goods between 2 logistic companies without using purchase orders is one company and sales orders in the other?<br />
<br />
We have 2 plants, and move material between each, and the only way I know how to do this is via a purchase order and sales order. There must be some way to make a transfer between the 2 logistic companies!</div></div><hr />

<br />
A solution like that might solve your problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">15th March 2002, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">If you need to transfer goods from one company to another  there are a few ways to do it. If you transfer goods, and you do not want to use purchase-sale, it is mandatory in my opinion, that those items have same standard price in both companies' item master data. And also there is another question to study, financial integration and, stock's financial values of this goods.<br />
<br />
I mean, if item A in company 100 has price x<br />
                item A in company 120 has price y<br />
<br />
When you move 1 Unit of A from 100 to 120, what are you going to do with x-y difference?<br />
<br />
Also, there is another question: This transfer is a frequent movement or you want to move all stock from one company to the other?<br />
<br />
If x=y use Inventory adjustments. If x&lt;&gt;y, I think you must use purchase-sale, but I need more details about your data.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
