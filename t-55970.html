<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ravi99</div><div class="date">29th May 2009, 05:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to  use Inv. adj. AFS for transactions. Here I want to ignore 'User Authorizations for inventory transactions'. Basically even if a user does not authorization in 'Maintain User Authorizations for Inventory Transactions', still he should be able to use inventory adjustment AFS? How to ignore authorizations when we use AFS? <br />
<br />
I look for any suggestion/solutions.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th May 2009, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You can not ignore the authorizations.  In essence you are running the baan code in the background.  Not only do they need the permissions, but also permissions to the sessions in the background.  If you own source code you could add in an &quot;if not api.mode then&quot; statement, but I do not know every place this would be needed.  For us - if they could run the AFS session, then they should be able to run it manually.  <br />
<br />
Now what we could do, if we wanted, is to give them permissions to do adjustments(sessions and authorizations).  Then we could pull the Baan session off their DEM flows so they could not get to it manually.  At our site users do not have access to run program - they do get my version of run program.  My version of run program checks to make sure the session is on DEM flow in a role they have access to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th May 2009, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought of another way you could do it - let the users enter the data or attach a file to process.  Then when they click continue - it launches a batch job, which could then log on as another user.<br />
<br />
Or let the user update a table.  Have a batch job running all the time that checks the table, picks up the data and does the inventory adjustment.  Again the batch job user-id would have the permissions and not the user.</div></div><hr />
