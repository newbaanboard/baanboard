<br />
Setting up the archive company correctly is very important. First get the latest manual from Baan support and set-up the archive company exactly as per the document.  For setting up the parameters, you cannot maintain the parameters or change through GTM some of the parameters because of referential integrity. As the manual suggests you can try the bdbpost with the file provided by Baan. Alternatively, you can create sequential dump of the parameter tables from the live company and create table in the archive company(select ignore referential integrity in the session). <br />
<br />
I am doing archiving at the moment but in Baan IV. I am doing this for the <br />
first time and just follow the document. So far no trouble. I take sequential dumps of the relevant tables for each archiving session and keep them in my own directory. Use session ttaad4222m000 to count the number of records instead of counting through table maintenance. The session is lightning fast whereas the counting in ttaad4500 is snail slow. If someone knows the reason please explain. You can have a report before archiving and afterwards get reports for both the archiving and live company, add and compare. Since I do archiving after office hours it is easier. Before running any archiving session, check the latest solution for that session and install them. And finally the most important thing. Pray to God before clicking 'OK'. Once you have clicked 'OK', God is the only hope for not having any problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">5th October 2005, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Do your homework and understand your data structures.  Good planning makes the archiving process quite painless.  I've been archiving since the late 90s, so have done quite a few.<br />
<br />
Review table sharing and set up your logical tables correctly in the archive companies.  Some sharing that is perfectly legal in the 'standard' company may cause issues during archiving due to references and the order that things are archived (like shared customers but not shared delivery addresses).  The database authorizations must be set up correctly in the archive company if it is to be actively used as a read-only source.  Even though you might want to set all tables to read-only in the archive company, a few must be provided write access (line tdinv700 - inventory transaction history) since the 'print inventory transaction history' session will try to update the 'printed' status (unless you can modify the source to not do this).<br />
<br />
Produce a spreadsheet with sessions that you intend to run and what they archive (copy only) and delete (copy then delete from source).  For each, have the business representatives over those areas agree upon or come up with a retention period.  I normally recommend somthing rather short with teh expectation that they will extend it.<br />
<br />
This process will provide a pretty good roadmap for archiving success, and will uncover some gaps -- things that are not archived but should be.  I have developed sessions to archive and clear the cumulative issue at the item level on a yearly basis, for example.  An archive of the detailed sales info (tdsls040/tdsls041/tdsls042/tdsls045) can also be useful in the archive companies to provide an inquiry that users are familliar with instead of Baan's standard archive of history (tdsls050/tdsls051) data only.<br />
<br />
If you are using Baan IV, make sure that service packs are rather recent.  Some real nice changes made in sp11-14 replaced our previously custom changes to optionally skip the archive of base data for often archived tables.<br />
<br />
It isn't a difficult process when planned properly, and really produces benefits when the database is large.</div></div><hr />
