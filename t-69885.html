<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">23rd March 2017, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I created a workflow on PO..Based on Accounts department and Project Department the approval is given..<br />
<br />
now the workflow is working fine, But what i want is that based on the result of the Workflow the Status of the PO in the LN should be modified or it should be reflected..<br />
<br />
Where should i make changes? Which sessions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">24th March 2017, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ajesh, Did you start with one of the workflows delivered as standard LN content? If so which one. Did you use one that is fed by SyncPO BOD or by the ProcessWorkflow BOD?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">24th March 2017, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">No,Adriaan. I did not.. Its a customized one? Did i fall into the loop of limited support and knowhow for customizations again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">24th March 2017, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">In the workflow output parameters can be defined. Those will be send in a ProcessPO BOD to LN. That is a way to update LN based upon an action in ION.<br />
As part of the standard content LN delivers also Document Authorization workflows (see the related guide). In such a flow the PO is blocked during PO approval is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">24th March 2017, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">My Ouput parameter has Status in it. and in the WF the Status is being set to Approved/Open.. But nothing is happening in LN PO level..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">24th March 2017, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you see the ProcessPO being send to LN in the ION OneView screen?<br />
Did LN raise an error? ION error screen? What is the current status in LN for this PO?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">24th March 2017, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes there is a Process PO being sent to LN..<br />
<br />
No error is raised in LN.. In ION Error screen getting an error for Sync.Error CBM-644543:0 but i dont think it is relevant here..<br />
<br />
Current status for this PO is approved..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">24th March 2017, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">If current status in LN is already approved, what needs to happen in your opinion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">24th March 2017, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I had rejected the wf ..it should be pending for approval or open</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">25th March 2017, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I am guessing, i need to update the Object Types in the Object Configuration Management, otherwise how else the system is going to know, if it is to update back the LN table, and that too for a Customized WF..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">27th March 2017, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">the workflow status field in LN only works when Object Configuration Mmt module is used. In that case the communication with ION is done via the ProcessWorkflow BOD. You mentioned that you use SyncPO BOD. This combination will not work.<br />
Did you follow the steps to deploy a model in the ttocm module?<br />
Adding a new object in ttocm is not just modeling work. It requires application changes as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">29th March 2017, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">No Arijke..ProcessBOD is also created..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">29th March 2017, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably better to have someone from Infor Support to have a look at your system. <br />
I probably can't help you out without seeing your system. So please log an incident in Infor Xtreme.<br />
