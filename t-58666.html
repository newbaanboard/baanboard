<br />
Having my first go at using AFS in the transport module. We have a customised session that is based on trtoc1184s000. An option is to zoom to maintain other lines session trtoc0560s000. A display session that lists the other line types, of which we only have invoice lines available. I can get our customised session started and inserting lines, but when I call trtoc0560s000 my AFS dies with the following <br />
Fatal error : Illegal value for size argument (0) for sym 'baanapi_input_data'<br />
Fatal error : Can not continue in trtoc0560s000 in DLL : ottstpstandard(&lt;28&gt;)<br />
<br />
My problem seems to be as soon as I activate the display session vaiables are not set correctly. The code from the session looks like this :<br />
<br />
if background then<br />
                fast.return = false<br />
                import(&quot;from.cpro&quot;,from.cpro)<br />
                import(&quot;from.kipo&quot;,from.kipo)<br />
                import(&quot;cont.orno&quot;,cont.orno)<br />
                import(&quot;cont.refp&quot;,cont.refp)<br />
                import(&quot;cont.kipo&quot;,cont.kipo)<br />
                import(&quot;cont.cpro&quot;,cont.cpro)<br />
I have found unless I use the zoom.option command, the variable background is not set, so my import of variables never happens. And code further on needs the first two variables to be set.<br />
<br />
So I need to get from.kipo and from.cpro set using a put.field. However, if I use a put.field before my zoom, then I get the background variable not set problem. <br />
<br />
Anyone successfully called this session in AFS? I seem to be going around in circles.<br />
<br />
Or do I need to make changes to the Baan code for trtoc0560 (which I do have).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nick Cooley</div><div class="date">22nd June 2010, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm picking we are not. On Baan IVC4, service pack 8 so pretty old.<br />
We haven't upgraded to the heavy customisations we have, which meant a service pack upgrade was a major mission. But being on this SP has not caused us any problems to date, hence we havn't changed.<br />
<br />
Would the toolset/stpapi version make much difference to the problem we are experiencing?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd June 2010, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">It could very well be the issue.  Along the way to our current SP we had a couple that completely broke our API code.  In those cases we had to go and do a tools update, portingset updates, etc.  It varied from issue to issue on what we had to update.<br />
<br />
You can try changing the code to work around the issues, but no guarantee it will solve the problems.  So in that one sessions you could do:<br />
<br />
if api.mode then<br />
  import()<br />
  import()<br />
endif<br />
<br />
The code might work, but not sure the baanapi input error would go away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nick Cooley</div><div class="date">5th July 2010, 05:40</div></div><div class="posttext">So, after much frustration, I did the honourable thing - gave up. But not quite. Instead I added the session trtoc1184s000 as a new sub session to my customized session and got that working instead.<br />
<br />
Running code from AFS also didn't seem to like the use of 'break' in case statements, but only some of the time ... curious ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th July 2010, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting about the break in case statements.  Wish we owned source code so I could check things out on. I have run into the same type thing with subsessions - I can't remember the name of the session, but there was one I had to do the same thing on.  In was generate requirements type session. Would not run in the background, so I made it a zoom.to session to solve the problem.</div></div><hr />
