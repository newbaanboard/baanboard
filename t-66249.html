<br />
I have an AFS session which automates the Warehouse Receipt Process. The session calls The Receipts session - whinhf3520m000 and creates a new receipt. Then links the expected order lines to the receipt. I noticed that the stpapi.find which runs on whinh3820m000 and finds the record to be linked , fails in some cases. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
        stpapi.put.field(&quot;whinh3520m000&quot;, &quot;whinh210.rcno&quot;, receipt.number)		|AM.14042014.sn<br />
	stpapi.browse.set(&quot;whinh3520m000&quot;, error.mess)		<br />
	if not isspace(error.mess) then<br />
		message(error.mess)<br />
	endif		<br />
	stpapi.handle.subproc(&quot;whinh3520m000&quot;,&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;,&quot;add&quot;)		|AM.14042014.en	<br />
		<br />
	whinhf3820m000.put.Order_Origin(whgei210.oorg)<br />
	whinhf3820m000.put.Order(whgei210.orno)<br />
	whinhf3820m000.put.Position_Number(whgei210.pono)<br />
	whinhf3820m000.put.Sequence_Number(ord.seq)<br />
	ret = whinhf3820m000.find(error.mess)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The FIND returns 2- another record found-  in some cases. Whereas it works fine in others. The session does not have a view field , as such I don't understand as to why the script fails. <br />
<br />
The session had been working fine for a long time now. But suddenly started to have this issue.<br />
<br />
Kindly provide your insights. I have attached the AFS log files for 2 runs of the session as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

Were there any recent solution installations related to Warehouse Receipts? May be any changes to functionality. Verify if everything is same as it was earlier.<br />

Also, try using stpapi.change.view() if the session has view fields instead of stpapi.find()<br />

Thank you for your reply. The session does not have a view field as such change.view  may not be applicable I believe.</div></div><hr />

I am not familiar with the session, but the thread Bhushan linked in shows 5 fields for the find and you only show 4.  So if the find has 5 fields even if you do not use a field like oset - you should still possible put it.  I just do not know if you have to have that field.<br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;,&quot;whinh210.oorg&quot;,&quot;80&quot;)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;,&quot;whinh210.orno&quot;,&quot;100000135&quot;)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;,&quot;whinh210.oset&quot;,&quot;1&quot;)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;,&quot;whinh210.pono&quot;,&quot;10&quot;)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;,&quot;whinh210.seqn&quot;,&quot;1&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
And on of the threads it links to shows 5 fields also, but they put receipt number again - so you might want to try that.<br />
<br />
stpapi.handle.subproc(&quot;whinh3520m000&quot;,&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;,&quot;add&quot;)<br />
 stpapi.put.field(&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;, &quot;receipt.number&quot;, recnum)<br />

 stpapi.put.field(&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;, &quot;whinh210.orno&quot;, &quot;211000499&quot;)<br />

 stpapi.form.command(&quot;whinh3820m000&quot;, 5, &quot;exec.user.1&quot;,error)<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically when you hit the find button manually what ever fields show up in it are what you should put in the session to execute the find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you mark for the great find. <br />
When I open the session and do a find  the set no is not included in the find fields. I checked the indices on the session and the table. The table has an index with the set no , but the session does not seem to use it. <br />
I have attached screenshots of the same. <br />
<br />
Problem is I am not able to reproduce the issue on my test environment and as such I am not able to do a trial and error. Hope you understand the pickle am in!! :(</div></div><hr />

If someone has tried a similar solution and worked please do reply. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">1st May 2014, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
You can definitely give it a try. I am not familiar with your session so can't try anything.<br />
<br />
AFS requires a lot of trial and errors and even after you think you are done, you can get some unusual problems either due to some new scenarios introduced or may be any system changes. You just need to be a bit patient and you will do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st May 2014, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it tells me something is different between production and development.  Session, libraries, porting set or something.  I am just not sure how to determine which it is.  <br />
<br />
And yes - I can't remember which case it was that I had to do a find twice to make sure I got the correct record.  I have also had to do change view and a find to make sure I got the correct record.  Sometimes you just have to play with it like Bhushan mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The test environment all worked fine , the first find returns  2 then the next find returns 1.   But on Live , only on certain cases , both finds return 2 . <br />
<br />
The test and live only differ by the package combination . Rest all is the same in both . As such I don't see why any difference should be there.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any other suggestions ? Will change.view work in this situation? But the session does not have a view field.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th May 2014, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Never hurts to try change view.  My thing is if it works in test and not production - there is a difference somewhere between the two systems.  I just do not know how to identify where.</div></div><hr />
