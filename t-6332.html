Trying to connect to an other Baan system, which is somehow lower than SP8, works fine.<br />

Crystal also works fine, before we installed SP8!!!<br />

<br />
thanks for your answer.<br />
<br />
Can you help a little more? What is the Crystal porting set? <br />
Where can I find it? On Crystal Server or Client? Where there?<br />
<br />
Or do you mean the Baan Porting Set?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

this is what we did, we always select BaanERP 5.0c. We also tried the others, but we succeed with none!!<br />

We are on 5b. With one of the porting set upgrades we had to use 5c settings on Crystal. <br />
<br />
Perhaps you should log a case with Crystal :).</div></div><hr />

We have already logged a case with Baan and with Crystal. This is no more then two weeks ago, and still no solution. <br />

We have had the same issue and the contacts at BAAN and Crystal are of no significant help. I have a BAAN 5C server that is WIN NT Â– SQL 7 and at the SP8 level. I have patched the SQL myself to SP3. <br />
<br />
After installing the latest porting set, I have been able (with some other solutions as well), to get it working but the initial connection takes forever (1 hour). I believe the problem lies in the tools patches for SP8. In order to go back to the earlier porting set you can just rename your current bin directory and the backup one you created before the porting set install. I have gone as far as taken the BIN directory from an older install that is currently at SP6 and made it current on my server. This did relatively nothing.<br />
<br />
I am sure at this point that the SP8 tools patches are the issue. <br />
Baan support maintains that their crystal works on their SP8 server and also on the SP8 server with all the current weekly dumps.<br />
<br />
It would be good to keep this forum going on this and I believe that the only positive resource and solution for this issue may be right here. I have a test server that i can literally trash to fix this problem so, any ideas, email me and update this post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">10th September 2002, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi jezard,<br />
<br />
we tried the other way round: we installed SP9 (recommended by Baan) and a new porting set --&gt; without success. Last week Crystal gave the case back to a specialist from Baan. He just ask me all the questions crystal already asked before. <br />
Hope we can get him on site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jezard</div><div class="date">10th September 2002, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been working last evening with a BAAN Support SQL Server guy. We turned on the trace option and started a client Crystal to connect. And there were no results. I hope you try the same.<br />
<br />
In SQL Server Profiler, select a new trace and add the TSQL events. After, connect to the server with Crystal and wait. You should notice that there is no activity. However if you log into BAAN with a menu browser the trace reports a great deal of data. <br />
<br />
I uninstalled both the tt SP8 &amp; 7 patches from the service pack and tried again with no luck. Eventually, we get a connection and can add tables to a new report. During the connection, fs.exe is running on the server using about 8% of the CPU. There is no disk activity or relatively none. <br />
<br />
FS.exe is part of the porting set that starts up the database driver. My understanding is fs reads the Data Dictionary, then starts msql(db_drivername) service. BAAN support believes fs.exe in my case is looping. <br />
<br />
BAAN Support has been in contact with the principal porting set programmers from the Netherlands and I will be speaking with Crystal Decisions at 9am Central today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">10th September 2002, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">'till now we never traced. At the moment a Baan supporter from the NL tries to help us.<br />
<br />
Btw. you talked from a loop: I tried to connect crystal to Baan. Then LAN traffic increases, there are flowing MB's up and down, but nothing happens. I let this run for two hours, then I killed the task.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jezard</div><div class="date">10th September 2002, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, it is very chatty. There is a bunch of data going back and forth or it is a continuous request for the data. During this time the client PC will have Crystal Reports status as not responding.<br />
<br />
Right now I am connecting to the server and am waiting for the db driver to start. Perhaps when I can see the trace actually working there may be an indication as to the problem but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
I really would like to know what is happening during this whole time I wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jezard</div><div class="date">10th September 2002, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">FIXED!!!<br />
<br />
In the dir winnt on the client machine goto winnt\crystal\baan\config and open file p2sbaan.cfg<br />
<br />
backup the file<br />
<br />
change the last line to read:<br />
<br />
BDB_OPERATION_MODE=212<br />
<br />
this disables some character triton blah blah blah<br />
<br />
good luck!<br />
<br />
test, don't have to reboot etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">15th October 2002, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with that ! CR works now fine with it!!!!<br />
<br />
We have had also a problem with pushing reports. This was solved by Baan Support. They installed the &quot;Baan Solution Kit&quot; new, BUT WITH THAT THEY TAKE CARE ABOUT SOME PREFS, RELATED TO AUTHORISATIONS. I was not here, when they solved it. But I know only a new installation doesn't help, because I tried this before.<br />

<br />
I had the authoriziation problem in c4 with a customer of mine also. Its realted to the german Crystal version - The group &quot;Administrators&quot; is named &quot;Administratoren&quot; in the german version during default installation. (if I recall that correctly). The Crystal Driver has &quot;Administrators&quot; hardcoded, thats why it does't work until you change these settings by hand. Sorry, I don't recall any more details - Crystal is &quot;on ice&quot; here because, when it was sold, far more was promised as what actually can be done with it. <br />
<br />
