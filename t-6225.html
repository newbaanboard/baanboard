<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthony_wang</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Now we have problem in MultiFinannce/Single Logistics setup in BAAN IV c4 package.<br />
The actions we have taken:<br />
1. Create a group base company 600<br />
2. Create company 601<br />
3. Shared table tfgld003 (company group parameters) in maintain logical tables (ttaad4120m000) session. Logical company is 601, source table from 600<br />
<br />
But when i want to select group company code 600 from tfgld0103m000 (maintain company parameters) in company 601, there's no other choice than 601!!<br />
Then i tried to insert company code 601 in  session tfgld0104m000 (600 company),  error messages popuped again &quot;Invalid company code&quot;!!<br />
<br />
Would someone please help to solve the problem? And should i share some other tables in maintain logical table?<br />
<br />
Thanks!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can seek field level help on the multi company concept in the group company parameter session. it gives the list of tables to be shared in multi company scenario. but the list is not exhaustive and not totally compulsive too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthony_wang</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">venkat500: Great appreciate to your reply.<br />
So i think you have rich experence in multi-companies?:)<br />
Well, I have also shared tccom000, and also other tables in TF, TT, TC modules according to the manual.<br />
But when i relogin to company 601, i can't open session tfgld0103m000(maintain company parameters), and still can't insert 601 company code in tfgld0104m000.<br />
Error message &quot;company data can't be found&quot; was what i got.<br />
<br />
Would you please kindly advice again?<br />
Thanks a million!!:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
let me know further on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthony_wang</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">ye, i have excuted convert to run time and also relogin.<br />
then we got the problem.<br />
<br />
and 1 of my colleague happened to excuted tfgld9000m000 ~ tfgld9003m000 in company 601. seem to solved the problem....<br />
...but then we found even if we deleted a shared table record from &quot;maintain logical table&quot;, the table was still shared.<br />
dont know what's wrong...<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">venkat500</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope you must have once again run the convert to run time and logged out after removing the tables from the logical sharing.<br />
<br />
Also make sure that the table data you are looking at did not exist before sharing the said table.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, everything i runed the covert to runtime and relogin. And after removeing the sharing. if insert new record in any of the companies, the record will also present in the other company - just like the sharing still exist!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthony_wang</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i have solved the shared problem by sharing the whole tables in TC, TD, TI, TS... before create tables in new company.<br />
<br />
As of the removing links in logical tables. Actually my colleagues have shared the whole module of tcmcs and then shared all tables in the modules again. So only delete the shared table didn't work.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your kind help anyway!!</div></div><hr />
