I have been asked to put together a proposal for adding VB to our Baan Development toolkit.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

One person I talked to used VB for his front end into function servers on the Baan side.  This way his field people could logon to their web page, fill out orders and things like that and then send these to files on the Baan server.  The function servers would then process the data.  He did this so his field people never had to logon to Baan or know about Baan.  I do not know all of the specific details, but it did sound like he had some cool ideas.<br />
<br />
One of the ways that I use it is with Excel. Sometimes it is easier for me to create a macro in excel to something a user needs, rather than fight to get permission to change a Baan report.  I have only done this a couple of times. <br />
<br />
Just a couple of ideas on ways to use it.  You can see from other posts in this group how others are using it.<br />

<br />
A month back I start writing a program in VB and trying to call any BaaN sessions thru our VB application, by directly calling functon using BaaN DLL (not thru STPAPI) actualy my intention was how to save BaaN login's because if u r running any BaaN sessions and it takes long time to get it complete u can't execute any sessions or it takes time to execute any other session at the same time because it is executing on the same thread. <br />
<br />
I am trying to write in-process or out-of-process either thru ActiveX EXE or ActiveX DLL and trying to use same object name for the diff. threads, so this way from the same machine user can <br />
execute any no. of sessions with the same speed just using one BaaN login.<br />
<br />
In the mean time I am  preparing a docs containing list of functions available in each BaaN DLL's, so I can do anything as BaaN window interface is doing. least but not last a good interface can be developed with additional features instead of using BaaN DEM.<br />
<br />

Thanks<br />
