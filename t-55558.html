<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medtun</div><div class="date">7th April 2009, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you ralph for answering. Can you give me more information about BIRT ?<br />
On which release of Baan you used it ?<br />
Can it modify built in baan reports ?<br />
Is the modification of fields done visually or it needs coding ?<br />
Is it difficult to install ?<br />
Do you think it could work with LN FP3 ?<br />
<br />
I tried to contact Infor but did not obtained satisfying informations.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medtun</div><div class="date">8th April 2009, 12:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Well. This is the answer of Infor concerning BIRT :<br />
  	 - Can you give me more information about BIRT for LN ?<br />
<br />
  Check solution No 229031<br />
<br />
- On which release of Baan it can be used ?<br />
<br />
   Enterprise Server 8.4.1, but I suggest ti aooky the latest version (SOL No 213717).<br />
<br />
- Can it modify built in baan reports ?<br />
<br />
   Yes, you can.<br />
<br />
- Is the modification of fields done visually or it needs coding ?<br />
<br />
   No, you only need to enable the report to print via Web. The procedure is very simple, but you need to make sure you have all the proper portingset, Webtop, Report Viewer versinos.<br />
<br />
- Is it difficult to install ?<br />
<br />
   One thing is to activate a BIRT in Baan, and other issue is to develop. So, to be able to activate it, you only need a proper ES (SOL No 213717), portingset  (SOL No 148218) and Webtop version (SOL No 142977). The procedure to activate a report to print in BIRT is pretty much easy.     And the other hand, if you want to develop you need Eclipse, Java Connectior (JDBC) etc.<br />
<br />
- what are the requirements to install it ?<br />
<br />
  To create graphs/reports, Infor Reporting Studio 8.4 has to be used, which is based on BIRT Report Designer 2.1.2.</div></div><hr />
