<br />
In Baan IV (with transport package), when manuelly creating a sales order line, it is possible to calculate the receipt date by typing &quot;ctrl shift R&quot; in the receipt date field. <br />
Now, I want to create my order line with AFS. <br />
I don't know my receipt date and I want Baan calculates it.<br />
How can I do this?<br />
Which AFS command can do the &quot;ctrl shift R&quot; action?<br />
<br />
Any idea?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
I shall check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chardy</div><div class="date">30th January 2006, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no specific option in the form.<br />
But there is something in the field definition.<br />
<br />
Now, how can I &quot;put&quot; the value in api mode?<br />
<br />
In the script, the data is retrieve in the in.ret variable which is useable in on.input event, not in check.input, when.field.changes,...<br />
<br />
Is the stpapi.put.field can be used?</div></div><hr />

I think this is what is documented in the Developer's Guide for AFS - under 'Hidden Functionality' <br />
<br />
&quot;The AFS cannot reach functionality that is only accessible through zooming on a field level.....&quot;</div></div><hr />

What a very bad news.<br />
This means that I need to calculate my date before to send it to the session.<br />
I need to do the same thing that the session do.<br />
Lukely, I have the source code. <br />
This is wasted time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">31st January 2006, 00:10</div></div><div class="posttext">With source code other options are available.  To do something like this I created my version to specifically call a subsession to do what I wanted.  I do not own source, but this was a work around.  Since you have source you could always create a button to execute this code and put that on the form.  I am sure there are other possibilities but those were the first two to jump into my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chardy</div><div class="date">31st January 2006, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not want customize the form to add a new function.<br />
Well, I shall take the source code corresponding to ctl-shift-R action (it is in a include function) and put it in my own session. I did not want to calculate the date, but I think there is no other way.</div></div><hr />
