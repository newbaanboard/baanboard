<br />
Sometimes this conversion is not what you want it to be (in current portingset 6.1c.06.04 when using matrix printers from Mannesmann, is solved in 6.1c.06.05).<br />
<br />
You can compare the output file with the ${BSE}/lib/printinf/?/* file to see what code is inserted where. What printerdriver is actually used, can be seen in the argument list.<br />
<br />
Use this alternative script to save the input/output files and the argument line used to call filter6.1:#!/bin/ksh<br />
# script filter6.1 to catch the argument list,<br />
# inputfile and outputfile from the filter6.1 binary.<br />
# usage:<br />
# $ mv ${BSE}/bin/filter6.1 ${BSE}/bin/filter6.1.org<br />
# $ vi ${BSE}/bin/filter6.1 &lt; copy this textfile<br />
# $ chmod 755 ${BSE}/bin/filter6.1<br />
#<br />
# results:<br />
# - for every run a line is written to ${BSE_TMP}/argfile.filter<br />
#   with runnumber and argument line used<br />
# - for every run a file is written to ${BSE_TMP}/input###.filter<br />
#   containing the input file used (printer independent format)<br />
# - for every run a file is written to ${BSE_TMP}/output###.filter<br />
#   containing the generated output file (printer dependent format)<br />
# where the runnumber is used in the filenames (instead of ###)<br />
#<br />
# DO NOT FORGET to<br />
# $ cp -p ${BSE}/bin/filter6.1.org ${BSE}/bin/filter6.1<br />
# $ rm ${BSE_TMP}/*filter<br />
# when done testing.<br />
<br />
# get last runnum<br />
runnum=`basename \`ls ${BSE_TMP}/output???.filter | tail -1\` | cut -c7-9`<br />
# Format number with preceding zero's (illegal becomes 000)<br />
runnum=`printf &quot;%03d&quot; ${runnum}`<br />
# Raise runname with one<br />
let runnum=runnum+1<br />
# Format number with preceding zero's<br />
runnum=`printf &quot;%03d&quot; ${runnum}`<br />
echo ${runnum}: $* &gt;&gt; ${BSE_TMP}/argfile.filter<br />
cp -p ${10} ${BSE_TMP}/input${runnum}.filter<br />
filter6.1.org $*<br />
cp -p ${12} ${BSE_TMP}/output${runnum}.filter<br />
Happy testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">12th March 2004, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to add additional data (files) to the spool file (additional shipment papers to a picking list). This is easy by adding spool.buf() calls at the end of the report.<br />
<br />
There is only one problem: The spool file contains `printer independent´ stuff -- my additional files are already `printer formatted (pcl)´. And I see errors in log.filter6.1 like &quot; skipped bad escape code: &lt;ESC&gt;-{37}&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I would like to know about the &quot;ESC CTRL-U #&quot;, &quot;ESC CTRL-U !&quot;, &quot;ESC CTRL-T !&quot; sequences. Is there any documentation available?</div></div><hr />
