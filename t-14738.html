I buildt a query &quot;select tisfc011.*, tisfc001.* from tisfc011, tisfc001 where tisfc011.pdno refers to tisfc001&quot;. After the fetch I get each field separately by doing the ParseExecFunction. My question: Is it possible to get the entire set, as string or array, to speed it up? How is the function call in this case?</div></div><hr />

You could always write a Baan DLL to put your data into a file.  Then pull or put the file on the client, that may be faster.  I know on the one that I did it was painfully slow on getting the data.  I usually started it then went and did something else.<br />
