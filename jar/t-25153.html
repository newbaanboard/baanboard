I am reposting this position for two reasons:<br />
1) In my first post for a Distribution Consultant (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=25107), I had written &quot;Service Consultant&quot; message body. My apologies for the confusion.<br />
2) This role has been expanded to include both Distribution and Manufacturing expertise.</div></div><hr />
