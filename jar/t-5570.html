<br />
I am not enquiring about the position for myself but rather curious about your posting details. The amount you mentioned is that the going rate for the advertised job? :eek: It's been a while  since I was involved in hunting down a contract for myself (touch wood) so I am a bit out of touch with current standings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">20th June 2002, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">A daily rate of GBP 120 (= USD 180) is merely USD 22.50 per hour based on a 8 hour workday.<br />
That is very disturbing. Are there so many b50_c application consultants without work in Europe?<br />
<br />
Please explain the situation.<br />
<br />

<br />
I am sorry to have caused such an uproar and offence with this posting.<br />
<br />
The rate offered for this vacancy is below the European market average as I am sure you are all saying to yourselves, and I agree... I don't think this is necessarily a reflection of how many consultants are out of work - just an isolated issue.<br />
<br />
However, this client has given me a genuine requirement for consultants and although I might not agree with the budget, it is also my job to find some candidates who might be interested.<br />
<br />
We are not forcibly asking candidates to lower their rates, but simply posting a vacancy that might be attractive to someone out there (i.e. a consultant living close to the project; a junior consultant who wants to gain more experience etc...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is fine with me if a customer wants to do this but what do they expect to receive for a rate like this?<br />
As normal in life they will get what they deserve and putting their implementation and business at risk by bringing in low skilled consultants is something nobody is waiting for.<br />
In the end the blame will go to the BAAN software because it does not meet expectations. However, due to lack of knowledge of the consultants they will find themselves in a deep hole one year from now.<br />
I have seen this thing happening time and time again.<br />
<br />
Hopefully in 1.5 years from now when they have learnt their lessons and have to re-implement the rates will be normal again.<br />
<br />
I wish your customer good luck and they should do what they think is best.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edwin</div></div><hr />

No need to apologize as I can understand the predicament you are in as well. As always every baanboard reader is free to take up on your offer or not. My main reason for replying was sheer curiosity.</div></div><hr />
