<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abennett</div><div class="date">2nd October 2002, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for a business analyst with 3 years working knowledge of Baan IVc to help support a recent implementation in the UK.<br />
<br />
The role is full time and requires skills in Manufacturing/Distribution/EDI, any tools skills would be a plus - however I am not looking for a Tools person. The role is one of business support and process mapping. An ideal candidate will be somebody who has been a super user in a previous implementation and then gone onto support the business for a number of years.<br />
<br />
The role is only open to those persons who are eligible to work in the UK and the position is based in the North East.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">11th October 2002, 12:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a Baan consultant with over 4 years experience in almost all modules of Baan. I have conducted several implementations and optimisations in several industries although the majority of my experience came whilst working for a midlands based manufacturing company where I was involved in all projects related to Baan.<br />
<br />
I have recently been made redundant from one of the UK's major Baan consultantancies and would be willing to relocate should a suitable role become available. This job appears to be very suited to my skills. <br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks <br />
<br />
