 be yourself<br />
  don't overrate your skills or go into topics where the interviewer could run you into problems<br />
 show that you are flexible in working<br />
I am sure there are people out there that can give you much better qualified advice though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">prepare your self for a behavorial interview.  These days having the technical/functional knowledge is not enough - they want to know how you react to differenent scenerios.  Realy prepare for this - do a search on the web for the common questions.<br />
<br />
Do not oversate youre skills - be honest - but be positive in everthing you say.  If you do not have a great amount of knowledge in a cetain area, put a postive spin on it - say that you have some knowledge but were not given an opportunity to use the knowledge as the project was cancelled.<br />
<br />
Do not give the impresssion all you care about is $$$.<br />
Give a range that is on the low end and satisy's you on the high end.  If you do get an offer that is lower than expected then ask for a salary review after 6months so you can prove youself.</div></div><hr />
