LN and Baan Functional consultants for U.S. and worldwide expansion<br />
<br />
Performa Apps is seeking to hire contractors and permanent positions for LN functional consultants, both LN logistics and LN Finance. The ideal candidate will have at least 5 years of experience with LN as a consultant, LN user or Baan user. A long history with Baan 4 and 5 can substitute for some LN experience. We can also speak with LN techno-functional consultants that have experience with Infor ION, Ming.le, Infor Barcoding, etc. Experience with other ERP systems, such as Microsoft Dynamics AX or SAP, is a plus. Ideally candidates will be U.S. citizens, Green Card holders or have an H1B visa. Although there will be some remote work, expect travel to be 80-90% Monday-Thursday.
