<br />
I am interested in learning more about the position you have posted here.  From the sounds of it, it is very much like my previous position.  As a Project Executive one of my recent projects was deploying a major global strategic initiative implementing Baan (in over 100 business units) in conjunction with several other key initiatives (consolidated financial services, IT outsourcing, lean implementation...).  This project required a program office to command and control the initiatives of which I was a member executive.  <br />
<br />
One element that may be of particular interest to you:  this said project was being executed by Invensys, PLC.  (the owners of Baan)<br />
<br />
If this has peaked your interest I would be more than happy to have further conversations with you.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
