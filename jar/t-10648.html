<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan_James_Baan</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Allow me to introduce myself.  My name is James Coen, and I am a Baan Systems Administrator.  I began my career in IT over seven years ago with the Boeing Company doing Baan administration in an HP/UX and Sequent PTX environments.  For the last four years I have worked as a consultant doing Baan system administration and tools development, project management, and data warehouse design and implementation.  I have worked on various versions of Unix as well as NT, and have worked as a DBA in Oracle and SQL Server.  Additionally, I have extensive experience with the iBaan eProcurement product, and am recognized as a cutting edge leader with the iBaan Decision Manager product.<br />
I have experience with Triton, Baan 4, and Baan 5 with the following modules (Finance, Manufacturing, Distribution, and Service).  In addition, I have a high degree of expertise in Exchange and Tools development.<br />
I believe you will find my experience in the Unix realm as well as my time as an NT and SQL server administrator, along with my vast experience with Baan only serve to add to my skills as a project manager, and key technical team member.  Also my background in Business Intelligence along with my advanced degree makes me a valuable asset for future business development and growth.<br />
Attached is my resume, feel free to contact me at anytime at (512)787-6130 or by email at baan.james.baan@thecoens.net.</div></div><hr />
