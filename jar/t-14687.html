In Malaysia, some job ads would even require that an applicant should be Bumiputra (literally, owner of the land or native Malaysians) as opposed to non-Bumiputra. Although both are citizens.<br />
<br />
There is preferential treatment for Bumis (short for Bumiputras) and the society believes in citizen ranking system. For example, Bumis can have more favorable interest rates when taking loan from a bank.</div></div><hr />
