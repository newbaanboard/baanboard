I am needing a strong functional resource who is strong in BAAN archiving .<br />
The client is looking to archive in their  5.0c environment, and I need somebody to lead the requirements gathering and setup.   Ultimately, they want to purge as much data as possible, and only archive the business critical data. This is a 4-6 month project<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you are qualified to do this or if you know of anyone who is<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanguy2</div><div class="date">29th July 2005, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I have done three baan archiving projects and it can take from 4 weeks to six months depending on the company setup.<br />
(I did one in Baan Baan V and it was 30 companies and multi-site and multi countries, it took 5 months, and other one I did on Baan IV which took 4 months, and other one took 4 weeks).<br />
<br />
Anyways, where in US this project is ?<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">29th July 2005, 23:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on how you define the &quot;project&quot;. I'm looking at the consulting part. In an archive project I don't include the actual execution of the sessions in the live company. Scheduling the sessions, pressing the continue button and twirling their thumbs until the session ends is not something a company usually wants to pay a consultant for. That is ongoing work, usually executed by the internal IT department and is indeed never finished.<br />
<br />
Preparation for archiving (the only part that a consultant is usually needed for) can be done by an experienced consultant in an average of 2 weeks. In unusually complicated circumstances maybe 4 - 6 weeks (mainly if there is a lot of &quot;junk&quot; data on a system). After that the company should feel comfortable with handling archiving themselves and the consultant should only be needed for occassional remote support.<br />
<br />
With the right tools and method it doesn't matter much if it's a multi or single site environment nor does it matter if there are multiple countries involved or how much data or customizations there are on a system. <br />
<br />
I've done archiving projects in single logistic companies as well as multi logistic setups with up to about 10 logistic companies and it still just took me two weeks. I have to say though that I have fully automated the data assessment and archive planning part and have most of the usually requested add-on archive sessions already developed and available.</div></div><hr />
