<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">3rd November 2004, 06:13</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a short term MRP audit project (less than 1 month)   <br />
<br />
I am an ex-Baan logistics consultant who is now a materials manager. I set up our Baan MRP system a few years back (Baan5c), and I am looking for someone to come in for a couple weeks to do an entire MRP/MPS audit of our processes. I don't have time to do this on my own and I know we are not using MRP functionality to its fullest potential. Basically this person would come in, work with me and our key users for a couple days to understand our environment and peices of the MRP system we are using, then put together a white paper on reccomendations. The goal is to streamline the MRP system to make it as automated and robust as possible. <br />
<br />
Since I have a lot of Baan MRP experience myself, Im looking for a very senior level planning expert with a lot of hands on Baan MRP experience. CPIM certification and hands on materials management / operations / MRP experience are a plus. <br />
<br />
We have a very tight budget and this project cannot go longer than 2 weeks. The company is located in Southern California.</div></div><hr />
