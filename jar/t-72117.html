Implementation Consultants – Finance and Logistics<br />
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Infor ERP LN, Baan.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
If you have exposure to both Infor ERP LN/Baan and Microsoft Dynamics NAV/365 Business Central as a Consultant or Super Key User, in either Finance or Logistics, then I’d like to talk to you!<br />
 <br />
 <br />
We have many existing customers that use Infor, both Baan and ERP LN and are also working with a significant pipeline of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central opportunities. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Our fiercely independent Infor ERP LN/Baan practice, established in 2005, continues to be the UK’s largest independent practice providing day-to-day support to Baan Users and trusted advice to implementations around the World.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
We are trusted by over 300+ SME Customers in the UK to provide IT Managed Support Services and many of them are ready for the move to using ERP – the choice often being Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.</div></div><hr />
