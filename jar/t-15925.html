The good news is that the positions are still open and my client is continuing to interview.  The bad news is that I failed to indicate that my client is unable to provide visa sponsorship and that to be considered for one of the positions, candidates must be in the Americas. <br />
<br />
I've tried to reply to each candidate who could not be considered for the above reasons and am continuing to talk with others of you who may be a good fit.<br />
<br />
Thanks again and good hunting.</div></div><hr />
