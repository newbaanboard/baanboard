<br />
Looking for experienced ERP LN Finance Consultant to join one of the implementation projects in Middle East.  <br />
<br />
The role is for a Finance consultant to join an ongoing implementation project. Given the location weekly travel home is extremely unlikely so the consultants must be willing and able to stay away from home for weeks/months on end. This is a 1-2 year opportunity. Excellent communication skills and English language skills are key <br />
The customer is expecting consultants to join the project and follow the roadmap i.e. a standard implementation. This is to help the users familiarise themselves with the tool and processes with a view to maximising the application in future phases<br />
Please send suitable profiles in Word format.</div></div><hr />
