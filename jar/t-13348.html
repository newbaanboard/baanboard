With over 25 years of business experience in Accounting and Management I can back fill an open position such as a controller or cost/financial analyst.<br />
<br />
Many companies are realizing that using a known and proven contract resource makes financail sense for the company. You pay only the agreed upon rate. There are no benefits or other employee related expenses to pay for. Economically speaking, it makes sense.<br />
<br />
If you need a resource for an accounting project that uses baan or any other application, I am that hard to find resource that can commit to short term and long term assignments.<br />
