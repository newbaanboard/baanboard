Just putting my 2 cents in.  I worked with Francois last year extensively, and he is very very good.  He knows the functional side of Baan (IV and ERP) very well, and his manufacturing processes were user centric and saved the client a lot of time.   He left them with all the needed documentation and is always willing to help out.</div></div><hr />
