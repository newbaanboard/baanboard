<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jit_mistry</div><div class="date">25th February 2002, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I am an Engineering IT Graduate that was involved in a BaaN IV implementation as part of my sandwich year. I gained a 2:1 award and have now had 8 months experience as a BaaN Analyst Developer on version Vb which has been implemented on an IBM AS/400. <br />
I have been heavily involved with DEM but also with some parts of tools, warehousing and EDI. I also have the added knowledge of Streamserve under my belt. <br />
I am enthusiastic and have a hunger for learning and would like to be involved in more projects especially with emerging technologies.<br />
<br />
where does the BaaN path lead me? Is there a Brighter future for following the BaaN route or should i diverge my knowledge in other areas of industry to secure a better future.<br />
<br />
I am open to any suggestions for career paths.<br />
<br />

Just to protect yourself.  Obviously, you would need to consolidate any new technologies you are trained on.  Just going on courses is not sufficient.  Baan is doing alright, but having experienced the previous slump, I would advise caution.  Datawarehousing is a good skill, but you need to really get involved with a datawarehousing project at an early stage, to pick it up properly.</div></div><hr />
