Flextronics is one of the top 3 clients of Baan and as such has developed an impressive track record in implementing Baan IV as well as Baan ERP and SCS. Members of our team have played various roles (functional &amp; technical) in more than 85 Baan implementations worldwide during the last decade. Utilizing best practice approaches, proprietary methodologies and tools developed by FES, we have proven to be an effective implementation partner. Our implementation methodology allows us to rapidly implement Baan solutions as well as rollout these solutions globally with minimal disruption. We have business models, data guidebooks and implementation templates that aid an accelerated approach, while taking into account regional regulations. <br />

* qFX (Quality Management Tool incl. RMA, NCMR, FA, SCAR, ISO etc.)<br />
* pFX (Project Management Tool incl. timesheets, expenses, request, project status)<br />
* mFX (Migration Scripts which allow data migration from any ERP system - especially Baan IV - to Baan ERP)<br />
* aFX (adapter that integrates BaanERP with Agile Anywhere)<br />
