 <br />
We are  looking for a Baan coding consultant.   We have a project coming up that will require some pretty heavy Baan coding in the service module along with Baan’s inventory system.<br />
 <br />
The modules that we use in Baan are:<br />
Distribution<br />
Manufacturing<br />
Service<br />
Finance<br />
Project<br />
 <br />
Most of our customizations coming up will be in the Service, Manufacturing, and Distribution modules.<br />

Location:              Midland, TX</div></div><hr />

<br />
Testing jobs yieds min START $35 per hr, and there are plenty available!. <br />
Testing job much more easy, less headache, much more flexible..<br />
I think, time to come out of Baan. I believe most of all people working on baan are very intelligent,capable and brainy but now a days it's not appreciable!. <br />
I bet any any seasonal baan developer probably can earn much respect, less  pressured work  and better pay if they work As a QA, and they probably will get absorbed pretty fast!.  <br />
<br />
Time to change!.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After working in BaaN distribution, finance and tools for last 10 years, Now I want to shift to TESTING JOBS which are much easier.<br />
<br />
Can you suggest me from where to start?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
