<br />
Thirty days after 9/11/01 was probably the worst time in US history to start an IT staffing company--in fact, more than 60% of the staffing companies in the USA went out of business within 24 months after that event.  For a lot of people in the industry it tells a story that we must truly be doing something different in an industry isn't.  It's proof that we not only survived, but put out a new model that is working and treats the talent like the superstars they are.  <br />
