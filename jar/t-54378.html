Urgent requirement for ERP LN Finance consultant in the Middle-East<br />
<br />
Consultant will provide ERP LN Finance knowledge transfer and work closely together with the implementation team to finalize the implementation of ERP LN at the customer's location in Saudi-Arabia. Customer concerned has more than 8 years of BAAN IV experience and because the users are very knowledgable about BAAN IV they are good to work with.<br />
 Due to visa restrictions we require ONLY people holding a US or EU passport to apply for this engagement. Visa application, visa costs and all other out-of-pocket expenses will be taken care of by the client. <br />
 Please send me your updated resume/CV, rate expectations and availablility as soon as possible.<br />
 Thanks,<br />
