<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OracleBaanGuru</div><div class="date">19th June 2002, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I am the former founder and Practice Manager of the Oracle Baan Center of excellence (Oracle Corporation).  I am one of the 3 original authors of the Oracle Roadmap for Baan, and the current keeper of the updated document.  I have recently upgraded clients from Oracle 7.3.4 to Oracle 8.1.7 on Windows 2000 and Solaris 8.  I have done migrations from Baan IVc3 to BaanVc, both data and customizations.  <br />
<br />
I have been working with Baan since 1995, starting with Triton 3.1a.<br />
<br />
I have done many migrations from Baan TBase to Oracle, and authored the TBase to Oracle Guide.<br />
<br />
I was a participant in the Baan Rapiditas team that created the multi-threaded MRP sessions.<br />
<br />
I have funtional experience with the Manufacturing, Distribution and Finanace modules.<br />
<br />
I have been the Technical Project Lead on over 3 dozen implementations.<br />
<br />
I have the Oracle Baan Investigator, which allows Oracle Discoverer to see Baan tables with intelligent table and column names.<br />
<br />
I created the Oracle Datawarehouse Solution Roadmap, as a replacement for the inept Baan archiving scheme.<br />
<br />
My former client list includes Nortel, Siemens PT&amp;D, Siemens Medical, US Filter, Royal Vendors, BioRad, SMED (Canada) and many others.<br />
<br />
If you are doing anything with Baan on Oracle, I am one of the experts.  Installation, upgrades, migrations, performance tuning, capacity planning, as well as designig, project managing, implementing and monitoring entire corporate infrastructures to support Baan on Oracle.<br />
<br />
Attached is my resume in Word Format.<br />
