<br />
Now that Infor SSA is looking for resources through BaanBoard directly it may be a good moment that Infor SSA finally recognizes our user forum and perhaps you guys can sponsor us one day.<br />
In the past SSA never cared about BaanBoard and even considered to shut us down completely at the end of 2004.<br />
I hope you can help BaanBoard to get its own recognition within the Infor SSA BAAN community as within a few months we will celibrate our 10,000th member.<br />
BaanBoard has been around since mid 2001 and has become a very useful and valuable meeting place for BAAN users all over the world.<br />
What would your users do if BaanBoard was not there anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">8th February 2007, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, let's hope that finally Infor recognizes what neither Baan, nor Invensys, nor SSA recognized: That they have a very strong and supporting community (from customers and professionals working with the software), that this community helped the product to survive, and that's it's not a good business strategy to constantly cosh one part or another of that community with very strange business methods (working against baanboard, working against freelancers, working against partners, working against customers with that audit software thing and so on, charging for every little bit of information or addon...). Let's really hope it - it can't go on that way too much longer, or the best community get's ****** off somewhen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">9th February 2007, 05:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Well put.  I agree totally with what all that Ulrich has said.<br />
<br />
I was never able to understand their mentality or strategy of the predecessors. Their penny-pinching attitude has engendered a lot of ill feeling (with me at least).  It seem as if that they enjoyed watching the installed base whittle away.  <br />
<br />
I am very hopeful that the new owners may have a different approach.  If that turns out to be the case we may upgrade and even buy more licences.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bruno simonnet</div><div class="date">9th February 2007, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Well,<br />
As I see your reaction it's interesting that Infor give more visibility to the business as done before.<br />
So, I am also within Baan World since 98.<br />
This is more an opportunity to extent the community and to exchange with Baan Specialists.<br />
For the moment it is a local and personal initiative.<br />
We can discuss how extent our relation, I have no doubt that everybody has to win about it.<br />
