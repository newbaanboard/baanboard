<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gfasbender</div><div class="date">25th October 2001, 03:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I am an independent ERP software consultant specializing in technical services supporting Baan software implementations.  I have over 18 years experience in the information technology field, with the last 8 years working on various commercial and A&amp;D (Aerospace and Defense) Baan implementations.  During the last 8 years, I have provided technical conversion and customization support for 11 successful Baan site implementations.<br />
<br />
Besides my years of technical Baan experience, the services I provide are unique in that I have developed innovative software tools, utilities and implementation strategies that are not provided in the standard Baan product.  These tools simplify and accelerate data conversion load cycles while enhancing data visibility, accuracy and integrity. <br />
<br />
If your company is looking for a &quot;can-do&quot; individual with my implementation experience,  please don't hesitate in contacting me.<br />
<br />
More in-depth information on my experience, qualifications, and software tools can be found on the web at GW Consulting. (http://gwconsulting.netfirms.com)</div></div><hr />
