 ==========<br />
Dear Sirs,  <br />
 I am a highly experienced professional with a long career of making significant contributions to the success of each organization whom I have served.  I have a long record of work stability and reliability.  When I have changed employers, I have had to come up to speed very quickly in each new environment even though it required very <br />
different skills for each change.  I have been successful in doing that consistently because I strive to exceed expectations.  <br />
 For the past 11 years I worked for Ropak Corporation as Sr. Programmer Analyst on the MK 8.0 ERP system (Now known as the ERP LN by Infor).  I was the chief architect and coder for all modifications and enhancements made to the Sales, Purchasing, Manufacturing, Planning, Inventory Control, Distribution, GL, AP and AR modules using Baan Triton Tools 6.0h and System Administrator for the HP 9000 running HP-UX 11.0 .  I worked the first 5 years in the corporate offices in California.  The last 6 years I have been telecommuting from my home in Bellingham, Washington.  The position included travel to the corporate office and to 7 manufacturing plants in the US and Canada.   <br />
 I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding the position of Baan System Administrator.    <br />
 Thank you for your time.  <br />
 Sincerely,<br />
 John P Morgan</div></div><hr />
