<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Eden</div><div class="date">4th February 2005, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">In todays challenging environment, it goes without saying that every Company must ensure that there is absolutely no waste in the product stream. Companies are so busy worrying about the product quality, delivery and cost that they dont look at the complete picture. Taking waste out of the business process requires one to look at the complete process, from start to finish, evaluate what is done at each step, and determine whether it adds value to their business or not.<br />
<br />
My background spans 20 years in the logistics / materials areas and the last 6 in the systems and process design areas utilizing the Baan software package. My most recent position required me to lead teams of users in the design of software and processes from the prospective of implementation and or optimization. It was my responsibility to analyze requirements, based on current business processes, and determine if the current solution was the most effective for the business. Review of all business processes, design of workflows, and development of training materials and delivery of the training were all under my responsibility. <br />
 <br />
My strengths include<br />
- Project management<br />
- Baan Distribution &amp; Manufacturing Specialist<br />
- Negotiation (20+ years dealing with suppliers both internally &amp; externally)<br />
- Process engineering / re-engineering (GAP analysis)<br />
- Problem analysis and solutions<br />
- training (requirements, development, delivery)<br />
- Quality (I have been involved in several ISO9001 &amp; ISO 14000 implementations)<br />
- Strong MS Office skills and Flowcharting software<br />
- Multi plant / facility experience<br />
 <br />
I have worked as a functional specialist in several companies utilizing my skills in the understanding of business needs and requirements. I work well with teams, both leading and participating. I have a passion for getting things done with details for quality results. <br />
 <br />
I would be very interested in meeting with you to discuss how I can assist you in assessing your systems and processes to ensure they are waste free.<br />
 <br />
I am attaching a copy of my resume for your consideration.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Sincerely,<br />
