Client is located in the south eastern USA region. Work would typically be on-site for 2 to 3 months.<br />
<br />
Individuals who can analyze existing customizations make changes as needed and then fully test these customizations to ensure that they will work in all cases.  Many of the existing customizations were done years ago and only partially tested.  They were tested to verify that they would do the specific job at hand, but were not tested to see what the impact of these customizations would be on all related functions in Baan.<br />
