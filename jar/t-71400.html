Infor ERP LN implementation experience?  Ready for a move into consulting? <br />
<br />
If you have gained experience implementing Infor ERP LN as part of an in-house team and are now wanting to step up to be a consultant then I'd like to hear from you.<br />
We are particularly interested in talking to people with ERP LN Skills (but Baan IV and V is good too).<br />
At this time we are looking for Consultants that are currently living in Europe or the UK with appropriate rights to work in these countries.Â </div></div><hr />
