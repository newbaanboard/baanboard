Our vision is to power every autonomous vehicle with the first LiDAR capable of making them both safe and scalable. It’s easy to get an autonomous vehicle to work 99% of the time, but it’s the last 1% that’s preventing them from becoming a reality. That’s where we come in. We’ve built a breakthrough LiDAR from the chip level up, delivering 50x better resolution and 10x longer range than the most advanced LiDARs available today. Luminar is not just a sensor, but the core of a platform that can enable the industry to have safe autonomous vehicles on the road.</div></div><hr />
