<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">12th May 2005, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to admit to a lack of education: where is 'GCC'?<br />
<br />
Mahadevan, I offer archive projects at a fixed price. That includes a professional automated remote data assessment, one week training and setup on site and on-going remote support.<br />
<br />
The data assessment is performed automatically by scanning your data with a complex program. The outcome of the data assessment doesn't just include the usual archive session sequence and step by step documentation but also information about customizations that could cause trouble, customizations that could be impacted by archiving, an overview about the data that needs to be archived, &quot;good housekeeping&quot; information (files with records that need to be cleaned up) etc. It's not possible to do the same thorough assessment manually. Please find further information on www.maxsc.com. <br />
<br />
My solutions are implemented at several companies in the US and Canada and I'm happy to provide customer references.<br />
<br />
If you're interested, please contact me for a detailed offer and pricing information. (karin@espelage.com)<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Karin Espelage</div></div><hr />
