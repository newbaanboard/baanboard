Freelance (LN Finance Expert) looking for a new Project throughout Europe<br />
<br />
Hello,<br />
   I am an experienced Finance Consultant (Freelance), based in Germany  (DÃ¼sseldorf) looking for a new project throughout Europe. Having started  1997 with Triton, Baan IV, Baan V up to LN 10.5 I do have also a very  good understanding of all logistical modules, as well as DEM and LN  Tools.<br />
 I am also familiar with all major localisations in Europe (Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany etc.) related to Finance / Controlling.<br />
   Please do not hesitate to contact me via mail if interested.</div></div><hr />

We at Buckman use BaanIV c4. We are being told that we need to comply with electronic invoicing in Italy starting from Jan 1 2019. I am just wondering if you have any experience and if you are still available. Please send an email to vcherukuri@buckman.com if you can help with this requirement.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Venu</div></div><hr />
