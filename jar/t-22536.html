<br />
Are you telling me you are seeking a new job for three years already without success..? Your profile seems like a &quot;hot catch&quot;...??? <br />
<br />
P.s. I don't mean this in an attacking/insulting way, just as being surprised...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertB</div><div class="date">5th July 2007, 14:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi &quot;en&quot;,<br />
<br />
I guess it's mostly to do with getting so used to the culture where one is treated by certain managers like a piece of trash - even though one is more highly qualified than most others in the company - that I've simply come to accept it as being the norm. The biggest problem here is showing energy, initiative, drive and commitment - I don't know, I just can't help myself...<br />
<br />
Actually, I haven't applied anywhere in particular - only here on BaanBoard. And, since my notice here has attracted so little interest, I just gave up on the idea, gritted my teeth and continued with this job. I mean, at 58 years of age, what other choice do I have? Plus, I've never had a CV: since I've had such an unconventional career, any CV I could put together (it would have to be unrelentingly truthful) would read like a fairy tale...<br />
<br />
Rob<br />
<br />
PS - I can now add good db skills in DB2, C#/Visual Studio programming and a knowledge of electronics (since I've just passed my Class A Amateur Radio Exam :) ) to the list. Just for the sake of completeness, you understand...</div></div><hr />

I am convinced that if you want, you can find yourself a new better work environment (according to your description of the current one...) with not too much effort. Even with your 58 years...</div></div><hr />
