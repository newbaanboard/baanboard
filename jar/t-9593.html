<br />
 I am a balance accountant and worked four years as Baan IV administrator in a trading company with a small production. <br />
<br />
 During the implementation of Baan IV I was the key user for Finance and Tools. Property in these four years I did much customizations(reports, forms and menus) and also I program own Baan sessions.<br />
<br />
 In addition I wrote interfaces to the Microsoft Office products (automatic debit advice by fax or by E-Mail, etc..) My job was killed because of an outsourcing project and I am looking for a new operating field. <br />
<br />
 I am located between Frankfurt and Cologne (Germany).</div></div><hr />
