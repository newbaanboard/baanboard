Hello,<br />
   I am an experienced Finance Consultant  (Freelance), based in Germany  (DÃ¼sseldorf) looking for a new project  throughout Europe. Having started  1997 with Triton, Baan IV, Baan V up  to LN 10.6 I do have also a very  good understanding of all logistical  modules, as well as DEM and LN  Tools.<br />
 I am also familiar with all major localisations in  Europe (Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany etc.) related to Finance /  Controlling.<br />
   Please do not hesitate to contact me via mail in case of interest. 			 		<br />
 Regards - Kaibou</div></div><hr />
