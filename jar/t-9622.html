More often than not and even after initial contact with recruiters phone calls and emails are not returned. Status of any application becomes obvious but this practrice will eventually turn against its practitioners. We (service providers) are attempting to teach best business practice and I personally believe that teaching by example is the best way.<br />

I am not sure that your problem/concern is? Are you trying to say that posting job offers on Baanboard yields 'unreliable candidates'? The only part Baanboard plays is that of 'facilitator', meaning we try to be a common meeting place for those who offer and those who are looking for work. What happens after that is completely out of our control. As recruiter you are free to use or not to use the facilities we offer.</div></div><hr />

No complaint whatsoever with the role that baanboard plays nor how it is carried out. The post was a simple reminder to the users, recruiters and applicants, that once initial contact is made between the two and promisses are made to follow-up it is only right to do so.<br />

Okay, I understand your point. In that case let this thread be a reminder :)</div></div><hr />
