This is your chance to work with some of the brightest minds in the industry as you grow in a dynamic, collaborative environment. Once you have gotten up to speed on our existing mainframe, you will combine your outstanding communication and analysis skills to help lead several of our finance functions onto Baan IV and ultimately towards a migration onto the latest Baan release, SSA LN.<br />
<br />
Youll have a wealth of opportunity to increase your business acumen throughout your regular interaction with various areas of the organization. Herman Miller System Analysts thrive on challenge and problem solving and have the design and project management skills needed to help drive meaningful change. Your leadership and organization skills will be critical as you lead and participate in medium and large scale projects. Also key is your ability to translate from business to technical language and vice versa as you act as the liaison between IT and Finance. Our Analysts are the very definition of multi-taskers and can readily handle the challenge of managing multiple assignments/projects concurrently and establishing and maintaining priorities. <br />
<br />
In order to be successful, wed like someone with a strong understanding of Finance/Accounting theory and process (someone who has supported a finance organization) and extensive knowledge of Baan. Youll need to demonstrate your subject matter expertise and skills in implementation of client server applications (such as Baan, Oracle, SAP, etc., web based applications, data warehousing, RDBMS and financial packaged software) in order to quickly gain credibility and be effective in this role. Weve found that most people who are successful in this role have a Bachelors degree or equivalent and have had around seven years of professional information systems work, including an understanding of hardware and software technology and development methodologies. <br />
<br />
Plus, youll get to work with one of Fortunes Most Admired Companies. This is a great opportunity to take your career to the next level! Apply now at www.hermanmiller.com/careers. Contact Bethany at 616.654.5282 with questions.<br />

KEYWORDS: Baan, finance, accounting, analyst, systems, COBOL, mainframe, SSA LN,</div></div><hr />
