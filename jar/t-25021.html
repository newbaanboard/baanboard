<br />
I have been working 10 years as a Baan Finance consultant. Because of the combination of knowledge of business processes, IT audit and Baan, I am able to translate business related problems into reliable solutions in Baan. I can assist your company with the following projects:<br />
-	Implementing Baan Finance (including integrations with Project, Manufacturing, PCS, Service, Distribution).<br />
-	Optimising your current environment. (Triton, Baan IV, Baan V). This can be using new functionality or streamlining the current processes.<br />
-	Auditing your current environment and giving advice how you are able to get a better control over your Baan system, to make sure that your (financial) data are reliable and complete. (For example defining a month end and year end procedure, describing all necessary checks and controls).<br />
-	Training the Baan users. Not only in functionality, but also creating awareness of how getting and working with a Baan system with reliable data.<br />
