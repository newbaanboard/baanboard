Freelancer Consultant for Infor LN and BaaN 5  -Logistics-   <br />
<br />
Professional experience: <br />
<br />
 <br />
For the last 15+ Years I worked in process and quality management, for multiple companies in divers industries. My focus was set on Infor(BaaN) applications. Many projects as well as daily maintenance and improvements was on the topic list. This includes installation- or migration project in CH as well as internationally around the globe. Projects sizes from 10 up to 600 people involved, was part of this portfolio. Some of them asked for interfaces and 3party software as well. <br />
 <br />
Initially trained as an engineer I worked some years as mechanic at the beginning of my carrier. But soon I moved into this IT-consulting role as it is today. Starting with other Software and ERP-Systems I started with Infor/BaaN 1999.</div></div><hr />
