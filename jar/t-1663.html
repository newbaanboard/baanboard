<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DavidS</div><div class="date">16th April 2002, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I believe I am right in saying that on an H1 visa you can't work as an independent contractor, you must have an employer to sponsor your H1.<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% sure, but I think that is the case. Can anyone clarify?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jganti</div><div class="date">16th April 2002, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I think its ok to work independently on a contract basis if you have a good rapport with your employer who sponsored your H1. Its a matter of profit sharing agreement between the two.<br />
<br />
But in reality are there any baan positions at all outside? I have been looking at dice.com, this site and also monster.com. But I do not find any at all. <br />
<br />
I am also on the look out. Recently finished my 3 year long Baan project and hunting now for any contracting positions.<br />
<br />
Any big baan projects coming up anywhere in the US? Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KyleYbarra</div><div class="date">2nd May 2002, 04:01</div></div><div class="posttext">No, H1 contractors cannot LEGALLY work directly for any U.S. employer without having H1-B visa sponsorship.<br />
The INS will hammer the employer and send you packing back to your home land.<br />
<br />
Re: your question about Baan employement, though, YES, there are Baan positions available and one of our clients is presently seeking Baan consultants to join them on a full-time salary basis.  The even better news is that they're willing to sponsor H1-B's.<br />
<br />
If you have Baan V and strong Financials experience, you can send  your resume to me for consideration at:<br />
