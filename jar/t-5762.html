My total IT industry experience is over 12 years. In my most recent job I was responsible for undertaking the above tasks in a manufacturing environment and within the following Baan modules:<br />
<br />
Manufacturing<br />
Distribution<br />
Finance<br />
<br />
I also have more than 10 years unix administration and installation experience under my belt. <br />
<br />
I am confident in a customer facing position and would enjoy the challenge of consultancy work, or any position in which I could utilize my existsting technical talents and communications prowess. I enjoy working with end users at all levels.<br />
<br />
Currently I am doing ad hoc analysis and customizations for a previous employer on an as needed basis and would be happy to consider any similar opportunities that might present themselves. I would also consider any permanent or contract position regardless of location within the UK, USA, or Europe. For the US sponsorship would be required.<br />
<br />
Please e-mail me at david@shepparddg.freeserve.co.uk to discuss any possible opportunities. <br />
