<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SoftTouch</div><div class="date">23rd February 2004, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a Baan finance consultant and qualified accountant with more than 5 years experience with Baan. Because of this combination of experience, I am ideally positioned to translate business related problems into reliable solutions in Baan (Baan IV and Baan ERP) and effectively communicate them to finance and business users. My areas of expertise as a Baan consultant have included:<br />
<br />
- Implementing Baan Finance. Most recently I was the sole finance consultant for a successful Baan ERP implementation in a multi-site environment in the Middle East. The tasks included but were not limited to, the redesign of the chart of accounts to comply with legal requirements and local reporting requirements in 4 countries, the appropriate setting of all parameters, master data and integrations to fit the required business model, creation of role specific DEM flows, finance data load management for each Go-Live.<br />
- Training Baan users. I have delivered standard Baan training courses for the Baan education partner in the UK. I have also produced and delivered process specific training for clients.<br />
- Providing application support. I have been the finance application support consultant on a major European installation and trained client staff to provide second level support.<br />
- Auditing and advising on Baan related business processes, e.g. month end procedures to ensure a timely and accurate close, purchase ledger procedures to reduce dependence on off system data and improve problem resolution.<br />
