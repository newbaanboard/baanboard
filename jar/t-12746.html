We can probably help. We have a 3.1 Baan installation still running on our internal systems, and actually still have a customer who is running 3.1 in a production environment. <br />
<br />
We have internal IT staff who are knowledgeable on Triton, and we should not have a problem figuring out how to integrate it with your customer's WMS solution.<br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing from you.<br />
