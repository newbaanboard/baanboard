Senior Baan ERP Functional Systems Analyst  <br />
<br />
RDI Technology Partners is an engineering and technology search firm. We are conducting a &quot;high priority&quot; search for an established technology products concern in San Diego (500 employees, but part of a larger multi-$ billion parent). This Senior ERP (BaaN) Systems Analyst position is exciting, highly visible and includes a very competitive salary and relocation package, along with a solid benefits package.  It is of course a direct-hire permanent position. This is mainly a functional analyst role, not a Baan technology administration/platform support role. The company is currently on BaaN V and in the process of moving to BaaN LN, using Hyperion Brio for data warehousing/reporting. You will be working with the end-user community to ensure the company is utilizing Baan LN to its utmost potential for their specific business and manufacturing environment.   There will also be some use of SQL and Baan’s 4Gl tool. <br />
US Ciitizens or US Permanent Residents with 3 to 43 years of experience will be considered. This is an exceptional opportunity to plug into a great position with an excellent profitable company in Sunny San Diego and have every other Friday off.</div></div><hr />
