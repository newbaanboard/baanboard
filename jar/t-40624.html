<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jshircli</div><div class="date">16th August 2007, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Our client is looking for 5 BAAN Developer/ Analysts- 2 Sr. Level (5+ years) and 3 Jr. Level (2+ years) for a 4-6 month contract. <br />
<br />
They can work out of the Milpitas, CA, Raleigh, NC or the Austin, TX client office but they will need to travel to Louisville 50% of the time. <br />
<br />
Skills that are important to do this job include BAAN 5b, BAAN Tools, Configuration and Customization, Oracle PL/SQL skills, and Functional and Technical Specification writing. The Developers will need to know how to tune it, how to make it run faster. They need to know how to create screens and go behind screens and program. It is very important that these developers have GREAT communication skills because they will be working face to face with the business people.  <br />
<br />
These needs are due to our clientÂ’s new Service Parts Logistics project. This means they manage the movement of parts to the supplier and then to the Louisville facility and then to customers. They also do reverse logistics which means if a customer has a piece of hardware that needs repaired then it is sent back to the Louisville location.  This will first be rolled out in Louisville and then rolled out in Europe and Asia (rollout by December 12). The manager can interview any day next week but Wednesday and not before 8am or between 11-1. If a candidate is not local then he will phone interview and if they are local then personal interview. He will hire off of phone interview. Candidates MUST have great communication due to them meeting with clients to gather requirements. The dress code is business casual and that includes jeans. Hours are flexible as long as they are in by about 9 and work 40 hours.</div></div><hr />
