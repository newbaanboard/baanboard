This client is located in the Cleveland area.  It is a manufacturing/plant environment.  <br />

Ideally a preferred candidate would have heavily exposure to BaaN  :) from a manufacturing standpoint and would be knowledgeable of the columns and tables from which they would pull reporting information.  This environment also uses crystal reports and the MS Office Suite.  <br />
<br />
Strong candidates will also possess statistical pricing experience with competitive pricing.  :cool: <br />
