ERP Ln FP2 FP7 Functional Consultant with 7* Years Experience<br />
<br />
I have been working with ERP Ln FP2, FP7 &amp; Baan V for the past six years. My primary area of expertise in Manufacturing &amp; Distribution Module implementations &amp; I have a Mechanical Engineering background. However, I can quite easily implement the operational and logistical components of systems as evidenced in my work experience. I believe that where I really add value to my employers is in being an all round performer. My functional skills are excellent and I am also technically competent.<br />
 <br />
In addition to my experience in implementing and project managing ERP Ln solutions I have more recently gained a broader level of expertise by developing Business process Mapping and complete gap analysis, making functional specifications, being a good leader &amp; team player in my present organisation.<br />
 <br />
Prior to working with FP2 &amp; FP7, I was supporting BaaN V, ERP system. In total I have been implementing &amp; working with ERP systems for 7 years and I have a comprehensive understanding of the workings of such systems as well as the business concepts involved. <br />
