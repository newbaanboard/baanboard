Have strong knowledge of distribution and manufacturing (incl. PCS) and have operated many times as either project manager or business solutions architect.<br />
<br />
As well as implementation support I can offer day to day support including stock/wip reconcilliations, Financial Statement writing, integration set-up etc. By having a strong business understanding and in depth knowledge of Baan (all areas), I believe that I can help you set up the Baan system to ensure you get the most out of it.<br />
