<br />
I have a client who is looking for a Baan Developer with 2-5 years experience. They are trying to fill a fulltime/permanent position within their organization and need a Baan developer to work with Baan at the backend. Some of the other requirements are as follows:<br />
<br />
Required Computer Science or Data Processing degree or equivalent work experience 2-5 years Baan developing experience (Baan V highly desirable) Problem-solving skills Preferred Administration of Baan; Tools knowledge a huge plus Baan V highly desirable Baan ERP LN also highly desirable Cognos OpenWorld DEM Vertex UNIX Scripting Familiarity with integration software EDI knowledge.<br />
<br />
This organization is offering very competitive salary, benefits package, relocation package, and I am offering a signon bonus to the hired candidate. H1B visa holder are encourage to apply as they will do a H1B transfer and will also sponsor for the Green Card process.<br />
<br />
Its a great opportunity with a large, stable organization in North America. The turnover ratio at this organization and particularly for this position has been very very low. They have not had the need to fill a similar position in the past 5-7 years. Hence, it a very stable job position and organization.<br />
