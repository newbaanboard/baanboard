I am a currently a full time employee of a large Aerospace and Defense company running multiple sites with Baan IV.  I am looking for opportunities outside of my current employer.  I can provide part time services to you that could give you added flexibility to address your business needs - without the commitment of an add to staff (~15 hours per week immediately).<br />
<br />
I am located in New York and I believe the three hour difference could be very beneficial to this arrangement.  I am a strong communicator and can make very effective use of collaboration tools such as netmeeting (or similar) when working with users.  If you considered it beneficial, we could discuss arrangements for some on-site &quot;face to face&quot; time to help enhance the relationship with end users.<br />
<br />
Please contact me if you feel this could be beneficial to your organization.<br />
