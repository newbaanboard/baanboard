Recently we came across a couple of customers running Baan against Oracle and we realize we need to get more knowledgeable about how Baan interacts with the database. I figure a half-day interactive workshop delivered by con call, webex, or similar to our engineers should do the trick. Please reply to malcolm at wirecache dot com.</div></div><hr />
