<br />
Currently working with ICRM v4.2.1 which for the main part has been heavily customised and enhanced to suit the utilities requirements and gauging from Baan Supports reactions we are one the largest customised systems currently implemented. This customisation also extends to include the integration of products such as MQSeries, IBM DataPropigator/replicator into the day to day use of ICRM.<br />
<br />
This role has been a contract position within Australia which is soon to finish and I'm interested in continuing work with the ICRM system.<br />
