<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 08:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using Win NT &amp; SQL Server 7.0 with Baan IVc4, in4, SP7, porting set 6.1c.06.02. <br />
<br />
I want to use performance boosters to speed up performance by using tcmcs0197m000 &amp; tcmcs0198m000.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone using this feature.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use only Session perf. Booster for some sessions.<br />
For example: tipgc5201m00b (Generate GRP orders, BaanIVc4and0, Oracle8.1.7, AIX4.3)<br />
I've set it for 3 servers only in the job for the job-user. <br />
(The running time was without the setting:13 hours,<br />
 but with the setting: 8 hours).<br />

<br />
We have met on another thread on a similar topic<br />
<br />
May I ask how many processors you have in your server ?<br />
<br />
Also I set up ( I thought as you said ) but maybe not as the perf boosters did not reduce the time on tibom1213m000 run as a Job<br />
and looking in through glance (HPUX tool) could only see 1 bshell not 3 ! So I must still be not doing something correct ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a IBM P620 with 4 processors.<br />
Because we are running more jobs at the same time, i use max. 3 servers as a perf. booster.<br />
Sometimes i get an error in the log.comdll0200 file concerning RETRY action but i've set MAX RETRY to 50. So the process still continues. (I get the error only when running the tipgc5201 session. Not while running the tibom1213 session)<br />
Was the session, which you mentioned visible into tcmcs0197m000? If not then your seesion is not supported by perf. booster. (According to me).<br />
I run tibom1213m10b. I think it is a specific BaanIVc4and0 session. It was mentioned in the tcmcs0197m000.<br />

They are not built into every session. Are you sure that session tibom1213m000 has Performance Boosters?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you speaking of the pb code being built  in the baan code ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct. I think GN has given you better direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In response it was not visible thru tcmcs0197m000 but I inserted it.<br />
<br />
There were no tibom1213??? sessions visible thru tcmcs0197m000 at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Djie-En</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Frank,<br />
<br />
If your session is not called into tcmcs0197 it is NOT supported by P.B.<br />
My session tibom1213m10b is mentioned.<br />
This session is specific AND0 (Aerospace and Defense) i suppose.<br />
<br />

<br />
Understood and many thanks<br />
<br />
Baan support have given us a different object (obom1213) which they say will report some stats <br />
<br />
However if our product is structured in a way to meet our product requirements the stats will be useful by telling us the &quot;why&quot; but we still will need to resolve the issue by reducing the run time<br />
so we will see if we can obtain the &quot;functionality&quot; from Baan <br />
which you .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mugambo</div><div class="date">28th August 2003, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">In BaaN V, when you click on parallel processing flag (if available on the session form like cprrp1210m000) then the record is created in tcmcs0597m000. Then you can run the session with performance boosters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">29th August 2003, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The flag in cprrp1210m000 is overriding the defaults of the tableboosters. There are only a few sessions that have this possibility. In this way you can schedule 2 sessions in 1 job: first to run parallel processing and the other not. This can be usefull in certain situations.<br />
<br />
Setting the flag will go to the default parallel processing checks. This check will generate the record in tcmcs097. So, indirectly you are right, but underneath it behaves differently.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
