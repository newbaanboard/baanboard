<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oirfeodent</div><div class="date">23rd March 2017, 06:36</div></div><div class="posttext">The native support does not seem to work for me. I see the BaanC in the list of languages, but the syntax is not highlighted. Highlighting works for other languages, though. Any hints?<br />
<br />
Can you post a screen shot of which highlight is not working?<br />
<br />
In general, post installation <br />
<br />
 go to Settings --&gt; Style Configurator.<br />
 Leave theme as the default theme (Only if you have done full installation).<br />
 Locate BaanC on the &quot;Language :&quot; box.<br />
 Select KEYWORDS under &quot;Style :&quot; box.<br />
 Enter all the keywords you want to highlight, in the &quot;User-Defined Keywords&quot; box seperated by a space.<br />
 Note that the &quot;Default keywords&quot; box, only has the Baan Reserved keywords and BaanSQL reserver keywords.<br />
 Select FUNCTIONS under &quot;Style :&quot; box.<br />
 Enter all the functions you want to highlight, in the &quot;User-Defined Keywords&quot; box seperated by a space.<br />
 Note that the &quot;Default keywords&quot; box, only has seven functions as a sample. <br />
<br />
<br />
The details for this behaviour is available inside the file &quot;langs.model.xml&quot; or &quot;langs.xml&quot; located in the installation directory of notepad++. <br />
<br />
Functions (Set your Functions based on Baan version &amp; TIV level. in Settings -&gt; Style Configurator -&gt; BaanC -&gt; Functions -&gt; User Defined Keywords)<br />
<br />
Also, note that only two sets of highlighting possible for now, as notepad++ uses an older scintilla; once the scintilla component gets upgraded there should 9 sets of highlighting possible.<br />
You can also frame your files based on the attachments from the post by &quot;jph_tours&quot;.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klesch</div><div class="date">23rd March 2017, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for your reply.<br />
<br />
I see BaanC in the menu Language --&gt; B --&gt; BaanC.<br />
<br />
But, when I go Settings --&gt; Style Configurator, there is no BaanC within languages.<br />
<br />
Snapshot is here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8ADxT62WL8ybmJLLTduVUJyaEE/view)<br />
<br />
Did I miss anything? I have a full installation of version 7.3.3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it should be because of how the notepad++ upgrade process works.<br />
After a fresh installation, the following files gets renamed and never gets updated after that... even if there are new changes inside the original &lt;*&gt;.model.xml files.<br />
<br />
 langs.model.xml --&gt; langs.xml<br />
 stylers.model.xml --&gt; stylers.xml<br />
<br />
<br />
If a fresh installation needs to be avoided, the new changes from the &lt;*&gt;.model.xml can be manually synced up to &lt;*&gt;.xml.<br />
<br />
