The only thing I can recommend is trying to re-install the patch that worked for you.  Of course if any of the fixes from the other patches are needed then you will have to re-work you current function server.  You may want to trace through it and post a more specific problem with a snippet of the code.  The maybe we can make some recommendations.<br />
