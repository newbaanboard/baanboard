<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ariolim</div><div class="date">24th February 2005, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all.<br />
<br />
I would like to hear from you about my testing of Baan IV on an Intel platform with Linux and Oracle 10g, host mode.<br />
<br />
Our live environment is on a Sun Enterprise 10000 with 16 Sparc CPUs 400 Mhz; Solaris 8 + Oracle 8.1.7 DB, host mode.<br />
<br />
Test is done on a dual Xeon 3Ghz 64bit (hyper trading on) with 4Gb memory. To evaluate the improvement (or not) I compared the executions of session tipcs5201m000 &quot;Generate Planned PRP Orders&quot; which is used often in our company.<br />
<br />
Live execution in multi-bshell (1+7) takes from 3 to 5 hours.<br />
Here come to good news: test execution, same data, one single bshell takes about 1 hour!<br />
<br />
Now the bad news: I make tests with multi-bshell and results don't change  :mad: <br />
With 1+2, 1+4, 1+8 bshells it takes always about an hour. The only thing that changes is the idle CPU: with 1+4 is almost 0%, with 1+8 the idle is always 0%.<br />
<br />
I have set hidden parameters in Oracle 10g as suggested by solution 166049 but nothing changes. Kernel parameter are set as required by Oracle.<br />
<br />
Any idea about that?<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />
Marco</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">24th February 2005, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all I think that you did some nice tests. But as with all tests, there are to many pitfalls possible.<br />
<br />
As you are using a dual CPU machine I would also expect an improvement when using multiple bshell. But maybe your system is not ideal:<br />
- do you have sufficient memory available for other processes or has Oracle everything?<br />
- is IO maybe a bottleneck?<br />
- is maybe the code path not optimal and do you have locking issues?<br />
<br />
to validate, you can use all kind of tools, but I suggest to start with the Call Graph Profiler as described in chapter 2 o the document I uploaded here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7665) <br />
<br />
Without finding the bottleneck I advise you not to move to this new machine as life machine. Maybe it can handle a relative small number ofusers very well, but it maybe has only 1 disk or has other bottlenecks that can prevent of usin it for lots of users.<br />
<br />
Happy digging,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">24th February 2005, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">What are the bshells doing? is it starting 4 but then only using 1? (ie are the others idle?)<br />
<br />
Are you running your PRP in Regenerative Mode?<br />
<br />
The natural conclusion that you might draw is that you have 1 or 2 big<br />
projects that are getting generated, and the rest of them only take a very<br />
small amount of time. So all of the work might be being done by a single<br />
bshell...<br />

<br />
Nope. With 2 CPU's multiple bshells your throughput already can gain a lot. In fact it are HT CPU's so you will see 4 CPU's. But I expect that you perform better on 1 bshell by turning HT off.<br />
<br />

That is also a very interesting point. I expect that you can see this very easy by measuring the CPU time every 10 minutes. If CPU drops after 10 minutes, this can indeed come through a very lage project.<br />

1- SGA=1,2 Gb <br />
2- When CPUs are less than 100% I see I/O wait, when CPUs are 100% I/O wait is 0.<br />
3- Don't understand: what is code path? Locking issues?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
1- As you have a 4 Gb system. It llook likes memory is not a problem.<br />
2-  when is cpu 100%? Only in multi bshell mode?<br />
3- I mean: if the code isn't optimal and you see locking or retries. If you face a lot of locking this has to do with code/ database/ data that isn't scalabele. If you sum up the count on important functions from a multiple bshell call graph output and compare it to the single bshell run this probably shows you if you faced locking / retries or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ariolim</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I have made other tests, this time using &quot;iostat&quot; to monitor and I got interesting results:<br />
<br />
- Disk I/O read almost 0<br />
- I/O write 5 Mb/s avarage<br />
<br />
With one single bshell, %util is less than 20%<br />
With 1+4 bshell is greater than 90%<br />
<br />
As reported by iostat man <br />
&quot;              %util<br />
                     Percentage  of  CPU  time  during  which I/O<br />
                     requests were issued to  the  device  (bandÂ­<br />
                     width  utilization  for  the device). Device<br />
                     saturation occurs when this value  is  close<br />
                     to 100%.<br />

<br />
Could I say that disks are the possible cause of this bad performance?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 13:53</div></div><div class="posttext">it is very well possible that IO is a problem as %util increases significant when running with multiple bshells. Can you describe your disk layout (number, RPM, spread of load, RAID)? How many disks and how fast? When running over 1 hour the cache of a few MB's doesn't help you anymore. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ariolim</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Data disk is a 420Gb RAID-5 LUN composed by 4 Seagate 140Gb, 10000 rpm, SCSI-3. SCSI adapter is Dell Perc/4DC.<br />
<br />
Every Oracle files is under the same directory: datafile, redo, controlfile.<br />
A colleague tell me that it's better to move redo log away from that disk.<br />
And possibly to increase them: now they are 10Mb each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">In general I hate RAID 5 for production. See http://www.baarf.com/ for more info.  RAID 5 is not the most performing . This can indeed be the root cause. I assume that if you remove RAID 5 and only stripe (only valid for test environments) you will see a dramatic IO improvement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ariolim</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Additionally I read about a  bug in Oracle 10.1.0.3 for linux 64bit (metalink docID 539559.994) that cause too many trace files dumped in the 'udump' area: actually 1 about every 4-5 seconds (!)<br />
Moreover in my tests I see that redo log switch every 10-15 seconds (!!)<br />
<br />
In this scenario, I/O is greatly involved in bad performance   :eek: <br />
