<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">10th February 2004, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an AFS library that inserts data into a session that does some checking in the init.form section.  If the checks fail, an execute(end.program) is called.  So, when I do my first stpapi.put, if the check fails, the subprocess does not exist.  I have figured out a way to check for this without proceeding all the way to the insert.  However, if I then correct the problem so the checks succeed, the first time I try to do the insert I get a &quot;Process is gone&quot; message (note that this also occurs if I let things run through to the insert on the initial run that failed the checks).  If I then retry the exact same data, the insert occurs.  So, I think the initial end.program execution must have left AFS in some nasty state.  Is there a way to clean things up so that there is nothing in AFS hanging around to cause this &quot;process is gone&quot; error?<br />
<br />
BTW: this is on 4c4, unix and/or NT, SP14</div></div><hr />

Not sure if this helps or if you have source code:<br />
<br />
if not api.mode then<br />
   execute(end.program)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Of course I have changed several of my programs to skip or ignore &quot;Process is gone&quot; - mainly because my code worked and somewhere along the way something ended the sub-session.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I repeat update/saves because it takes two tries to get the data into the session.  If you always know you have to do two inserts then that is probably what I would do, of course I do not have access to source code.<br />
