<br />
In this DLL insert function does not exists, and I don't know if I have to insert the fields in the same order and using the corresponding zooms, to other sessions,  simulate the original session.<br />
<br />
The  function &lt;DLL&gt;.handle.sub.process(......), How can I use?.<br />
<br />
<br />
:confused: <br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Here is one (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=696&amp;highlight=receipts) . Maybe Srinivas will stop by and enlighten us to his solution.  In my part of the post it was just a simple create a receipt.  I have a feeling I will soon be developing a complete FS for this session and a couple of others.<br />

I have not worked on that session, but the general rule in AFS is to perform the actions how you would in the regular session.  So, yes, you must use the change view and zooming options to get the record in using this session.<br />
<br />
The function handle.sub.process...  is to register subsessions with the AFS, and tell it what mode to use when it encounters a zoom to that session.  Read the afs manual about the modes (Search for 'afs.doc' on these boards to get a recent manual).<br />
<br />
The handle.sub.process just registers the session, it does not call it.  You must issue the handle.sub.process command while the parent process is active, and before the logic encounters a zoom to the subsession.<br />
<br />
Hope something in there helps.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />
