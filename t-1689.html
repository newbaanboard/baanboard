I have  a situation where two process send and receive messages  using send.bucket() and receive.bucket() in Function Server.In one situation  Process-2 which send a message to process -1 died  ( not sure why it called ddc.end()) and the  process-1 ,received the message and sends a message back to process -2  and it waits for receving a message,where as it never cames back since process-2 is dead already and the Function Server hangs. send.bucket() method doesnt return any value to check the status of the process .How to overcome this situation?<br />
regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th April 2002, 01:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what you are trying to code, but I think you are talking about the standard messages going to the Baan ddc server.<br />
This is the middleware portion of ddc coding.  If the middleware sends a message (send.bucket) to the ddc server and never receives a reply, it is supposed to resend.  The Baan middleware specs. require a resend after a user defined TIME OUT value has passed.  It should resend MAX RETRIES times, waiting the Time Out value in between each retry.  If no value is recieved after the last retry, a message is to be returned to the user saying the function server timed out.<br />
<br />
That has to be coded in the middleware.   If Baan does not return a message, that's what it wants to happen.  <br />
<br />
In this scenario, Baan code does the receive.bucket, middleware (your) code does the send.bucket.  If you are programming the send.bucket and receive.bucket yourself...I am not sure what you are doing.   The choice is yours really.  If no response is recieved, either retry after a specific period of time, or abort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to know if we can use bucket messages between two different applications ? <br />
<br />
Infact I will explain what I am doing, I have created an application in visual basic which is used to capture the start time and end time of operations in a production orders based on the bar-coded route sheets generated from ERP LN. <br />
<br />
Now through the front end of Visual basic I store / update the information of start time of operation, end time of operation and the number of quantities completed in a temporary table of ERP LN database. <br />
<br />
Now these values i need to update in the production order quantity completed, operation start time and end time, and this i want to do it via AFS, but i am not sure if I can access AFS functions in Visual Basic through some reference DLL that i can include. While going through baan board i found information of inter-process communication, and came across your post, please advice if this my scenario can be met by send.bucket and receive.bucket functions or any other way to execute AFS functions through visual basic...<br />
<br />
Would appreciate some guidance on this please...</div></div><hr />

I did it once in excel and I assume the same could be done in a VB application.  Let me see if I can find some of the posts - there was one user who had a VB front end.</div></div><hr />
