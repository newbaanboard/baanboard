<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iain Fordyce</div><div class="date">19th March 2015, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to set up a Purchase Order Approval workflow in ION but I'm being told that this isn't possible as there's no 'pending' status - i.e. a PO can either be created or approved, there's no step in between the two where the document can be sent out to ION. <br />
<br />
Is this true and does anyone have any solutions to this? All I want is to be able to set approval rules outside of LN and route them back in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Till the mid of last year, there was no standard way for this. They told that they will be bringing this in their later version called Jira. Not sure if they have introduced it or not. Workaround is  - Customizing BOD's. <br />
<br />
Moving the thread to ION Forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">20th March 2015, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Iain, In LN 10.4 this is supported. See KB 1026816. There you can find the LN - ION content guide. There the procedure is described how to do the setup for Document Authorization (chapter 2) and the supported documents are described (ch 5). This will give you the pending status.<br />
<br />
hi Bhushan, Jira is not a version. It is an issue tracking system, just google on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">20th March 2015, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Adriaan, didn't knew that. Just remembered from my past about a mention of ION Jira and thought it was a version as they mentioned it.<br />
<br />
There was a reply from them - &quot;Enhancement Jira ION-349&quot; is pending and I assumed it to be their next ION version. Haven't been working on ION lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iain Fordyce</div><div class="date">20th March 2015, 10:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks - we're on 10.3 so that's disappointing. <br />
<br />
Would it possible in theory to use the approval capability that is in LN and connect ION so that it sends notifications when users have a Purchase Order to approve? <br />
<br />
I recognise that this isn't using the workflow capability but it seems like a potential workaround to me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">20th March 2015, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">So for 10.3 there is no nice solution. You could however introduce a munal first step in the PO procedure. So at moment of approval IOn can create a task. This is a review task of the PO and if the approver is ok then he should executed this manual step. Then the real PO process can continue. Not elegant but maybe just sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hpruim</div><div class="date">12th June 2015, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ian,<br />
<br />
I create an purchase order approval cycle with a manual order step. Once the order hits the status 'To be approved' I send out an e-mail using the ERP Add on FormDesigner. In the ERP system I created tables to be able to setup which people need to approve the order (Bill of Approvers). All of them get an email and have to do the actual approval in ERP itself. Once everybody approved the order can move forward in the order procedure.<br />
If you are interested, please contact me.<br />

We have customers on 10.3 and solved it using ION and manual activities.<br />
