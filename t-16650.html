<br />
We are in process of implementing Cash Flow application using AFS. While doing this we are facing problem with tfgld1101m000 session.<br />
<br />
It works fine while creating new batch and cash receipt transactions. But if I use api.delete call to delete cash receipt transactions then it the behaviour is bit different<br />
1. For the 1st record it goes to tfgld1101m000 and then after finding and marking specific batch it goes to tfcmg2100s000 sessions and delete the receipts transaction.<br />
2. For the 2nd record above flow work perfect but then it starts tfgld1106m000 session in background and the control doesn't come back to my program.<br />
<br />
Actually we have 2 baan instances, in one of the instance ottstpapihand is latest and in another it's old. Surprisingly it works fine with old instance. <br />
<br />
Any clue why it's not working with latest object.<br />
<br />

There could be a variety of reasons it does not work with the new objects - newer session objects needed, bad library included in the patch, etc.  The last time this happened they gave our admin a new patch to install.<br />

We are looking at doing this very soon and I'm looking for some examples so I don't have to reinvent the wheel.  I have written a custom session to post lockbox transactions through EBS but I don't think I want to go that way.  Any info would be great!  Thanks!<br />
