I am using standard purchase order approval work flow through &quot;object configuration management&quot; but somehow workflow is not getting completed. I am using demo image, provided by Infor. Workflow status is &quot;Approval Received&quot; in &quot;Checked out object&quot;, when I am trying to check in this object manually, I am getting following error:<br />
<br />
1. Fatal Error - Function &quot;handle.dependent.objects&quot;, recursion not possible; refcount =2<br />
2. Fatal error - Can not continue in ttocm9599m000 in dll 0tdpur400 (Handle.dependent.objects)[last.function:get.var]<br />
3. ttocm9599m000: A not terminated transaction is aborted (Handle.dependent.objects) in otdpur400<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you have any clue about this error and may help me in the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!!<br />

Thanks,<br />

Check with Infor if you are missing any standard solution. If its 10.4 there is an open KB#1686716 for this issue.<br />

<br />
I have recently started exploring ION/Mingl.e integration with LN. I have been able to make the work flow working, events and document flowing. I have following few doubts:<br />
<br />
1. Is there standard ION functionality through which we can upload sales order through an excel file? I mean with no customization at all.<br />
2. Where is the setting through which work flow response is linked with &quot;approved&quot; or rejected in LN? I mean we can give any value to the button in work flow so how does ION/LN knows which value means approved or rejected?<br />
3. Can you please name few advance thing which we can do with ION-LN integration? Once I have the name I will try to setup on my own at my end.<br />
<br />
Basically I want to explore different capabilities of ION-Mingl.e-LN integration so any input on that line will really be helpful!!<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your guidance!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">28th September 2016, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">@1 the file connector can be used in combination with ION mapper functionality to create the ProcessSalesOrder BOD towards LN.<br />
@2 These values are hardcoded at LN side. So changing the return values in ION will break the integration.<br />
@3 The workflow can be fine-tuned such that low dollar amount orders are approved automatically.  you can do amount level based approval.</div></div><hr />
