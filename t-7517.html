Ive experimented with these (although not extensively) and did not notice any improvement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as i know not all baan sessions can be improved using boosters. You can find in documentation that only the list if sessions can be affected. We use boosters for MRP sessions - increasing f.e. 'number of servers' parameter and so on. The result is quite visible -the OS (Unix) gives as much resources it can (look system activity reporter - sar) and the planning is highly improved at high speed. The other side is increasing  'number of servers' parameter means invoking additional baan licences. So it is as if severAL USERS perform one task simultaneously and  parallelly. <br />
<br />
Trying to add other sessions to the list (which baan itself doesn't use with boosters) leads that it simply ignores it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm using perf. booster for several sessions. For example: generating orders (tipgc5201m00b). In the past the session took about 14 hours, but now about 8 hours. <br />
(I run the session with 3 (three) number of servers.)<br />
The info i got from a BAAN employee is: It does take effect, if you have more processors on the server. We have a server with 4 processors. I use 3, because at the same time another batchjob is running.<br />
Untill now i have no experience with table-boosters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course, you can improve smth. if you have resources. We have 8 CPUs and it is a chance to have visible optimization. Certainly when it is only one CPU the bousters are no good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info.  We have only two cpu's so i can why the boosters never really helped much but at least I understand how they work now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">7th November 2002, 08:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The multiple bshells when enabled will generally give a significant boost to the the performance of selected batch jobs.  But, you need the CPU resources to take advantage of these.<br />
<br />
With the table boosters, level one datab ase drivers get a good performance increase.  Level two drivers are less impacted by the table boosters and one of my clients has even reported worse performance with table boosters enabled.  <br />
<br />
Display performance boosters will make virtually no difference unless you are running batch jobs over a high latency WAN.<br />
<br />
Here are some graphs that show the impact of running multiple bshells... (see attachment)<br />

<br />
I use perf. boosters (number of servers) in a batchjob only. <br />
A file with a password is not needed.<br />
The batchjob is activated by the crontab of bsp.<br />

<br />
<br />
Do you use performance boosters on session tibom1213m000<br />
IF so could advise the details and the benefits you have gained ?<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are running B40B_c4_and0.<br />
The ext. &quot;and0&quot; (= Aerospace and Defence) has the session tibom1213m10b. (Update Low Level Codes and Detect Loops)<br />
This session is visible in tcmcs0197m000 to use 'number of servers'.<br />
If your session is NOT visible in the tcmcs0197m000, then the program script of your session is not programmed to make use of performance boosters.<br />

<br />
You were right we could not use tableboosters nor wer we able to get them form Baan for our version<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Baan are still trying to assist us reduce the time taken for this session</div></div><hr />
