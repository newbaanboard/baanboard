<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">montanac</div><div class="date">17th May 2006, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
we are using Baan IV c4, with the latest version of tools and porting set.<br />
<br />
We are using Crystal Report Enterprise Edition 9.<br />
<br />
We are moving Baan IV c4 to SLES Linux 9 and we would like to use Business Object XI relase 2 for Linux (which is available) connected with it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Business Object didn't released the Baan Connection Kit for it, but since a generic XML data source is available for BOI XI rel 2, we would like to use it to read and process the XML files that the Baan report<br />
can produce.<br />
<br />
This &quot;generic&quot; XML connector of BOI XI rel 2 needs to have a valid XSD file which describe the XML schema &quot;in conjunction&quot; with the XML file.<br />
<br />
Since I believe that LN is already able to produce this XSD file, is there a way to get this XSD file from Baan IV c4, maybe using an &quot;external&quot; component?<br />
<br />
<br />
Many Thanks in advance.<br />
Claudio Montanari</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is a Baan Integration Kit (Baan Driver) available for BO-XI. This should also work under XI Relaease 2. As I understand it in Release 2 there was only a move away from M$ to Open source (MSDE to MySql and from IIS to Tomcat).</div></div><hr />
