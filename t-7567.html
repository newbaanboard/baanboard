<br />
The Crystal Enterprise Solution kit for Baan (CES) installs fine, except it fails to create the Baan Admin, Viewer, and default Baan user accounts in Enterprise.<br />
<br />
The native Baan driver for Crystal reports works fine.<br />
<br />
We're using BaanIVc4.</div></div><hr />

You forgot to mention that the CES version is 2.0.<br />
<br />
Welcome to baanboard buddy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">8th November 2002, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks :-)<br />
<br />
I decided not to post the specific version, in the hopes that somebody would say they got the hands on CES version 2.5, or got CES 2.0 to work somehow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">poomens</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mean that CES 2.0 doesn't work at all? With any Baan version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">CES will work with CR8.0 and lower (according to Crystal support).  The Baan version isn't the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">poomens</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">But not with CR8.5? I had it working partially, i.e. it worked, except for printing directly to a printer (quite important however). <br />
<br />
But now I get this error message<br />
<br />
Sending report to Reporting Environment via device &lt;...&gt; failed.For details ....<br />
<br />
I got it before but I'm not sure how to solve it. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We've all but given up on CR8.5 and are moving to CR8.0 until CES2.5 is ready.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">CES 2.5 won't be out until the end of the year at least. Another important thing to know is that CES 2.5 won't be compatible with CE9.0. That means that you can't upgrade to CE9/CES2.5/CR9 in 3 months. Since the API/SDK for Crystal Enterprise releases isn't finalized until it's out the door, it takes a while for CES to play catch up.<br />
<br />
I've purged CE8.5 from our server and I'm installing CE8.0. The Integrated Reporting actually works, but CE8.0 is extremly buggy. All sorts of javascript errors, pageserver/cacheserver errors, etc.<br />
<br />
The problem I had with CES2.0/CE8.5, is that CES would not install correctly. It did not set up the BaanAdmin and BaanViewer accounts in CE and didn't set up the default baan passwords. This meant that when you print from Baan, an error will appear in the IBR logs and the baan device logs about a bad or corrupt username/password.<br />
<br />
I've no idea why printing to CE would would work, but not directly through CE to a printer. Perhaps give Crystal or Baan support a call. About the error your getting... if you check ttaad3520m000 (I think) it should give you the full error message.  Also, see if the XML file is making is getting uploaded to the Crystal server.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps... if it sounds incoherent, that's because I haven't had coffee yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering if anything has changed the status of the &quot;collective&quot; status of the postings on this thread to date ?<br />
<br />
Reason for asking is that I am being asked to look to upgrade to<br />
CE9 as a &quot;report bug&quot; is supposedly fixed in this version</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing has changed. I met with a Crystal salesman and the ERP (Baan/Sap/etc) business developer at Crystal. It will be a month or two for CE9 to be released, and then another month or two for an updated version of CES that will support CE9 and CR9. I have a faint hope that they will use my client for some pre-release testing, but will have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
I suggest to give Crystal Care a call to get their thoughts on an upgrade timelime.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the Baan driver (included in CES 2.0) will work with CE9, but considering the current track record of interoperability, I don't really expect that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks for the update Wim<br />
<br />
Are you still at CE8 or 8.5 and am I to assume you are using CES2.0 and not CES2.5 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using CE8.5 with CES 2.0. CES2.5 is not available. I briefly switched to CE8.0, but found it lacking the features, better looks, and cohesiveness of CE8.5.<br />
<br />
This means we can't use Integrated Baan Reporting (IBR) via the Baan XML print device. However, we are still writing all sorts of Baan reports via the Baan native driver for Crystal Reports.<br />
<br />
There is a way of adding code to a session, so that if a button is pressed it will load up iexplore with the respective report in CE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jdboer</div><div class="date">14th December 2002, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We had the same. Bought CE in june 2002. After installation we heard that the XML push for BAAN is not available for CE 8.5 and that it will be released &quot;soon&quot;. Nobody gives a date for this release yet!!!! They told me that it will be released begin 2003!!<br />
<br />
I think that it's not good to sell products that are not finished (but this is often the case with software i guess).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">13th January 2003, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">A further questiion<br />
<br />
What version of the desktop do tou run and have you found it &quot;influences&quot; &quot;results&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">13th January 2003, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently CES 2.5 was finished a week ago. After talking with our sales contact at Crystal, we're told that we should get it today by download. Otherwise we'd have to wait a month for them to print out the PDFs and deliver a shiny shrink-wrapped version.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will finally do what they promised us 2-3 months ago, with a minimum of installation pain.<br />
<br />
Frank: What &quot;desktop&quot; are you talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">15th January 2003, 22:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I'd let ya'll know...<br />
<br />
We received CES 2.5 (by download) yesterday. Install was painless. It's definetly a sweet system now: it is very easy to apply common templates to any stock Baan report... For example, adding a logo to the header, page numbers/print date to the footer, etc. It's also very easy to change the layout, fonts, grouping, filtering, sorting, etc of the information contained within the Baan report layout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hzttker</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">download?could we download CES2.5? from somewhere or we have to order this product?<br />
I want to use CE8.5/CE2.5 to replace CE8/CES2.0 if CE8.5 works well with CES2.5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 11:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Give your sales contact at Crystal a call... I believe all upgrades are free.<br />
<br />
Once it was released they shipped us a shrink-wrapped copy, but messed up and sent the old CES2.0 version... so they set us up with a download.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hzttker</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 11:15</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks,Wim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AnnaMaria</div><div class="date">22nd February 2003, 00:05</div></div><div class="posttext">What version of Baan are you on?  Must be on IVc4 of higher for everything to work 100%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">22nd February 2003, 00:56</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on Baan IVc4, with the latest porting set.<br />
<br />
Currently we're playing tag with the Crystal and Baan support teams, to resolve issues in the XML that Baan generates, and issues in the CE parser that parses it. :-(<br />
<br />
Also, note that CES will not work with Crystal Enterprise 9.0 or Crystal Reports 9.0 for at least 3 months... unless maybe more people put pressure on them...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">24th February 2003, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the update Wim<br />
<br />
We are hoping to set up a &quot;test&quot; version of CE 8.5 with CBS of 2.5<br />
<br />
Incidentally do you get your support for Crystal through Baan or direct from Crystal themselves ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">24th February 2003, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Official support is through Crystal. They are in regular communication with the &quot;Crystal team at Baan&quot; though. In our case, I still find myself dealing with the Baan people directly as well, to get fixes/solutions for Baan itself...</div></div><hr />

So maybe put some pressure on your sales contact at Crystal....</div></div><hr />
