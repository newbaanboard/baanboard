<br />
I wonder if someone could provide me info or point me in the right direction with this:<br />
<br />
We have our schedules (MPS plan) constantly changing because of market conditions / shipment delays from suppliers / line downtime, etc. Due to this the planners / buyers are under constant pressure to figure out what can be build and what we cannot. For instance if there is product X that cannot be build tomorrow as per schedule, then we need to be able to answer what other products can be pulled in from a future build for which we have adequate capacity and materials (materials is more critical for us). So some software which will go through the schedule and recommend changes to it based on capacities and most importantly on materials (possibly based on scheduled PO receipts). <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Beware though, the latter isn't cheap.<br />
