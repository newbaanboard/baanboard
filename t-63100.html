DO NOT go to any other tab - STAY on Tab-1, now click export. Even if sufficient fields are populated as a result of &quot;Get User Defaults&quot; - the &quot;Export&quot; button will automatically go to Tab-2 (provided you have not been there yet). Select &quot;Export&quot; once again and you go to Tab-3. Now &quot;Export&quot; will finally work and export the components. Is this to prevent this session from being remote controlled by AFS? So far, it is successful in blocking me from using AFS to perform any exports. Anyone have a solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">14th November 2012, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Make your AFS visit the forms by writing a blank into one of the 'from' fields on each form after #1.   This should indicate that you visited the forms to the session and it should launch without any delays.<br />
<br />
You have to set the checkboxes since the string fields are not available for edit unless the checkbox is filled.  When using API, I don't depend on defaults since they may vary by user.  I would probably set each checkbox that I would include in exports thru API - this also fills the need for visiting the other forms.<br />

<br />
I tried various options with this session (On Baan V environment), even at a point entered value for all fields available but no use. I would love to see someone cracking it.<br />
<br />
I eventually settled for what I felt is the second best option available. I would use code to set the values as default and then run the session in normal mode and export. <br />
<br />
please do share your code if you are able to crack it.<br />
