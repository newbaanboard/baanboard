	I need to print the purchase order acknowledgment from one company and the corresponding sales order acknowledgment from a different company. Should be easy with AFS right? Thats what I thought but when I actually wrote the code and trying to test it now, the thing does not work.<br />
	<br />
	I have a swith.to.company(200) before I print the PO acknowledgment and a swith.to.company(100) before I print the SO acknowledgment. The problem is that the second call to switch the company to 100 does not actually the change the current company to 100 and because this there is no SO acknowledgment printed. I tried to print SO acknowledgment first and then the PO acknowledgment but it really does not make any difference.<br />
<br />
	Does anyone experienced this before? Is there know issue with switching companies and AFS?<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

It should help.  Also maybe what lisa recommended would work - spawning a new process for each company.  Anyway read the thread and use switch.to.company for this forum in the search features.</div></div><hr />
