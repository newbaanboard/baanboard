<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">16th February 2012, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We have about 20 companies within 1 group company.  So I'm taking the largest of companies (303) and trying to set up an archive company (903).<br />
<br />
Worked through the users guide provided by Infor and set up as best as i thought.  <br />
<br />
So now I try to run the archive fully paid purchase invoices... I get an error message that says:<br />
Archive company setup incorrect.  Not all companies in group have different archive companies.<br />
<br />
Not sure exactly what this means, but i only set up one archive company.  Should I have set up an archive company for every operational company before running this session?  Would like to think I don't have to do that part.<br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
You can explain why you dont want to have archieve company for each comp in the group.</div></div><hr />
