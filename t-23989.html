<br />
We like to introduce the CRP  Central Resource Planning solution. This Solution integrates the resource scheduling system Open Plan with several modules of SSA / Baan.<br />
<br />
This solution is created to provide a centralized planning solution for TP Project, PCS  Project and SFC Manufacturing driven processes. The main objective is it to provide companies with solid planning data for the financial control of Projects and large Manufacturing orders. Project margins and cash flow can be obtained based on dynamic data coming from Open Plan combined with static budget and cost data in Baan.<br />
<br />
Baan Project and Manufacturing orders can be linked in a Planning Network using resources from OPP and Baan to schedule everything within their availability parameters.<br />
<br />
Supported by the Multi  Project Capability of Open Plan, it is possible to link active Projects and Orders with planned Orders to verify the future Resource Availability.  <br />
<br />
The solution is created by S&amp;T Services and Solution / Slovenia and PMS- Project Consulting / Germany.  The solution was created in cooperation with Skoda Transportation, Plzen, Czech Republic.<br />
<br />
The Resource Scheduling Software Open Plan is created by Welcom Software Technology International USA, the leading Manufacturer of Project Management Solutions.<br />
<br />
Detailed description of the CRP  solution being available. We hope that you will find this solution interesting. If you have any queries please do not hesitate to let us know.<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
<br />

<br />
I have two questions about  Central Resource Planning solution (CRP).<br />
- What versions BaanERP are supported with CRP? <br />
- Earlier was WELCOM own interface between OpenPlan and BaanERP IV &amp; 5. You use it, or CRP is fully new development?<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Vladimir</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the short answer to your questions.<br />
- Supported is BaanERP version 5.0c only. <br />
- CRP is a newly developed application with some enhanced functionality. <br />
<br />
Regards, Martin</div></div><hr />

<br />
as Martin has stated: the CRP Interface is a new solution, since the privious Baan - Welcom interface is not supported any longer by Baan and Welcom. <br />
<br />
Besides this, our approach in this interface is very different from the old one. The basic idea is similar to the first one, made for ABB / Boeing several years ago. But the link does not only connect Baan project with Open Plan, but also PCS - orders and now procurment positions as well. Furthermore, it also works with OPD (Open Plan Desktop), not only with OPP Open Plan Professional) from Welcom.<br />
<br />
Then, for this interface clients have contracts and manitenance and we add new functions required by users in order to improve the exchange of data, costs covered by manitenance contracts<br />
<br />
This interface works based upon Baan Functions, it does not need Open World Licences. Its installed in about an hour. On the Open Plan side, we use also standard import / export functions, just to keep everything as simple as possible. <br />
<br />
If you need to know more, ask Martin or me for details.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Ulrich :) <br />

<br />
Are you have plans to supporte ERP LN 6.1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kopson</div><div class="date">22nd September 2005, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
<br />
Yes, we have made plans to develop SSAERPLN6.1 version too. There is not much difference between BaanERP version 5 and SSAERP version 6.1 concerning this interface. <br />
