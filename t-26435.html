<br />
We are in Animal Feed Manufacturing industry.  We are in the process of making interface between our Production Control System and BaaN IVc4 Shop Floor Control Module.<br />
<br />
The output from Production Control System consists of quantities produced for finished products and quantities consumed for raw materials. Currently the data is entered manually in the SFC module.  <br />
<br />
We do following steps:<br />
1. Maintain Production Orders (Release from the same session)<br />
2.  Report Operations Completed (By completing the last operation)<br />
3.  Report Production Orders Completed<br />
4.  Maintain and Release Inbound data<br />
5.  Enter Material Issue for Production Orders (Correct for actual quantities)<br />
6.  Generate and Release Outbound Data<br />
7.  Backflush Hours<br />
8.  Close Production Orders<br />
<br />
We are exploring the options for the interface development.  I understand that by using Function Server, we can develop the interface without writing much code.  I am going through the help of DDC module and trying to understand.<br />
<br />
I appreciate if any one can give the sequence of steps to follow in interface development based on the above conditions.  Any exercises for using DDC/function services are also helpful. I appreciate any suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance,<br />

<br />
But this will include alot of DLL's to be taken care. it will call all the information internally.<br />
<br />
I have done it but i can't post the code for the same as i done it in breakups.<br />
I will recommend you to just start it in Break ups. Start with Creating Production orders, Releasing It in First Stage.<br />
<br />
In Second Stage, start report completion . Generate inbound &amp; Relaese Inbound against that order.<br />
<br />
In third stage , do enter material issue/ backflash material and close production order.</div></div><hr />
