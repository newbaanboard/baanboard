<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dwgeis</div><div class="date">3rd February 2006, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to find a financial and operations reporting package that can query Baan and a number of other applications (FAS, payroll software), can manipulate the data (+-X/), and that doesn't need a programmer to make new reports or change existing ones (the finance guys can do it).  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">14th February 2006, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Try Crystal Reports from Business Objects. You can use it to report off of multiple data sources. They include connectivity to data sources like Oracle, MSSQL, Sybase, DB2, Informix, Access, Excel, and many others. They also have a Baan interface you can get too. We have had it for over six years and have done several multi-data source reports. We have several finance people currently creating and updating financial reports. Users such as Finance people can create and maintain these reports, but there is some training that you'll have to invest in for them and you may need to occasionally help them. However that would be the case for any tool. <br />
