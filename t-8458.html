<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mschiffe</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We are a university institution that benchmarks ERP systems against each other. Currently we want to compare some functions in Baan ERP with SAP R/3.<br />
<br />
We have just set up Baan ERP 5.0c. <br />
<br />
When we tried to implement a simple manufacturing process in Baan we had to take notice of the fact the demo-company 902 is a rather an uncompleted company (training purposes; but NOT ready-to-go). <br />
<br />
What I am still looking for is something like a &quot;ready-to-go company&quot; to set up some typical business processes. <br />
<br />
In the first approach we do not want to configure that much but focus on to get a general overview of the functionalities of Baan ERP without getting to much into the configuration work (e.g. set up a new compony on our own).<br />
<br />
SAP provides IDES as a basic demonstration system, so: the question comes up whether Baan has something like that too.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; Question: Does somebody know something about such a demo system? Is there a COMPLETE and ready-to-run demo company available somewhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any tips in advance!<br />
<br />

Try contacting Baan Mexico</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wgarcia</div><div class="date">23rd March 2005, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Exists an installation pre loaded called iBaan Start, this it was developed by Baan mexico. However it is an installation basic, pre-configured of parameters that doesn't possess localization in particular for any country. This is important depending on the fiscal necessities of country where you want to present the product.<br />
<br />
   The time to implementation is aprox 3 months.<br />
<br />
   Try the contact with Baan Mexico for a Demo.<br />
