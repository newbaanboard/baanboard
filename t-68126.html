<br />
So, this utility is based on Java but is easily integrated with Baan/LN.<br />
<br />
Basic Working <br />
<br />
1. A jar file is placed on the server<br />
2. CSV file is created using Baan/LN tools functions<br />
3. Jar file is called with parameter as CSV file name<br />
4. That's it!<br />
<br />
I have attached 2 versions of JAR file with this post. One can use whichever required, based on the requirements.<br />
<br />
Version 1: (BarGraphGenerator1.jar)<br />
The Bar-Graph is displayed in a window. (Check-Snapshot1.jpeg)<br />
<br />
Version 2: (BarGraphGenerator2.jar)<br />
The Bar-Graph can be placed in a PDF file or can be displayed in a window depending upon an additional parameter (Check-my_graph.pdf)<br />
<br />
Usage<br />
<br />
The scripts will explain it pretty well!<br />
<br />
Minimum Requirements<br />
<br />
Java Version<br />
Java Version 6 Update 6 or higher.<br />
Baan/LN Version<br />
Should work on any versions of Baan/LN with right functions <br />
i.e. app_start(worktop)/start.application.local(webtop)/client.download.file(HTML UI) <br />
<br />
Example<br />
I am generating a CSV with 10 items from whinr100 table with inventory on hand less than 1000 in descending order. The Item Code is 1st column and is considered as X-Axis. On hand is 2nd column and is considered as Y-Axis.<br />
<br />
Note that, the separator should be a comma(,). You can modify the jar in case you want another separator or you can even make it a parameter.<br />
<br />
All the files are attached as zip. The java source is attached as well.<br />
Any questions, changes, modifications, advancements, improvements are welcomed.<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />
