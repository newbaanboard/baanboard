<br />
Good day .. <br />
<br />
I'm studying the possibility to customize stock movement report using CR 2013 . <br />
Our company using Baan LN FP7 with multisite setup . We separate company for Finance &amp; Logistic. <br />
The objective is to have stock movement report consist the quantity and amount / value . <br />
I have tried few ways using CR 2013 , but failed. <br />
This is because I still need knowledge . <br />
Those kind hearted , can you share idea on how to do this ? <br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

In fp7 you have 3 options, both are creating external data in XML structure. One is to use create &quot;IAR&quot; file in BSE tmp folder, you can open it in CR and filter/change data as you wish. this data file, once created, should be opened manually in CR<br />
Other option is that you implement Microsoft SRSS interface SAOP interface and &quot;route&quot; calls to CR.<br />
third option is I think very old. On extreme portal, you can find some DLLs that were implemented as connectors to CR. AFAIK they are not supported anymore, maybe they still work for your version.</div></div><hr />
