<br />
I've been reading about using AFS with session tdpur4120m000 and its child tdpur4131s000. I NEED to group several PO lines in one receipt (under the same reno/dino). I managed to finish successfully with just ONE PO line by receipt, but I'm not able to select (mark) several lines in tdpur4131s000.<br />
<br />
I've also been trying to select just one line in tdpur4131s000, get back to main tdpur4120m000 and change its dqua, bqua, etc.. (success) THEN zoom again to tdpur4131s000 and try to select another line. This is where I'm getting crazy, because it doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what your index is but in our system you have to specify the supplier, date, order and line number to get the correct value. That is why you're doing the select, right?<br />
So I would suggest you call:<br />
<br />
<br />
retcode = stpapi.find(&quot;tdpur4131s000&quot;)<br />
 <br />
<br />
After you fill (put.field) orno,suno,ddtb and pono you then call stpapi.find. Actually in your code you're putting ddtb,pono &amp; orno and immediately after getting the same fields :confused: <br />
<br />
Also in our system, if you're in tdpur4120m000 and do a change.view it will always jump to the subsession. Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

I''ve tried so many ways, that I can't remember them, but I'll try your way.<br />
<br />
Tell you the results.<br />
