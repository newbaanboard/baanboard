<br />
I created an AFS for Sales Order and it is creating Sales orders But the problem is that it is not considering localisation while calculating Net Rate &amp; Line Amount. It is simply calculating Line Amount as  -  Qty &amp; Base Price.<br />
<br />
Well, While working on AFS , it was not inserting quantity and was creating order with 0 quantity. But some how after putting update, it started updating Quantity and i also got the base price updated by some work arround. But now it is not adding Sales Tax / Excise / VAT or Service taxes Amount in Line Amount.<br />
<br />
Is there any way after creation of line, i can get the Line Amount &amp; net Rate recalculated to remove the problem.<br />
<br />
pls help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veyant</div><div class="date">16th July 2004, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I supplied data thru AFS to following sessions sequentially<br />
<br />
1 . tdsls4101m000 - Sales Order Header ----------- successfully created header<br />
2.  tdind0270s000 - Extension to Sales Order Header ------ success<br />
<br />
3. then called tdsls4105s000  - Maintain Sales Order Lines [ Wholesale]<br />
--- on stpapi.insert -  it created lines with 0 quantity. So i again passed quantity by using<br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdsls4105s000&quot;,&quot;tdsls041.oqua&quot;,value) followed by <br />
stpapi.update<br />
now it updated the quantity. But it still doesn't picked up price. so i picked up price from tdsls030 and then updated theu SQL to following tables - tdsls041,tdind017,tdsls051,tdind203<br />
<br />
Now i called tdind0271s000 - Extension to Sales Lines --- Passed values.<br />
<br />
Now i called session tdsls4810m000 - recalculate discount &amp; prices.<br />
<br />
Now if i go to New generated sales order and see the line it shows, qty , price correctly. But the Net rate  = basic price &amp; Line Amount = qty * basic price.<br />
<br />
actually it has not calculated Net Rate by considering sales Tax/ or Other Taxes. If i tab on price and go to tdind0271s000 manually and then just click ok or cancel to come out of session it calculates the Net.Rate correctly.<br />
<br />
But i want this thing to be done thru AFS not thru manually go to each line.<br />
<br />
pls advice.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
