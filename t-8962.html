<br />
This environment does not have the AFS libraries.<br />
We do not have the source code.<br />
It is the ba version of Baan.<br />
There is no remote bshell possible.<br />
The BSE is on Unix.<br />
<br />
We feel Screen Scrapper could be one of the ways to do it, but do not know if there is a product in the market for Baan ?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th February 2003, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Products like RMCgen, QKEY and the freeware on these boards (search for 'rush') fit this description.  These tools do not require source code.  They provide a wrapper around the source code where you can add to or remove the standard sections.  You cannot change standard logic.  This can be used similar to a screen scraper.  In fact we have used this product to replace the screen scrapers and include logic in these automations.  Our tool also provides the ability to make a session wrapper or create a library out of the session.  This does not use AFS functionallity and was developed specifically for versions not supported by AFS.<br />
<br />
I am not sure of the availability of RMCgen all version of Triton, are you running 31b2?  If you think it this is something that may match your requirements, let me know and I can research the version availability.   You can also research the other products.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What happens when the unexpected UI pops up? E.g. error messages, zoom sessions, questions etc?<br />
<br />
I am still in the process of looking at these programs, but in the meanwhile do you know how would the sequence of the (sections) execution be determined if I invoke this generated 3GL not by linking to the respective session but via another 3gl program?  Seems like I will have to determine the execution sequence myself by calling the respective extern functions accordingly. Right?<br />
<br />
My client is using 3.1b7 version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">21st February 2003, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">With RMCgen, you can create a 3GL script/library or a 4GL program script. If you choose the latter route, things will execute using the Baan's standard program.  If you go the 3GL route, then yes you would have to ensure that the appropriate code &quot;sections&quot; are called in the correct/desired order.  Much of this, however, is defaulted for you when you do the generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">djain999</div><div class="date">21st February 2003, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">What does RMCgen handle the errors messages, questions, sessions that are displayed via the internal logic of the session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">21st February 2003, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We have handling for messages and questions.  As you gain experience with the 3GL versions, you can learn how to get around zooms, etc.   I've asked djain to contact us direct with further technical questions - so we don't flood the board with posts on our product :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
