Also do you get an error on the insert or does it just not do anything? You might also want to search this forum I believe these sessions have been mentioned before.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

Herewith i am posting the latest script which inserts the sales order header.But in lines it hangs.After inserting the header,i am finding the particular record in sales order header. If it is successful then i am starting the  handle.subproc then zoom point.But in zoom point it hangs.The code is in VB Script and i am calling  Baan library in VB script.This is field by field updation.In zoompoint when the baan library is being called at that point it hangs.Should i have to put any patches...<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing from you....<br />

Thanks very much in advance.<br />

<br />
sometimes it would be necessary for complex business processes like sales orders that u may have to touch the source code, particularly if u have localization objects also in the picture.<br />
<br />
like u will have to check the before.zoom sections of UI code</div></div><hr />

what you have posted is the intermediate dll created using ttstpcreatdll session.<br />
can you post your vb code, where in you are calling the baan sessions? That would help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your prompt reply.<br />
<br />
First of all i am regret for the delay because i was away from the office for 2 days.<br />
<br />
Herewith i am sending the source code as an attachment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I have seen your code.<br />
From the main session tdsls4101m000, if you want to go to subsession tdsls4105s000, you should use<br />
stpapi.continue.process()<br />
<br />
In your code, you have just created the handle for the subsession but the command to start the subsession is missing. <br />
so add this line stpapi.continue.process() in your code after you do an insert or update.<br />
<br />
This will start the subsession.<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gentercz</div><div class="date">19th December 2002, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
i have the same problem with a baan script writing sls lines.<br />
<br />
here are some details:<br />
when inserting a line in a sls order, we use session tdsls4102s000.<br />
inserting a stock-controlled item is NOT working when there is not enough stock.<br />
<br />
This is what happens in the baan standard program, called via afs.<br />
<br />
it goes to function &quot;handle.stock.shortage(...)&quot; then loops in a repeat...until loop.<br />
beacause in that loop a zoom.menu is activated &quot;mtdsls000090461&quot;. here could (e.g.) choose &quot;No action&quot;, then the session would continue.<br />
as i am using afs i can not interact with this zoom.menu, thus my session loops forever. (variable choice.4801 never gets a correct value!)<br />
<br />
is there a way to default the action in the zoom.form by afs, so the session exits this loop.<br />
<br />
hope you got my problem, if needed i can post some code<br />
jochen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">19th December 2002, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,<br />
I have seen the same error when running the session using AFS.<br />
<br />
when we set some parameter somewhere(dont know where) this menu pops up in the sales order lines session(tdsls4102s000)<br />
<br />
and we need to give some values to this menu. if not a while loop keeps going on without ending.<br />
<br />
I had the source code. so I have added this line in the session script.<br />
<br />
<br />
if api.mode then<br />
        | code to give the  action, cancel in the menu.<br />
endif<br />
<br />
This has solved the problem for me.</div></div><hr />

so, is there no other way ???<br />

<br />
Thanks very much for your prompt reply.But if we change the source code then if some some patches are installed then all the previous code will be re-written to original source code.<br />
Do you have any other alternative.Right now i don't have source code with me.Could you please send one.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />

It varies upon service packs..</div></div><hr />
