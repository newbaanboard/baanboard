<br />
We have a old DDC midware working in our live Baan IVc4 environment. However, this is not supported anymore. We plan to replace it or customize it by our internal staff.<br />
<br />
Does someone have some development guide or conceptual documents related to it? Please share a copy for me. Thanks in advance.<br />

For me, actually the best solution is infor Barcode/ BridgeLogix.<br />
<br />
For information, i'm make several barcodeProject (With Epic Data, Specific, .....). And it's very difficult to make a DDC driver and DDC server.<br />

I would like to know how to develop the middleware. I think Baan should have a document to guide the partners to develop the middleware.<br />
<br />
As our current one is really old and no support any more, I want to know if we can find a way to replace it or take the support ourselves if we could.<br />
<br />
If anybody have such information, please forward it to me.<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />

Thanks, Guillaume. We will be going to replace our barcoding system with BridgeLogix in the next one or two years. <br />
<br />
What I am concerning about is another interface, which exchanges data with some machinary control software without barcoding inclued. It passes information such as inventory data, production batches/orders, lot information to a system (controlling machines); and feeds back with some data to write off the inventories, to report production tasks or orders completed.<br />
<br />
As this interface is not supported anymore, we can just hope it works. In case it fails, we can only manually input the information to Baan. That's why we try to replace it.<br />
<br />
Any ideas are welcome!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are interested please send me an email and I will be pleased to send you detail information.<br />
<br />
felipe@disus.com<br />
<br />
www disus com and look into Componets and Disus Transaction Adapter.<br />
<br />
Our driver could handle specifically the transaction that you are mentioning.<br />
