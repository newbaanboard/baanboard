<br />
Thanks for your link document. btw have your been hear about cyberquery from cyberscience?? thats BI tools like crystal report.<br />
Rita how about reporting in your company? and I wanted to ask moved in the field whether your company?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">28th June 2005, 05:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen Crystal but not implemented it (yet), it's good, i think it's basically the standard for baan customers (Like Safari used to be)<br />
<br />
with the native driver you can download Baan reports right into crystal and modify them (for crystal reporting) which is nice. and you can also see (elements of) the data model, etc from crystal as well so that's good too.<br />

<br />
My Company uses this technology for the clients. I have heard of Cyberquery but have never tried anything on it. <br />
<br />
Could you try Reporting Services ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ROLAND</div><div class="date">5th July 2005, 04:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hallo rita,<br />
<br />
Yup,my company using reporting services but along a month we used this tools. Do you have a friend had tried cyberquery ?<br />

<br />
Though I am not able to answer all your queries, I can tell you that my company uses Crystal reports Professional V9.0 to link to Baan using Native drivers via ODBC. This is verty easy and does produce very professional reports. I don't know whether you ahave any experiance in using Crystal, but once the connection to the Baan database server is made, the rest is pretty simple.  It is quite possible to produce <br />
<br />
<br />
We have also used Safari previously. This too is not a bad choice. <br />
<br />
Your best bet is to talk to your local Baan rep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ROLAND</div><div class="date">10th July 2005, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hai ash,<br />

<br />
In the main, my company tends to develop native Baan reports using tools. This way all Baan users can have access to this facility. Since Crystal requires a licence for each client, this can get expensive.<br />
We tend to use Crystal mainly for central reporting, &quot;nice&quot; external documentation and ad-hoc reports. As a techie,I tend to use Crystal to interrogate data when fault finding. Very easy and quick to change parameters, selections, sorts etc, since its all GUI based. <br />
<br />
If required can send you a sample of a few reports I have set up. Remember that we have Reger (5.2a) so the tables are much changed from 4c.<br />
<br />

Can you please post the sample on board. I would like to have look at it.</div></div><hr />
