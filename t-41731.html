<br />
We are trying to do archiving. I follow the steps given in the document from infor BaaN documentation, but when i run any of the sessions for archiving i get an error 606.<br />
<br />
The event viewer says is between tccom010 y tcmcs010, apparently the session is trying to insert a Blank inthe country code in tccom010. But in the origin company there is no blank in that field...<br />
<br />
ideas? suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Hi David,<br />
<br />
If you mean with the session tfgld0103m000 (Mantain Company Parameters), the documentation says i have to clear all fields for FORMS 2 and 3... then initialize parameters with tcmcs0295m000</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you brief us about what data you are archiving? Any Sales Orders/Purchase Orders/Prod Orders?<br />
OR<br />
Are you setting up Archive company?<br />
<br />
Before starting the process, you have to set up parameter tables in archive company, other wise 606 (Reference) errors are bound to appear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">19th September 2007, 03:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Before an initial archive (after company setup), I set up and review the codes/parameters tables (tcmcs) in the archive companies based on the source company.  You can use bdbpre/bdbpost to do so.  Also ensure that your table sharing between the source and archive company (or companies) structure is identical.  Failure to do so may cause some reference errors.  Doesn't hurt to set up calendars and financial company info as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm setting up an archive company. i follow the steps in the attached manual (when copy data from the tables specified in page 2-16 i had to include tcmcr000 and tcmcr001 because i was getting an error when initializing parameters)</div></div><hr />

<br />
e.g. in your case, tcmcs010 is master and tccom010 is its child. A child table can have more than 1 master tables and you need to load all of them. You can find parent tables by refering the Data Dictionary...In your case other master tables are &quot;Titles tcmcs019&quot;, &quot;Languages tcmcs046&quot;, etc....<br />

what i'm doing is to run the session tcmcs4200m000 &quot;Archive general data&quot;... while processing it gives me an error message &quot;reference does not exist&quot;, the event viewer shows me that the value it can't find is a Â¿blank space? (see attached images)<br />
<br />
when i compare the values of the tccom010.ccty (real company) with the values in tcmcs010.ccty (archive company) i found that all values that should be copied to tccom010 (archive company) are already in tcmcs010 (archive company).<br />
<br />
PS: tables tcmcs019 and tcmcs046 in archive company already have values</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaukul</div><div class="date">29th September 2007, 06:12</div></div><div class="posttext">create a blank entry in table &quot;tcmcs010&quot; of archive company.<br />
after this, run the archive session.<br />
<br />
this might resolve the current error...<br />
<br />
(i think the problem is due to a blank &quot;Country&quot; field present in &quot;Customer Master&quot; of your Production company for one/more of the customers)<br />
<br />
do rever back with your results...</div></div><hr />

<br />
just for the record... <br />
<br />
we need to include the table tdcms018 to those that are copied from the real company (we already had added tcmcr000 and tcmcr001)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaukul</div><div class="date">26th October 2007, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">we need to include the table tdcms018 to those that are copied from the real company<br />
<br />
This table has a &quot;text&quot; field. So, if you want to access text in archive company, text tables will also have to archived.</div></div><hr />
