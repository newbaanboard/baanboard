<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">7th September 2002, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Many a times Baan developer comes across a question to print a report / process logic based <br />
on certain enum values only (which may not necessarily in from-to range). At this point of time <br />
developer has to say no to such request (At least in Baan IV) in the absence of clear guidelines<br />
on this.<br />
<br />
For such a request , if user follows following steps, he/she can accomplish the objective easily.<br />
<br />
1. write following function in 1 dll .<br />
function extern return.enum.booleans(long setval, ref domain tcbool enm())<br />
{<br />
long i<br />
	for i = 1 to 32 step 1<br />
		enm(i) = setval \ 2<br />
		setval = setval / 2<br />
	endfor<br />
}<br />
2. The enums for which specific values are desired , need to be copied as a 'set' to another domain<br />
with same enum options.  Set allows multiple selection.<br />
3. Convert to runtime.<br />
4. Forms on which specific enum values are desired , this new set field has to be included.<br />
5. In the program , call the funtion written in dll in before choice section of print.data or <br />
cont.process<br />
	return.enum.booleans(etol(setfield) , enm)<br />
6.In the main processing select after selectdo , you need to add following condition before other <br />
logic<br />
	if enm(etol(enmfield)) then<br />
		|....normal program logic<br />
	endif <br />
7.Also  Declare enm tcbool with 32 dimensions in the same program<br />
8.Include the dll in step 1 above before compiling the program.<br />
<br />
You have accomplished the desired objective.The only disadvantage could be it will select<br />
all records with all enum values . In some case it may lead delayed performance.<br />
<br />
Another disadvantage could be that maximum set options could be 32 only (I have not tested beyond 32 but I feel it will not work) whereas enums could be upto more than 32 upto 255 ( as in case of domains tctror,tcfitr etc)<br />
<br />
Same instructions are also contained in text file attached.</div></div><hr />
