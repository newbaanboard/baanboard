<br />
Currently I'm facing a problem with AFS and messages which are promted in the session. <br />
<br />
In this specific case I need to update the slack time in &quot;Maintain Production Planning ( tisfc1101m000 ). When an order is in production the session prompts a message &quot;Order already in production&quot;. I need to press OK to get rid of this message. <br />
How do I handle these messages in AFS?  Any ideas?  I'm working on Baan 4.<br />
<br />
Thanks:confused:</div></div><hr />

If it is a message the AFS should act just like OK was pressed and I typically do not even worry about them.  Sometimes I have to get the last message to do additional processing or testing, but usually I ignore information messages. Are you having a problem?  I tried updating the slack time on one where the first operation was completed, but did not get the message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. In this case we talk about a message and you were right about the interpretation of messages by AFS.<br />
The problem was caused by an incorrected variable in my program and not by the message. The program is running ok now.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
