changed the table def of tdpur046, tdpur046.cmba to No check on delete and update mode, <br />

Anybody has experience on this? Comments?thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what is the setting in the PUR Order Parameter? Delete 'By Order' or 'By Order Line'? How often do you run this session without deleting? Is it part of your daily jobs? How many records are in the tables tdpur045 and 041?<br />
What about running the session in two steps? First: Process order data. Second: delete processed orders.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your reply. I found out that we have lots of bad data last year. Some have the status Print Purchase Invoice instead of Deleting Line. In fact the program skipped the bad data.<br />
After confirming with my finance and purchasing guys that I can delete the bad data, I made changes to the records so Baan thinks that the record has been processed properly:<br />
<br />
  tdpur045.date = 729724<br />
  tdpur045.stsd = tcstsd.all.approved<br />
  tdpur045.stsc = tcstsc.updated      <br />
  tdpur045.spur = 9                   <br />
  tdpur045.pmsk = &quot;eeennnneennnnnnnnnnn&quot;<br />
  tdpur045.invn = 911                    <br />
  tdpur045.invd = 729724                 <br />
  tdpur045.bqua = 0   <br />
<br />
I only made the changes on tdpur045.srnb &lt;&gt; 0<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
