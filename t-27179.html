<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mitchell</div><div class="date">23rd May 2006, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I needed to add a field to a form, however I do not have source code and therefore could not define this new field.  So I created my own session (with the new field I needed)  and used stpapi fields to run the standard Baan session.  My problem is that I dont know how to pass the new field from my session to the report.  Would I just use the stpapi.put.field to pass this variable to the report?<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd May 2006, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope - the problem is that this new variable exists only in the new API session and not in the Baan session and report.  I am not sure if this will work, but it is worth a shot.  Before calling the BAAN session with stpapi commands export the variable.  Go to the report and edit/create a report script.  In the before program section try importing the new variable.  Of course I am assuming that this is just a plain variable and not actually part of the detail records of the report itself.  Since I do not really know what you are trying to do it makes it hard to come up with solutions.</div></div><hr />
