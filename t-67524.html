<br />
We work in baan4 c4 with one client, they have a customized fields in table tdpur040, when we tried execute afs, the value for the customized field is always empty.<br />
<br />
We check with afs.log, but we don't found anything strange, also I tried changing the code, from check.input section to before.input section, but the before.input section is not executed <br />
<br />
Anybody, have any idea why the afs code can't put the value? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I am not sure why it happens or what causes.  I am assuming you have the right table field, data and domain for the field.  In my case what I did was a select table for update for the field - and guess what?  It is the very same session you have - but the field is buyer.  A snippet of my code is below.  I know I have seen this on a couple of other sessions, but this is the one that popped into mind with your post. The buyer never gets updated on the form.<br />
<br />
<br />
	stpapi.get.field( &quot;tdpur4101m000&quot;, &quot;tdpur040.orno&quot;, dummy )<br />
	created.po = val(dummy)<br />
| IF buyer did not update correctly update it here.<br />
	stpapi.get.field( &quot;tdpur4101m000&quot;, &quot;tdpur040.ccon&quot;, dummy )<br />
	buyer = val(dummy)<br />
	if(tipgc520.buyr &lt;&gt; 0 and buyer = 0) then<br />
		db.retry.point()<br />
		select	tdpur040.*<br />
		from	tdpur040 for update<br />
		where	tdpur040._index1 = {:created.po}<br />
		as set with 1 rows<br />
		selectdo<br />
			tdpur040.ccon = tipgc520.buyr<br />
			db.update(ttdpur040,db.retry)<br />

AFS is based on interacting with the form definition, not the table definition...<br />

Yes, tdpur040.nspr is a field in form.<br />

<br />
How complicated are the validations?  Make it a library and just run them in the afs script also. Or just put the validations in itself in the script.  Pretty much all my api code is in libraries.<br />
<br />
Some of my sessions have hundreds of lines of data validation before I ever start the AFS code.  In some cases the sessions will do the validation, but I do not want to get 2 or 3(or more) sessions deep before I run into an error. Backing out the other sessions would probably be more code that the validations themselves.</div></div><hr />
