I know that there are a few sample excel speadsheets that came with our installation, but I can't get the uploads to work. I can retreive data from BaaN to Excel, but not able to send data to BaaN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I moved the thread to this forum since this is considered the OLE piece. I do not have any real example where I update data in Baan, but there are two ways that I can think of that you can do this.<br />
<br />
(1) Use a OLE function server to put the data to a Baan session and enter data that way.  You should be able to search the forum through here for a sample of that method.<br />
<br />
(2) Write a Baan dll to write the data into the Baan tables.  From Excel pass the data into the DLL. The DLL could then write a record to some Baan table. I will include a brief sample of this code - please note that my DLL actually calls the AFS code. <br />
<br />
<br />
        dllfunction = &quot;sfcdll9475.process.records&quot; &amp; &quot;(&quot;<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; comp$       ' Company<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; main_f$     ' main from<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; Main_t$     ' main to<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; sub_f$      ' sub from<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; sub_t$      ' sub to<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; year_f         ' year from<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; year_t         ' year to<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; date_f         ' date from<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; date_t         ' date to<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; efficiency     ' Efficiency<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; salary_perc    ' Salary Perc.<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; simu_comp$      ' Simulation Company<br />
        msg = &quot;Start&quot; + String(60, &quot; &quot;)<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; file1$      ' Input File<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; file2$      ' Report File<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; Chr(34) &amp; msg &amp; Chr(34) ' Report File<br />
        dllfunction = dllfunction &amp; &quot;)&quot;<br />
    BaanObj.ParseExecFunction dllname, dllfunction<br />
<br />
<br />
I have not actually used this in production yet.  This was only a test that I did - and it worked with a little help from Gordon. I have never written directly to a Baan table.  Maybe one of these methods will solve your problem.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
