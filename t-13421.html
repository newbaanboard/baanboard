I am calling session tibom1110m000 with stpapi and add a record to the BOM table.  The session updates the first submitted record but crashes on the second one.  The error message I get says &quot;Link on stack failed zero pointer pushed&quot;, &quot;Cannot continue on...&quot;, &quot;Use of NULL pointer on ' ' &quot;.<br />
<br />
Any ideas why I get this error message?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

(1) Make sure you have the latest stpapi patches<br />
(2) Make sure you have the latest object for the session.<br />
<br />
<br />
I noticed you had three versions of Baan listed in your profile, does this problem exist in all versions or just one version?  Do you have the source of this session? Being able to put it in debug mode may be helpful.  Also do you end the session each time or open it and keep putting data?  Posting the code might help someone see a problem.<br />
<br />
Also remember that not all sessions are API friendly, Baan supports very few sessions and I did not see this one on the list. Search through this forum there might be something useful on null pointers.<br />
