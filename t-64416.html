<br />
I am happy to give impartial information where I can so please feel free to contact me. <br />
<br />
EFS is a sponsor of this site and an Infor Global Solution Partner for ERP LN and Baan so we have a good pedigree and many years of experience in the field.<br />
<br />
We have and are creating the following solutions specifically for ION:<br />
<br />
•	Our Document Output Management solution can take the ION BOD and re-format it into attractive looking documents / labels for automatic distribution (print / e-mail / archive etc)<br />
•	We are working on creating a standard forms pack for all current business orientated BODS (i.e. Invoices / Statements) which allows us to create an ‘out of the box’ solution<br />
•	We are about to use ION to receive extracted data from an incoming Supplier Invoice, via our OCR solution, for receipt and subsequent 2 way matching (manual / automatic option)<br />
•	In addition ION will then initiate workflow for approval of unmatched documents<br />
•	EFS is working on a Web Part for Infor 10 (Ming.le) to bring back the scanned image for viewing within this process <br />
<br />
This is just a small example of how ION can automate manual business processes and link nicely into 3rd party solutions (namely ours ).<br />
