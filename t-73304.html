<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alibaba</div><div class="date">22nd July 2020, 08:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Experts:<br />
I tried to get the value from an enum field using the stpapi.get.field() function.<br />
I can use this function to get the value i need from other types of fields.<br />
But an empty value is returned when performed on the enum field.<br />
Is there any special way to use this function on enum fields?<br />
<br />
stpapi.get.field(&quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, &quot;net.amnt&quot;, ACP1230.net.amnt)	| <br />
stpapi.get.field(&quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, &quot;receipts&quot;, ACP1230.receipts)|<br />
stpapi.get.field(&quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, &quot;link&quot;, ACP1230.link)|<br />
stpapi.get.field((&quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, &quot;approve&quot;, ACP1230.approve)<br />
<br />
<br />
net.amnt/receipts/link/approve is the four fields on the form of tfacp1230s000 , and when run this script, I can get the value of net.amnt/receipts, but the link/approve returns an empty string.<br />
<br />
ThanksÔºÅ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd July 2020, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I found one we did before:<br />
<br />
	domain	tcwtst	order.status<br />
		stpapi.get.field(&quot;tdilc1120m000&quot;, &quot;tdinv100.wtst&quot;,order.stat)	<br />
		order.status = ltoe(lval(order.stat))<br />
<br />
<br />
As long as ACP1230.approve and ACP1230 are strings I would expect it to work.  I think we only used tfacp1230 in a couple of sessions.  I did find this.<br />
<br />
| This should start tfacp1230 again<br />
		stpapi.zoom.option( &quot;tfacp1110s000&quot;, 1, &quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, msg )<br />
		msg = stpapi.get.mess.code( &quot;tfacp1110s000&quot; )<br />
| If these do not check out then do a kill and stop everything<br />
| At this point tfacp1230s000 values Not needed 20050719		<br />
|		stpapi.get.field( &quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, &quot;net.amnt&quot;, dummy )<br />
|		net.amnt = val(dummy)<br />
|		stpapi.get.field( &quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, &quot;receipts&quot;, dummy )<br />
|		amount   = val(dummy)<br />
|		stpapi.get.field( &quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, &quot;link&quot;, dummy)<br />
|		link.rec = ltoe(lval(dummy))<br />
|		stpapi.get.field( &quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, &quot;approve&quot;, value )<br />
|		approve  = ltoe(lval(dummy))	| 20050719.end		<br />
		stpapi.update( &quot;tfacp1230s000&quot;, 1, msg )}</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th July 2020, 16:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you ever process anything thru tfacp1230?  Been a while since i have used baan or these sessions, but from the looks of our code those fields should have values.  I am wondering if you did an update or something, maybe read the variables afterwards again.  Another option if possible - go read the tables directly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alibaba</div><div class="date">26th July 2020, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your suggestion mark, I didn't do anything on session tfacp1230s000, I just tried to get values on the form after it was activated by tfacp1110s000.<br />
I did the same test on other session and found that I couldn't get values from any enum fields. I'm not sure what's causing this, my STPATI.*(ostpapihand)  is probably the latest version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th July 2020, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah - some of these sessions I could never figure how to get the data out of the form.  I finally got to the point if the worked I just skipped trying to get the data. The last one I wrote 4/5 years ago every place tcacp1230 came up I just ended the sessions.  I also know in other AFS code I knew the key fields so I just jumped out and read the table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alibaba</div><div class="date">16th August 2021, 12:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Incredibly, even though I didn't do anything, in today's debugging, I suddenly found that I could get the value of the enumerated field...Why? Because that server was restarted ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th August 2021, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anything else been done to the company in the last year?  What I found in the past in a porting set or one of those Service Packs could make things start working as intended or break stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alibaba</div><div class="date">16th August 2021, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Since asking this question, I have not done any tools or porting set update work. Only the database was updated (got a copy was copied from live environment), and the application server was restarted.(And I used to copy this form to the current VRC, and then deleted it) I just found out about it. Anyway, it can be used, haha.<br />
Thank you for your series of help, mark!</div></div><hr />
