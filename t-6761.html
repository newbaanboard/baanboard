I am using stpapi.find in the session tfacp1131s000 , after <br />
putting the following values.<br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tfacp1131s000&quot; , &quot;tdpur045.orno&quot; ,str$(orno))<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tfacp1131s000&quot; , &quot;tdpur045.pono&quot; ,str$(pono))<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tfacp1131s000&quot; , &quot;tdpur045.srnb&quot; ,str$(srnb))<br />
<br />
ret = stpapi.find(&quot;tfacp1131s000&quot;)<br />
<br />
i have verified that the value i am putting in the Key fields  do exist.<br />
<br />
But the stpapi.find returns a zero , with the error message string empty .<br />
<br />
I also tried using stpapi.browse.set with the first.set option, but it also returns zero with the error message set to empty.<br />
<br />
Note : I have written the script for a company 100 which is a Finance Company....<br />
the tdpur045 table data doesnt reside here ...but in the logistic company 110.....is this why the problem exist...???<br />
<br />
<br />
Any Suggestions ??????<br />

Could you post the complete code of your script? It would help us to help you..</div></div><hr />

The code would help to debug.<br />
<br />
Are you saying:<br />
   tdsls045 data resides in company 110<br />
   Session tfgld1131s000 is being run (or more properly, should be run) from what company?  100, right?<br />
<br />
So..you run the session in what company?  Because the code depends on this.  You can switch companies at a given time using the check.compnr() function - did you ever get that working?<br />
<br />
So..assuming you start this from company 110, you need to do something like:<br />
1.  Read the tdpur045 data.  No special read is necessary as you are already in this company.<br />
2.  Maybe store the tdpur045 data in temporary variables<br />
3.  Switch the company number to 100 using check.compnr() or similar.  Check that this was successful.<br />
4. Execute the api's to the tfgld1131s000 session - this should act as if you are in the 100 Company.  <br />
<br />
The biggie here is 'should'.  I personally have not tested if the check.compnr() sticks when calling api's.  Should be fine, but maybe there is a problem?   If so..you should structure your program to be called from the 100 company, something like:<br />
<br />
1.   Read the tdpur045 data from company 110.  Your current company is 100, so you would need to put in the select statement like:<br />
<br />
   select   tdpur045.*<br />
   from     tdpur045<br />
   where    tdpur045._index1 = {:orno.in, :pono.in}<br />
   and      tdpur045._compnr = 110<br />
<br />
That allows the read to another company (110) from within the current company (100).<br />
2.  Execute the API's now from the native company 100, using tdpur045 data from 110.<br />
<br />
Method 2 looks cleaner all around.<br />
<br />
Post back if you are having problems, I know you said something earlier about the check.compnr() not working...?  Good luck!</div></div><hr />
