We are looking at how to integrate the solution with LN.  Anyone have any recommendations for using standard functionality (EDI, exchange) versus AFS.  Also any third parties out their that have already created an interface for this type of thing?  XML or flat file interface?<br />

<br />
My company - CrossroadsRMC (www.crossroadsrmc.com) has an RFID solution for our Infor data collection software, and all possible transactions for shipping, receiving, inventory movements and labor for LN.  These use a combination of AFS and DAL coding in LN, through OpenWorld.  Our solutions both read the RFID, and help you create the tags.  We have 20 yrs experience integrating with Baan / Infor.   Pls consider us - email me at lbencic@crossroadsrmc.com if you would like additional information or a discussion.</div></div><hr />

RF Gateway was developed specifically for Baan and upgraded to support ERP LN - shop floor data capture offering all the 'item handling' transactions you would expect.<br />
<br />
Being hardware-independant affords the widest hardware choice and delivery of shop-floor data, be it barcode or RFID, is no problem.  A combination of barcode labels/RFID tags with handheld readers as well as RFID loops can be implemented via a single system.<br />
