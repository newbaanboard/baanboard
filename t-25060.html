I am automating User Creation in BaaN IV c4. Everything is working fine but while calling tgbrg4150s00 from tgbrg4100m00 it returns me an error &quot;Model not found&quot;. Can anybody draw me what could be the error<br />

Thanx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th September 2005, 01:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say that when you use the AFS and zoom to tgbrg4150s000 the model is not being passed correctly.  Sometimes things like this happen using the API code.  Do you own source for these sessions?  Makes it easier to debug what is happening.  If you do not have source then do you have a source extension program like RMCis or Q-key?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wenaymj</div><div class="date">12th September 2005, 07:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I have source code but I cannot compile it in debug mode as it requires include files also. I will again try it by checking with our administrator whether we have other include files also or not. <br />
<br />
Can u tell me what is source extension program RMCis or Q-key? and from where I can get it. we have AMC with SSA global. Can they provide the same to us?<br />
<br />
Thanx &amp; Regards<br />

A similiar, but free product is available on Baanboard in the code and utilities forum by ~Vamsi.  I use qkey and sometimes I have to play with sessions to get them to work with the API coding.<br />
<br />
If all you are missing is some include files then I would contact Baan.  They have been helpful to us in this regards at times.</div></div><hr />
