However before each sequential dump, i do run a Remove application locks for range but i still end up getting a report which shows these two tables being locked. If i take table dump of these tables individually, they are created but not when i give the entire range of a particular company. I have db level backups going on, but with the alarming rate at which both these tables are consistently locked puts me in a spot of bother..<br />
<br />
Could anyone shed any light on this sort of behaviour and what could i possibly do to get it back the way it was..<br />

As already mentioned in your other threads, the &quot;Create Sequential Dump of Table&quot; puts an exclusive lock on the table, if you have a batch job or user modifying any row you would not be able to get the lock. Not every program uses application locks.<br />
<br />
In Oracle (http://www.ss64.com/ora/lock.html) there are different views and lock options to trace which user/process has the lock. You have to find the similar option in MS-SQL Server (http://www.mssqlcity.com/Articles/Adm/SQL70Locks.htm#part_6)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">12th June 2007, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a small comment to the application logs, as they seem to cause some confusion:<br />
<br />
The application locks in baan are not related at all to the database locks you see. Aplication locks are simply entries in a specific tools table, which any session can make and any other session has to test explicitely for. Application locks have no influence on bdbpre at all.<br />
<br />
Question is: Why do you do dumps for backup purpises, if you have database level backups running at all?</div></div><hr />

   The puzzling thing is that, why out of so many tables, only tccom010 and tdinv001 gets locked and that too every time the sequential dump of table is run. Why only these two tables out of the lot? Is it any indication to something about to go wrong?<br />
<br />

    There are couple of reasons why i do take sequential dumps apart from the database level backup. The main reason being that i am still unclear about the restore part using just SQL backup as data source. It gets complicated because we have installed BCK. I have yet to chart my recovery process with SQL Backup with BCK involved. I know for a fact that sequential dump(no matter how much time it takes) will restore all the data if the dump is without any missing tables. <br />

That depends on the active processes on your system and also which functionality you are using. If you are using manufacturing batch jobs than freight management then you will have locks on different tables.</div></div><hr />

   We dont have batch-jobs in manufacturing and Freight Management is not available on Baan4c4. The only thing that happens at the same time Sequential Dump takes place are the deliveries. But this is not a recent development(deliveries). We did have this before and the sequential dumps came out ok at that time. <br />

<br />
Assuming that you are still facing this problem, please try to run &quot;Create sequential dump of table&quot; for the 2 tables right now and see what happens. If you face error, then check at SQL server level which thread is locking it.<br />
<br />
Also, try taking backup of these 2 tables through bdbpre after 2-3 hours. You might be able to trouble shoot then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">16th June 2007, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The tables get backed up when you run for those two alone after you run couple of times(first run may give &quot;Cant Lock Tables&quot; error in the log but the next one succeeds). Yesterday we did an offline backup(Create Sequential Dump i.e) and found out that all the tables, including those two tables that werent getting backed up, were backed up. This points out that the tables were indeed locked by some transaction at the time of backup. The amazing thing in all this is the consistency it showed in avoiding these two tables when it was backed up online. <br />
 <br />
Thanks for all your inputs...<br />

Whats the difference? New Server. After shifting to a new server(which was in the pipeline for other reasons and with the same config) the backup started acting normally. All tables are now being backed up..<br />
