I am using LN6.1, I am doing planning for a/some freight order planning. I have defined all routes, carriers, transportation Means and TMGs and assigned to order and line level, still it is showing the error message &quot;no carrier and TMG/TMC not available&quot;. <br />
can anybody suggest a solution for this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fm_baan</div><div class="date">4th April 2008, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">FM planning engine checks if the carrier/TMG specified on the Freight order line is able to achieve the required transportation. The check is done on many parameters such as speed of the trucks (TMG), the load capacity of the TMG, Carrier capability of operating in different transport modes etc. If the carrier on the order does not satisfy any of the requirements, the search for a other suitable carrier is done. Only the carriers which have been defined under &quot;Carriers by Shipping Office and Planning group&quot; are considered for further planning. <br />
<br />
Would suggest, check the following in the set-up to make sure atleast one carrier/TMG is selected.<br />
1) Define multiple carriers under Shipping office / Planning group.<br />
2) If you are using combination codes and/or Transport types for the items then make sure there is a TMG defined with similar values.<br />
3) Specify a average speed at TMG such that the transport can be achieved between the desired planned load and unload dates.<br />
4) If Means of transport is being used, make sure there are sufficient number of those defined under a Carrier/TMG combination. Also make sure planning percentage is given as 100%.<br />
5) Specify the capacity on the TMG such that it is able to handle the items which are being transported on the freight order line.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fm_baan</div><div class="date">13th May 2008, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">One way to diagnose the problem is to use the &quot;Detailed Planning Log&quot; option when Generating the Freight Planning. This option is present on the second tab of the session fmlbd0280m000. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
