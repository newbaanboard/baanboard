I've done one ERP implementation where the transportation module was implemented. We had to customize (and improve) the module a lot to make it work. The company had some very special requirements though. Transportation has not been implemented often and as a result we had to deal with a lot of bugs. That was in 1996/1997 though and things might have improved somewhat by now. <br />
<br />
The consultant who was responsible for the transportation part of the project is Marc van Kessel. He's an independent consultant and the one and only true expert for transportation that I've met during my 10+ years of Baan consulting. Transportation is not implemented at many companies and there are not a lot of people who know something about it. Marc has done several transportation projects though. He's a baanboard member. Just search the member list for 'Marc van Kessel' and send him a PM. I'm sure he's happy to answer your questions (if he can't, then nobody can). If that doesn't work send me a message and I can  send you the last email address I have for him.<br />

We are using Transportation for 7 years now and it almost perfectly meets our needs. The integration into the Distribution module is one of the key features we need. Karin is right when she says that the module is not often used and there have been a lot of bugs in the past. But things improved over the years (maybe due to the cases we logged  ;) ) so that we would consider the current version as &quot;stable&quot; for our needs. <br />
When working with Transportation you will find that the integration into other modules is not as seamless as you might expect. I guess due to the lack of requests from customers they stopped the developement at this point sometime.<br />
The latest Baan version SSA ERP LN offers the successor of Transportation, called Freight Management with a supposed better integration into other modules. Maybe this is an option for your company.<br />
