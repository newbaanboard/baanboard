<br />
We are using Ln version 6.1 a.<br />
<br />
While using transportation (Freight mgmt), I had enclounter the following issue.<br />
<br />
Carrier is defined in logistics table and attached to a supplier ( say &quot;x&quot;)<br />
<br />
The carrier is defined for a shipping office and planner group (thru session  carrier by shipping office and planning group) <br />
<br />
when I generate a Fright order for a Purchase order for supplier &quot;Y&quot; ( having  warehouse which is attached to same shipping office )  , freight order gets generated for same shipping company and planner group but the carrier field is blank and I am unable to enter value in this field manually as the field is disabled.<br />
<br />
When I am trying to generate plan ( direct shipping method ) against the same freight order , error msg &quot;NO carrier available&quot;<br />
<br />
One way to reslove this problem is enter carrier in purchase order header / line , then it gets updated in freight order when the freight order is generateded.<br />
<br />
But I want planning to select carrier based on the parameter setting ( like cheapest / shortest / fastest) <br />
<br />
Do u have any soln .... pls help <br />

Of course it could be that in your setup you have for example indicated that a certain transport type or combination code needs to be taken into account for the item(s) on the purchase order. If carrier X does not have suitable transport groups that could result in a problem to use the carrier.<br />
All in all you really need to revisit your setup. :cool:</div></div><hr />

I've been working with them for a couple of months and the feedback so far is great!</div></div><hr />
