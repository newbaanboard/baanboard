   Want to know that EDI Messages Delfor and DELJIT is supported in SSA Baan Ln.<br />
<br />
Is EDI implementation in LN different than Baan5 C or Baan IV?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Refer to the SSA-ERP-LN documentation -&gt;<br />
<br />
Document code : P3496B US<br />
Release : SSAÂ® ERP LN 6.1<br />
Document title : Functions &amp; Features<br />
Publication date : July 04<br />
<br />
Chapter 10<br />
Electronic Commerce<br />
10-2 | Electronic Commerce<br />
Master data<br />
Before you can use EDI, a great deal of setup must be made. As a result,<br />
codes for organizations, such as BEMIS, must be entered, the messages that<br />
must be exchanged, such as MRL001 for sending data related to material<br />
releases, the messages that are relevant for each business partner (not all<br />
business partners will need EDI messages) and the moment (the SSA ERP<br />
session) the EDI message must be generated. For example, during the<br />
Approve Release Lines (tdpur322m100) session an EDI Message for the<br />
Material Release (MRL001) must be generated.<br />
Networks<br />
All the EDI messages must be stored somewhere, because all the<br />
information is all electronic data. The user must define in the Network<br />
session, where the data must be stored. The business partner data is linked<br />
to this type of network.<br />
Conversion<br />
The conversion sessions are an important of the entire EDI module. You can<br />
enter the codes, for example, for addresses, currencies, countries, and<br />
schedule types in the system. This helps to interpret the meaning of the EDI<br />
message.<br />
The user can see, in the conversion setups for each message, which table<br />
fields will become part of this type of message, what level the table field has<br />
in that message, and the length of the message.<br />
When all codes are defined, the setup can be made for conversion-in data,<br />
so that incoming EDI messages can be transferred in the standard SSA ERP<br />
data, and for conversion-out data, so that messages are correctly<br />
transformed from the SSA ERP system. A good example where this<br />
functionality is required is the item code. In the SSA ERP system, an item<br />
can have code ABC, whereas at the other party, the same item has code<br />
123. To make sure that the other party will get the right information, this type<br />
of conversion must be made.<br />
In addition, you can define specific conversions for each business partner,<br />
and you can perform import and export of messages.<br />
Electronic Commerce | 10-3<br />
Communication<br />
A separate module is present that handles the processing of the EDI<br />
messages. Messages can be generated for a particular network or being<br />
imported from a particular network.<br />
If message-generation fails, and required changes are made (either in ERP<br />
or in the EDI module), you can try again to generate EDI messages.<br />
Message data<br />
You can view the messages that were received. If the conversion failed so<br />
that the message could not be processed, the old data remains there, and<br />
you can retry to perform the conversion. The user can always see the old<br />
data.<br />
In the outgoing file, the EDI-messages are stored, which must be processed.<br />
If processing the message was successful, the data for being processed is<br />
removed from the Messages to Be Generated session. In the history<br />
sessions, all relevant data is still available for the user.<br />
General<br />
In EDI, the sessions that are triggering the BEMIS EDI message are defined.<br />
As a result, the functional session, for example, the Print Release session<br />
checks if the session is defined in EDI and, if so, a trigger is set in EDI that a<br />
BEMIS EDI message must be created for the printed release.<br />
10-4 | Electronic Commerce<br />
The following table lists the messages that can be generated from the<br />
various SSA ERP entities:<br />
Code Name of the message Related Business Object where<br />
message is used<br />
DIS Dispatch Advise ASN<br />
FML Load info to Carrier Freight Management<br />
FMS Carrier Status info Freight Management<br />
INV Trading Invoice Invoice<br />
MRL Material Release Purchase Schedule<br />
OCA Order Change<br />
Acknowledgement<br />
Purchase Order &amp; Sales Order<br />
ORC Order Change Purchase Order &amp; Sales Order<br />
ORD Orders Purchase Order &amp; Sales Order<br />
ORS Order Response Order Management<br />
RAD Remittance Advise Finance<br />
SEQ Sequential Shipping Schedule Purchase Schedule<br />
SHP Shipping Schedule Purchase Schedule<br />
ERN Error Notification<br />
RDN Receipt Discrepancy<br />
Notification<br />
Receipt<br />
You can group data from multiple Business Objects into one EDI message.<br />
The order information, for example, also contains address information, which<br />
is another Business Object.<br />
To be able to compare data present in an EDI message, a print session<br />
called the Print Compare Conversion Setups (ecedi5400m000) session is<br />
available, which provides an overview of which data is present in the<br />
incoming messages and which data is present in the outgoing messages.</div></div><hr />

Technically spoken, the EDI module is working exactly the same in LN. No new developments in that area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">23rd March 2005, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The code name MRL (Material Release) is comparable with DELFOR and with 830.<br />
The code name SEQ (Seq. Shipping Schedule) is comparable with DELJIT and 866.<br />
The code name SHP (Shipping Schedule) is the 3rd EDI message for schedules that is supported in LN and is comparable with 862.<br />
<br />
830, 862, 866 are X12 stds.</div></div><hr />
