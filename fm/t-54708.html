<br />
We are working on LN FP2, is there any way to less discounts, freight, insurance amount from the ASV value....??<br />
<br />
Situation:<br />
We have raised a SO with the amount Rs.100 on which the calculated taxes are <br />
BED - 14 @ 14%<br />
CESS - 0.28 @ 2%<br />
HCESS- 0.14 @ 1%<br />
CST - 1.14 @ 1%<br />
<br />
Now, at the time of booking SO Sales Person is not having any information about Insurance &amp; Freight amount so we books the order on an approx value including Freight &amp; Insurance. So we want to mention that out of Rs.100, Insurance Amt is Rs.5 &amp; Freight Amt is Rs.5 at the time of invoicing.<br />
<br />
In this case Cost of Goods Sold has to be 100<br />
and ASV for Excise will become Rs.90<br />
<br />
That means Customer should be debited with the amount<br />
Goods     -     Rs.100<br />
BED        -     Rs.12.6 (AVS Rs. 90)<br />
CESS      -     Rs.0.25 (AVS Rs. 12.6)<br />
HCESS    -     Rs.0.13 (AVS Rs. 12.6)<br />
CST       -     Rs.1.13 (AVS Rs. 100+12.6+.25+.13)<br />
<br />
Is there any way to handle this sceanario...??<br />
<br />
Thankx is advance....!!<br />
<br />

<br />
Are you using the new Package in LN : Freight Management  (fm) ? <br />
<br />
SSA ERP Freight Management is a Transport Management System (TMS) that enables customers to properly manage their transport orders, load consolidation and planning, as well as calculate delivery lead times. This can be done across different logistic<br />
companies. The main target group of SSA ERP Freight Management is<br />
shippers rather than mere carriers or logistic service providers. The product is<br />
a fully integrated part of the SSA ERP suite and has strong links with<br />
Warehousing, Finance, Order Management (Purchase and Sales), and<br />
Enterprise Planning. The product can, however, also be used as a standalone<br />
freight order and planning system.<br />
<br />
