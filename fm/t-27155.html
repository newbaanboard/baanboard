<br />
With 10 years of Baan functional and technical experience in Commercial and Aerospace and Defense environments, I am looking for an opportunity to provide Baan services in a flexible as needed setting.  I am a Certified PMP with significant hands on experience in Baan administration, development and business/system analysis (both Unix and MS environments).  I have strong communication skills to interpret user requirements to technical specifications and to implement solutions.<br />
<br />
Please contact me to discuss ways I can assist your organization on a particular project or task you may be considering.  Currently, I would prefer to provide support for small to medium size engagements.  This would allow you flexibility to address specific user requests without the need for additional dedicated staff.<br />

Thank you<br />
