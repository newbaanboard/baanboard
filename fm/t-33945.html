is anybody using Freight Management tool in ERP LN ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">12th April 2007, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - Any questions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">16th April 2007, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we are trying to use it and I have a question for you Flip. <br />
<br />
When generating a plan, we are getting the message that the load date of various freight orders is before the current date. This is fine and I know that, if I change the load and unloading date on the Freight order header it will work. This is, however, an annoying feature. <br />
<br />
Ideally we would like to have any unplanned freight orders included in the plan and their dates corrected. Is this possible or is there a procedure you can recommend? Should I delete the freight orders and regenerate them?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Simon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">16th April 2007, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">You can set the defaults for the delivery margins that is used to calculate load and unloading date in fmfmd0110m00 (Address - Freight Management) for address specific info or fmfoc0100m000 (Freight Order Control Parameters) for company specific info.</div></div><hr />

I have tried changing these parameters. It doesn't seem to give us what we need. Firstly we would like to restrict the planning by our customers calendar so that we only plan to deliver on the days that they &quot;usually&quot; recieve deliveries from us. If we want to change the margins we must untick the &quot;use customer calendar&quot; box.<br />
<br />
I notice that, providing the parameters are set correctly, if you change the planned delivery date on the sales order, the freight order dates will also change and therefore will be included in the plan. This causes us a problem because if, for whatever reason, we do not deliver on the originally planned date, we want this order to be replanned the following week. We do not, however, want to have to change the sales order delivery date because we want to monitor our delivery performance.<br />
<br />
The other option, I think is to change the loading &amp; unloading dates on the freight order. This would be ok if we didn't have to do it manually for each freight order. <br />
<br />
Do you understand our position? do you have any suggestions to achieve this easily?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
<br />

What we have done is added an extra field on the sales order line where the original delivery date (Cust Req Date) is saved and can not be chaned once you leave the order. This will be used to monitor delivery performance. We can then change the planned delivery date by line.<br />
<br />
Also found by using the margins the system can plan delivery into the history if you do not delete the delivery dates by Std Route. This caused an issue as you only want to deliver today onwards so need to delete the dates by Std Route on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a question, excuse me to take part of this thread, but instead of create a new thread, my question is related to FM.<br />
<br />
- Is it possible to know, calculate, the sum of volume received during a reception? Is FM can allow this functionnality? In my company, we have to calculte the volume received per each reception and I have no idea to do it.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

Paul</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">18th April 2007, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">You sould be able to do this without FM.<br />
Each receipt has a grand total on received qty in receipt unit. This can be changed to volume unit based on the conversion table.<br />
Also received weight is available by receipt line in Order Tab in Receipt line details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Lambert</div><div class="date">18th April 2007, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for answer, I ll check it now !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think we will use the date on the order header for customer requested date and initially change our order lines to the acknowledged dates. <br />
<br />
I have to admit, we had not set up standard routes. I have done this now and am testing it. I am getting a very unuseful message telling me that the standard route and the route cannot be used and that a direct shipment will be used. Both the route (from common tables) and the standard route are included on both of my freight orders, they both have the same delivery dates.<br />
<br />
Have you seen this error before?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">19th April 2007, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to let you know that the error mentioned above is now fixed. It was because of the fact that one leg of my standard route did not have a distance set up. Well, actually it did but, at the moment, the distances are all coming from the transport category &quot;Not applicable&quot; instead of &quot;transport by road&quot; despite my route stating that it has a transport category of &quot;transport by road&quot;. I am assuming that this could be a bug but if anyone knows why this might be then please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

We had the same - When load and unload date is the same this error is received. We also just use the &quot;Not Applicable&quot; as this is needed anyway on order entry and as when the freight order is created the planning has not been done and the type of transport and std route is not linked yet.<br />
There are some defaults against the Cust and Carrier and Std Route on Address though.<br />
Not sure how to set def transport type on order entry. As there are not default set at this site we are using the &quot;Not Applicable&quot; only as this needs to be set anyway.</div></div><hr />
