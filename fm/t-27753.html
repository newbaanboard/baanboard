<br />
    I'm trying to setting Freight Order Management in LN6.1, but I'm facing some problems when doing &quot;Warehouse Receipts&quot;<br />
<br />
     The error occurs as &quot;Carrier 001 has no transport means group available with matching transport type, combination code or peice unit.&quot;  <br />
<br />
      Even if I have checked and maintained all related data in Common Data and Freight Master Data, this error still occurs.<br />
<br />
      I would like to know that any parameter, data or process needs special set up and aware.  Please kindly advise....:) <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and Best regards,<br />

On your Transport Means Group - remove &quot;Capacity in Pieces&quot; unit with qty 0<br />
<br />
Also in Freight Planning Parameters you can deselect &quot;Check Transport Means Group Availability&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jutaratp</div><div class="date">1st August 2006, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I maintained data and parameter as your suggestion.
