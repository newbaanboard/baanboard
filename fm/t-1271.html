Does anyone out there have any experiences with vendors who have solutions of this kind, and whether they were successful? <br />

I am not sure what version of BAAN they are looking at but in b5.2 there will be a new Freight Management solution in the standard. That may resolve their issue. Otherwise an integration with CAPS Logistics can be considered.<br />

Thanks for your reply. They are on Baan IVc4. We looked at CAPS Logistics and while it is a great solution it was a little out of their price range...<br />
