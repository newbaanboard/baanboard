I am created a freight order from warehouse to some busines partner. From address and to address are maintained. I created a plan, then load with same from and to addresses and timings also as per freight order, and created shipment also with the same parameters, <br />
    but when i am attaching freight order lines, i could not found any freight orders, if i am entering the freight order line manually, it is showing the message &quot;freight order from and to addresses attributes are not matching with shipment addresses&quot;. <br />
<br />
I have maintained the distances by zip and City. and the ship-to address of the BP is also same. <br />
<br />
any help in this regard is appreciated,<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

The further processing of freight orders can/should be done within freight management itself. <br />
<br />
Next steps in your scenario would be<br />
1) Actualize the plan.<br />
2) Confirm delivery (status changes to Shipped)<br />
3) Confirm Receipt (status changes to Completed).</div></div><hr />

I misrepresented the problem, i have created a freight order manually in Freight Management, that is not at all related to Warehouse Management, our's is only transport company, so i taken from address as warehouse (to represent an address) and to address as business partner.<br />
<br />
here actual problem is that when creating shipment lines, sytem is checking the address of the Ship-to Business partner and the ship-to address of the Freight order and Ship-from address of the freight order to address of the Warehouse. If these are not matching then it is giving error.<br />
<br />
Being a transport company we transfer the material to different addresses belongs to same business partner. <br />
<br />
How this can be mapped, if the above problem is not a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I understand correctly, you are trying to use one freight order to ship goods to different addresses. This is not possible, there have to be different freight orders for each of the different address (even if they all belong to the same business partner). <br />
    Each of the freight order has to go in a different shipment (if addresses differ), but all these shipments can be consolidated under the same load. Also, all shipment lines under the shipment go to the same address only.</div></div><hr />
