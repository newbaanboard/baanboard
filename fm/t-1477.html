<br />
I have seen a presentation on b5.2_a Freight Management by BAAN this week and it looks very good.<br />
It will especially be suitable for companies that handle their own transportation but if you want to outsource this the system can handle that as well.<br />
There is also a nice integration with CAPS Logistics if you want more detailed functionality there.<br />
<br />
To be continued ...<br />
