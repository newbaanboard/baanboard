I am looking at Baans transportation add ons, but am also interested in any third party transportation systems. Any suggestions would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you ever take Freight Management into consideration? As far as I know this module is available for Baan 5c.<br />
We are running Transportation on Baan IVc4 and are currently looking for a way to upgrade on Baan 5 without loosing too many functionality of the 'old' Transportation module. Our local Baan sales office told us that Freight Management is released since spring 2002, but I've never heard of a company running this module.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">12th September 2002, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan 5.2 has Freight Management back as standard. Not Transportation as in 4 as yet. 5.2 has allso been released to accomodate the iBaan Logistics ad-on for transportation that will be release at the end of the year. Mainly for 3PL companies and can be linked to CAPS etc. for detailed scheduling. If low level scheduling is ok then std Baan will be ok.</div></div><hr />
