<br />
We want to add freight lines interactively/automatically in purchase orders. I have tried defining additional cost sets, price lists, linking supplier, linking freight item, price in price books etc. but nothing seem to work. It never adds in the purchase order. Does this really work?<br />
<br />
For sales orders I am able to do the set-up and make it work.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I checked it for a specific supplier and it worked. Ensure that the cost item for freight has purchase price and is costed. Also the PO value should fall between the lower and upper limits that you defined for in the session 'Additional Cost Set - Item'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. Is your set-up working in LN or in other version?<br />
I have checked that the freight line criteria is within limits.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

If we have eg. a return order then there should be automatically a cost item appearing on the sales order lines. I tried everything set up a cost item use additional cost items put the item within the price book but what I try to do it doesn't come within my Sales Oder Lines. Please advise.<br />

Thanks,<br />

Our business requirement is to have freight lines interactively/automatically in purchase orders. I am trying this via additional cost sets, price lists, linking supplier, linking freight item, etc. but nothing seem to work. It never adds in the purchase order. Does this really work?<br />
I want to add additional cost automatically to PO<br />
<br />
I defined a cost set next I attached a supplier with the cost set and then cost item with cost set (weight criterion)<br />
Linked the cost item with Supplier in the price List as well.<br />
But it does not populates the additional cost line in Purchase order.<br />
I am using Baan IVc4 application.</div></div><hr />
