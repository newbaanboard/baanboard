(without allowing access to change prices to line items)<br />
<br />
We use our own UPS/FedEx/LTL accounts to ship some customer orders.  Since we pass through the freight costs to the customer without markup, our shipping personnel are responsible for adding freight charges.  In our previous ERP, we were able to add the actual freight charge in the ship-confirmation module/session.  The only solution we have come up with for LN is to give shipping access to update prices on all line items.</div></div><hr />

Thats generally the approach taken.<br />
