<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">20th September 2004, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a meeting with our new SSA Global Sales Exec last week. <br />
<br />
He was keen to ask all the salesman questions as to our plans etc whilst seeking to not impart much information in return. He did say that SSA ERP-NL is now available but he either could not or would not say whether it had modules to address all of our 4c4 implementation, what additional features it may have or when we may get some concrete information on it and/or migration process.<br />
<br />
We have had no contact or response since the meeting which was one week ago. This is strange to say the least for a new sales person who is dealing with one of the largest and most comprehensive implementations of Baan in this country/region.    <br />
<br />
We may yet have to dust-off our software contingency plans and bite-the-bullet.  <br />
<br />
It would be interesting to know if SSA are being more evangelistic in other markets.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m.wilhelm</div><div class="date">21st September 2004, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand this question regarding vaporware very well.<br />
<br />
We try to get in-depth information about SSA ERP LN 6.1 since weeks. But we didn't get any detailed docus or &quot;Functions and Features&quot;.<br />
<br />
But SSA Global Support promised to publish:<br />
<br />
- Online Help of LN 6.1 as a standalone application (planned late September)<br />
   (see Solution 142197)<br />
   http://secure1.support.baan.com/webteamcgi/xTtanexist.cgi?key=142197<br />
<br />
- &quot;Flash Demo CD&quot; (&quot;in a couple of weeks&quot; regarding Development)<br />
<br />
I can send you also the slides of the Webinar &quot;Introducing ERP LN&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thea said they have already some new customers (in Central Europe) which are starting now with implementing with SSA ERP LN 6.1! How to do that with vaporware? ;-)<br />

<br />
Yes. By section Documentation/SSA BaaN Documentation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. By section Documentation/SSA BaaN Documentation.<br />
<br />
I know of that, but there is no specific area on the list for ERP LN docs!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chodix</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I know of that, but there is no specific area on the list for ERP LN docs!!<br />
<br />
By SSA BaaN number like P35*, P34*, U83*.<br />
Release can be empty when You are using such choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am very much surprised this info is only available via the BAAN Support website and as far as I know this is a secured site.<br />
So far, no news regarding ERP LN 6.1 has been easily shared with the user community. Even existing BAAN customers are not aware this info is available.<br />
I do not care about all the road shows and meetings SSA has organized in all the countries they serve. Despite these efforts potential ERP LN 6.1 customers are still in the dark what they can expect and where to buy it.<br />
<br />
I wonder...when will they (BAAN) ever learn to communicate properly? This has been an issue since I first joined BAAN Company in April 1996 and now more than 8 years later nothing has changed obviously.<br />
Does SSA Global BAAN still believe they can win the battle of &quot;next generation ERP&quot; against Axapta 4.0 from Microsoft (coming out in February 2005) and the different ERP products from SAP, Oracle/Peoplesoft, etc. by just not communicating?<br />
One can only think &quot;Wow....these guys still have lots to learn&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edwin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">By SSA BaaN number like P35*, P34*, U83*.<br />
Release can be empty when You are using such choice.<br />
<br />
I have done that actually.. for the whole range from *00*, *01*, *02*, ... *98*, *99*.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure there are better ways to get the documentation.  The www.support.baan.com interface is frankly a disgrace:-<br />
It's slow to use, <br />
the searching is non obvious, <br />
and it is impossible to see newly released/revised documentation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">30th September 2004, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">My thoughts are very much in line with Edwin's comments.<br />
<br />
I think SSA'a competitors are having trouble believing how easy their lives are going to be. (My cynical view is that they kept too many of Baan managers etc)  <br />
<br />
We have asked for details of differences vis vis 4c4 and for details of migration tools and have been told there is no suitable documentation at this stage. <br />
<br />
We are now re-looking at our earlier short list of high-end ERP's who are keen to &quot;cross-grade&quot; on very reasonable terms for the sake of the attention that would generate.  Given SSA's very Baan-like approach over the past year it is almost certain that we will move away from Baan within 12 - 18 months. <br />
<br />
(If SSA's account management approach doesn't change it may well be that the first they know of it may be when our support check stops arriving.)<br />

In this doc. 400 pages with differences and explanation of the topics.<br />
Further I agree with the other people that it's hard (or impossible :-) ) to get this kind of info from BAAN/SSA people if you ask them.</div></div><hr />
