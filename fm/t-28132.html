<br />
We have a BOM whose end item(A)'s unit is set and the child material(B) unit is m. Purchase unit and inventory unit are same for each item.<br />
So, we have maintained this BOM as 1 set A -- 4m B. It seems ok.But when we run cost and valuation calculation, an error comes out as &quot;No conversion factor found between unit m and unit pcs&quot;.And only after we have maintained conversion factor between m and pcs for item B, the cost price can be caculated. <br />
It's very strange and could anybody tell me the reason.Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">12th September 2006, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite simply, you're using two different units and Baan needs to know how to get from one to the other. You can have global conversions like 1 FT = 0.30479 Meters, and you can have specific conversion factors set up per item. This is where Baan looks first. You wouldn't want to globally convert SET to METERS because SET might convert differently for a different item. Therefore the conversion factor needs to be set up for that individual item, allowing Baan to get from here to there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">12th September 2006, 23:18</div></div><div class="posttext">In case where different units are involved, baan looks for conversion facturs between these units. In your case baan will check if there is a direct conversion factor defined between set and m. Since this conversion factor is not defined, baan looks for two step conversion factor, whereby it is trying to first convert set to pcs (thi s is probably defined) and then pcs to m (this is missing) and since it does not find pcs to m conversion factor, you are getting this message.</div></div><hr />

Does it means even  I have maintained that 1 set A is made of 4 m B in BOM, the system still need the convension factor between set unit and m unit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rocky6</div><div class="date">13th September 2006, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't agree with the statements that there must be a conversion factor defined (directly or indirectly) between 'set' and 'm'.<br />
First, that just doesn't make sense. Second, I just tested this on our system (LN6.1-FP2) and had no problem with rolling the cost. <br />
There has to be more to this--probably in your setup somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">13th September 2006, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right. I read the original posting too quickly and took the conversion factor error at face value. The statements rkathait and I made should be true if the different units are used on the same item, i.e. purchasing units as sets and inventory units as meters. Using different units for the parent and child items should not be a problem at all.<br />
<br />
I apologize. Unfortunately I have no good answer for this problem. Or could it be that you have different units defined for one item? Item A is set and item B is m, but &quot;Purchase unit and inventory unit are same for each item.&quot; Now I'm confused. Is one of these items set up to use more than one unit?</div></div><hr />

LN won't let you a U/M in, e.g., Purchase Unit or Purchase Price Unit if there is not a conversion factor defined between that unit and the inventory unit.<br />
<br />
I still think there is soemthing else going on here. Not sure what, but maybe something like Freight Management, Assembly Control, Unit Effectivity or ODM? (I'm reaching, I know, but these are all packages/concepts that we don't have implemented.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">14th September 2006, 01:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize for my earlier statement, I agree with Rocky that the there is no need for a conversion factory between set and m in the case mentioned in the original statement.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure of other modules, but there could be some data corruption if the data was loaded using some tools like excel upload etc. We had similar situation at one of the client site where the system was asking for some conversion factors that were not required. We had to delete the entire item master and then recreate it using an exchange scheme.</div></div><hr />
