<br />
I have a question related to Management Freight Package.  (Infor ERP LN)<br />
<br />
This question is related with fm and td packages.<br />
<br />
When you prepare a Sales Order  (In Order Module) , you may calculate by  every line (subsession tdsls4101m000, Invoicing page, <br />
<br />
the Freigth Import, field  tdsls401.fram, pushing  the bottom  Freight Amount.<br />
<br />
Before that I have to tell you that we have parameterized that the calculate of this Freight amount, field tccom112.infr, as  Client Rates   (its means that it have calculate based in Freight Rate Books).<br />
<br />
Until this, all is fine the calculate is fine, it use the correct Freight   Rate Book, and so on. But<br />
<br />
Which is the error that I found:  :confused:<br />
<br />
This calculate is for every line in the sales order. If I have a Client rates (Freight Rate Books  tdpcg050) with value of Fixed Amount  (tdpcg050.fiam) <br />
This fixed amount is added  to every line and it is not correct, the fixed  amount is a fixed value for all items to be transported, it shouldnÂ´t be used in every line. In Addition, we can probe this topic, because when the system is calculating the estimates freight (to pay for transport, no to collect from de customer), the fixed Amount is used only one time for every Freight Order Cluster).<br />
<br />
I need to know if there a next process or intermediate phase  where the Freight amount (tdsls401.fram)  to collect from the customer, will be re-calculate correctly.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, <br />
<br />
