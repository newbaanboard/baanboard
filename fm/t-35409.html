<br />
Can anyone help me with a Freight Management problem we have. <br />
<br />
We want to create our Freight plan at the beginning of the week then we generate the outbound data a day or two before delivery is due. We want to generate outbound load by load so that only the stock for the planned deliveries is allocated.<br />
<br />
In our normal business it is common for urgent sales orders to arrive right up to the last minute. This means that we need to add orders to loads at any point before the load leaves the warehouse. <br />
<br />
The problem we have is that once the outbound is generated, the load's status changes to in progress and, from that point, you are not allowed to add any more orders to the load. Does anyone know this issue? if so, how do you work around it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Simon</div></div><hr />

FM Leading Loadplan (Yes/No) does have an influence on this and is set by Planning Group.<br />
Execution happens in warehousing and changes can be recorder there.<br />
You can pick a freight order in warehousing without it being planned in the Freight Module. Just need to generate the freight order is part of the order steps and then you can generate the outbound data.<br />
<br />
Have a look at whinh4180m000 to see changes made to Freight plan in WH module</div></div><hr />
