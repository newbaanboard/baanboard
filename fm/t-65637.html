<br />
could you pls explain where and why you would want to change the tax code for landed costs ? Actually you can do that when matching the LC lines against the invoice but I believe you want to change it on the order line ?<br />
<br />

<br />
you will have to enter tax on position line thus the right tax amount can be applied to the LC line. There is no option to overtype the tax code from the PO (perhaps thatÂ´s what you expected). <br />
