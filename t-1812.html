<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trchandra</div><div class="date">25th April 2002, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, I tried changing the view using stpapi.change.view().  <br />
This function is returning value &quot;2&quot;, which is according to documentation 'first record in the next view'<br />
<br />
Document fragment..<br />
_______________________________<br />
long stpapi.change.view(string session [, ref string err.mesg])<br />
ARGUMENTS<br />
session	Name of the session this command is executed on.<br />
err.mesg	This parameter will contain the text of the error message if the function cannot complete normally.<br />
DESCRIPTION<br />
This sets the current view for sessions with forms of type 3 (multiple occurrence plus view). The field values of the view fields must be set prior to calling this function.<br />
RETURN VALUES<br />
0	No view found or error occurred and err.mesg is filled<br />
1	View found (err.mesg is empty)<br />
2	Another view found (err.mesg is empty)<br />
<br />
 <br />
EXAMPLE<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;dtfsa1501m000&quot;, &quot;dtfsa101.seno&quot;, str$(i.seno))<br />
ret = stpapi.change.view(&quot;dtfsa1501m000&quot;, error.msg)<br />
if not ret then		<br />
       message(error.msg)<br />
endif<br />
Explanation:<br />
The View field in the session is changed to the given key.<br />
USAGE NOTES<br />
The behavior is the same as a find/new group action through BW: if no records exist, then no record is shown (return value 0); if at least one record in the view exists, then the first record in that view is selected (return value 1); if the view cannot be found, then the first record in the next view selected (return value 2), or if there is no next group, then no records are shown (return value 0).<br />
The error messages returned can be:<br />
n 	Any error message from the session given during the browse action.<br />
Before a record can be inserted on a type 3 form, the view must have been changed to the desired key fields.<br />
_______________________________<br />
<br />
I dont why it is returning value 2, when there is view defined and record exists!<br />
<br />
When I looked at the table level, the first view (1st primary key) consists 2 fields which are plan level (plvl) and plan item( plni).  I set these fields properly, but I dont know why it is not picking up that record.<br />
<br />
I desperately need this functionality as I have to set a value, which has question attached and I need to pass answer to that question (other than default answer), which I cannot do with dal.update()<br />

<br />
I tried that but this time, the stpapi.find() is giving me value &quot;2&quot;, which is &quot;A record different to the one requested was found&quot; according to documentation.  <br />
<br />
Why is this session so special, I tried same kind of programming on other (multi-occurance) sessions, they are all working fine and giving me what I want except this...<br />
<br />
I also looked at the source code of session cprpd1500m000, it does not have any query.extends or anything like that which might tamper the starting mode of the session.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th April 2002, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you put the source session in debug mode and watch what happens with it?  This way you can see what happens when the session is started and what happens when a change.view or find is done. This might help you solve the problem.<br />
<br />
If that does not work then I would place a call with Baan. A new version of the session may be needed.<br />

Mark,<br />
    I did put the source (cprpd1501) of session cprpd1500m000 in debug and when program entered into above source, the value of cprpd100.plni (Plan Item) is not the same value which I assigned in my program, instead it is showing the first record.<br />

<br />
The field &quot;Plan Item&quot; actually looks like a combined field. It has three columns displayed under it's header. Check the table definition and if this is the case, then put() all four key fields before the find() function. <br />
<br />
Also, I've never been able to get an API to work for a session that has a start option of Find (7).  Symptoms of this happening are receiving dialog errors &quot;Zero pointer: name '' in qss.search&quot;, &quot;Use of NULL pointer on ''&quot;, and &quot;Can not continue in &lt;session&gt; in DLL: ottstpstandard()&quot;. If this is the case, try changing to something like GetDefaults.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">1st May 2002, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We had the same problem. We use an outside PDM system that calls BOM create/update. I am attaching our case description and solution we offered to Baan below (apologies for size of reply but the problem lasted many months and was solved accidentally).<br />
<br />
Case description: <br />
We have installed standard program solution 119947 (Nov-20-2001) on our production system. It generally works OK. To solve a specific problem we installed standard program solution 121657 (Jan-17-2002) on our test system. After installing that solution 121657 one of our cc-package BOI's written by Origin began failing. When we back out the solution 121657 the BOI again works correctly.<br />
<br />
Looking at the compiled dates on the standard programs in Unix shows that only two routines were actually updated in 121657: stpstandard and stpcreatedll. The defects in solution 121657 affecting B50b were 115419, 120512 &amp; 120188. Specifically DF120188 in stpstandard reads &quot; DF120188, 2002/01/11: API exec form sections during to.form&quot; and DF120512 in<br />
stpcreatedll reads &quot;DF120512 Functions modified to handle optional arguments&quot;. We suspect Baan's fixing DF120188 or DF120512 caused our problem since we are dealing with API functions.<br />
<br />
We went further in the investigation and installed standard program solution 122405 (Feb-15-2002). The problem still exists at that level and also at all previous levels of the standard programs until we get to 121253 (Jan-02-2002) where the BOI works again. For your information: solution 121253 ONLY updated stpcreatedll by fixing DF120275 and reads &quot;DF120275<br />
Incorrect function-names when not restarted&quot;.<br />
<br />
Could you please advise what program (stpstandard or stpcreatedll) would affect the way a BOI would behave? We believe this is caused by the Baan solution 121657 but we do not know how to describe the problem to Baan since it is a non-standard BOI. And since the BOI calls stpapihand directly;<br />
we believe we are one level removed from the cause of the problem, so logging input/output from our BOI would not help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
 <br />
Solution description: <br />
Solution from the customer:<br />
<br />
Please close this case. <br />
<br />
The solution is to recompile our custom VRC's whenever we do a porting set upgrade. In our case we updated from 6.2a.03.03 to 7.1c.02 and the was updated from 1997 to 2001. Apparently stpapi.change.view() to sessions with a form.2 does not work in 7.1c.02 with the older in the the session script. <br />

  <br />
Hi Quin,<br />
I have investigated our situation further. We have a customized script tibom1510. This was known before the case was entered. The custom code adds four fields to the form and other minor changes.<br />
<br />
I found that my 3GL test script does work using standard (uncustomized) Baan code for script tibom1510 (VRC B50U_b_stnd). The update date on that script is May 26, 2001. So, I agree with PEG that they cannot reproduce the problem.<br />
<br />
The plot thickens: <br />
By empirical testing I found that if I use the tibom1510 script object from when it was last &quot;officially&quot; compiled (Nov 2001) my 3GL test script always FAILS. If I simply re-compile the script tibom1510 then my 3GL test script always WORKS. The bic_info6.2 is identical (except for compile date and developer ID) for the two objects. I have copied the afs.log for the two <br />
executions below. You can see that the stapi.find() fails with the older object and works with the newer compiled object.<br />
<br />
So, the problem appears to be what is in the older compiled object. The Nov 2001 compile was using porting set 6.2a.03.03 and  the standard programs from July 2001. The compile I just did today is using porting set 7.1a.02 and the standard programs from Mar 15, 2002. There are three #includes in tibom1510: <br />
&lt;bic_dam&gt;, tcmcs2000, tcmcs2010. The last two have not changed for several years. &lt;bic_dam&gt; changed when we updated the porting set .<br />
<br />
I should not have to re-compile my program after a standard program update. Please continue your investigation with PEG, perhaps focusing on the new porting set being (somehow) incompatible with older compiled code for tibom1510.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
