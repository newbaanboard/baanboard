I have created a session, which extracts data from five different tables and inserts the same in a single table. What are the ways and means using which I can increase the speed of the session.  At present the session is taking a lot of time to execute and produce results.<br />
<br />
The table in which the extracted values are being inserted has only six fields. <br />
Even then the performance is low. Please suggest me ways and means to increase the speed of the session.<br />

In general, performance is hardly influenced by the number of field to fill. Usually performance problems will be caused by a wrong usage of index and order by combination in the query select statement, which might result in full table scans where sometimes only 1  record wil be retrieved.<br />

<br />
Without getting in the specifics, this is my top 3 of things to do when your custom code runs slow.<br />
<br />
1. Make sure you use the indexes of the five tables you query. <br />
2. Make sure you use ONLY indexed fields in your queries.<br />
3. Avoid full table scans and cartesian joins.</div></div><hr />
