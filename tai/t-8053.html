<br />
Is it possible to output any changes in session tiitm0101m000 to an ASCII file or similar for monitoring purposes.  <br />
<br />
So whenever a user makes a change to the Item Master I can see which fields and values are being modified.  Would there be another way of doing this?<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever tried such a thing?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably a better forum would be the tools admin forum.  Maybe Pat will be so kind to move this thread to the correct forum - since I have no moderator capablities here. :)<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

Why don't you add the table in ttaad4117m000? If you do so, all changes will be logged and you can monitor it through ttaad4461m000 any time you want.<br />

I will experiment with your suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The audit only applies to tablefields that do allow for auditing.<br />
Which fields these are, you can tell from the field details on the table definition (also look in the dtiitm001 RDD information for that table). Not all fields allow for auditing.<br />
And...<br />
Auditing can be performance costly, because a lot of sessions do modify (other) tablefields in tiitm001 (than you are interested in), and each transaction now has to go over the normal database driver and over the audit database driver.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ofcourse that are all true remarks. Especially the performance-issue is something to take good notice of; even more: make also sure that you've got enough space on the filesystem in the audit-directory!<br />
<br />
Nevertheless: if the fields you want to monitor are allowed to audit and when you are willing to take the consequense of losing performance in session tiitm0101m000, this is a perfectly sane solution to the monitoring problem. It's just a matter of what you value more important: auditing or performance.<br />
Also, it's something worth trying without too much risk. When you notice a spectacular downgrade in your performance, you can correct the audit in an easy way.<br />
<br />
