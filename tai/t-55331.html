<br />
My company currently runs Baan 5c on a Windows/Oracle 10gr2 environment. We have over 5 years of production data and the size of tfgld418 is almost 10 million records.  We were thinking of cutting over to a new DB our next fiscal year.  I wanted to know if anyone here has had any experience running Baan on a SQL Server DB?  I would like to know if there were noticible performance issues with a fairly large DB compared to an Oracle DB?  If anyone has information to share, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.<br />

<br />
I was wondering if you could tell me how you have the SQL data configured?  Is it across multiple drives?  How many Baan companies do have in the DB?  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">29th April 2009, 01:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We have about 60 milion records in tfgld106 in a production company and about 150 milion in an archive company and Baan runs very well (Numbers in tfgld418 are more or less the same).<br />
We have a dedicated database server with 4 processors and 20 GB of RAM running sql server 2005 (level 2 driver).<br />
Although you should take a look at Infor documentation for tunning in sql server.<br />
