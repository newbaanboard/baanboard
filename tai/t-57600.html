<br />
[1] create user in windows <br />
[2] create user in Baan<br />
[3] convert to runtime<br />
[4] create database user<br />
[5] convert user<br />
[6] link baan to database user<br />
[7] dump user<br />
<br />
However I get stuck at step 5 as I do not know which user/password to use. Our previous IT person has left and has not noted it down anywhere... I think I should be using sys as username but do not know the password. Is there any way I could reset this?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance.<br />

<br />
you could reset the password by &quot;alter user ... identified by ...&quot;. However there might be scripts on your system that use the (unknown) password and they wont work afterwards.<br />
Maybe its bettter to use a workaround until you receive the pasword from your ex-colleague:<br />
<br />
open $BSE/lib/ora/ora_users<br />
duplicate a line from this file (copy+paste)<br />
before the first colon (&quot;:&quot;) insert the username you created in Baan<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">14th January 2010, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Just create an oracle user and grant them sysdba privleges (or less depending on how oracle savvy you are). then use that username/password to let baan create the user.<br />
<br />
NOTHING should be logging on as sys, so you should be safe to change his password. if something fails, then vollia you found out 'another' stupid thing that your unethical ex-sysadmin did.<br />
<br />
key note, nothing in baan relies on the sys user so if this instance of oracle is only serving baan you're most likely problems will be in backups or monitoring, etc. easy fixes overall.<br />
