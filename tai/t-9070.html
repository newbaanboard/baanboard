    How do I determine what extension of Baan IVc4 we are <br />
    running?<br />
    Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st March 2003, 00:22</div></div><div class="posttext">First Note that a company is attached to a package combination.  Each package combination can hold packages that are derived differently.  Usually, though, if you check the td (or other common) package, you can see the derivation for all.  Spot check a couple packages to be sure if  you are not sure you are set up right.<br />
<br />
First find what Package Combination your current company is running under.  On the main menu, choose 'Options', then 'Change Company'.  Don't change your company, but make note of the Package Combination displayed under it.<br />
<br />
Then, go to Display Packages by Package Combination (ttaad1521m000) and look up your package combo (on top).  Pick out a couple packages to research.  You are looking for the VRC (Version/Release/Customer) columns.  These should be closely named to your package combo, and are hopefully named the same for the common packages.<br />
<br />
Then, go to Dispaly Package VRC's (ttadv1511m000).  Type in a package, like td, and look for the VRC name you noted as attached to your package combo.  Look on the right and you will see what it was derived from.  The standard you are derived from may be several layers deep on the derivation level.  If the naming conventions are followed, your custom VRC's will all start with B40C, and you will find the standard ones as B40U or B40L or just B40.  Extensions are these - usually B40L or B40U.<br />

Happy hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigJohn</div><div class="date">1st March 2003, 02:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Lisa,<br />
	Thanks for the reply.<br />
	I followed your steps.<br />
<br />
For td,<br />
    Here is the tree<br />
<br />
    B40T c3 prd1<br />
	  |<br />
    B40U c3 stnd<br />
          |<br />
    B40 c3<br />
          |<br />
    B40 c2<br />
<br />
So is the extension B40U stnd?<br />
So does this mean we don't have an extension?<br />
Please advice.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">1st March 2003, 09:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Faster, run ttstpsessinfo from the Run command (or P on ba6.1) from your top most package combination and insert any session code there. The sessinfo displays the derivation structure based on that package combination.<br />
This ttstpssessinfo report is also one of the first things Baan asks you (if app. related) to see what is your VRC structure.<br />
<br />
For your particular case:<br />
<br />
B40T c3 prd1  &lt;-- Your own layer<br />
|<br />
B40U c3 stnd  &lt;--- Update standard layer (for patches of c3)<br />
|<br />
B40 c3   &lt;--- BaanIV c3 standard (upgarde from c2)<br />
|<br />
B40 c2  &lt;--- BaanIV c2 standard (initial installation)<br />
<br />
So you are on BaanIV c3 standard, no [Baan] special extensions (eg., controlling or similar).<br />
Your connected to your own extension &quot;prd1&quot;.</div></div><hr />
