<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">5th April 2004, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the following problem:<br />
<br />
When I send the report to RTF device (using ttstpconv with argument RTF and page length 66) the pages following the first one are not-aligned; it seems that add 2 or more blank lines in the top of the second page, so the resulting report looks bad.<br />
The same report it's ok if it goes on the windows printer (or the direct printer) with the same characteristics (A4 format with 66 lines per page).<br />
I've done so many tries, changing the page lenght (64-65-66-67-68 lines by page) but I cannot achieve the correct printing.<br />
Note that this report is - in fact - the SLS invoice that has to be send to the customer, so it's a must to correctly print this document.<br />
Anyone has knowledge about this strange phenomena? There is something I can do to change this or is a &quot;known problem&quot;?<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">6th April 2004, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to be a general problem; the same happens also if I use directly the B2Mail product and the RTF output format, that uses a program different from ttstpconv. The first page is OK, in  the other pages there is a shift of some lines down.<br />
I think the problem is the way the file is prepared. In both cases, first an ASCII file is generated, then it is converted to RTF format. Maybe in some way there isn't a page break signal, but some blank lines are inserted instead, and the sum of lines doesn't match the page length declared.</div></div><hr />

Change the page length on the device data session to 49 and test it out.</div></div><hr />
