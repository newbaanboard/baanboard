<br />
My plan was to create the comapany skeleton in live, create all tables, etc and take the Sequential data dump from backup and import into live system ( same company name )<br />
<br />
I don't think all of the company parameters get sent across do they ?  :(   <br />
<br />
Am I missing something here that will allow a complete running setup company ( with logical table shares ) to be exported over to another similar baan server ? if not, i guess I have a lot of copying to do back and forth ...<br />
<br />
Thanks folks for your help !!</div></div><hr />

If you have created the structure of the companies you do not need to create the tables before running the import, I used to do exactly the opposite: import the data (with ignore ref. integrity), run a create tables and only then do a reorg. (for the ref. integrity).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">10th August 2005, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh OK, I was under the impression that the create tables was needed first through the Baan papers that i read up on QG 1022.<br />
<br />
I'll take a look through this and try a few things. I may ask a few more questions :)  Thanks for your help ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
the reason I ask is that our chared tables are out of date on backup and I would like to know if Baan will update ALL the records in a logical table of just append the differences ( new records not in LIVE system ) to the tables ....<br />
<br />
Did I make this clear ??   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">12th August 2005, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan imports can be of type &quot;delete existing before import&quot; OR &quot;append if non-existant&quot; (existing will be skipped and not overwritten). If your live setup is empty, then running the whole import with append would do also an append in the logical tables.<br />
I have never tested your scenario myself (usually we had refreshes, with a deletion before import) so, do some tests or wait for more feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will test the scenario first and repot back what I found out....<br />

thanks for the insight ....</div></div><hr />
