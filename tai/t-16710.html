<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">query1</div><div class="date">5th October 2004, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We did an upgrade of the porting set from  6.2a.03.01 to 7.1d.06. The Oracle database is also upgraded to 9 from 8. But still i see the driver info in the ipc_info as oracle8.how can i make sure that i'm using the correct driver??<br />
When i try to to the bdbpost on any table...  get the error &quot; write error(512) which is the corrupt data dictionary &quot;. i'm trying to convert the tables from level 1 to level2 by dropping the Hash columns, taking the bdbpre of the table and then the bdbpost. it fails in the bdbpost. can u help me on this?????<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">6th October 2004, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">There is only one Oracle driver for Oracle versions 8,9 and 10<br />
that's listed in Baan as the oracle8 driver.<br />
<br />
Why would you drop the hash columns and then do a bdbpre / bdbpost?<br />
<br />
If you're going to pre/post then just do ORA_LEVEL1=1 bdbpre6.1 ....<br />
ORA_LEVEL1=0 bdbpost6.1 ...  end of conversion...<br />
<br />
I asked you before to post your db_resource and tabledef.. I can't help you on the 512 error until you do that.<br />
<br />
Are you getting the error on all tables? or just some? <br />

  I'm sending the snapshot of the db_resource and the tabledef6.2 for your reference. Kindly help me and let me know what settings should be done to enable the bdbdpost option. Actually the data has some ascii character (0) in place of Null values in Oracle level. But when the dta ais getting loaded using the bdbpost option the constraint fails and the error (&quot;cannot insert null into not null column ...&quot;) is displayed and the bdbpost fails. This is the error (512).<br />
How should i rectify this problem????<br />
<br />
bmp1.jpg contains the snapshot of the tabledef and<br />
bmp2.jpg contains the snapshot of the db_resource.<br />
<br />
Expecting an early reply,<br />

<br />
why not just use the &quot;k&quot; option on the bdbpost then?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">11th October 2004, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan creates all collumns with the &quot;not null&quot; attribute. I think in your case you have an old existing table with a column, which Baan is not aware of (maybe was some other PKG) in the past.<br />
<br />
Now Baan tries to insert and does not give a default value for the new/unknown column. This creates your error.<br />
<br />
If you follow Daves advise, the table will be newly created and this should be ok!</div></div><hr />
