VERSION(S): SSA ERP LN 6.1, Service Pack 1<br />
<br />
This solution contains links to a subset of the documentation belonging to Service Pack 1:<br />
<br />
1. The changed_components_B61asp1.zip file contains an overview of all components that were modified in Service Pack 1:<br />
/ftpdownload/updates/Documents/changed_components_B61asp1.zip<br />
<br />
2. During the development of Service Pack 1, all solutions created for the initial master product (jn the remainder of this text called SP0 solutions) were as much as possible immediately ported to and included in Service Pack 1.<br />
SP0 solutions that were created after the code freeze date of Service Pack 1 will always have a corresponding Service Pack 1 solution dump on the ftp server. The obsolete_solutions_B61asp1.zip file contains an overview of all SP0 solutions that are included in Service Pack 1. The solutions enumerated in this document don't have a separate Service Pack 1 solution dump on the ftp server, these solutions are an integral part of the Service Pack 1 dump:<br />
/ftpdownload/updates/Documents/obsolete_solutions_B61asp1.zip<br />
<br />
3. The 'SSA ERP LN 6.1 - Specific Installation Guide' (U8744A US) describes how to upgrade an existing environment to Service Pack 1 level:<br />
