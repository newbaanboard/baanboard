<br />
B40c4/SQL2K/W2K<br />
<br />
Situation:<br />
=======<br />
- a new server with all tables created and have 0 records <br />
- we took seq dump of tables from old server<br />
- we created tables from seq dump in new server with disable domain constraints / ref integrity. It warned reorganise tables with repair ref counter YES.<br />
<br />
- now before even reorganise (takes about 2-3 days ...?) the table contents seem Ok. <br />
   &gt; Ref fields are ok. Like &quot;item&quot; referenced from tdsls041, is ok.<br />
   &gt; not possible to delete item, so it works for ref counter.<br />
<br />
Question is, given if all tables have 0 records intially and if records are added using &quot;create tables from seq dump&quot;, then is it that the Re-organise or Repair reference counter is not required.??? <br />
<br />
Appreciate your light<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">2nd August 2003, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, if you are taking a sequential dump from a company where the reference counters are ok, it is NOT necessary to reogranize/update reference counters.<br />
<br />
You really only need to do this if you are taking a subset of tables (or one table), that differs from a target database.  e.g. you take sales order lines, headers from one company (or from a different time period), so the items used may be different from what was there before - thus reference counters would need to be updated for the item master (and other tables).  If you take a full set of tables, it's usually not necessary.<br />
<br />
In summary - if your target was ok, and there were no changes, reorganize is not necessary.  It does not hurt, by the way, and you never definatively know that your target does not have some &quot;hidden&quot; problems (maybe some data corruption).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kamaljit</div><div class="date">3rd August 2003, 10:47</div></div><div class="posttext">As correctly mentioned -  REORGANISE TBALES is not required in your case.<br />
<br />
Since you have taken the complete dump of tables and loaded the complete set - you need not reorganise tables.<br />
<br />
You have to run a couple of sessions if the company nos. have changed though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 08:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, <br />
<br />
I basically disagree with everything said above!<br />
<br />
a) First of all, after a sequential dump, you do not need to do actually a &quot;reorganize tables&quot;, but a &quot;repair reference counter&quot;.<br />
It is the same session, but with &quot;Data and Indexes&quot; NOT (!) marked. This will only take a short time (half an hour up to 3 hours), depending on your data naturally.<br />
<br />
b) Wether you load part of a company or a whole company, does not really matter.<br />
<br />
c) When you disable &quot;ref integrity&quot; during loading (and you have to do this while loading a complete dump), then Baan will not calculate proper reference counters, so you might need to repair this.<br />
<br />
<br />
So now comes the big question, wether reference counters are at all still used. I have the impression this is true for level 1 drivers (informix/sql server) and might not be true for level 2 drivers (like oracle).<br />
<br />
Any comments here???</div></div><hr />

<br />
i thought reference counter there are two field in every table;<br />
<br />
create seq dump session takes the ref counter field definition and its values.<br />
<br />
create table from seq dump on the destination faithfully puts the reference counter values<br />
<br />
Is it not true....?<br />
<br />
vish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">No, not true,<br />
<br />
The reference counters are two extra fields in the database, but they are not data as such. Therefore reference counters are not dumped!<br />
<br />
It also would not make sense to dump them, because the new reference counters depend on the target system and not on the source, right?<br />
<br />
Anyway, a dump is just an ascii file. Dump a small single table and have a look at it!<br />
<br />

<br />
you are right, if the target system has already data and if data is appended or overwritten on it.<br />
<br />
as initally mentioned, the target system is completely empty, every table and every record from the old server is being put into the new server (from scratch)<br />
<br />
hope this clarifies<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding the line in your first post of this thread:<br />
<br />
&gt; not possible to delete item, so it works for ref counter.<br />
The actual deleting of an item is done in the subsession tiitm0203s000.  In this session, the system does not check the reference counter fields, but actually does a database query on quite a lot of tables.  If the item is found in any of these, the item is not deleted.  To see which tables are accessed, filter the table names from a bic_info on the object otiitm0203.<br />
<br />
By the way, Markus is absolutely right.  Reference counters are NOT exported and imported, unless you use a dump created and read by the database itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">hi markus, naveen<br />
<br />
yes you are right ref counter values are not exported as part of the dump. (ttaad4226m00). thanks<br />
<br />
but now the problem is, <br />
<br />
markus / naveen can you pls tell me, <br />
<br />
1)how baan uses ref counter for what ? <br />
<br />
2)If it is not rebuilt what are the effects?<br />
<br />
3)can processes go slow (process delivered orders, posting, finalisation)?<br />
<br />
4)Or How do i do a fast reorganise, Check Ref Integrity, Repair Ref.Counter alone if they are YES in Reorganise will it do<br />
<br />
5)for coys with only finance data and all other tables are shared can I select the package from tf to tf only in Reorganise?<br />
<br />
Your suggestions will help<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Some quick answers,<br />
<br />
1)how baan uses ref counter for what ? <br />
<br />
If table a references table b, then table b conatins a counter how often a does this.<br />
If you try to delete a record in b, then Baan will check wether this counter is 0. If not, Baan will not allow the deletion to keep referential integrity.<br />
<br />
Note: This scheme is not applied for all tables. For some tables Baan actually performs a lookup, for some Baan doesn't check. This is defined in the DD of the Table/fields.<br />
<br />
2)If it is not rebuilt what are the effects?<br />
You might delete records, which you should not be allowed to.<br />
Or Baan might prevent deletion, which you should be able to.<br />
<br />
3)can processes go slow (process delivered orders, posting, finalisation)?<br />
No!<br />
<br />
4)Or How do i do a fast reorganise, Check Ref Integrity, Repair Ref.Counter alone if they are YES in Reorganise will it do<br />
Try:<br />
       Data and Indexes: no<br />
      Repair Ref counter: yes<br />
      Repair Ref Counters of parent only: no<br />
     everything else no!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5)for coys with only finance data and all other tables are shared can I select the package from tf to tf only in Reorganise?<br />
<br />
Only, if you did a repair ref counter on the company, who owns the physical tables. Note: If you load a dump with tf, the you obviously have to repair also the tc tables, because, they tf is referencing them!<br />
<br />
<br />
The whole thing should not be such an big issue. With above setting it will not take so long or something is wrong with your system. How much data do you have and what HW?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Markus,<br />
<br />
I just ran reorganise for only one table tiitm001 and for one company. (no of records 89900)<br />
<br />
Reorganise Options : <br />
Data / Indices : NO <br />
Ref Integrity: YES <br />
Repair Ref. Counter : YES.<br />
<br />
It was running for 3 Hrs and still not complete I had to kill the process.<br />
<br />
I checked the log ttaad4225 in $BSE\log. But it doesnt have any trace. Any hints?<br />
<br />
Can you pls refer my previous replies in the same thread for the data volume and HW config....?!<br />
<br />
I apprecite ur continued suggestion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I am not a pro on SQL-Server and if you see old postings on mine on the board, then you will see, that I am also not much of a fan of this platform in generla, if it comes to Baan.<br />
<br />
Anyway, your data volume is pretty small. I was talking of db sizes around 200 GB and more.<br />
<br />
Your server (CPU's and RAM) seem adequate for the task. So it might me the SQL Server driver of Baan or SQL-Server itself.<br />
<br />
Maybe somebody else can be more helpfull here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anupkumar</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">If you monitor $BSE_TMP or $BSE\log directories u will observer that some of the file sizes keep on increasing as the reorganising process continues( Assuming no one else is working). In this file you can check at what stage the reorganise process is at.<br />
<br />
When you reorganise a table it checks for all the table to which the main table refers to.. And as you are reorganising the table item master which i think has the most references.<br />
<br />
So this process will take time. I have also observed that it sets the references for texts in tables too. and you start from a small table and end up setting references for table tfgld106 too.<br />
<br />
This could be the reason it takes time for reorganising table tiitm001.</div></div><hr />
