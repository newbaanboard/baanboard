I am trying to install SP8 for stnd for Baan IV c4.  After I scan the solution, and check the solution to install, the report shows that the SP8 for sch0 and sch1 are the co-requisites which are not available.  Also the status of the solution remains &quot;Available&quot;.<br />
So now I scanned the solutions for SP8 for sch0 and shc1.  Now when I am checking the solution to install, the report shows that now the co-requisites for SP8 for stnd are available, but the pre-requisite for SP8 for sch0 &amp; sch1 is SP7 for those VRC's which are not available.<br />
<br />
The current set that we have is SP7 for stnd, SP5 for sch1, SP5 for sch0.<br />
While installing SP7 for stnd, I didn't get this problem.  <br />
Now I don't want to install the SP8 for sch1 &amp; sch0, I only want to install SP8 for stnd.<br />
<br />
According to me I should be able to install a solution if the pre-requisites for that solution are available, I need not install the co-requisites.<br />
Any suggestions as to how I can get the SP8 for stnd installed without having to install the SP6, SP7 &amp; SP8 for sch0 &amp; sch1?<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance.</div></div><hr />
