Quick question here.  We are currently on service pack 5 on Baan IV c4, however due to implementing Crystal ENterprise with the Baan Solutions Kit we would ideally need to be on service pack 7.  Does anyone know if it is possible and how to upgrade Tools to service pack 7 without upgrading the rest of the system?  It is basically not having the resources to carry out the testing of the service packs on the system that is holding us back although Tools would not be such a problem.<br />
<br />
If anyone can let me know that would be great.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">outra9e</div><div class="date">5th December 2002, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">so this is possible?  my colleague has said that you cannot extract patchs from the service pack - how do you get the individual patches?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">5th December 2002, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Your colleague is correct.  You would have to download the individual patches separately from baan support.  Not pleasant but I don't think you can accomplish what you wish any other way.</div></div><hr />

From these, it is possible to install only Tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsteenwi</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that Baan even started doing that with the release of SP 8.<br />
<br />
But anyway, that isn't really helping you, I'm afraid.<br />
