I want to develop a session that list the sessions permision by user.<br />
All of our users have DEM and the session permission are managed by DEM.<br />
<br />
In the following tables I can see the permission that are created by DEM:<br />
<br />
ttaad231 Permission by session.<br />
But when I list all the session´s permission by user, I found a lot of them that the user can´t access. So I suspect that there are another set of tables that have a relation with ttaad231 and can give me the effective sessions permission.<br />
<br />
Anyone have faced a problem like this?<br />
Thank in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th March 2007, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">How did you determine they could not access them?  I found that when DEMs are generated all kinds of permissions get generated which the users should not have.  For example - if I included #pragma used session xxxx in a one program then the DEM flow would give users permission to session xxxx.  If the users had permissions to the session they could use run program to get to them.  What we did was write a program(actually a consultant wrote it about 10 years ago and I do not know if there is a baan equivalent) to trace through a role - storing in a table all the main sessions available from that role.  Then I wrote a &quot;run program&quot; session that finds what roles a user has, verifies the user has permission and launches the session.  I think you will need to do the same type thing to find out what the &quot;real session&quot; permissions are.  Just keep in mind - if the permissions are in the table there still might be a way the user can get to the session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">14th March 2007, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe there is another table  - authorization by module (probably ttaad230 ). That too plays role in determining effective permissions . Further there is an indicator exclusive/inclusive in the record . Have u taken care off the same .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">14th March 2007, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Mark &amp; Hitesh for your suggestions.<br />
I will take on mind.<br />
<br />
I found another table, ttaad999, Session Permission, that stores the &quot;efective session permission&quot;. I searched documentation about this table and I found none. Have you been heard about it?<br />
<br />
I also put a support request to Infor in order to clarify this.<br />
<br />
I will inform you anything that answers.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th March 2007, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure about that table.  For example one user has basic only &quot;global inquiry&quot; role.  Now when I look at this table she has tipgc0101m00b which is maintain group item.  When I look at her role this session is not included - yet it is on this table.  I think at one time I looked at this table - many years ago - and had problems using it.  I also do not know what is in description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th March 2007, 06:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi , <br />
<br />
Both of u seem to be correct . <br />
<br />
ttaad999 is populated when session authorizations are converted to runtime from ttaad230/1.There are no record of super users in this table .<br />
<br />
And it is updated with some description which is valid time and whether authroized or not (like 000024001 or 000024000 where first 4 digit for from time , next 4 digit for to time and last 0 or 1 for false / true ) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">23rd March 2007, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All,<br />
Infor have been answered my question with this?<br />
What do you think?<br />
Below a description how the DEM authorizations (via roles and employees) relates to the authorization settings in Baan Tools (AMS).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 DEM authorizations<br />
· DEM employee is linked to one Baan User <br />
· DEM employee can have up to infinite roles (defined in 'Roles', tgbrg8110m000)<br />
· Roles are assigned to processes and activities. <br />
<br />
The authorization is top-down. If a role is assigned to a process, each activity (and sub process) will be accessible.<br />
<br />
 How DEM helps you in setting up roles in AMS<br />
<br />
Since these roles interact with each other, the DEM Tool support the automatic generation of AMS Roles for Baan users linked to DEM Employees. For each DEM employee, automatically a Baan user can be generated. During that generation process, the generated Baan user will automatically get two AMS roles: 'FULLDB' and 'FULLSESS'. These two roles assign authorization for each session, table etc. Since these users will use dynamic menu browser as end-user interface, the DEM role has to determine the authorization.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
QUESTION<br />
When generating a DEM interface for a new user we always check the box &quot;Insert session authorization&quot; in the user dialog tgbrg4250s000, thus giving the user authorization of the sessions defined in the role.<br />
<br />
But how does Baan insert session authorization for tools sessions such as ttdsk2080m000 (Run program) and others? <br />
<br />
We have noticed that approx. 148 sessions are inserted in the ttaad2131m000 + module stp in ttaad2130m000 after a new user has been generated, are they the necessary standard tools sessions?<br />
<br />
ANSWER<br />
When within DEM authorizations are generated is this in first instance done on base of the sessions, which are modeled.<br />
From those sessions also other sessions can be started and from those also and from ....<br />
During the generation of the authorization this is done for 4 levels below the modeled session.<br />
Some of the sessions reachable in that way can be Tools sessions, so that explains some of them.<br />
The module stp is needed, because these are sessions/libraries within Tools, which support the working of the other Baan sessions.<br />
<br />
The Run Program session is done, because this is a Menu Option in all the menus. If you want your end-user not to being able to use this session,<br />
then you can in the session User Data (ttaad2100m000) make sure, that the option &quot;Call Session by Code&quot; is not checked.<br />
Next to that during generation for a lot of standard Tools session are given authorization, because they are needed to for example enter Texts or<br />
show Graphs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd March 2007, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah - I believe that is what it does.  What we did was to remove run program from the user, use tgbrg9490m000(I do not know if this is standard) which prints the roles and sessions, use report for tgbrg9490m000 to write a table with session and role.  Then write our own run program - which takes the user id, checks the role for that session and launches the session.  We did this because auditors were using the &quot;authorizations&quot; tables and seeing that everybody had things like maintain items, maintain SFC orders and a bunch of finance sessions - most did not know how to get to the sessions or that they even had them, but it did not matter.</div></div><hr />
