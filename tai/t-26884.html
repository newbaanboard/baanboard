<br />
I have installed Baan Vc with SQL Server as the database.<br />
when i checked what service pack installed on it, it wrote service pack 5.<br />
<br />
My problem is, when i try to open session scan solution/patch file, it give me a message &quot;Default textgroup unknown, please enter defautl textgroup in &quot;Maintain Default Textgroup&quot; and after i clicked ok. it give me error.<br />
<br />
What should i do?<br />
My objective is, i want to move all the solution in my live server in this testing server.<br />
<br />
My assumption is i can get all the solution and the service pack which already installed in the live server by doing scan solution.<br />
<br />
Is what i'm doing now, is the correct way to move all the solution in my live server to my testing server? (any idea about this)<br />
<br />
and why, i can't open scan solution/pacth file session, how to fix this?<br />
<br />
Please help.</div></div><hr />

Anyway quick answer: You have to create a default text group for your user in company 000, because that's where PMC runs.</div></div><hr />
