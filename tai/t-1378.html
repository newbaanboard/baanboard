I have heard much about the mythical Linux Porting Set (Never seen it)  - but nothing about an standalone XWindows Client for Linux Workstations. Having looked through Baan's Support Site - I cannot even find a solution to download any X Windows Client at all.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas?<br />
<br />
Do I have to download another Unix porting set - explode it and extract the BX6.1 from there. If so - which one?<br />
<br />
Also, once I have this, what are the steps in regards to installation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">14th March 2002, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">If Baan is installed on unix platform then it is possible to use BX client. Also Baan has discontinued BX with BaanERP. And the &quot;client&quot; need not be installed on your local box. It will be on the Baan server. In &quot;X&quot; what they call a client and server are opposite of the usual convention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">msanlon</div><div class="date">14th March 2002, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - But unfortunately our Baan Server is NT so there is no BX6.1 in the bin directory!!!<br />
<br />
I was thinking perhaps there was a way to perform a &quot;fat client&quot; installation on a Linux machine but have it access a Windows Server. I have seen posts on the board where people have successfully done something similar with the ASCII client - but it wasn't Linux on their client machines (It was a flavor of UNIX readily supported by Baan) - and I believe they used the porting set binaries, constructed a few directories, set up their environment variables and managed to get it to work.<br />
<br />
Conversely, I have heard of folks that are running the BX Client on Linux with a UNIX Baan Server....<br />
<br />
I know this isn't the easiest thing to do - if it all possible - but I was just curious!</div></div><hr />

<br />
See the thread http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=591&amp;highlight=ba6.1 : the title is for ba6.1 but the example I show is valid for both ba6.1 and bx6.1.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the linux portingset &quot;that is around&quot; is a very old one, so probably the bx6.1 has a lot of bugs...</div></div><hr />

Any ideas where I can get this Porting Set?</div></div><hr />
