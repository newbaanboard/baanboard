<br />
Many times our users are facing problems of BAAN login, error is 'Maximum Users reached'. This message we are getting when all the user-licenses are in use.<br />
<br />
To avoide this problem can we restrict users / allow users to use license by departmentwise. Suppose we are having 100 license copies and 10 dept.s then can we allowcate 10 users to each dept. ?<br />
<br />
Please guide me....<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />

<br />
the problems around the licenses have been discussed very often. Please do a search on the board.<br />
<br />
For a first start have a look to this threat Monitoring logged in Users  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8604) <br />

A suggestion<br />
<br />
You can fix time slots for users and give the time as sometime to sometime  instead of 0:00 to 24:00 <br />
<br />
so that each user is disciplined and has his time to use Baan</div></div><hr />

<br />
With respect to Rita's suggestion I do not think that this would be in the best interests of the system.  The thought of 'disiplining' users seems a bit Totalitarian to me and in my view would lead to inefficient/ineffective use of human resourses (twiddling their thumbs until the master will let them on to the system for their time slot !)  <br />
<br />
Sounds like an investment in extra licences would give a good return.  May be able to reduce the work force to pay for extra the licences.  Although I am a critic of SSA-GT/Baan rates for licences and support they are usually cheap vis a vis the the cost of extra people.<br />

May some user keep BaaN login idle to reach you &quot;Max .....&quot; error message.<br />
<br />
Kicking off that users and make free for other user also resolve problem some how.<br />

<br />
You should install filterbgsb.exe. The purpose of this is to control the users that can log in the baan. It allows to create groups of users and allow just a certain numbers of users of each group at a time. It allows to limit connections to 1 for each user. Here you can treat group as department. This solution is for NT Users. For Unix, you can check similar thread or my thread.<br />
<br />
I think this will solve your problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like filterbgs.exe, no solution available for unix. You have to create a script to control baan users.<br />

For Unix solution, Post already available. Just you have to search Forum</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your solution can work with my requirement provided requested you to add more comments about installation filterbgsb.exe. I mean to ask is where to install, where I can get this application etc. We are having NT platform...<br />
<br />
I am thankful to you for your efforts.<br />

<br />
Thanx very much for the procedure. Plz tell me one thing suppose I am having users from aa to zz and I have made 2 Groups in bgsb.conf and includes users aa to dd in first Group and from ee to hh in second Group. In such scenario what will happened for remaining users i.e. from gg to zz, will be they able to login to BAAN ? Will filterbgsb.exe utility work for remaining users ??<br />
