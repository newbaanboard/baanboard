<br />
There can be many reasons for Runtime Error in job. <br />
<br />
If the session is interacting with the directories, you need to check the write permissions. Check if there are any end() or exit() kinds of statements in job. Check the date initialization. Check if the session doesn't go to any infinite loops.<br />
<br />
Try to use statement like:-<br />
<br />
if job.process then<br />
        message(&quot;Process Completed&quot;)<br />
       job.process.error = false       <br />
endif<br />
<br />
Check the log files too.</div></div><hr />

Guess that will you give a hint what's going wrong.</div></div><hr />
