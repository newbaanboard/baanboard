<br />
We have found 4c4 to be much more reliable as the MCR extension was poor in 4c3.<br />
<br />
I did not do the technical work but it did go very smoothly using an external company. We also had a separate server to test it on first. There are some functional differences which you would need to be aware of in all modules.<br />
<br />
Also in tools you have the opportunity to use  PMC for updates which is much easier.<br />
