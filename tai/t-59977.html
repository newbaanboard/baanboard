On every WIN7 client it is not possible to edit the Standardtext with notepad. The Textgroup &quot;Standard&quot; is defined for editing with ext. tool &quot;tttxt1116m000&quot;. Normaly you can call the session tiitm0101m000 and press the Text-Button you can choose &quot;Articeltext&quot; and notepad pop up. But on the WIN7 Workstations it doesn´t work ??? :confused:<br />

We had a similarish problem with our Baan font to Windows font mappings in the registry.<br />
That's about as far as I can help....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">merian</div><div class="date">19th April 2011, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">any solution for this problem? we are experiencing same problem with windows 7 pcs'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">19th April 2011, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems that your textmanager objects are rather old. I would install the dump of solution 22857025 (244647) and if it does not work log an incident at Infor365.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">merian</div><div class="date">13th May 2011, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">With baan client version b40c 6.1.3.89 the notepad opens normally when texting management.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">1st June 2011, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also check the porting set level, if the porting set is too old as well as the tools standard (4GL engine) it is possible that these cannot handle text correctly in a client running in a newer OS such as Windows 7. <br />
Yes, even if you have the latest BW client. Think about it, per every porting set a new BW is released, (hand in hand) so if you only upgraded one side of things (BW client) the other side (porting set) is still behind in time.  Do tell what porting set you have and compare in the Porting set vs BW matrix in Infor solution 22881483.</div></div><hr />
