You got the wrong error code posted in this thread -<br />
<br />
SSA ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide<br />
<br />
506 ENOTABLE - XXXXXXXX<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Description:  <br />
This error indicates that the table does not exist. <br />
Solution:  <br />
XXXXXXXXXXX <br />
<br />
540 EDBLOGONDENIED - Database logon denied<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Description:  <br />
This error indicates that the database is available, but that access is denied to the current user. Verify the database username and password, and verify that the password is not expired.  <br />
Solution:  <br />
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX <br />

Also -<br />
We have to two company in different VRCs.<br />
Companies are linked to Package Combinations and NOT VRCs. It depends on your VRC derivation structure as well as package combination. If there is a common/derived VRC between the 2 package combinations, then you have to execute runtimes (ttadv5210m000 or ttadv5215m000) for the package combinations to generate the Table's Data Dictionary, bounce shared memory and then create tables in the database.<br />
<br />
Please be detailed with your issues, and others are only trying to help you here, they are not aware of your system setup and configurations. Also try to search for known solutions on the forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exactly did you change between your 540 error and your 110?<br />
<br />
Error 540 makes me think your group password has been changed and the change has not been reflected in the ora_groups file.<br />
<br />
Try to connect to oracle with your group (the one linked to your user inside ora_users)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">2nd February 2007, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a relationship between 110 and 540, being that (for reasons beyond comprehension of mortals) sometimes error 110 occurs while creating tables when the user has no create permissions in the database.<br />
<br />
This is a permissions issue. Make sure that the database user that is linked to your baan account has sufficient rights and that the password for that db account is set correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yashwant</div><div class="date">2nd February 2007, 13:15</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Mr Francesco,<br />
You are right actually 540 error is coming when i am running the &quot;create table&quot; session first time and if i am running again that session(without exiting from that session), 110 error is coming.But you are telling that permission issue,but i am doing from bsp user.2 months back i had created one comany and created the tables in that user.Is it the reason of password changing.as i have changed the password of bsp.Now what to do ,actually i have forgotten the old password.<br />
<br />
thanks <br />

<br />
Perhaps if you re-visit the Baan-DB connection documentation some of the old concepts will come back clearer. (I mean no offense with this it is merely a suggestion)<br />
<br />
Your bsp password is ok since you are connecting to Baan. The problem seems to be in the &quot;group&quot;. The &quot;group&quot; is the DB user that owns all Baan tables and grants the authorizations to all the Baan users at the DB level. It is also the one that creates the tables. You have problems at table creation time not when you use them that is why the &quot;group&quot; seems to be the problem.<br />
<br />
I am not a DBA but the problem you mention below does not seem like a simple authorizations' issue. I would not expect a core dump file simply because of that. Get some DBA help to find out why that is happening.<br />
<br />
i did only CRDD.I think this is user permission to database.when i am trying to enter into the oracle through bsp error is coming like &quot;Bus error(coredump)&quot;<br />

<br />
go into oracle and type<br />
alter user baaniv identified by baan;<br />
<br />
then go into unix and type<br />
encrypt6.1 baan<br />
<br />
the output should be something like (doesn't have to be exact):<br />
[W9I@n_R(Y)&lt;%H#f]@Bn)&gt;t:%;QwKl&quot;&lt;<br />
<br />
cut and paste that into your ora_groups as<br />
baanIV:[W9I@n_R(Y)&lt;%H#f]@Bn)&gt;t:%;QwKl&quot;&lt;<br />
<br />
make sure there are no extra spaces or carrage returns, etc.<br />
