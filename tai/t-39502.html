<br />
We have a BIVc4 installed on Linux (Suse Linux Enterprise Server 9). Since today morning some users are not able to login via BaaN Login. They get a message saying &quot;Error 4: Your password has expired&quot;. But, the same user is still able to login to operating system (ssh) with no message about password. The same user can also login to BaaN via Rexec. In OS user's password is NOT expired! Switch all users to Rexec is not an option. There is nothing in log files, that could help us. <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen something similiar before? Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Depending on what OS your user logs in..he or she would only face a problem with the password when his or her name is validated at the time of using a server resource or application. Loging into a client operating system(without domain) requires only a local user name and password. If the password for the user has expired on the server, it wouldnt prompt at the time the user logs into his or her own pc...<br />
 <br />
Baan uses the password from the server user list along with the database user list. Therefore look into the user properties on the server. <br />
 <br />
If nothing works, try changing the password for the user on the server, db and his/her pc..<br />
 <br />

P.S: The above statement is based on a windows platform. Shouldnt be too far off compared to Linux, baan wise i.e...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">23rd July 2007, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your answer, but in case of Linux, username and password has nothing to do with local PC windows account. When I wrote, that user can log in operating system, i didn't mean his local station, byt Linux server via SSH.<br />
Yes, we could change passwords for all users and temporarilly solve the issue. But the problem may repeat in the future. The question is rather about the source of problem.<br />
<br />
According to user properties on the server, password aging is switched off. But BaaN Login still says &quot;Password expired&quot;. As I wrote above, the same user can work with BaaN using Rexec. Strange.</div></div><hr />

   Where do you set the password to expire in Baan4c4? <br />

Baan tools use the OS (Unix, Windows, Linux) password aging mechanism.</div></div><hr />

 Thats what i thought too. But in this case the password ageing was switched off at the OS level. So where does baan pick it from? <br />
Not only that the work-around for your case was to decrease the password ageing period. So its only meant for a setup where password ageing is turned on...<br />
 <br />
Grzegorz: what porting set are you on?<br />

Refer to the SolutionID 119781 on Support Site:<br />
<br />
English	 How to activate password aging for UNIX using the Baan GUI ?<br />
VERSION(S):<br />
BaanERP 5.0c, SSA ERP LN 6.1 <br />
<br />
- Password aging has to be enabled on the Operating System Level (this is a system administration task)<br />
Note: Plan this carefully; sometimes this cannot be reversed, because the system could be upgrading from security Level B to security Level C.<br />
<br />
- The message that your password will expire in XXX days has to be displayed on UNIX level.<br />
Example: &quot;Your password will expire on Sat Dec 1 20:57:30 GMT 2001&quot;<br />
Note: The frequency of this screen popping up and the expiry date of the password will depend on how this is set up on UNIX<br />
<br />
- Don't edit the database users file on unix level (e.g. $BSE/lib/ora/ora_users), because changing of passwords might fail.<br />
<br />
- In some cases there could be a problem with permissions on the binary &quot;badmin6.2&quot;.<br />
Refer to Solution #117156 &quot;password aging (ttstppwdaging) is not changing the password correctly&quot; for more details.<br />
<br />
If you do not set your password to expire in Unix then it never expires; you do not have to change password until you change your mind :)<br />
The bug I encountered was that blogin  daemon thinks my password is expired when I still had 2-3 days on Unix. I can login to a Unix Terminal but not into Worktop.</div></div><hr />

i have exactly the same problem with Baan 5.0c, Porting Set 7.1d.13 on a SLES 8 Linux Box trying to change the connection method from rexec to BaanLogin.<br />
I get a message that my password has expired, although i can login via rexec and also on ssh.<br />
<br />
Here is the debug message from blogind6.2:<br />
<br />
Daemon: Incoming connection, spawn child.<br />
Daemon: revert to listen-mode.<br />
 Child: handle BaanLogin request.<br />
 Child: received:  user kgnha001, action 1<br />
                  IBCmd /baan/Vc/bse/bin/ipc_boot, bseVersion 6.2<br />
Try authentication via PAM<br />
No success via PAM; try classic route<br />
Function HAL_cmp_password OK for user kgnha001<br />
 Child: logon for kgnha001 OK.<br />
 Child: pwd status = 4, message = 4: Your password has expired.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">7th February 2008, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">After several experiments we found out, that BaaN Login has problems with passwords, when &quot;Maximum numbers of days with the same password&quot; is set to high. In meantime NPRao published the same suggestion. Seting a numer like 10000 instead of 99999 solved our problem; and for us &quot;10000 days&quot; is close enough to &quot;never&quot;. But we had to do it user by user :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">7th February 2008, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for this hint grzegorz,<br />
now indeed the message about the expired password is gone. But now i get a bw message that i'm not authorized to run as user root.<br />
The entry in log.bshell looks like this:<br />
<br />
E:root: ******* S T A R T of Error message *******                                                       <br />

<br />
the log message is in german and means:<br />

Any hints?<br />

Error 84 in my documentation means &quot;Too many users&quot;, but it's a document for LN, not 5.0c. You don't have any Umlauts in your password, do you?

<br />
No umlaute and yes i can login as root via rexec!<br />
<br />
I think it has something to do with the user who started the blogind6.2 which is root indeed.<br />
I found something about that in another thread with the $LOGNAME variable.<br />
Couldn't find it now. It dealt with a wrapper script i think.<br />
<br />
Think i have to open a case with Infor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">7th February 2008, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi together,<br />
after searching on Support Site i found the solution.<br />
It seems that this is a problem up to porting set 7.1d.13.<br />
In release notes to 7.1d.14 there is a workaround.<br />
<br />
If user root starts the blogind6.2 and the variable USER is set (to root in my case) then no one except root can log into Baan.<br />
<br />
Workaround:<br />
Unset USER before starting blogind6.2<br />
<br />
After that i can login with BaanLogin method.<br />
<br />
Maybe this helps someone,<br />

Andreas</div></div><hr />
