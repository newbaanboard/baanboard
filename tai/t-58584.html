You can use the Unix crypt command:<br />
<br />
crypt(1)                                                           crypt(1)<br />
<br />
 NAME<br />
      crypt - encode/decode files<br />
<br />
 SYNOPSIS<br />
      crypt [password]<br />
<br />
 DESCRIPTION<br />
      crypt reads from the standard input and writes on the standard output. password is a key that selects a particular transformation.  If no password is given, crypt demands a key from the terminal and turns off printing while the key is being typed in.  crypt encrypts and decrypts with the same key:<br />
<br />
           crypt key &lt;clear &gt;cypher<br />
           crypt key &lt;cypher|pr<br />
For Windows refer to -Encrypt your data with Windows XP Professional (http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/security/learnmore/encryptdata.mspx)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your information.<br />
Actually , We want to generate a text file from BaaN report session. Due to the limitation of report layout of 255 characters we need to create a file. In addition to this I want this file to get encrypted while creating. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Please use search for already discussed threads. Refer to the thread -<br />
Exclamation  Nb max of caracters on line in the report    (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9408&amp;highlight=spool)<br />
In addition to this I want this file to get encrypted while creating. <br />
Please explain what is the purpose of encrypting during file creation? <br />
Crypt command needs an input file. One possible option is to use - seq.open() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_directory_file_operations_seq_open) with binary mode.</div></div><hr />

We are generating a text file of composed payment. This file is having information of cheques with amount. This file is uploaded to the bank's portal site. Then the cheques gets printed in Bank and then disbursed to the supplier. Therefore before uploading / rather while generating the file we would like to encrypt the information ( like amount, cheque no .. everything) . This we want to do for the sake of security. No one will update the contents of the file. <br />
Pl help how to generate such file through BaaN session.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

That will require some detailed efforts.</div></div><hr />

Couple of thoughts -<br />
1. Which OS are you on?<br />
2. You can use file access permission and set to rwx------ so others cannot read/write/view the file and only the file owner has all the permissions.<br />
3. The crypt() on Unix operates at file level. Here is example usage -<br />
[DEV:bsp]/app/common/home/bsp/test&gt;cat input.file<br />
Hello World<br />
[DEV:bsp]/app/common/home/bsp/test&gt;crypt testing &lt; input.file &gt; output.file<br />
[DEV:bsp]/app/common/home/bsp/test&gt;cat output.file<br />
ö¯4ªÚÃGîH<br />
[DEV:bsp]/app/common/home/bsp/test&gt;crypt testing &lt; output.file<br />
Hello World<br />
4. No one can read the contents of the file, until its saved or closed by your process.</div></div><hr />
