<br />
 I have a customized package &quot;kk&quot;., with lot of modules attached to it. (say.. sfc, rou, hra). There are lot of tables/sessions/domains that are part of this &quot;kk&quot; package/module.<br />
<br />
I want to create a new package &quot;mm&quot;., and would like all the &quot;kk&quot; sessions to be &quot;copied&quot; into the &quot;mm&quot; package.<br />
<br />
Basically, If there is a session kksfc0101m000,... then It should work under its new name... mmsfc0101m000.<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility to &quot;copy&quot; packages and all its components and change the package code ? (A &quot;tt&quot; session perhaps ??)<br />
How would this effect the data dictionary ?<br />
What all would I need to do to accomplish this ? (IF I were to write a 3GL to update the tt tables.... would it mess up the dictionary) ?<br />
<br />
We are on Baan IVc2.<br />
<br />
All suggestions and help is greatly appreciated. Thanks</div></div><hr />

Yes. There is but inside the BaaN - dc/du tools. I developed that tool when I was in BaaN and its not released to customers.<br />
How would this effect the data dictionary ?What all would I need to do to accomplish this ? (IF I were to write a 3GL to update the tt tables.... would it mess up the dictionary) ?<br />
<br />
Yes this affects the datadictionary. You can only do it if you know all the tools table structures the way the data is stored etc. I prefer not to write this program now as you would need those functions/methods which are located in the tools includes (we need tools sources to make our scripts compileable) and are always subjected to changes.<br />
BEWARE If you make any changes directly into the tools tables at the customer end, due to BaaN Copyrights rules, they are not responsible for any mess that you created and the support becomes void.<br />
I suggest you log a case with BaaN support and try to get that session. But I built the tool for BaaN-5 series. I am not sure if it was ever ported for BaaN-4 series.</div></div><hr />
