Its like this, the table has reached its size limitation so some fiscal year records were backed-up and then deleted. But still the table size stayed the same. Any1 have needed answers to this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">19th July 2012, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">the table size does not change by simply removing the records. it's a database thing. the size is made up of the actual space and a reserved space. when you delete records your actual space occupied by your records lessens but it brings it to your reserved space. the bottomline is you will still have the same size after all. you need to ask your dba to shrink the database, meaning do a db maintenance to manage/shrink the reserved space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">biboie_63</div><div class="date">20th July 2012, 06:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Benito for your reply. But I just resolved the problem by creating a sequential dump of tfgld106 only and then create table from sequential dump to a test company. But takes sometime and the procedure worked. File size lessened and and number of records are same with the source. So next thing to do was to create table from the same dump file to the actual live company with option to delete table b4 loading. Now will test data integrity randomly.</div></div><hr />
