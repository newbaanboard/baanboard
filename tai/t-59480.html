I now inserted a localization VRC in the middle of the vrc path. The top package comb is converted and this localiz VRC is in the path OK. Also I checked that the fd...-file on BSE/lib is containing the proper vrc-hierachy. <br />
<br />
The problem is that when I install into the new localiz vrc, and make a &quot;check to install&quot; the function &quot;check customizations&quot; does not show anything on the report. But I know that there are customized  version of the component to install, on the top vrc level, a couple of levels up.<br />
<br />
When I do this in a totally different vrc-path (same tools), it works. So it is not a bug in a tools object. <br />
<br />
I know there are many things that have to be right for this to work, e.g. what you check=yes on the &quot;check to install&quot; screen. But I thought I knew this quite well.<br />
<br />
Any ideas are welcome.<br />

It is ERPLN FP3 on windows.<br />

<br />
CASE CLOSED: It was a &quot;friend of mine&quot; that had sources without objects in one vrc and checked a PMC with objects without sources.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not come across this issue, but from what you wrote, maybe you should<br />
check the &quot;Current package VRC of user&quot; of who is doing the check-to-install.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day,<br />
