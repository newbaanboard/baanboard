i want to insert a new text to associate this to a record in tfacr200. Because it goes from a external system, I need do that using ORACLE PL/SQL, so i need to know which tables i have to edit (tttxt***).<br />
<br />
THX!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">28th March 2007, 20:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not a programmer but you might want to consider coding the insertion with Baan so you can take advantage of Baan's text handling functions. How about you create an external script (perl?) that runs the Ora PL/SQL script which should send the text to a temp file. If something is generated then the big script  kicks off the Baan object that will do the insert.<br />

<br />
Dumping the text into a file and then hand it with a session in Baan is a good idea, because Baan function make.text might work. The problem is how to invoke this session.<br />
I mean, I need add some text to tfacr200 records which comes from the external system. I'm trying not to custom any script or session (i.e. tfacr2100m000), that is the reason because I've considered to insert the text into tables tttxt***</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th March 2007, 11:15</div></div><div class="posttext">You can make a simple 3GL script which selects the required records from tfacr200, and by using Baan's standard function write.text you can let Baan create the texts from the existing text-files, and assign the new texts to the tfacr200-table...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">29th March 2007, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is using Baan exchange. From what I remember you can put text in the ascii file that will be imported by enclosing the text with delimiter strings. Sorry for not being more specific but it was long, long ago. I do remember I learned it from Baan's help and was able to make it work (it can't be that difficult then :) )<br />
<br />
Now if I have to give my preference I think I would try the 3gl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gsegovia</div><div class="date">30th March 2007, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank U all for your suggestions<br />
I've just solved my problem without using a 3gl. <br />
Well, I've done the following:<br />
-You must insert text code into tables tttxt001,tttxt002 and tttxt010. Field tttxt002.refcntd may have the number of instances of tttxt010.ctxt (diferents text translations).<br />
- Insert the text into table tttxt010 which you want to associate on table tfacr200. This text DOES MUST have a new line character (ascii code 10) at the end. This is a very important thing, because if you don't add this character, BaaN will not recognize the text.<br />
- Update tfacr200.text with text code on the record.<br />
<br />
