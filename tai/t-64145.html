<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">4th June 2013, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">We are migrating from UNIX platform to Windows platform and I thought this would simply some work.  For example<br />
<br />
On unix, I build a csv file of open production orders with data as defined by our factory.  It was run in cron job every 20 minutes by a job user unknown to windows.  I have created a task on my windows client to ftp the file from UNIX to Windows.  These are 2 disjointed processes.<br />
<br />
Now we are moving to Windows platform and I'm expecting that I can combine both processes into one.  I have added to existing script, server2client(server.filename, client.filename, etc).  When I run the program interactively, the transfer happens.  Now I have added task on server and the file is built, but no transfer happens.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed light on this subject?<br />

Since jobs aren't associated with a client, there isn't anywhere to read or write the files involved with client2server or server2client.<br />
<br />
When running from a windows server, you should be able to have a mapped network drive that others can also access and directly write the files there using 'seq.*' calls.  Remember that these files must be opened with the &quot;t&quot; following &quot;r&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, or &quot;a&quot; since the target is a windows location.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yesterday, I created a .bat file with a copy command.  When I run my script interactively, the file is copied.  When I execute the script using a windows task, the file is NOT copied.  I am wondering if system security is causing this issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">7th June 2013, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank JappJD for responding.  I tried<br />
<br />
if job.process then<br />
    run.prog()<br />
else<br />
    app_start()<br />
endif<br />
<br />
I got the same behavior.  The file built on baan server but was not copied to the appropriate directory on windows file system.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">7th June 2013, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">The .bat file you execute with run.prog() can only copy a file to a client if that client has a writable share. So, it should have something like:<br />
<br />
copy c:\some_dir\my_file \\clientpc\share$\my_file<br />
 <br />
And of course that client must be connected to the network at the moment the job runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">7th June 2013, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the bat file has<br />
<br />
copy $BSE\tmp\my.file S:\baandata\my.file<br />
<br />
In this case, S is a location on our shared network, so the PC client is not part of the equation.<br />
<br />
Does this matter?<br />
<br />
As for logging in, the task includes user id so a user is identified within the task.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">7th June 2013, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">$BSE in a bat file does not work. Check if BSE is set on the system as environment variable. If so, use %BSE%, otherwise just code drive and path to the tmp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">7th June 2013, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">copy d:\baan\bse\tmp\my.file s:\baandata\my.file</div></div><hr />

What happens if you run the bat file on the server console? Something in the event viewer about this, both Baan server and server that holds the S: drive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">7th June 2013, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">When I run bat file, the file is transferred.  I'm glad today is Friday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th June 2013, 01:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry - really know nothing about this, but still - just wondering if you have tried other things in the bat file like echo Running.....?  Have you tried any of the flags with the copy command - like /V or  /Y?  Or maybe even try double quotes around the file names.<br />
<br />
I also just thought of something - I can't remember what I was looking, but one of the analysts had a bat file with copy in it that was not working - we switched it to xcopy and it worked.<br />
<br />
And maybe this is not relevant - but I found this post on the net (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/windows-7-and-i-have-a-batch-file-to-copy-files/311cdd34-40a2-417c-bb7d-ca96a7ef56ee).</div></div><hr />

<br />
copy d:\baan\bse\tmp\my.file \\ipaddresss\shared\baandata\my.file</div></div><hr />
