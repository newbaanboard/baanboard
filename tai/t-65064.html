<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">5th December 2013, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, we're having a nightmare getting SLM working for the first time.  The BaanIVc4 system was migrated to 64bit windows (from 32bit windows) but we now need level2 SQL drivers and are forced (by 64bit / SQL2008 portingset) to use SLM.  Unfortunately, its not working.<br />
<br />
When we switch $BSE/lib/defaults/all to use SLM and try to login to Baan it says there is no licence despite it appearing SLM is running and the temp key reports that it is valid.  I have set SLMHOME and BAANHOME variables to be the same.<br />
<br />
First thing I'm trying to find out is if the poorly documented information regarding which SLM components to license are correct.  I have added the following under the concurrent section in SLM:<br />
<br />
Application licensing of ERP Baan IVc application - Named/Concurrent users - 7124 <br />
Tools development license for ERP Baan IVc tools - Named/Concurrent users - 7126 <br />
Tools licensing for ERP Baan IVc tools - Named/Concurrent users - 7122 <br />
<br />
Is that all I need to get Baan licensing to work?  I've asked Infor several times today with no response.... :(<br />
<br />
HELP!</div></div><hr />

Note that the guide refers to InforXtreme KB articles. Those articles have the link to the PMC solution dumps.</div></div><hr />

Check the solutions in the PDF that Jaap mentions, did you install them?<br />
Don't forget to restart the SHM server afterwards since the security code seems to be stored there as well.<br />
<br />
Things to check if it doesn't work:<br />
- use 'bic_info -S all' to check if the security code are read correctly.<br />
- check if the *__slm__ files stored in the i&lt;package&gt; folder are in your vrc deriviation path.</div></div><hr />
