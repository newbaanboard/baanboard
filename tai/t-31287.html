<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">13th February 2007, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, this may appear to be an odd question ....<br />
<br />
We run several manufacturing companies off of one 'LIVE' VRC.<br />
These companies are all interrelated ( use same OA reports, Sales Reports, etc )<br />
We are now configuring a new product that is totally unrelated in function or Baan reports to the existing companies.<br />
<br />
We don't want to see the OA reports etc in this new company that we have configured for the existing companies ( in sessions, etc ).<br />
<br />
Can I solve this by creating a new VRC that is totally unrelated to the old companies or some other way ? This is new territory for me so I am not sure a new VRC actually solves any problems at all ( as the reports I think are still at the 000 level regardless )?<br />
<br />
Can someone offer a solution if this is totally wrong approach ? Do I need to create unique sessions for this new company to only show related reports for printing ?<br />
<br />
Thanks !!</div></div><hr />

Instead of trying to think VRC's ( which the more I thought about it, the less convinced I was taht it was gonna work ) I stumbled across another thread based on Report Groups and this code:<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
in &quot;Maintain Sessions&quot; put yur reports in different groups and the use the predefined variable &quot;reportgrp&quot; in your session script as follows to switch to the correct report group based on your condition:<br />
<br />
Code:<br />
choice.print.data:<br />
before.choice:<br />
	if (some.condition) then<br />
		reportgrp = 1<br />
	else<br />
		reportgrp = 2<br />
	endif__________________<br />
<br />
I would just set my condition to = the new COmpany number and that should do it  :) ....</div></div><hr />
