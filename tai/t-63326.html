<br />
Is there any ability to segregate between the transaction user and the approval user for the same transactions in the accounting and finance section , I need to give authorization to user who will be the only Approval user in the finance department.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate some guidance on this requirement.</div></div><hr />

Maybe approval is in a seperate session or dll, you can only autorise one person for this session / dll.  <br />
You also can give autorisation for table / fields, in that way you must be able to block the table / fields responsible for approval for transacion users. <br />
<br />
I'm not a finance consultant, maybe within finance there's also a possibility to autorisation?</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply Mario.<br />
I think what you are trying to say is defining the authorizations based on the user roles.<br />
But I want to know, is there any facility available so that we can set authorization even at form command level.<br />
For eg: Only the authorized person can see the form/standard command enabled for rest it will be disabled.</div></div><hr />
