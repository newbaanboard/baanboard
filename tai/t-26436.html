When you have no response on your posts, it probably means that nobody could help you with your questions. Although the BaanBoard is loaded with international expertise, it could happen that something is being asked on which nobody at the time knew an answer. <br />
<br />
I understand your frustration, but please remember: this is a free, volountary, uncommitted place. If you are in the need of urgent help, you are entitled to hire a consultant to assist you. You cannot however come here and get all angry that nobody yet dared answering your question. Also, posting it a second and a third time will not help you in any way...<br />
<br />
Please read and observe...<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">20th February 2006, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, here is my little knowledge about nlsedit. On my unix system, I have a program $BSE/bin/nlsedit6.1 - so you should be able to find a nsledit*.exe I guess.<br />
<br />
My nlsedit6.1 gives some help:<br />
<br />
<br />
INFO:<br />
terminf       : vt220<br />
nls_in        : generic.in<br />
nls_out       :<br />
BSE           : /baan/bse<br />
<br />
Be sure your terminal has been configured correctly:<br />
<br />
* 8 bit dataconnection (all layers!)<br />
* 8 bit terminal emulation support (i.e. vt200)<br />
* Multinational (for keyboards other than US)<br />
* Keyboard setup (language)<br />
<br />
KEYS:<br />
d/h/o :        decimal/hex/octal mode<br />
t     :        edit nls_in &amp; nls_out tables<br />
r     :        toggle display of characters<br />
s     :        toggle character set<br />
<br />
<br />
The option 't' switches to a table which shows lines starting from char 160 (decimal, clear text &quot;No-break space&quot;) to char 255 (decimal, clear text &quot;Small Letter y with Diaeresis). Maybe that's a starting point.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

I am working with Baan 5.0c on windows 2003 SP 16</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">21st February 2006, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,<br />
<br />
try: tsscomp.exe -i (input file tss6.2) -o (output file)<br />
<br />
tss6.2 is the source file where you change the data to what you want, and the output file should be tss_c6.2...<br />
<br />
both files are in the lib, remember that to backup tss_c6.2 before you replace it, as it is loaded in the shared memory.<br />
<br />
Hope this help</div></div><hr />
