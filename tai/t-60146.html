It is the first time I post a topic in the forum and I hope it is the right location.<br />
Today we have the following configuration:<br />
  - BaanERP 5.0c SP15<br />
  - Porting set 7.1d.04<br />
  - Oracle 9<br />
  - AIX 5.2<br />
We want to change the OS and the database in order to move to Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008. I want to know if someone has this configuration with Baan 5 and if it works properly. Our production company has more than 500Go of data and I want to avoid performance issues with this new configuration.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards<br />
Nabil</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for your replies.<br />
@drkempf and vinceco252, are you speaking about BaaN V.<br />
I'd like to know if your customers have BaaN application and the database installed on the same server and what do they use for the storage. In addition, which module do they use in BaaN? At the begining, we had some performance issues with the configurator and the MRP. These issues have been solved and we are affraid to have the same issues with SQL Server. It is very difficult to find companies that have BaaN V with SQL Server. <br />
I begun to think there were nobody with this configuration.<br />
<br />
Thanks you for your help,<br />
