<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">At a former employer, we had the same problem.  We just warned them that they would have to recreate.  Then we discovered WorkTop.  WorkTop kept everything local so it doesn't have the network load that Desktop does over a WAN.  The worktop documents were stored on the users' network drive so they got backed up.  And they users liked it.</div></div><hr />
