After installing a solution, sometimes a table won't take effect of changes made. So I have to &quot;create DD&quot; for that table, because &quot;Convert to runtime&quot; doesn't work.<br />
But I don't want the whole package VRC to be &quot;created&quot;.<br />
How can I make this?</div></div><hr />

I'm not able to wee the new fields of the table. I've created sequential dump of the table, deleted the table and re-created de table. Still nothing...<br />
<br />
I'm out of ideas now!</div></div><hr />

If it doesÂ´nt work try reboot...<br />
<br />
Hope it would help.<br />

<br />
Have you checked your RTDD at OS level to see what is going on there?  Also, a create without the reorganization of the table will not work since Baan will not swap the .new with the corresponding DD of the table.  You may also need to update your domains.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">22nd September 2002, 14:29</div></div><div class="posttext">[I suppose your table is, eg, tfacp999], do the following:<br />
<br />
(connected to correct package combination)<br />
- check you can see the new DD of the table from maintain tables<br />
IF you don't see it, then it's obvious!<br />
<br />
- check that the VRC where it is located can be seen by your current package combination (check your VRC/PC structure)<br />
Your package combination may be useing VRC's that are not on top of the VRC where the table DD is, thus will never be seen!<br />
<br />
- check that it's correct at RTDD level (check your files dict/dd&lt;package_combination&gt;/dtfacp/*acp999*)<br />
IF you have a .new file, then the CRTDD did not work, you still need to convert RTDD first before the CRTDD.<br />
IF you don't see the new fields, then your CRTDD did not updated it, check previous steps.<br />
IF all it's ok, then restart shared memory.<br />
<br />
One of these steps should show you where the problem is.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise the table won't reconfigure. Be aware that domains can be of a different package!<br />
