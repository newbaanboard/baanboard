<br />
We are on LN 6.1, OS- Unix and DB- oracle.<br />
<br />
I would like to know the best Job scheduling practice for this environment.<br />
<br />
Currently we have scheduled all jobs through crontab.<br />
But maintaince is becoming difficult task, as there are already many root jobs set of non-LN activities. So for adding a new job, or changing the time frame has become tidious activity as we have to go through entire cron and check jobs one bye one.<br />
<br />
Is there any efficient way of scheduling jobs, (other than cron)? And what kind of setup is required for that.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />

<br />
They allow for a nice centrally managed system with alerting, retry, dependency tracking, etc.<br />

In Baan, you can use its job scheduler, setup jobs, calendar, multiple batch-user ids for every company and use the job daemon functionality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never tried any of the tools mentioned above. For sure there may be situations where complex job scheduling has to be supported with additional software, but we have been able to control job flow with own scripts so far.<br />
From your posting I understood that your main problem is the size of your roots crontab (or the amount of jobs in it).<br />
So I have 2 suggestions:<br />
First one (easier): sort the entries in crontab and build one section for Baan related scripts like:<br />
*********cleaning up stuff**********<br />
#comment<br />
12 12 * * * /work/jobs/job1.sh<br />
.<br />
.<br />
*********HR jobs<br />
..<br />
..<br />
<br />
*********Baan Jobs<br />
#comment JOBNAME like used in Baan <br />
<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
second version:<br />
<br />
use another users crontab for Baan jobs alone - bsp seems a good candidate.<br />
Don't forget to change the OS-user in ttaad2100m000 if you use that approach and think of permissions for files and scripts used.<br />
