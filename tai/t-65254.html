<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">6th January 2014, 20:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 locations using HP LaserJet printers with 3 trays in each printer.  The baan device is set as windows server printer.<br />
<br />
I have accessed server, right-click on bwprint.exe, open as administrator, and set up which reports are pulled from tray2 and from tray3.  I have completed my development and testing.  Tuesday, I was doing a last round of testing and decided to login as end-user.<br />
<br />
As end-user, the report does not print.  I was able to see the report in tmp file, and I saw the number of reports on print server change from zero to one and then back to zero, the printer light started to blink and the printer displayed a message &quot;processing job&quot; but no paper was printed.<br />
<br />
Later, our administrator modified priviledges adding end-user to baan_admin group.<br />
<br />
With this change in place, end-user was able to print.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had this problem?  Know what to do?  <br />
<br />
Of course, we cannot leave end-user in baan_admin group, so this problem must be solved.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions will be appreciated.  Yes, I have been in touch with Infor.<br />

<br />
Have you checked with the file permissions for the baan folder located on client machine? May be its having insufficient rights. Generally we give full access to the baan folders and some others like temp etc.<br />
<br />
We never required to add the user to baan_admin group. Also check the permissions for $BSE. Try giving full permission for everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By registry you mean? I guess you are on Windows, so, you can just right click on the folders -&gt; Properties - &gt; Security. Add everyone to the users and give them full control.<br />
<br />
Providing access to registry to the clients can be done using your domain server. You can google it get a lot of links explaining the way.</div></div><hr />
