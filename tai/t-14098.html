<br />
Happy New Year !!<br />
<br />
We have Baan IV  / Informix 731 / HP_UX.<br />
<br />
We have restored our test &amp; development system after a system crash and is currenlty running on a ealier date. The system has not been re-validated yet.<br />
<br />
The Baan system permits insert &amp; update in a normal way, but hangs for about 45 mins during a delete.<br />
<br />
The locks at the database level are seen as HDR+IX when a delete is fired. <br />
<br />
When we try to delete the record thru the database directly it deletes just fine with not lock scenarios or hung systems.<br />
<br />
Any ideas to solve this are welcome. I have attached the db_resource and onconfig file for you ref.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
Max</div></div><hr />

- Is it happening for all deletes or just on some tables<br />
- Which process is consuming most of the time during delete?<br />
- What are the disks doing during the delete?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
