<br />
I need to join two companies. Can anybody give me a clue how this can be done? What steps to follow? Some doc's maybe?<br />
BaaN version is IVc3/AIX multilogistic/monofinancial.<br />
More precise:<br />
Logistic companies: 101, 102, 103, 104<br />
Financial company:100<br />
I want to join companies 101 and 103<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

a)<br />
Do you mean to share a set of tables between two baan companies ?  Setting up Logical Tables will allow this.<br />
<br />
b)<br />
Write Baan code that will process data from multiple companies ?<br />
There are standard Baan programing functions for this<br />
<br />
c)<br />
Move data between companies as a one time ?<br />
Baan Exchange.<br />
<br />
Please provide more detailed information about your specific problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">17th May 2002, 05:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not had the occasion to try this, but as per the manual, it is possible to use the tablename._compnr field.<br />
<br />
For example, assuming that you want to report data from 101 and 103 as if they were in a single table, you could try:<br />
<br />
<br />
select ttmmmnnn.*<br />
from ttmmmnnn<br />
where {all your required conditions}<br />
and (ttmmmnnn._compnr = 101 OR ttmmmnnn._compnr = 103)<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This will give records from both the companies together.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, this is not the point. Sorry for the confusion.<br />
What I want is to join all the data from two companies into one single company keeping all the relations with the financial company.<br />
So, I have two logistic companies 101 and 102, and one finacial company 100. I want to &quot;move&quot; all the date from 101 and 102 to company 103 witch must be linked to financial company 100.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">1st June 2002, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gone through this exercise and it is a quite extensive task. The general steps were:<br />
<br />
1. Archiving and deleting as much data out of both companies as possible.<br />
2. Writing a program to compare the tables in both companies and print out the records with the same key fields in both companies (e.g. same order numbers, text numbers etc.)<br />
3. Deciding table by table, how to consolidate the data in one company.<br />
3. Changing the records, which existed in both companies with the help of exchange schemes and programs (e.g. writing a program that creates new text numbers)<br />
4. Importing the data of both companies into one new company.<br />
5. Running the tfgld900X sessions to change the company numbers to the new company number<br />
<br />
There are of course a lot of small steps inbetween. The whole thing needs carefull analysis and planning.</div></div><hr />
