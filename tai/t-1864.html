<br />
I've manged to get it working for ba6.1 by changing the user path to bin.new but I cannot get it to work for bw6.1.<br />
<br />
I've followed the instructions in the Baan quick guide.<br />
<br />
1. Add line into ipc_info<br />
<br />
eg: bshell_new              s    0    0  p  ${BSE}/bin.new/bshell6.1<br />
<br />
2. Amend bshell name in BW config to bshell_new<br />
<br />
However when I log in to bw6.1 and then run the shell bshell6.1 -v reports the current porting set and the users path variable is set to $BSE/bin. <br />
<br />
Although I have noticed that the variable BSHELL_PORT_SET is set to the new porting set. <br />
<br />
Does this mean I am running the latest porting set ?<br />
<br />
Any assistance appreciated.<br />
<br />

<br />
First: I do not think, what you are doing is a good idea. You will manage to execute the new bshell and with some effort the other portingset binaries. But what about the new files in $BSE/lib, shlib and so on? You have to check carefully, that the new portingset does not contain important changes here.<br />
<br />
Second: If you insist on doing it. You are on the right track. Your changes in ipc_info and so on are ok, but additionally, you have to make sure, that the PATH variable points to the new directory. That's why bshell6.1 -v still reports the old portingset.<br />
<br />
You can do this by using the set option in the command parameter of bw, or by running first through a script and set all variables there.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply I must confess I'm not 100 percent sure if what I'm doing is the correct way to deal with my problem.<br />
<br />
Basically I've been given a solution from support which contains a couple of solutions and an update to the porting set. I'm trying to test the solutions in my test environment but obviously updating the porting set will effect both my live and test environments.<br />
<br />
I will speak to support and try to get an answer regarding the validity of what I am doing.<br />

<br />
the test of a new portingsets is one of the reasons, why I recommend all our clients to have a completely seperate test environment. Just a test VRC will not do. It is better to have a complete seperate BSE or even better a seperate server (can be smaller obviously, but should be same OS and DB).<br />
<br />
The other reasons are tools updates. Which have the same problem.<br />
<br />
The last reason is testing of backup and recovery procedures.<br />
<br />
The very last reason is to have a easy way of setting up a new current test system, without &quot;repair company number&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe there are even more reasons. Anyway enough resons to convinve management to by a small test server.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />
