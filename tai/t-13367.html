Here are my observations-<br />
<br />
I found 2 diff's on our Unix system. One from my unix profile path and another from the baan ksh path. I verified that they were both same file size, located in /usr/bin/diff and /bin/diff. You can check using - $ which diff<br />
What do I set BAAN_SCM_GRP to? (or what is common there?) <br />
You do not need to set it to anything. Bshell automatically picks it based on the current login unless you specify it to something or override when using it in the BW configuration file.<br />
In ttadv1115m000 (Directories of Software Components), only the Forms path was changed. <br />
Looks like a bug. It has to be set for all the other components.<br />
Do I have to convert to runtime after this? <br />
Yes from the specific menu. Usually this is done during the VRC/package combination creations.<br />
Questions, questions.....and as always no documentation  <br />
I believe there is some documentation in the BaaN Administration manual.<br />
Anyway, we didn't have a good SCM thread yet far as I could tell. <br />
That is because most of the BaaN customers are on the BaaN-4 series, and SCM is available in the BaaN-5+ versions and only on Unix based platforms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">22nd October 2003, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently, Baan uses GNU diff and GNU diff only.<br />
I was using whatever diff ships with Solaris, and received error msgs that --a was not a valid option.<br />
<br />
By the way, when I log into Baan, there is no value set for BAAN_SCM_GRP. What is it automatically supposed to pick, and where does it pick it from?<br />

Apparently, Baan uses GNU diff and GNU diff only. <br />
I am not sure myself... because there is 1 BaaN delivered binary in $BSE/bin/diff6.2<br />
By the way, when I log into Baan, there is no value set for BAAN_SCM_GRP. What is it automatically supposed to pick, and where does it pick it from? <br />
You can see the value of that variable, when you use !ksh -v on the start program then $ env | grep BAAN_SCM_GRP<br />
You can only the effect of that variable when you use the SCM checkin/out functionality and then looking at the $BSE/application/&lt;userid&gt;/package-checkout-package-vrc directories.</div></div><hr />

Apparently it picks up the login name of the user.<br />
<br />
As far as the diff version goes, I have confirmation from Baan that SCM specifically uses the GNU variant, found in the diffutils package http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/diffutils.html<br />
<br />
I believe the same is true for RCS. I had to re-install that as well, but then I am not sure if the version we did have came from Sun or not.<br />
