<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th January 2017, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We typically only do the database when we create the test company.  We are also only on 4c4 so not sure how relevant this might be.  But we copy the database and run a company renumber on the data.  At this point if I was in your spot I would get the system administrator to force a create-runtime-data dictionary on everything - you might be able to get away with running some specific sales tables, or maybe all of the sales modules.  And don't forget if you are in the system when they do this. log out and back in once it gets finished.</div></div><hr />

In my case, I have seen this error when I copy data from production to develop, and there is differences between tables on both environments. If this is the case, you need to copy the definition from one environment to the another and reload the data.<br />
<br />
Your dba can help to identify if there is diferences between both environments and even create the necesarly fields.<br />
<br />
I prefeer to export the table definition from the production server and install on the test server. If this is the case, be sure that this change will not affect any other development on your test server.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
