I am currently having the problem of finding the main session of some Sattelite sessions. I have not found any report or anything like that for it so far. Is there any way to find out?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

The only way I did this was to just launch main sessions until I found the satellite session I was looking for the main session I was looking at.  It was a pain with some of the activates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the program &quot;Print where used Sessions (ttadv2410m000)&quot; is exactly what you are looking for.  Enter your session at the top and chose as Option only Sessions!</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes this session is what i need. But you have to change the range options to get a readable result. I have only deactivated the options &quot;Scripts/Libraries&quot; &amp; &quot;Business Objects&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />
