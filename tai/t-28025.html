<br />
what is your OS (missing in the profile).<br />
<br />
Either on W2003 Server you have to start the Jobdaemon with the graphical Interface. (In former times it was called &quot;baan windows nt manager&quot;... i guess)<br />
<br />
On Unix you have to start the jobdaemon. This will call your jobs &quot;in queu&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unix$&gt; ps -ef | grep ttaad5260m000<br />
<br />
(To check if it is already running). If not add it e.g. to the correct crontab.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have also the same problem, the Job daemon is started with the graphical UI called &quot;Baan NT manager&quot;, but the job status is always remains &quot;In Queue&quot; and it never executed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">31st August 2006, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">In your case, I suspect you have not started the job daemon.<br />
You should started from Unix, using the comand:<br />
$ rc.startjobdm<br />
Doing this, every job with the status, in queue. Will be executed as per job defined.<br />
<br />
Another way to run jobs is put the job as inactive and run from unix with the command:<br />
$ rc.startjob &quot;job&quot;<br />
<br />
If after this you are unable to run jobs, try to stop the jobdaemon with:<br />
$ rc.stopjobdm <br />
and restart the job daemon.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
sometimes the execution date and/or time of the job may cause a problem.<br />
<br />
Please edit your profile with DB and OS. The help will be much better.<br />

We r using &quot;ERP LN FP2&quot; with Windows 2K3 and SQL 2005.<br />
<br />
When we start job manually using activate jobs, job executes at scheduled time, but it does not execute when kept in queue. BaaNJobdaemon is already active in services.<br />

This is a common rule for baan you must have an user for each company: he can then start the jobs for this company but not for other companies.<br />

Please use search option to look for already discussed topics. Refer to the thread - Configuring Jobs (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=48116&amp;highlight=job+windows)<br />
<br />
Create a multiple Startjob.bat for every company/BWC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaukul</div><div class="date">8th March 2008, 06:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Thnx NPRao,<br />
<br />
But my query is not answered in that thread. I am looking to run multiple job daemons, one for each company. Right now, I can run only one Job Daemon (which is for 000 company).<br />
<br />
Is it possible to run multiple services in windows for multiple companies OR can any one tell me how to configure and run services via ASM?<br />
<br />
Thnks in advance...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on Hans &amp; Murphy's notes from the thread, you can create a copy of startjob200.bat into startjob300.bat and run multiple job daemons for different companies. And make sure to create a bspxxx account for xxx company so that you have a unique batch account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaukul</div><div class="date">11th March 2008, 06:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
They r suggesting to run multiple Jobs (startjob.bat in $BSE\bin) and I am looking for multiple Job Daemons (jobd.exe in $BSE\bin).<br />
<br />
Right now, I have started service BaanJobDaemon which executes the executable &quot;jobd.exe&quot; with login &quot;job000&quot; (000 is default company).<br />
<br />
I need to run such services for at least 2 more production companies. One way could be to &quot;share Job tables between these companies&quot; and start Job Daemon with that company user.<br />
<br />
But, I want to know and want to set if it is possible to have multiple &quot;Job Daemon&quot; services running on server...</div></div><hr />

<br />
* edit all jobs in company 000<br />
* run it with a juser from company 000<br />
* in session ttaad5101m000, mask 2 you can define for which company you want to run the session.<br />
<br />
Result: You should be able to run the jobs for e.g. company 100, 200, 300 , 400. But the root is company 000.<br />

What you describe results still in one jobdaemon and that's not what Kaukul wants.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried to use multiple jobdaemons since I prefer to use an external scheduler to run my jobs. Even not sure if it's possible.<br />

Fo this, you have to share tables among companies and it is not possible to share tables between tools company and production companies, as the package combinations are different among them.</div></div><hr />

We are able to run multiple job daemons on Unix server with BaaN IVc4:<br />
We have created shell scripts like rc.startjobdm.&lt;company number&gt; and inside them, we are exporting user data.<br />
<br />
In ERPLN + Windows, we are configuring a scheduled task that will start the Job Daemon with user having Production company as default one, but that is not working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">12th March 2008, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for sharing about the multiple jobdaemons.<br />
<br />
However it's not something I prefer:<br />
1. each jobdeamon uses a license;<br />
2. bad performance if you run multiple jobs at the same time in one jobdaemon.<br />
<br />
The advantage of it is that your users are able to schedule jobs. (If that is what you want.)<br />
