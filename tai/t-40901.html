Recently we have loaded ERP, so it came with portingset 8.2b, and i wanted to have the portingset as 7.1d.15, but when i am trying to downgrade it, i am not able to do it, it is giving errors like &quot;Not authorized to run as root user&quot;, but i am doing it with bsp, and also i have checked the permissions of $BSE they were correct bsp:bsp.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway out i can downgrade, any thoughts or assistance is higly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in anticipation.</div></div><hr />

the porting set mainly consists of the executables in $BSE/bin (although some config files in $BSE/lib might cause compatability probs). So if you have a backup of this subdirectory, you could try to swap it.<br />

Thanks for the reply. I appreciate that. <br />
But as i said this is a fresh installation so there will not be anyback of old folders, And mind you there are lot of differences in 8.2b and 7.1d.15. like the licensing etc. So it becomes a bit complicated to downgrade it. I have tried but i got errors like &quot;Not authorized to run as root user&quot;, then the after some more trails next error was &quot;Your password has expired, error 4&quot; then the next error is when we start the Be client, it gives error saying there is a problem in opening the BW, check the log.BW or event manager on NT, but there was no such log.BW and in when i looked in Nt event manager of the client machine it was giving the messgae that Connection with the server lost. So i checked for the BW version it is 7.1d.15.168 which is compatible with the portingset 7.1d.15. But still the error is there.<br />

don't know if it helps but have you checked resource slm_enabled in $BSE/lib/defaults/all file?<br />
Maybe file is overwritten during downgrade?<br />
