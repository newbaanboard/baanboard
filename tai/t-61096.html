Hi jaotto,<br />
<br />
Yes, it is Windows 2003.<br />
DB in the same server (MS SQL 2008 sp2). <br />
<br />
anyway i solved this issue by installing   SQLServer2005_BC.msi.  It crossed that stage.<br />

But we get error while  database is initializing.  please refer the attachments for the error log.<br />

<br />
Thanks Mr.Mmurphy for the reply,<br />
<br />
Yes you are right.  The collation sequence for the database is not correct.  But It is not clearly mentioned that  what collation should be used for SQL installations. I tried all the combinations as mentioned below.  But no luck.<br />
<br />
The pre-installation guide says,<br />
==============<br />
Specific ERP LN Note<br />
If during the installation process of SQL the Collation Settings dialog box appears,<br />
select Collation designator and sort order together with the Binary check box to<br />
specify a binary sort order:<br />
However, in case of a Unicode install, select the following:<br />
▪ Collation designator and sort order.<br />
Together with: ▪ Case - sensitive ▪ Accent - sensitive ▪ Kana - sensitive ▪ Width - sensitive<br />
=================<br />
<br />
Also as per solution 7020001<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
The required collation for Unicode is Latin1_General_CS_AS_KS_WS (Case Sensitive, Accent Sensitive, Kana Sensitive, Width Sensitive)<br />
<br />
===========================<br />
<br />
Solution:691852<br />
<br />
Which Collation and Sort Order to use when installing a new MS SQL Server 2008 database for ERP LN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resolution Description: <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
<br />
The pre-installation guide (attached) is telling which collation is needed. SQL2008 is not supported that long, but regarding MSQL2008 there are no changes compared to MSQL2005. So the collation can be the same.<br />
<br />
The new (in SQL2008) Latin1_General_100_CS_AS_KS_WS collation may be ok as well (it passed our internal tests). The fact that it passed our tests will not necessarily imply that sort order is correct in all cases, but that users in most cases will not run into trouble... Unfortunately, Microsoft is not telling much about the new _100 collations. They say it is better for linguistic sort, but do not provide more details (on msdn). <br />
==============<br />
<br />
While installing SQL 2008,  there are two type of collation can be selected. <br />
One is  windows collation and another one is  SQL collation.  I tried both for above combinations.  Still i am getting the same error. <br />
<br />
Could you please tell me which collation  (either windows  or  sql )  should be used for LN installations.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards.<br />

So, I created the database as erpln before the installation.<br />
<br />
Now I crossed that stage (Database configuration is successful)  but I am getting some windows registry error.  <br />
<br />
Please see the event log below :<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
ttbsi.001700: Windows Registration Error. File D:\infor\ERPLN\bse/lib/bse_vars has a wrong format erpln  <br />
<br />
The description for Event ID 1000 from source Baan cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.<br />
<br />
If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.<br />
<br />
The following information was included with the event: <br />
<br />
ttbsi.001700: Windows Registration Error. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I tried edit option for the file   bse_vars,  it contains <br />

<br />
But when I press next,  it gives error  as  &quot;bse_vars file is invalid. Missing &quot;=&quot; sign in one of the line &quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
Please advice on the above since infor is refusing to support on installation and implementation even though we are having annual support contract with infor for more than 15 years<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bennke</div><div class="date">28th November 2011, 04:41</div></div><div class="posttext">couple of things to look at.<br />
1. You MUST be logged into the server as local user Baan with password baan, when installing LN.<br />
2. You must ensure that SQL security is set to both Windows and SQL authentication<br />
3. Ensure that password complexity and password size is set so that the password baan can be used. SQL 2008 uses your windows password security settings when setting passwords.</div></div><hr />
