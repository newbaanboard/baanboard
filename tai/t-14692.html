<br />
     Is it possible to create a Sequential dump of a table and users are in the system? Does anyone has design a disaster recovery process for BaaN IV C4, Oracle 8i Win2000?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Technically it is possible to take sequential dump of table when users are in the system. But the sequential dump locks the entire table and users are not able to update the tables during the time the tables is being dumped . And this is big concern for big transaction tables. So practically it is not possible to take sequential dump when users are in the system.<br />
<br />
There could be many approaches to disaster recovery like <br />
oracle stand-by server with another oracle instance in read only mode or  online replication using oracle utilities or OS approach using win2k replication capabilities or using baan tabledef6.1 approach . <br />
<br />
Though Baan tabledef6.1 approach is considered unsafe compared to other approaches , we have used this approach and we are running it successfully since 7 months without any problems. <br />
<br />
You need to take care off dictionary separately in order to be able to online program script / object /dictionary etc replication. U may see these thread as a reference.<br />
