I made a job that consists of executing a exchange schema for importation of data for a table.<br />
If the job it's executed with the session ttaad5203m000, it works well. <br />
If i use the command $BSE/etc/rc.startjobdm, it does not works, and presents the following status: &quot;Runtime Error&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Not much of an expert, but I found this link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6044). In it is a post by Neal that mentions setting and exporting user name and the terminal setup.  Not sure if this helps. I know the one time I played with it I had to setup a script to get the terminal emulation correct.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
I think that the problem it's relationed to the exchange schema session because the job works fine if i try with, for example, a print session like tiitm004m000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you run rc.startjob under the same account as your exchange scheme? If not it is probably a permission matter.<br />
<br />
Anything in the log files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">telgar</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be no problem with running an exchange scheme in batch mode.<br />
<br />
If you could send me the screen prints of your log files and any message that might be in Display Job History Messages, I will look a little deeper into it.<br />

<br />
As Francesco mentioned,<br />
<br />
1. you need to clarify if the job user and user id with which you are testing ?<br />
<br />
2. if both are different? you need to ensure, the directories where the output/job-log files have the write authorizations, i.e, 775 permission modes.<br />
<br />
3. if both are still the same id's? then please check the program script code there might be exceptions coded there  like -<br />
<br />
<br />
if not (api.mode or job.process or background) then<br />
        do.something()<br />
else <br />
        do.nothing()<br />
endif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 05:45</div></div><div class="posttext">If your are running the job via the rc.startjob daemon then you need to ensure that all your environment variables are set. Eg. $BSE. Also you need to ensure that the $USER variable is set to a valid Baan user. Also if you are running it from the cron where there is no display then ensure that BAMODE=1 if not then it is 0 and your TERM value is set.  Hope this helps.  If you can run the job with the Baan session then you should also be able to run it with the same user using the daemon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilforum</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem was solved.<br />
I changed the permissions modes to 775, and the job worked well.<br />
Thanks to all of you.<br />
