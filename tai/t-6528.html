<br />
1. check the company and it's package combination<br />
2. Check the DD of that table in the current package combination.<br />
3. whether DD in current package combination matches with that of company's package combination adn it's RDD . If not through error 512.<br />
4. Load the table in memory and initialize the file pointer to the first record in that table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be careful with GTM! It works directly with Baan tables and you may accidentally damage or delete some data thru option &quot;Modify record&quot; or &quot;delete&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">GTM is the Table Editor for Baan. It allows you to modify records without using the session logic. So where in the session &quot;Maintain Sales Order Lines&quot; (tdsls4102s000) you can only edit lines for orders that also do have an order header &quot;Maintain Sales Orders&quot; (tdsls4101m000), due to data model constraints, you can change the order number field tdsls041.orno in table tdsls041 (&quot;Sales Order Lines&quot;) into a non existing order number in tdsls040 (&quot;Sales Orders&quot;).<br />
<br />
If you need to know exactly what happens when you start it, you can use all kind of tracings and loggings. But that is not what you want to know, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GTM (ttaad4100) has a smart sister/brother:<br />
ttaad4500. <br />
With this session you cannot modify/delete/insert, just look.<br />
Try to get get acustomed to only using this one and restrain the use of ttaad4100 to the rare occasions when you have to use it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">But in case you will need more information (like table field input help) you will still need to go to GTM itself. When viewing is smart enough, you are absolutely right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">And also when users make mistakes which are difficult to correct via baan sessions it is no way to make the situation stable but to do corrections manually (but always keeping in mind that trespassing baan sessions logic may do harm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">A view of GTM and its usage from a different angle<br />
<br />
We only allow Baan support to use GTM on our Live installation<br />
and issue a seperate password for each case we raise which requires GTM. We also keep a log of all these.<br />
<br />
Our reasons are <br />
<br />
1 If users are able to screw up the data then the software should be robust enough to prevent this and therefore it is an issue for Baan ( it is accepted that PC failures can detract from our rationale but we may be fortunate but have few of these)<br />
<br />
2 We will not allow any &quot;in house&quot; user access to GTM based on past experiences we had which caused the company much grief.<br />
This also means that the responsibility for GTM is only with Baan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Also worth noting that there is a log of GTM transactions. If something in the tables appears to be messed up, it doesn't hurt to run Print General Table Maintenance Log (ttaad4400m000) to see if anything was altered by GTM. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry , yes I missed that out<br />
<br />
We actually print these to excel and merge them with the Baan case on a monthly basis<br />
<br />
As I said we did have a large problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you saying that you are logging a case each month just to post the ttaad4100 log to Baan? Does that prove anything? Since it is a printout of an editable logfile...<br />
<br />
Or do you only post the ttaad4100 log to demonstrate that Baan is the only party that could have messed up the data and thus cause the problem you are registering in that particular case?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">For each case that requires GTM we print the appropriate log entries to excel and attach relevant case number for reference<br />
<br />
Currently running at 6 a month which has reduced from 12+ a month early in year due to implementation of increased number of solutions which have addressed the finance area</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">If GTM is needed, I think it indeed should be done by persons that know the datamodel and make *all* appropriate changes in *all* tables. Even not all support analysts do have that knowledge alas... :( Not even myself.<br />
<br />
That brings me to the next point: Having a log of ttaad4100 is only part of the story. The log does tell you which kind of action is done on which table, but it does not give you the old and new values...<br />
<br />
Do you also track the changes themselves (for example: create a dump before and after, then save the diff output)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to your first point that is the reason we only allow Baan support to make changes via GTM<br />
<br />
As far as the &quot;before&quot; state is concerned the details are logged on the case itself  but as for the post update state this is a matter for the relevant internal business analyst to record and be satisfied .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chanel_amyz</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 04:35</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW, how to get the log of ttaad4100?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chanel_amyz</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 04:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Something puzzling me:<br />
1.When I log in with user of &quot;Baan&quot; (the default user), and open ttaad4100, set information of &quot;tt, aad,200(User Data),000', the click &quot;y&quot;, system directly goes in<br />
2.Log in with another super user except of &quot;Baan&quot;, and open ttaad4100, set information of &quot;tt, aad,200(User Data),000', the click &quot;y&quot;, system pops up input box for Password!<br />
<br />
So what's the mechanism of this GTM? And which password is the wanted passward, the one set in &quot;ttadv0144m000&quot; or one set in somewhere else?</div></div><hr />

open the session, ttstperrlog and then find the option - log.ttaad4100 then print it to a display browser to see the GTM log.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">And both sessions do use the log.aad4100 in $BSE/log<br />
<br />
Administration tasks within your Baan system are done by a special administrator account named baan. This user should not be used for normal tasks, but for administration tasks only.<br />
<br />
User baan has special privileges within the system (comparable with Administator on NT), among which the use of ttaad4100.<br />
<br />
For other users there is a special autorisation required in the form of knowing the password (see session ttadv0144m000).<br />
<br />
As layed out in this trhead: using ttaad4100 may violate the datamodel restrictions and is risky to use. Do not log in as baan for normal operations (do not allow yourself to get accustomed to mending datacurruption with this session: leave that part to professionals). Change the password on ttaad4100 (login as baan and then set a new password) and keep it save.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I see that this very old thread was reactivated today by Siripuram for some odd non-understood reason. However, I looked through it, and saw OmeLuuk's comment about the ttaad4100 logfile which only shows you the tables changed, the date and the user, but do not show the old and new values. Ome Luuk opts for running a dump before ttaad4100 is started, and one on exit or so, and print the diff to a log (or maybe integrate it into the same Baan-log...?). Has OmeLuuk (are you back with us???) or anyone else ever done this? Anyone has better, more detailed logging of GTM??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, have done that (before/after dumps) on a case by case basis. But more often I've used a &quot;mini-dump&quot; approach. <br />
<br />
Say, for example, something is messed up in a gld batch. I will dump or print the before change and after change version of any records that are to be altered. Not as fail-safe as full table dump but often more workable.<br />
<br />
All the other earlier advice in this thread is still valid and important. <br />
Unless you really know what you're doing, and are willing/able to take responsibility for it, leave GTM to Baan or your support provider.<br />
Try the solution in your test company before even thinking about touching the live company.<br />
Document what you did. If the problem recurrs, there is a roadmap for the  next fix. If the &quot;fix&quot; impacts something that seems unrelated, you or someone else can more easily trace why.<br />
GTM is an emergency fix. Seek permanent solution through Baan to prevent future recurrences.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Scott, I agree fully with all the precautions to be taken related to usage of GTM. I however use GTM often at my company (I'm the Baan administrator), and would like to automate this additional logging; i.e. automatically when ttaad4100 is started, take dump/log, and on exit a new one, compare, and log the difference. How is this to be achieved?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">16th April 2005, 06:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Wish I could help you on that one. I'm a just [dis]functional guy -- not a techie -- and I have to go with common sense solutions. But I 've had to use GTM more frequently than my previous reply suggests. If someone out there can suggest a more fail-safe solution, we'll all be grateful!<br />

If I'm not mistaking I saw a thread recently (maybe even last week?) discussing a problem applying AFS for session like GTM ttiex1280m000 and others..?</div></div><hr />
