If so what were your experiences ?<br />
Any advice ?<br />
<br />
IE Did you do the Tools upgrades on SP9 and SP10  before you did the upgrades to the applications ?<br />
<br />
Or did you do SP9 tools and then the SP9 applications followed by the SP10 of each ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did them back-to-back, so first a complete install of SP8, followed by a complete install of SP9.<br />
<br />
There is theoretically nothing wrong with doing that. As always, just make sure you have back-ups of everything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to agree with Pat there, this has been a common question on the board before and it is viewed that many problems can occur with rushing SP updates. They should never be rushed or even short-cutted in anyway as problem solving then becomes a nightmare to sort out. <br />
<br />
Also check out the details of ALL patches to find out what might be needed, you will be surprised how many times you might need to restart Baan, Dump Data Definitions and many other things that are not listed in the manuals or documentations with the SP's.</div></div><hr />
