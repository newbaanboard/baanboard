Is it possible to use Service Pack Batch installer to install controlling service packs?<br />
I know that there are no problems with batch installer on a new installation but I am curious to know if I can install service packs in this way in my situation.<br />
Does anybody try to do something similar?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">14th April 2004, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I did some testing with the batch installer in a test environment with Baan IVc4 stnd SP5.  It was a copy of our production environment which has had many patches applied.<br />
<br />
The batch installer can be used in this situation, however you need to validate that no solutions are already installed on your system that come  after  the solutions included in the batch installer.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you can over-write your 'newer' objects with older objects included in the Batch Installer.<br />
<br />
Baan support gave me mixed messages concerning the use of the Batch Installer in existing environment, because of the risk of over-writing newer objects with objects from the Batch Installer.<br />
<br />
I used the batch installer, and then installed individual service packs up to SP 14.<br />
<br />
I was about to start a 'customization merge' process when I stopped working on this process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Do not use Batch Installer except for new installations. Then use only the most recent Installer desired. Use it once and move on with installing SP's after that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The batch installer consists of two parts:<br />
<br />
a) a big single patch, which is a collection of the result o finstalling single patches.<br />
<br />
b) a table dump to bring your PMC tables up to the same content, if you would have installed the patches one by one.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if you are sure, that your batch installer is higher than any other patch you are having, then you are fine. If not, then skip it!</div></div><hr />

First I installed controlling Service Packs and after that I only have to install a few patches to place patches in standard and patches in controlling on the same level.</div></div><hr />
