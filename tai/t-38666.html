<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David Eagar</div><div class="date">6th July 2007, 08:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We are soon to upgrade our Baan server from Windows 2000 onto a new server, Windows 2003. Are there any tips, tricks, do's or don'ts that can make this a smooth transition?<br />
<br />
Observing some of the posts here, I assume it is not a 'click the button and away you go' operation<br />
<br />
I have searched here and the Infor support for documentation, but not able to find much (other than new installations)<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated</div></div><hr />

Are you actually planning to upgrade the same hardware of just to transfer your existing environment to a new server which runs on W2003? <br />
<br />
We did use the second option given us the option to test first. We didn't encounter problems during that transition. <br />

<br />
i can share my exp. that this kind of operation is not the one step task.<br />
if you want to change the server box, you can migrate all data and the<br />
appl. to the new server. however, this kind of task is not in the document.<br />
you must find the exp. people since during the process, some error might <br />
happend.<br />
