<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">3rd November 2008, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I have three questions.  Please answer if you can.  Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
I notice that in our Baan, when it makes temporary files, it likes to put them in this directory: c:\temp<br />
<br />
For example:  When I want to export to certain formats, Baan will export the document to c:\temp\tmpfilename.extension, and then open the file. <br />
<br />
(1) Is this normal?  (2) Is this something I can modify?<br />
<br />
I'd like to specify this directory to be pointing to the Windows environment variable for temp.  (3) How can I force Baan to do this?<br />
<br />
All clients are running Windows OS, so the environment variable looks similar to this:<br />
<br />
TEMP=C:\DOCUME~1\USERNAME\LOCALS~1\Temp<br />
TMP=C:\DOCUME~1\USERNAME\LOCALS~1\Temp<br />
<br />
The problem with Baan using the C:\temp is manifested in having to create this directory, and assign it the appropriate permissions.<br />
<br />
If I can change it to reference the user profile, then I can be carefree, and not have to change anything else.<br />
<br />
If it MUST use this location, then I will know that I need to automate the following batch file as a tack-on to all installations:<br />
<br />
&gt; creating the directory, via &quot;md&quot;<br />
&gt; assigning the permissions, via &quot;cacls&quot;<br />
&gt; cleaning out the directory periodically, via &quot;schtasks&quot;<br />
<br />
Obviously, I like things as effortless as possible.  (What's the point of a computer, if I'm doing all the work?)<br />
<br />
I have some multi-user systems, so troubleshooting would be slightly easier, if I ever have to look at any issues with these files, if I know that userA and userB can't ever mix up their temp files.  I have not had this issue yet, but I can never predict what a user will do.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your assistance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't forget to write a simple batch script that will remove your temp files since Baan doesn't remove the automaticly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cesar Lopez</div><div class="date">6th November 2008, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">as Han mention BSE_TMP is the variable which controls that and depending of the version there are different ways to set a deferent TMP directory for different users, in baan5 or higger you can do it from the client in BW configuration jus with -set BSE_TMP=temporary_dir&quot;  and the same in Baan4 but redirecting to the user first to a shell to load the variables.<br />

Thank you for telling me that this is coming from the variable:<br />
<br />
BSE_TMP.<br />
<br />
Of course, I have a follow-up question:<br />
<br />
(1) Where do I find the variable:  BSE_TMP?<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
(2) Or, maybe more importantly, how can I check whether BSE_TEMP is being used for a command or not?  <br />
<br />
For example:  what if the Baan variable indeed points to the correct default location.  This wouldn't matter, though, if a command is hard-coded to place the file in &quot;C:\TEMP&quot; instead of &quot;BSE_TMP&quot;.  Even if I modify BSE_TMP, I won't get the correct result, unless I know what command/script was being called in the first place.<br />
<br />
More specifically, I am needing to know if there is a way I can check to see what script is being run when a button is clicked on.  This way, I can see exactly what command is being sent.  Then, I can parse that command, to figure out what happened.<br />
<br />
I am sure that I saw the Developer doing this one day, but I'm a neophyte, and don't know where to find this setting.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />

On windows it can be set as a system variable or via the baan/infor manager.<br />
<br />
Just check on oslevel if the variable is set.<br />
<br />
You are right: a programmer can decide not to use it although it will not be a good example of how to program.<br />
<br />
