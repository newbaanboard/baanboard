In 4c4 we do not nave the ams module. And the developement editor is different from the Baan notepad editor for text.  Input in the Notepad editor is immediately translated to internal Baan code for text.  In theory, if we switch languages with text, any labels etc, in the text would follow the language switch.<br />
<br />
I am after a way to choose other than notepad for baan text</div></div><hr />

<br />
But for text, I would like to switch from the notpad editor to another (wordpad, or even multi-edit, wscite, etc).  Is there a way to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hi all,<br />
<br />
Well, this thread is quite old, but i needed to implement an external editor, but not notepad.exe. let's say notepad++ for example<br />
<br />
I've read on an oher thread that it can be done with setting association for .c extension to the right editor, but it didn't work for me.<br />
<br />
it seems notepad.exe is launch via app_start function which will try to find it in :<br />
1. The directory where BW is loaded.<br />
2. Windows system directory.<br />
3. The windows directory<br />
4. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.<br />
<br />
So i've installed the binaries of notepad++ in the &quot;Baan IV\lib\user&quot; directory and renamed notepad++.exe in notepad.exe ... and it works. Texts are opened with notepad++<br />
<br />
depending on how you launch bw, you may need to install it in another directory (Baan IV\bin ??)<br />
<br />
I think this can work with any text editor which don't need any install (all config files for notepad++ are in &quot;Baan IV\lib\user&quot;).<br />
<br />
After tests, only probs i've found are the non-availabilty to change text language or edit key-words<br />
<br />
I hope this can help c4 users</div></div><hr />

The trick is that you must have the program in the search path of your pc if the program is pc based.  Myself I used SCITE that I have even customized further for Baan use.</div></div><hr />

it's the only way i found in c4 to edit a text with another program than standard baan editor or notepad<br />
