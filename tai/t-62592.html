<br />
High Availability Support<br />
In some instances, SSA Global can grant customers high availability support. To prevent a particular percentage of your licenses from being lowered after the grace period, you must specify the High Availability Support (HAS) option in your SLM Server configuration.<br />
Multiple logical SLM Servers<br />
In some instances, you might want to install and configure multiple logical Servers due to technical reasons, or if products require different versions of the SLM Server. This section describes both of these situations. A possible technical reason is if you want to license two different SSA Global applications that are installed in different network zones, for example, one application on your intranet and the other in your demilitarized zone (DMZ). The preferred way to deal with this situation is to install a logical SLM Server in every network zone, for example, one on the intranet and another in the<br />
DMZ.<br />
Another valid reason to install and configure multiple logical SLM Servers can be your geographical distribution and the related latency in your network. You then install a logical SLM Server for each geographical location.<br />
Note<br />
For each SLM cluster, an activation key must be requested. Bear in mind that<br />
SSA Global Validation does not count the amount of logical SLM Servers.<br />
SSA Global Validation only validates the total amount of licenses requested<br />
by customer.<br />

Trying to see what the advantage is over a virtual system.<br />
Is it worth the cost which is rather high?<br />
Yes we have HAS. 3 SLM licenses on 3 Production Servers and 1 in DR.<br />
Worth the cost? that's up to your SLA's and Business Model. In our 3rd Party Logistics implementations, the business/operations cannot have extensive downtime.</div></div><hr />
