I currently have BaaN IV installed on a SPARC/Solaris/Oracle machine, which is getting quite old. I'd like to migrate my system on a VMWARE vSPHERE 4 Virtual Machine for better security, manageability and performance.<br />
<br />
Is it possible? Has anyone some docs/howtos indicating how to do it?<br />
Where to start?<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
we have moved our older BIVc4 sites from HP-UX to SLES virtualized on ESXI.<br />
<br />
But don't know from Solaris.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

I think SLES or RHEL would be nice too...<br />
<br />
Going virtual means re-installing... (our SPARC is a RISC system and we need a x86/x64 platform...) so i am considering other OSes too.<br />

Should be no problem at all. Lots of customers are using baan on virtual systems these days. It's not different compared to a physical server migration.<br />
<br />
However there is one pitfall, the latest portingset using licd as license server don't allow you to run on a vm. This means you have to upgrade to SLM as license server. <br />
<br />
If you never have done it it's perhaps more wise to hire someone to do this for you.<br />
<br />
There is a document available &quot;How to move an Infor ERP environment to another host&quot; from infor which describe how to do this.<br />
<br />
Basicly:<br />
- install the database software;<br />
- install portingset<br />
- copy your BSE to the new host;<br />
- merge the portingset installation with your BSE;<br />
- Export the tools company from the old server and import it.<br />
- Install SLM<br />
You should have a running tools company at this point.<br />
Now export/import all your company data.<br />
After that you have to consider crontab/scheduled tasks and printer.<br />
<br />
Now you can let your users test. After they have accept it you copy your company data once again in e.g. a weekend and go live on monday.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your post. You are correct. However that means you will miss all future updates since Infor stopped development on the 6.1c portingset....<br />

*** Checked for currency: 10-JUL-2013 ***<br />
<br />
<br />
Purpose<br />
---------<br />
Explain to customers how Oracle supports our products when running on VMware<br />
<br />
Scope &amp; Application<br />
----------------------<br />
For Customers running Oracle products on VMware virtualized environments. <br />
No limitation on use or distribution. <br />
<br />
<br />
Support Status for VMware Virtualized Environments <br />
-------------------------------------------------- <br />
Oracle has not certified any of its products on VMware virtualized <br />
environments. Oracle Support will assist customers running Oracle products <br />
on VMware in the following manner: Oracle will only provide <br />
support for issues that either are known to occur on the native OS, or <br />
can be demonstrated not to be as a result of running on VMware. <br />
<br />
If a problem is a known Oracle issue, Oracle support will recommend the <br />
appropriate solution on the native OS.  If that solution does not work in <br />
the VMware virtualized environment, the customer will be referred to VMware <br />
for support.   When the customer can demonstrate that the Oracle solution <br />
does not work when running on the native OS, Oracle will resume support, <br />
including logging a bug with Oracle Development for investigation if required.<br />
<br />
If the problem is determined not to be a known Oracle issue, we will refer <br />
the customer to VMware for support.   When the customer can demonstrate <br />
that the issue occurs when running on the native OS, Oracle will resume <br />
support, including logging a bug with Oracle Development for investigation <br />
if required. <br />
<br />
NOTE:  Oracle has not certified any of its products on VMware.  For Oracle RAC, Oracle will only <br />
accept Service Requests as described in this note on Oracle RAC 11.2.0.2 and later <br />
releases.</div></div><hr />
