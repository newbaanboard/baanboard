<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Henslee</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in the beginning of a prototype of setting up Baan's Webtop 3.0 on Suse Linux.  In the documentation I have found so far, I see that it is compatible with Suse Enterprise Edition Version 8.  Since this is a prototype, I'm wondering if I can try purchasing and installing either the professional or personal editions of Suse Linux just to get this prototype going and keep costs down.  Has anyone done this before or is currently running WebTop on Suse Linux?  Will this work?  Please advise. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 08:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I would give it a try. According to my understanding it is purely Java based and the actuall Baan processes are still running on your application server.<br />
<br />
The webtop should run on more or less any platform, with the appropiate Java and Web Sever installation.<br />
<br />
Pay some attention to printing by using the web top. It was pretty much useless the last time I saw it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Marcus - can you elaborate a little more about the pringing issues you describe?  Are these issues you ran into with Version 3.0 of the Webtop or other versions.  We us the BW Client now with BW Print controlling the destination of our print output (for the most part).  Anything specific you care to elaborate on?  Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">What I saw, was a demonstration by Baan in Germany of WebTop 3.0 for BaanIvc4, but a pretty early version three month ago.<br />
<br />
If you pressed print, then it was opening a new HTML window with the first page of the report and buttons to page forward/backward. To actually get the printout on paper you had to print each singel page, apart fromthe fact, that a IE printout never has the exact format you might want.<br />
<br />
Baan promised then to have server based printing in the next version. I am installing the new version right now and will check it out soon.<br />

hi han, how did you solve that. baan says, only IE is supported.<br />

In this day and age, you'd think they would overcome that one BEFORE releasing the product!  In my 'world', users are helpless unless they have that physical piece of paper stuck in their pockets!  ;)<br />
<br />
Keep in touch!  Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Henslee</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">What is your configuration for your PC?  Is it pretty 'beefy' or will just about anything above a 300-500 MHz PC work okay for a prototype?  Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Henslee</div><div class="date">16th September 2004, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">In Suse Linux - I know that there is a setting whereby you can disguise your Konqueror configuration.  It might be able to imitete IE 6.0.  I'm still checking on this.  I thought I saw it somewhere.  Will advise if I find it.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you can help me out.  I'm soooooo close (I can taste it!)  I just can;t seem to get Suse to interact with our network.  I installed the Webtop and Tomcat.  I have started tomcat - but when I want to connect to the webpage for Webtop (or for that matter the tomcat page :8080), it says that it is looking for a proxy authentication to our proxy server.  It also says that the gateway could not retrieve the requested page!  It on the same server, why would it be going out to the network?  Any ideas??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">17th September 2004, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest the only thing I did was installing webtop/tomcat on my suse box. All the admin/login stuff I did was on IE on my XP client.<br />
<br />
Regarding the printing possibilities, it's now possible to us it like as if you are using bw. Webtop pushes bwprint to your client if it's not available.<br />
<br />
Furthermore it's important to realise that the combination of Sun Vm with webtop doesn't work. If you have it installed you need to turn this off. This can cause a problem if you need webtop and other applications that make use of Sun VM. The good thing is that SSA will deliver very soon a new release of webtop in which this is solved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Henslee</div><div class="date">17th September 2004, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the administrator console working.  I too (like you) wound up using IE from my Windows 2000 machine to access it.  I was trying to get LDAP to speak to Active Directory.  I was trying to get through our firewall to get this machine to the internet but dropped it because I basically have what I need.  The machine is on our network, I can see and talk to my other Unix Boxes and I can access this machine from IE from another machine on the network.  Next step is to recover a backup of our environment to our DR server.  This environment has the latest and greatest portingset and tools standard on it.  It has also been updated to SP15.  <br />

Thanks again for your help!</div></div><hr />
