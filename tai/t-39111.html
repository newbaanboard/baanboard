<br />
Need some help guys.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to set the parameter so that we can create seperate instance on the same sql 2005 server. Than we can assign each company to their own db (instance). <br />
<br />
I have search all the documentions i can get my hands on but can't find any telling me how to do it on an sql 2005 server. (only have oracle parameter)<br />
<br />
secondly, izzit better to create a seperate db user for each LN user or is better to let all the LN user share the same db user login? is there any different?<br />
<br />
* my thought is that using the same db login when have different instance will be easier to manage, since all need to refer back to the tools company.<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
create 2 db with seperate listener, create 2 database def pointing to each alias at the paramater field.<br />
eg: oracle_home=/app/oracle/product/xx,two_task=db1<br />
another for db2<br />
<br />
specified diff company to diff db def accordingly, eg: tabledef6.2 pointing to<br />
*:888:oracle(oracle_home=/app/oracle/product/xx,two_task=db1):N<br />
<br />
and also storage_param to point the company to use the correct tablespaces.<br />
<br />
for mssql nothing so far, still reading.</div></div><hr />

I myself dont have oracle in my environment, but was just interested in knowing if it was possible or not. Anyway, i had a link suggested to me in one of replies to my thread on 3-tier and i think it would best suit your requirement. Here is that link http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=25495<br />
