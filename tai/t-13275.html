We have BaaN IV c4 with Service packs till 9. While upgrading to SP9, we had to download individual solutions and lots of their dependencies midway.<br />
Now, I want to take a backup of the application/components. If I take it via session &quot;Export Data Dictionary&quot; (ttiex1280m000), then only the &quot;latest&quot; object which is being patched up in a VRC would get backed up. I also want to backup the history of the objects, something which the PMC keeps track of.<br />
How do I back the application components so that in case of a disaster I restore all the objects and also the PMC data so that PMS installing/uninstalling can still be utilized after restore.<br />
<br />
Can data backup/restore of PMC tables do the required thing?<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />
Manu</div></div><hr />

<br />
Export dump backup consists of latest objects as u pointed out and single components may be diffifult to be restored. If the export is based on sessions then all components may not be exported for dyanmically evaluated components.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
One more thing, is there any easier way than &quot;Export Data Dictionary&quot; session to backup the s/w components?<br />
Because, it takes only one PVRC at a time.<br />
Moreover, with some PVRCs I get a BW error message 2555 (which means ORA-1555) when I backup and the session terminates.<br />
What is the solution for this?<br />
I searched thru the net and understood that probably the ROLLBACK segments are lesser than required for the task. Is there any other easir way than increaseing the ROLLBACK segments?<br />
<br />

 <br />
<br />
A lot of improvements have been made after SP4 to do commits in between big transactions to avoid that error. You are now on SP9, so I don't expect much more optimizations from the code (unless it's your customized sessions that are still generating problems).<br />
So, you really have to check your rollback segs. and tune them.</div></div><hr />
