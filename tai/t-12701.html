<br />
Since you want to block all users except a few superusers, the fastest is to change the ufiles (in $BSE/lib/user) permissions to 600 and bsp ownership except the ufiles of the super users (that should be 660 and bsp owned).<br />
<br />
To re-enable them all again, just change the permissions to 660.</div></div><hr />

1. Change the permission of /baan/bse/lib/ipc_info file to 700. It will not allow any user except bsp, root to login.<br />
2. Hash(#) the entries of users in /baan/bse/lib/informix/inf_users file for all users other than Super users. We have made the group of users in this file which makes the work all the more easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's very easy to apply.<br />
