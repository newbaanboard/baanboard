<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vineetu1</div><div class="date">22nd February 2007, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
We are using the default time out for all the users as 10 mins via the normal procedure of defining it in a file called all in the defaults folder.<br />
<br />
Now we have a requirement to give some users timeout settings of 30 mins.<br />
<br />
How can I achieve this ?<br />
<br />
I have already tried to define it in the users default file in 'user' folder, which works, but whenever any new user is created and user is dumped, the settings gets replaced with the default settings (i.e. 10 mins)<br />
<br />
Also I do not want to use the option of using the BW Client settings, as the users might know it and missuse it.<br />
<br />
Any solutions<br />
(I have searched the forum for session timeout, and my search engine could not find any particular solution)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could elaborate on it with an example (on Windows OS)<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never done it for Windows but I think it should work.<br />
<br />
If you create a script  that runs ntbshell you can then point your bshell entry inside $BSE/lib/ipc_info to this script instead of directly to ntbshell. If that works then you can add some logic before the actual ntbshell invocation in your new script to set up your timeout variables depending on who is connecting. <br />
<br />
In UX there is the logname command that gives you the UX account name. With that info you can then check a configuration file that could contain something like:<br />
<br />
peter,60<br />
tom,90<br />
charlie,120<br />
<br />
where the number would be the time out for each user. Then you set up your variables accordingly.</div></div><hr />

  The &quot;session_timeout&quot; setting in your user file setting($bse\lib\user\u&lt;username&gt;) wont be erased and replaced by the default setting unless and untill you run the Convert User Data to Runtime Data Dictionary for all the users. If you run this specifically for the user you just created, all the other user files are left untouched, based on what i seen. <br />

Suke suggestion can be used. But there is a disadvantage of using that. On client settings may be you can use -- set -SESSION_TIMEOUT=0 . May be you can apply some policy on windows server. Apart from this I think that there is no way to solve this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vineetu1</div><div class="date">25th February 2007, 07:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea !!<br />
<br />
This is a tough one...I searched Baanboard and was sure this sort of query was not addressed...<br />
<br />
But how can we achieve what Ecarceller  has suggested in Windows..<br />

Lets give some thought on this...pls give ur suggestions..</div></div><hr />

In $BSE/ipc_info you change your bshell entry to point to your script instead of the bshell binary (remember this can affect everyone in your system so do it in test)<br />
Suppose you have a file called config.txt where you have one line per account  with 2 columns. First one is account name and second one is the desired timeout. This is one thing I would do (and most likely can be improved). BTW I am just typing here so I did not even tested it. This is just to give you an idea of what can be done in the script that will replace bshell6.1:<br />
<br />
account=`logname`<br />
configfile=$BSE/scripts/config.txt<br />
for i in `awk '{print $1}' $configfile`<br />
do<br />
	if [ $i eq $account ]<br />
	then<br />
		timeout=`grep $i $configfile|awk '{print $2}'`<br />
		export SESSION_TIMEOUT=$timeout<br />
	fi<br />
done<br />
${BSE}/bin/bshell6.1 $*</div></div><hr />
