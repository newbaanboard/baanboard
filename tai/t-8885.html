<br />
How difference between SP8 and SP 10 for standard C4 can influence on Baan's add on solution instalation?<br />
<br />
We have the following situation:<br />
We need to install Baan's add on solution for BIVc4.<br />
<br />
In the Baan's instalation guide it is specified that we must have SP 8 for standard BIVc4 installed.<br />
We have SP 10.<br />
 <br />
My question is:<br />
Can we install the solution on SP 10? <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />

And if your system is updated till SP10 then this solution should be there on your system. Check your system for this solution number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the mayor dependencies can be the use of the ability to print to XML. This caused a change in the $BSE/include6.1/bic_* files used to create objects. So objects created with these include files also need the support of this in the tools objects (in casu the ttstprepdll). This change also required a portingset update (because bic and repgen use the same $BSE/include6.1). This dependency is also documented in the SP requirement.</div></div><hr />
