<br />
How to get the files (objects) in UNIX which have changed because of a patch/solution installtion?<br />
i.e. I would like to know if I have installed a solution/patch sat today, ; give me the list of objects (program scripts/program objects.etc) which are changed after the installation?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 23:08</div></div><div class="posttext">find $BSE/application -type f -mtime -y -exec ls -l {} \;<br />
(where y is the # of days since you installed a patch), gives you a listing of all files that have been touched in the past y days.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

in ttiex1284m000 you have the option extract only. you will extract a file dump.l. Look for the objects,forms,reports that would be replaced. After installation of the patch use bic_explode6.1 or bic_explode in NT to see that paths of the objects,forms, reports, etc.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
The scripts attached we use to check in Unix for baan patch/mods before applying.<br />
<br />
It check the current objects and backup the ones the patch contains. So you have a backup to go.<br />
<br />
Please change the VRC names inside the script to substitute yours. You need to check the script before you run. This is written for HP Unix.<br />
<br />
Hope this may help.<br />
<br />
thanks,Eric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms</div><div class="date">6th June 2002, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Eric, I will go through the scripts...hope that the scripts are w.r.t PMC (we have Baan5c with PMC)!!<br />
<br />
Also, Fransesco, I have iinstalled Service Pack yesterday and would like to know the objects change, hence I gave the following comand  <br />
<br />
find $BSE/application  -type f -mtime -1 -exec -l {} \;<br />
<br />
There is no output. Is the syntax OK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">6th June 2002, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the service pack didn't update any objects? ;)<br />
<br />
The syntax looks ok to me (correct me when I'm wrong), not to mention completely POSIX, but the 1 day actually means a full 24 hours. Maybe a little more patience?<br />
<br />
Either that or try it with mtime -0<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
