<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ngschroth</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted some advice on the need to create different package combinations in both BaanIV and BaanERP.  Our enviroment is only used for DEMO and DEVELOPMENT, so my guess is that the seperate VRC's could all share the one standard PC.<br />
<br />
Since I already created seperate PC's and will be creating new companies for each, I wanted to understand this better.  We have no need to isolate functionality, just report and sessions that have been changed and the data used with them.<br />
<br />
Oppinions from those of you that have more experience in this area is appeciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 19:37</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, it is always a good idea to have a separate VRC structure/package combination for production and whatever else you have (call it TEST, DEVELOPMENT, whatever).  This way, you can test not only changes you make to forms, reports, scripts, etc., but you can also test service packs, patches, etc. without worrying about your production environment crashing.<br />
<br />
As far as a DEMO environment, I guess that would depend on your intended use.  Some people use it for training.  In that case, you could just make a separate demo company that utilizes the production package combination.<br />
<br />
I hope that helped some.  I'm sure others will weigh in on this, too.</div></div><hr />
