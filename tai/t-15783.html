<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rbritto</div><div class="date">28th June 2004, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 8 servers and total of 620 licenses. The support contract is costing too much. Also we are in the process of changing servers and validation is required. We have a high availability cluster HPUX cluster environment for 1 site.<br />
<br />
As any one stop support from Baan ?.<br />
<br />
Also I have the following questions regarding License Sharing,<br />
<br />
1. Can anyone provide information on license sharing, with servers in multiple locations and the supporting the cluster environment ?. <br />
<br />
2. Can we limit the number of licenses for each server ?.<br />
<br />
3. Is it possible to have license sharing between 4b, 4c4 environments ?.<br />
<br />
4. The server requirements for a license server ?.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
