Our environment has following components<br />
<br />
BaaN4CIV, NT, SQL 7.0<br />
<br />
<br />
In this month we have found out lot of entries that exists in their respective package but the same has not been posted as Integration transactions in Finance. For example for a production order that is closed, it is showing nothing in finance. Secondly many production order related entries are not coming to finance. As a result, production result is not coming correct. This has happened for few days only.<br />
<br />
I want to know &quot; Whether Running Reorganize tables will correct these entries&quot;<br />

I am not clear on where the records are/are not<br />
<br />
Are the records that are not transferred to finance in tdgld416 (not yet posted)? These would also be in tfgld410 but would have a flag set to indicate that they had not yet been posted. Records get posted to tfgld102 from tfgld410.  They then get finalised in finance transaction processing and posted to tfgld106 (which is in effect all the journal entries) and other GL tables updated. <br />
<br />
It is very unlikely that Reorganise Table would fix this problem. If it did it would mean (to me) that the database software was in bad shape.<br />

did you have these problems before the reorg (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12690) that went wrong?</div></div><hr />

The mamimum would be a reference integrity check but this seems not to be the case.<br />
From what you mention, certain records were not updated when they should, this points to a problem on the application, not the data itself.<br />
You should check what has been installed lately or what customizations have been made lately that can have an impact in the &quot;affected&quot; sessions.</div></div><hr />
