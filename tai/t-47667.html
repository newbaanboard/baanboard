I am facing a problem related to the extract the dmp extension files. we are going to migrate the IS3 to IS5. we download the files from from Infor Site. All of these files are in dmp extension. Now we are extracting these files one by one. It takes more time. Because these files are bulk in quantity (App 1800 files)<br />
<br />
How it is possible that the all files extract in one shot. Please help me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">For a second i thought you would be using the pmc scan solution session {ttpmc2200m000} which allows you to define a folder where all the files are for scanning more than one solution. However this is not supported in session ttiex1284m000 as it specifically asks for each files...<br />

We goes into the Test Login and Run ttpmc2200mooo. This Session show an error &quot; Default text group unknown, please enter default text group in &quot;Maintain Default Text Groups&quot;&quot;. <br />
<br />
I Also entered this in the session 'tttxt1113m000' and run this session again. The problem was same. <br />
<br />
The TEST user is a Super user.<br />
<br />

   You would have to first log into/change to the tools company (000). Once in the tools company open session Maintain Default Text Groups by User {tttxt1113m000} and then assign the text group &quot;text&quot; to the user (TEST in your case). This will enable you to open the session Scan Solution File {ttpmc2200m000}.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your valuable input. I Permission to TEST User in 000 Tools company and session is open. <br />
<br />
Now the problem is that, is this session store all the files in the system automatically or we save these files in other folder before saving in the registry of the system.<br />
<br />
Second Question is How we give that folder which contains all files or path given for every files.<br />
<br />
Please suggest.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

You can keep the files that you downloaded in any folder in any drive of your choice. I am not sure about the structure of the files that you downloaded , as to whether they are all in one single folder or if they have subfolders amongst them. But ideally all the files that needs to be scanned should be inside one single folder.<br />
 <br />
As far as your second question is concerned: In the column named &quot;Solution File&quot; in Scan Solution File {ttpmcs2200m000} session, enter the path where all the files are located. <br />
For instance, if all the files are located in &quot;Temp&quot; folder on your C drive then you give &quot;C:\Temp\&quot;. Once you click on continue, Baan would ask if you want to scan the whole folder. Click on &quot;Yes&quot;..<br />
