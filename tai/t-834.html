<br />
we are getting an error when we start baan with rc.start.<br />
the error msg is like below:<br />
<br />
Load Runtime Data Dictionary in Shared Memory<br />
srdd_init6.1: Can not open 'lib/fd6.1.c1' error 2<br />
Can't find object ({package=c1}F_OBJ:otisfc0505;otisfc0505) errno 2<br />
<br />
then object presents in the path: <br />
..$BSE/application/tiB40_c1/ptisfc <br />
<br />
What can be the reason for this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<br />
Try to recreate your srdd_tab6.x file by doing a &lt;CTRL-D&gt; from the session Maintain Shared Memory Data [ttaad4150m000]. Then stop and restart Baan and see if the error still occurs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think if you just recreate the file it will still try to load the objects in question into shared memory on startup.<br />

<br />
You are correct. In my previous answer I was assuming that information in the application data dictionary was already up-to-date. It is of course always good to check that first and then convert to runtime. In that way I only gave half of the answer :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the little information you provided, it may be that the problem has to do with lack of braces.<br />
<br />
You posted   $BSE/.....<br />
<br />
Perhaps you meant  ${BSE}/.....<br />
<br />
If so, then I am wrong, but if you do put in the {}, it should parse properly and the error message ought to disappear.</div></div><hr />
