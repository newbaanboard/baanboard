<br />
We faced a serious problem here. <br />
<br />
We are moving the O/S and Baan application from the old hard disk to a new disk. We are sure that all the files (including the hidden files were copied to the new disk including the .brand6.1). But, when we tried to start the Baan application, the above mentioned error message prompted.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
With Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is actually the documented and expected behaviour of Baan. The .brand6.1 file can not be copied or recreated eg. from tape. I am not sure how Baan implemented this origionally. Rumours have it, that they store the inode of the file in the file itself and compare it.<br />
<br />
What do you do?<br />
<br />
a) Start Baan, ie. the shared memory<br />
b) Log in at best with the ASCII interface<br />
c) It will complain about the missing license but it should show you the menu<br />
d) Go to: tools -&gt; SW Installation -&gt; Misc<br />
e) Execute &quot;Patch objects after system crash&quot;<br />
<br />
After step (e) your users can work normally, but get a warning message about 30 days.<br />
<br />
If you face problems in step (c), eg. no menu is shown, then log into another system like your test system and get the session code of the session and start the session directly by passing the session as an argument. The sessioncode is something like ttiex3...., but I do not know it by hart at the moment.<br />
<br />
Now, if all you did is a disk change, but the rest of your HW is the same (particular the serial of your first CPU), then you can use your old validation data to create a new brand6.1 file from within baan, by executing first &quot;Validate tools set&quot; and then &quot;configure application&quot;.<br />
<br />
I hope that helped. <br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your advise. I don't think we can migrate to the new disk successfully without your help.<br />
<br />
I also would like to share with others regarding my experience for this project. We are migrated the Baan System to the new disk due to the free space issue (Other hardware are remained unchanged). After successfully move all the old disk content to the new disk, we found Baan is not running properly. When we start the Baan application, there is an error prompted &quot;licd6.1: Can't run - Please brand your software&quot;.<br />
<br />
The followings are the steps taken to solve the issue (thanks to Markus):<br />
1. Login as root<br />
2. Execute &quot;Patch objects after system crash&quot; session<br />
3. Execute &quot;Validate Tools Set&quot; session<br />
4. Logout<br />
5. Login as bsp<br />
6. Execute &quot;Patch objects after Error Solving&quot; session<br />
7. Logout<br />
<br />
Note: No new validation key needed since all the hardware remained unchanged except the disk.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
With Regards,<br />
