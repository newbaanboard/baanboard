We have installed Service pack-8 on our BaaN IVc4 environment and while doing the installation of Service pack 9, it was mentioned in the installation guide that one need to have the latest porting set.<br />
Is it necessary to have installed the same before installing the Service pack-9. or can one go ahead and install the service pack 9.<br />

however you need to see what the latest porting set was when SP9 was released !<br />
<br />
We are upgrading to SP10 and it does say upgrade to the latest porting set  again . This time we did upgrade to the very latest one which we did 6.1c.06.06.<br />
<br />
From SP 9 you will have noticed the tools can be installed seperately from the applications which we found a good step forward . Unfortunately the installation &quot;guidance book&quot; does not segregate the instructions !</div></div><hr />

<br />
your Portingset should be 6.1c.06.X when you use SP9.<br />
<br />
Some Sessions will have problems when you use an older PS. <br />
When you just install SP9, but not SP9-Tools-Patch the risk of having problems is not very high (tried that once), but if you install SP9-Tools, , too, you will have trouble e.g. in compiling reports etc.<br />
<br />
If possible, i would update SP, SP-Tools and PS...<br />

<br />
't Is better to keep up.<br />
<br />
We're running SP11 and SP12 is in the drawer, waiting to be installed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">webslave</div><div class="date">17th March 2003, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a problem with sp9 installation<br />
110323stnd is prerequisite for instalation<br />
and it is distributed with sp9<br />
<br />
when i went about instalation of 110323stnd,<br />
i scanned whole directory and now it will not<br />
install 110323stnd but asks for stb40c4_9 (tools)<br />
<br />
i dont know if it is right thing to do or<br />
to put more general question,<br />
can scaned files be 'purged'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">17th March 2003, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">hm, follow installation instructions...<br />
You must now fool the system to have it thinking that 110323 (and related solutions) do not belong to SPx to install them before continuing. Better is: ask support to give you advice on how to cope with your situation.<br />
<br />
I consider it too risky to tell you what you could and could not do. I do not want to get sued afterwards if things go wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did not install sp9, i just scaned it</div></div><hr />
