Is it applying the customization all over again .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th April 2003, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, usually you have to check the forms and redo the updates if there have been changes.<br />
<br />
You can make it easier to check by comparing the c4 and c2 base versions using the Compare Package VRC utility (you have to have them loaded in the same environment).   If there are no changes c2-c4, you can copy your customized version directly.  If there are changes, I am afraid they have to be evaluated individually.  Usually once you get on a roll, you can do this in a day or 2 if it is really just forms &amp; menus.  You can also take that opportunity to look at the new c4 changes and see if your changes are still required.<br />
<br />
If you are planning on installing c4 on a new server, if possible move the c2 base and custom level VRCs over to it for comparing and upgrading.  Having the c2 environment available on the same server is invaluable, you don't need the company and data overhead, just the components for upgrading.  You can remove it when you are done.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
