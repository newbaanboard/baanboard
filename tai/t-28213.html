Please contact system administrator!&quot;. The error was detected when customizing grids in sessions tdpur4100m900 and tdsls4100m900.<br />
<br />
Did anyone have this problem?<br />
Should I uninstall tools solutions that include ttadv9200 as a component?<br />

<br />

Enhanced (off course) but the theory behind it is still the same: you can load one or more solutions or a whole bundle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kansel</div><div class="date">5th October 2006, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
I have had the same problem and noticed that it was related to the portingset. The problem went away after installing the latest portingset (8.2b pa 3188).<br />
I am running on a Windows 2003 server with MSSQL 2000 SP4 as database server.<br />
<br />
I also had problems with some users logging on getting security errors. This is a bug in portingset 7.6b.01 where the userids in the file $BSE$\lib\msql\msql_users needs to be in all upper case or the first letter in uppercase and the rest in lower case. This happens for random users<br />
<br />
Remember to install solution 200869 (tools solution) and run the ttcor2260m000 program BEFORE updating to the latest portingset.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

English	 Trying to save grid customizations results in a 'Error saving customizations. Contact your system administrator' mshown in the statusbar.<br />
TOOLS VERSION(S):<br />
7.6_a2, 7.6_a3<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
&quot;Customize Grid&quot; (ttadv9200)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Trigger customize grid option in a session. An option 'Apply to zoom session as well' exists and has been checked. Press OK, an message 'Error saving customizations. Contact your system administrator' will be shown in the statusbar.<br />
<br />
This happens when the session was not 'grid customized' and OK is pressed without having made changes. And can happen when the session was already 'grid customized' in a LN version before fp2 and OK is pressed<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
When the option 'Apply to zoom session as well' has been checked, the grid customizations will be saved for the zoom variant of the session as well. It could happen that it was tried to save a field customization for a field, that in this LN version actually didn't exist anymore.<br />
<br />
Before the save for the zoom variant is done, the fields will be checked on existance in the LN version.</div></div><hr />
