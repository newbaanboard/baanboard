<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">4th June 2002, 08:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a need for users to be out of Baan while doing sequential dump of tables (in a job)? <br />
If answer is Yes - how can I temporary kick-out users (if there is any hanging by night...) in a job SCRIPT !? <br />
Aix/BaanIVc4 <br />
If answer is No - is there a problem of locked tables for dump, or dump can be done on table which is accessed in moment of dump?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Users can lock tables so you will not be sure that you can dump the table.<br />
<br />
Scripts can be called from out of the job, however you should be root if you want to be able to kill other users processes or should use a script with a setuid bit on.<br />

<br />
is there some script (or script repository on the web) which will help me to not forget something needed in script (like env. variables and so ...) for UNIX(AIX) / BAAN IVc.<br />
<br />
I'm not so new in Unix; but I'm real newbie in Baan adm.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

Therefore you should stop all user and job processes, then run your bdbpre. The easiest to get rid of running bshells is to make a shell script.</div></div><hr />

<br />
our factory works 7 * 24  and can not log off user to take dumps.<br />
<br />
will there be problems if I need to use this dumps with  bdbpost <br />
<br />

<br />
If you don't have any errors in your dump log file, then it should be OK. But check your log file after each backup to be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">4th June 2002, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">But Caner.B is using informix and the informix tools support online backup, so that shouldn't be a problem. <br />
<br />
However Karlovac is using bisam, that totally different.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much the software is changing I would go for a weekly backup of the baan software and on a daily basis make a backup of the bisam files.<br />
<br />
You can simple use the unix tools (cpio/tar/dump etc.) to backup the .bdt and .bid files. You don't need any baan env. settings for that.<br />
<br />
To stop the bisam db you can simple use the rc.stop script which contains all the necessary env. variable already.<br />

<br />
even with no errors in the log of bdbpost, your dump is most likely inconsistent!<br />
<br />
Depending of the size of your company, your dump might take several hours.<br />
<br />
If at 22.00 you start dumping lets say the tc tables.<br />
And at 23.00 somebody is changing tc and ti and at 24:00 you are dumping ti tables, then your dump is inconsistent.<br />
<br />
This will not result in any errors in the logs.<br />
<br />
If you are actually a 24x7 company, then you definetely should use a database like oracle or informix. If you use a database, then you can easily use the online backup feature and be on the safe side!<br />
<br />
If you still use tbase, then you have to migrate. There is no way around.<br />
<br />
Sorry<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th June 2002, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep Markus is right. Especially when your backup takes a good while you while loose logical consistency within your data unless only read-only operations are performed. If you are already using Informix than I would definatively recommended taking a look at the Informix backup tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caner.B</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 08:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using Informix Dynamic Server Version 7.31.FD1<br />
<br />
and every day I take backups from the informix side including logical logs.<br />
<br />
I think that  I can use the dumps by loosing just one or a few tables from baan instead of the informix backups.<br />
 <br />
And I know that the baan dump are can never %100 consistent for me , but I don't have any alternatives.<br />
<br />
Thank you all very much<br />

This thread od messages is like a good online backup cookbook.<br />
Only one thing is missing (my opinion):<br />
Does someone has a solution in form of script for all that was said for Bisam database (it should be helpful for other db too):<br />
<br />
Story goes;<br />
In a time of night (day) when smallest number of users are active in Baan - Baan Job takes control <br />
Job should contain unix script which will:<br />
     1. Write to all users that should logout after 30 minutes <br />
         (wall for unix/ascii users and ? for bw users)<br />
     2. After 30 minutes kill users and make Baan unavailable for <br />
         all users ascii/bw/bx  users<br />
     3. Do the bdbpre (command line) dump of tables<br />
     4. Make all steps to make Baan available to users.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have good will to share her/hes script with all of us.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
