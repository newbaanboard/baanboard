<br />
Wanted to bring this up for discussion. I'm using LN FP5 and FP6. I wanted to find out how everyone handles their missing help files and their fallback scenarios for their webhelp. Other than loading pretty much everything from solution #142197 so that it can fulfill most of the default fallback scenarios in the system. I still find a couple of places where the help text is missing.<br />
<br />
 Is there any check list that Infor has to which sessions have a help file ? Updating or Rebuilding the Index didnt help. Running the Check Links in Help content showed me quite a few errors with missing images, broken links etc ..<br />
etc.. I'm looking for a better way to keep the help file system organized so the users would have a easier time working with it.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
