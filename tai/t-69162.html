Baan4c User switched to Tools Company? <br />
<br />
We are trying to set up in the Test company for the user to run TTaad4100 General Table Maintennce.Â  The Session ttaad2100m000 Maintain User Data (000) shows correct company (100) but the user Me. Logs into the test company is set to company (000). Somehow the user was switched to tools company, But the Baan user maintenance, displays correctly as co100.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would make sure that you recreate runtime the runtime data dictionary for the user.  I would also make sure nothing is in your bwc startup command line.  I believe I once was able to put something like BSE_COMPNR=xxx to get into other companies like 000.</div></div><hr />

(sorry) But when I go to any of the sessions it gives me errors messages and wont even let me look at regular sessions.</div></div><hr />
