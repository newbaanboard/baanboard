<br />
The solution files from Baan support is .tar.gz file.<br />
I can use winrar, 7-zip, tar tools to extract it.<br />
At last, I can get a info file and a directory, under this directory, there is a file call solution number, without extension.<br />
<br />
But I'm sure this file is a compressed file.<br />
<br />
My question is somebody know how to extract this file?<br />
<br />
<br />
If we using ttiex1284m000, how to fill in the path file?<br />
<br />
thank you very much.<br />

Thank you,<br />

Based on my observations, the session ttiex1284m000 does not interpret the new LN PMC dump file format.<br />
<br />
Jeffers,<br />
<br />
What are you trying to do? You can scan in the patch using the session ttpmc2200s000 and then go to process solution session ttpmc2100m000, the solution is available in the system to see its components list, dependencies, or any release notes. If you use the option 'check to install' it can even determine, the dependencies in the custom VRC layers which are impacted by installing this solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to get the program script without install the solution.<br />
I find the solution file (without extension) should include many files together.<br />
Such as dump.x.<br />
But I don't find a way to extract it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank for you quick reply.<br />

<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
PMC has option to install and uninstall. You can install the solution, copy the program script as per your requirement and then uninstall it.<br />
<br />
Just a workaround...;) <br />

Then you have also the possibility to print the differences with session &quot;Compare Package VRCs&quot; (ttadv6450m000).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the easiest is what Kaustubh has suggested if you want to see the scripts, and if you go for the session ttadv6450m000 then you will get only components differeing in two of your VRCs...<br />
<br />
All the best...<br />
