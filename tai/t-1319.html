<br />

<br />
i don't understand what is the matter ! <br />
<br />
The features of our machine are:<br />

 Oracle alert file<br />
 TNS listener log file<br />
 Oracle user trace files<br />
How often does the disconnect happen? Are all users impacted? How do users connect? (BA/BW) Do you users connect through a WAN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tianalita</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">i receive errors in 2 files :<br />
<br />
log.oracle8 and log.bshell<br />
<br />
&quot;the message is the same in the 2 files : lost connection to the database engine&quot;<br />
<br />
what is the name of TNS listener file ? <br />
<br />
the disconnect happen every hour.<br />
<br />
All users are impacted.  There are 10 users now. BW. the users are connected through the LAN.</div></div><hr />

for alert file: look in your $ORACLE_BASE/admin/SID/bdump</div></div><hr />

i have not the alert file &quot;bdump&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you by any chance install this Oracle version recently, or rather...did it ever work correctly for you?<br />
<br />
I have not worked with 8.i myself yet, but the word on the street is that the install of 8.1.7 can be easily goofed which will result in the ORA-01041 errors that you are seeing.<br />
<br />
Two more questions.<br />
<br />
Do the disconnects happen around the same time or throughout the day?<br />
<br />
What are the properties of your tablespace?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 02:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not found much info about this error. It seems to be an Oracle bug. In OTN web, a search for the ORA error that appears in your log, results in the link bellow.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Administering Failover of the Applications<br />
Oracle Real Application Clusters Guard restores service quickly. The application must restart transactions when it receives an Oracle message that indicates that failure has occurred. <br />
<br />
Failing over the application when the primary instance fails is straightforward. The application sessions receive the ORA-1089 and ORA-1034 Oracle errors for new requests and the ORA-1041, ORA-3113, and ORA-3114 Oracle errors for active requests. These errors must be trapped by the application. At reconnection, the application connects transparently to the new primary instance. For example, in the case of a web server, the server threads are restarted for each connection pool against the new primary instance. The current transactions are then resubmitted by the clients. <br />
<br />
Failing over the application when the primary node fails is not straightforward because of TCP/IP time-out. TCP/IP time-out is a significant problem for high availability. It occurs when a node fails without closing the sockets, because new requests can be made to an IP address that is unavailable. For active requests, the delays to the client are the values for TCP_IP_ABORT_CINTERVAL and TCP_IP_ABORT_INTERVAL. For sessions that are waiting for read/write completion, the delay is the value for TCP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL. The values for these TCP/IP parameter should be tuned at each site. <br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Note: <br />
These parameters are specific to your operating system. See your operating system documentation for more information.  <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
TCP/IP time-outs are addressed in Oracle Real Application Clusters Guard by using relocatable IP addresses and the call-home feature. Because Oracle Real Application Clusters Guard moves the IP addresses, active requests for an address do not wait to time out. Requests for connection are refused immediately and are routed transparently to the new primary instance. Requests that issue SQL statements receive a broken pipe error (ORA-3113), allowing the application to restart. The application should detect this error and take appropriate action.&quot;</div></div><hr />
