<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_info</div><div class="date">21st July 2007, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
We are in process of moving to new baan server with new OS AIX5.3 and DB oracle 10g from AIX4.3 and oracle 8.0. currently we r on baan 5c SP3 and moving to Baan 5c Sp18<br />
We have lot of customization on standard components (like tables, scripts, forms etc..) <br />
My I need any suggestion, advice or help how to retrofit the components on new service pack.  <br />
<br />
should I copy a session to cus VRC and look for the changes in old server. and redo them again in new server...<br />
<br />
Also we have around 15 GB of data how do I transfer that data to new server. keeping in mind that some tables might have been changed in sp 18 from SP3. <br />
<br />
There is a table with 1 GB of data in it and 4.5 million rows how should i move that table.<br />
<br />
any thought, advice or suggestion are more than most welcome.<br />
Regards<br />

Customized VRC is a good approach as it gives you room for testing your customized objects in the new SP before applying it on the standard VRC objects. Dont forget to go through the SP documentation as it details out what changes are brought forward with each release. <br />
 <br />
To move tables, the best way(according to me) is the sequential dump. Take a dump of the table and restore it. <br />
 <br />
Good Luck on the migration..you need it!!<br />
