We recently closed the acquisition of a company that has Baan. We are planning to move the system from their DC to our DC. Currently, Baan is running on HP Unix and Ora DB 9. In order to move the system to our DC, Baan has to run on Redhat Linux and Ora DB 12g.<br />
<br />
My question is, can we replicate Baan onto our server or should we install Baan from scratch and then migrate the data? Any recommendation or direction on how to approach this scenario would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Check for the Porting set release notes for the supported Operating systems and Database versions. <br />
Oracle 9, 10, 11 are desupported by the vendor now so you have to upgrade the database to the latest Oracle 12 release.<br />
You have to install the latest Porting set on Redhat Linux and then export/import the software from the old to new system or clone the file systems (with exceptions of bin/etc etc.). Also ensure, you have the correct kernel parameters for the Operating system.<br />
Test all your custom shell scripts, applications and performance.</div></div><hr />

I would contact them - we just moved to solaris 11 and oracle 12g and it required a porting set upgrade and with that it required a new license manager(I think it went to SLM or something like that).

We are doing similar migration except Redhat Linux. Infor support contract is getting delayed and with aggressive timelines we wanted to get this moving. Any alternate options for Infor support? <br />

So may be on a high level would you mind letting me know the migration strategy. Did you install Baan on the new environment and then imported the data and other required files? Or if you followed export/import DD, I would like to know more details and steps you followed. And any issues you encountered during the process would be highly appreciated. Thank you.<br />
