<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">20th November 2023, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm planning how to set up a development VRC in BaanIVc4 to meet a SOX requirement to show how we copy code to production (I had another thread about that here: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=222415#post222415).<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now we have a custom/working VRC derived from Standard (&quot;PROD&quot;). We only have one server. We do have a test company in the PROD vrc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I need to create a &quot;DEV&quot; VRC for development and copy changes from that to PROD. I would also move the test company to the DEV VRC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Should DEV be derived from Standard or from PROD?<br />
<br />
I am hoping that if I derive it from PROD, the dev environment will be able to use everything in PROD without having to copy it all to DEV: I'll only need to copy objects that are being changed. If an object is being worked on, users in PROD won't see the DEV version until it is copied to PROD.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that correct, or do i need to derive both PROD and DEV from standard?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Then everything in the DEV environment will work the same as PROD from the beginning. Changes can be made after copying components from DEV to PROD. After testing, copy components to PROD and delete from DEV.</div></div><hr />
