<br />
<br />
I have a serious problem in running bshcmd6.1!<br />
<br />
I run the command: bshcmd6.1 -s -p -u5 -w5 &lt;pid&gt;, where pid<br />
is a bshell id I got from ps -ef.<br />
<br />
Some pids it works and give output, and some doesn't give anything although this bshell is openned with lot of sessions.<br />
<br />
What could be the problem here with the command?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a look at the bshell.# file in the $BSE/tmp dir. In the first case, you sometimes find your response there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
bshcmd6.1 -p -s -w 10 &lt;pid&gt;  <br />
<br />
I get my pid the same way that you do, when I do not get a result from this, I have found that the user is just sitting on a session or menu, not that they are processing.   I usually have my dbase admin check the pid for me, if your dbase admin can not find any activity, you know that they are not processing.  Sometimes I have found that this is due to loss of connection for just a moment.</div></div><hr />
