<br />
I would like to know if it is possible to have two application servers that will connect to a single database server?<br />
<br />
Is there will be no locking problems?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">6th February 2002, 11:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is possible to have multiple application servers. I don't think you have to worry about locking problems. The only occurrence of locking problems with multiple application servers I have seen so far is when you run pdaemon processes on more than one application server.</div></div><hr />

However you have to consider some thing else: how are you going to manage the application objects.<br />
<br />
PMC will update the pmc tables and only install the objects on the apps server on which you are going to run the install.<br />
<br />
You could do a copy of the bse environment, use NFS or perform a fat client installation of the second apps server.<br />
