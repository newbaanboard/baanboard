<br />
in company 000 I have defined a job with session ttaad4461m000. <br />
<br />
Table: from: aa aaa000   to: zz zzz999<br />
Company: 920<br />
Sequence: 000 - 999<br />
<br />
the rest as defaulted.<br />
<br />
The job is set up as periodic and automatic - so it is started by the job daemon root000.<br />
<br />
The output should be printed as file (ASCIF) in my home directory. (I have defined the path clearly in the job) <br />
<br />
Now the problem is: The job is getting started and completed without any error message but I don't get any file. Nither in my home directory nor in the directory of root000.<br />
<br />
I know that data is present because I get results when I do this manually.<br />
<br />
Can you help?<br />
<br />
Greetings<br />

<br />
i think, to solve your problem, more information is needed.<br />
<br />
is the job set to active ?<br />
Has the job been runing by daemon ?<br />
<br />
Are there access right problems by &quot;root000&quot; to the dir's ? <br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

I found the solution. The problem was that the user root000 did not have the permissions for Audit. <br />
<br />
To be able to process audit sessions the users have to receive extra permissions by root. Now it was surprising for me to see that root000 did not have the permissions. Anyhow the problem was solved after root gave the audit permissions to root000.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
