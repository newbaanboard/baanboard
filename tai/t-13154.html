How do we restrict / specify which objects have to be loaded in shared memory. If it is session Maintain Shared Memory Data (ttaad4150m000), then in this I have specified only tools program scripts to be loaded. But I find that when I view all the loaded objects in shared memory I find that domains and tables of all the package combinations are loaded in the shared memory. As a result of this, the allocated space for shared memory gets full. <br />
Why did domains and tables of all the package combinations get loaded in shared memory when I did not specify them anywhere?<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />

<br />
Check the Package Combinations session if the check box - load domains/tables is turned ON or OFF. If its turned ON all the applications domains/table definitions are loaded into the shared memory.</div></div><hr />

This is a RDD file which may be overwritten later on by a convert to runtime...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">1st October 2003, 07:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Thanks for the info.<br />
I unchecked the relevant package combinations which do not require to be loaded in the shared memory.<br />
But now I wanted the changes to be reflected in srdd file. For that I went to &quot;ttaad4150m000&quot; and &quot;Converted to Runtime&quot;, but it gave me &quot;Error -13 during seq.unlink srdd file&quot;.<br />
I even manually tried to modify the srdd contents and save, it gives error that some other application is using it. Probably the shm manager daemon is not relinquishing its control over the file.<br />
If I stop the shared memory, then baan does not start.<br />
<br />
Pls tell me the way in which I can &quot;Convert to runtime&quot; to the srdd file via BaaN. I do not want to change the file manually.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">1st October 2003, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Check your file permissions... they should be something like:<br />
-rw-rw----   1 bsp        bsp          ... ... .. ..:.. ${BSE}/lib/srdd_tab6.1<br />
on Unix that is.<br />
<br />
Because of error 13 on W2K, you still have to check the permissions.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.<br />
I checked the permissions, 'baan' user has rights to write/modify/update the file.<br />
Now I have to check, if the file can be modified manually after stopping the shared memory service, which I cannot do now as system is being used.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">1st October 2003, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The file is only used when the shared memory is initialized, so it is safe to change it in between.<br />
<br />
Restart shared memory services to activate changes (and afterwards check the &quot;show loaded&quot; option to check the effect).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">6th October 2003, 07:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi OmeLuuk,<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
As mentioned before, I am able to modify the contents of srdd file only when the shared memory service is down. I don't know why.<br />
BUt, anyway, I stopped the service, manually made changes to srdd and restarted the service. Now, everything is working perfectly.<br />
But I am concerned of the fact that in case someone wants to make changes to srdd file ahead, he has to do the same procedure.. stop shared mem.. make changes manually... then restart shared mem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />
