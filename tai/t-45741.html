<br />
Problem could be large tables like mentioned before. Are all finance sessions slow or just a specific one. In case of f.i. customised reports wrong indexes could be used. This may result in search actions where each record is searched sequential in an related table causing major performance problems. <br />
Other causes could be slow disks, almost full disks, bad tuning of the database or processor capacity of the server. <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<br />
 Where we find finance table or how can we archive this table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">13th December 2007, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Finance is related to the session that is slow.<br />
<br />
1.   Which session<br />
2.   Check what is the main table ( can be found in tools )<br />
      <br />
     Note: other tables are can be related but are not visable, you need the<br />
              source of the program to find out.<br />
<br />
3.   Use standard Baan archiving session to archive finance data<br />
<br />
4.   Reorganize the tables <br />

   Before you think of archiving, have you tried doing some transaction (that were being done by your finance users) at the server side to see if there is any difference in performance? For all that you know, a minor network upgrade could possibly improve your existing condition. Secondly, how many years have you (your organization) been on baan?<br />
