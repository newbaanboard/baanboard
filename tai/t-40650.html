<br />
We have setup a temporary account (which has full access in BaaN) to be used for  emergency basis. In order to verfiy what was done by the analyst, <br />
I need capture the complete auditrail. Within BaaN, I have a log I can check for any GTM changes, JOB changes or source code promotions. But, I am not getting the full visibilit what else was done with this account (like running standard baaN session to modify data, administrative task (elevated privileges),) Is there is an audit log availble within BaaN to capture an audit trails for the entire activity?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Patyogi</div></div><hr />

The User Log will only show you what sessions the user accessed and at what time. It doesnt tell you what was done in that session or table at that time. That sort of micro logging can only be done by enabling Audit on the Tables. <br />

U may keep audit trail only on some very important tables which are very important for tracking and the changes to which are rare .</div></div><hr />
