We want to update the solutions on our server, we currently have solutions till January 2007 and want to update them to November 2011.<br />
<br />
Our database size is close to 800 GB, can any one advise on how to install or work on resolving this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

What's exactly your problem? Are you afraid that the installation will take too long because of the size of your database? It depends if the solutions will change existing table definitions. However if e.g. a new column is added the latest portingsets don't export/import the whole table anymore but just run a 'add column' statement.<br />
<br />
You can run the check to install option, turn the print component option on, that will show you also the changed domain/tables. <br />
<br />
Best you can do is to run it first in a test environment and check what it's going to do exactly.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you for your reply, my concern is that will it effect the functionality. since we are working on the solution set for a long time. <br />
<br />
We are sure it will increase the performance but at the same time have  fair that it will cause functionality errors.<br />
<br />
what should be the best approach and how should the solutions be installed, in bulk or few at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
With that number of solutions it's impossible to do it not in small portions.<br />
Normally it's important to have a stable ERP environment. So what I recommend is to setup a test environment, install the solutions in it and let your users test the functionality. At least their daily processes. If they accepted it you can continue and install it in production.<br />
<br />
Still than you will probably find later on things that don't work at expected but hopefully it will not hurt that much.<br />
