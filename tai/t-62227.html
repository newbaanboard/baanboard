<br />
In LN FP7 Webui, if run in a Windows 7-hosted VM (XP-mode or Virtual PC), mouse selection does not work in drop-down selection boxes in LN.  If you select something in the list it is highlighted as usual, but when you click to select, the original selection stays in place.  The only way to make the selection stick seems to be by typing the first few letters of the desired selection item.<br />
<br />
I thought at first it must be some sort of Java fault, but it does seem to happen only in VMs under XP-Mode or Virtual PC (running on W7 host).  It doesn't matter which browser is used.  I have tried with both XP and W7 guest OS VMs.<br />
<br />
Has anybody seen this issue, please, and have a clue how to fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much</div></div><hr />
