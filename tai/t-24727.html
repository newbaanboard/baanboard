Does anyone have experience exporting/importing such a huge amount of data? They have SQL Server and WIndows.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Also - If you're exporting and importing all 40GB then you're doing it wrong...<br />

Dave<br />
<br />
I agree with both statements....<br />
<br />
40 GB is not that much - I was on a project where we were growing at a rate of 200 GB every 6 months.....<br />
<br />
also a 4c3 to 4c4 upgrade is not that big of deal and you should NOT be exporting the data!   It should just be another VRC in your derivation structure...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our DB is about 70 GB and we're using the standard Baan sessions for creating sequential dumps and then creating tables from the sequential dumps in the new c4 VRC on our new server.<br />
<br />
The whole process is expected to take from Thursday 5pm to Sunday 10am.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marine</div><div class="date">4th August 2005, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">A)  If you absolutely insist on doing SEQ dumps, make sure you use db_resource settings (ie. RDS_FULL=100) that will speed up the dump and also what I have done is &quot;manually multithread&quot; the SEQ dump by creating 7 seperate SEQ dump ranges and firing them all off at the same time.  I can do about 30 GB in about 6 hours.<br />
<br />
B)  Please look at session ttaad1101m000 - Change Pkg Comb. by company<br />
This session will evaluate the Data Dictionary differences between c3 &amp; c4 and automatically do the table conversion for you on ONLY the tables that change between the 2 VRCs.  Your message also stated you were going to a new server - you could do a &quot;restore of Baan&quot; on the new server and then just use this session to migrate.  Our App &amp; DB restore in about 5hrs.<br />
<br />
Just another thought.. when migrating to c4 are you applying all 18 service packs too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">4th August 2005, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">We are actually going from c3 sch0 to c4 ags0.<br />
<br />
I don't think a direct restore would work as we have a different disk setup on the server.<br />
<br />
We did a bulk install up to SP12 (I think) and then did 13,14 and 15.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marine</div><div class="date">4th August 2005, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">ah - I see you are on Informix...<br />
<br />
If you plan to reconfigure your inf_storage file and changing how you have the database files structured, then I can see needing to do SEQ dumps.  However, I assume that you are not planning to do a SEQ load directly into c4 ags0 because of the DD differences... which of course would fail on those changed tables...<br />
<br />
The idea of &quot;multiple simultaneous SEQ dumps&quot; would still work for you and may accelerate your process!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">4th August 2005, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct we have to migrate from c3 sch0 to c4 sch1 and then c4 ags0.<br />
<br />
We don't really have a problem with the down time as the factory will be on shutdown when we do the migration so we never really thought about doing multiple seq dumps. Although it's very useful to know that this can be done.<br />

Run ttaad4226m000 for seq dump (select specific separators &amp; directory for tables files check box) from old server &amp; import using ttaad4227m000 on new server. <br />
if u can change db_resourc file setting on both the server then it will save ur 50% time easily. pls go thru the file (file to store table name error not created) &amp; event viewer during importing. use batch installer (sp1-18)  for sps loading. definitly some tables may be skiped due to structure difference.<br />
<br />
please feel free to contact me for any query regarding to said topic.<br />
<br />
best of luck.<br />
bye</div></div><hr />

Well 40 GB is not a large amount of data.</div></div><hr />
