<br />
Is it possible that you have deleted all records in these table? (instead of one) Afaik the entries are necessary. On our system the table consists of more than 10000 records... If you have a backup you can compare the empty table with the one in your backup. If there are records so you'll have to repair the table with the data from your backup.<br />

The program is looking for a reference, and when it can't find it, defaults to company 000, and tries to find the table the script is looking for in co 000.<br />
<br />
Also, the error is not necessarily saying that cisli240 is the table with the issue; the error is referencing the function where the error occurs, which is cisli.dll2045.check.if.order.present.in.cisli240.  You would need to check your log.bshell or event viewer to find the specific table.<br />

Thanks to the reply from vinceco252 and peturba.<br />
<br />
I did checked the event viewer from the ERPLN server that i installed in and the event showed that the sql is select from cisli240 table. I check the table from the system backdoor and the table does exist but without any data. But the data does show in the front end session. So, if I am not mistaken, the data was the Demo data that come together with the software becuase the data was totally different with the data from backup.:confused:<br />
<br />
For more details, please refer to the attachment (Event Viewer sheet of the Error 506.xls)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

one of the reasons for such a problem is that some tables are pending for creation, just go and run the create tables (ttaad4230m000) for complete range and then try..<br />

it will probably solve ur problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course you can see the sale orders in the session tdsls4100m000. That's because Baan stores the sale order data in several different tables and session tdsls4100m00 needs just some of the data and obviously doesn't need the table cisli240. So, if you try to open a sales order then a routine in the session tdsls4100m900 is being executed and checks some data in the table cisli240. If there is no data in the table an error appears.<br />
<br />
Best way to solve this is to check the backup data first. The table cisli240 stores the header data of sales and warehouse order invoices and should usually be filled in an usual productive environment (in test environment surerly with test data). So - if you're in a test environment, install the demo data again and if you're in a productive environment use your backup to fill the table again.<br />

<br />
I think Wiggum hit it closest.<br />
<br />
What frequently happens is that your finance company gets lost in the session. or is configured incorrectly. (impossible for me to tell)<br />
<br />
So baan looks for your table cisli240 in company 000. <br />
<br />
Naturally functional tables don't exist in tools, so you get a 506.<br />
<br />
Not having records in the table may or may not mean anything, but it definitely won't give you a 506 error.<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm having the error 506 when running ledger history(tfgld3501m000.  Only me having this error.  others finance users don't have this error.  <br />
<br />
my question here, if i run create table (ttaad4230m000) will this cause any problem for other tables, as running this session will re-create the tables for everything.<br />
<br />
Please advice, thank you.</div></div><hr />
