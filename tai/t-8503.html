You need to execute - Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary (ttadv5215m000) and Create Runtime Data Dictionary (ttadv5210m000), resolve any errors, and then you will have the DD files for the tables that you can create the tables.<br />
<br />
Please refer to the Tools Adminstration and Development Manuals for the standard procedures.</div></div><hr />

i have converted data defination to <br />
Runtime Data Dictionary (ttadv5215m000) and Create Runtime Data Dictionary . At this point it was not giving any error but while<br />
creating the table , it is displaying  &quot; no table defination present&quot;<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

I think the DD files were not created. There is no particular document for the session ttadv5215m000. Try to execute the session, ttadv5210m000 for the package combination.<br />
<br />
Please go through the documentation do remember the various options which can change the results of the process.<br />
<br />
Here is some info on the ttadv5215m000 from BaaN Support from a case I logged -<br />
<br />
Checking Reconfigure Tables, will compare and reconfigure tables if a new table def/domain is present.  If you unchecked this option, then the .new file would be created but nothing would get reconfigured.  As for the Runtime Directories option, what it does is create new runtime directories if they do not already exist, like if there is a new module zzz, it would create the Runtime directory tczzz if checked and wouldn't if it wasn't.<br />
<br />
Also, on the sessions themselves: <br />
CONVERT TO RUNTIME<br />
To convert the changed software components to the runtime data dictionary.  This is done by a range of package combinations/packages.<br />
<br />
HOW TO USE THE SESSION: <br />
Enter the ranges of package combinations and packages, and indicate which components must be converted.  <br />
<br />
Only the table definitons will be created, not the tables itself.  To create tables, run Create Tables ttaad4230m000) <br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: <br />
If Reconfigure Tables = yes, the system will reconfigure ALL tables (the range of tables is not taken into account!)  which are changed.  This will be done for the companies linked to the specified range of package combinations.  BE SURE that everyone has left the bshell, to avoid problems with locked tables.  If reconfiguring tables is not successful (e.g. dure to lock errors), it is possible to stop the process by answering &quot;No&quot; at the question &quot;Error during file configuration; try again?&quot; Later on, you can restart reconfiguring the tables, by running this program again.<br />
********** <br />
Be aware that after a reconfig all ref counters have been set to 0.  This means that ALWAYS a refint has to be run on all tables.<br />
********** <br />
CREATE RUNTIME <br />
To create a runtime data dictionary containing software components by package combination.  This session is automatically called after you have created a new package combination.  It convers all specified components to the runtime dictionary, including those that have not been chagned.  The following software components will be converted to runtime dictionary:<br />
<br />
        -table definitions <br />
        -domains <br />
        -enum descriptions <br />
        -sessions <br />
The session will also dump the user data of users withing the specified packge combination and the fd6.1&lt;package combination&gt; with redirctions for software components.<br />
<br />
The runtime definitions of tables, domains and enum descriptions are stored in &quot;d&quot;-files in the directory as defined in Maintain Package Combinations ttaad1120m000.  The runtime definitions of sessions are stored in table ttadv999.<br />
<br />
To create runtime forms and menus you must use the sessions ttadv5214m000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another option is to first clear the srddtab file (do not load any components into shared memory at Baan start with rc.start), and then try again.</div></div><hr />

u might have the table defination in PC, whereas u are trying to create the tables in some company which is not attached to that PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">REETA1967</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 04:55</div></div><div class="posttext">thanxs for all the above replies.<br />
<br />
 Now i am able to create tables  after taking the shut down of the server.<br />
i would like know the following things:<br />
1. what is the diff betn . create Data dictionary &amp; convert data dictionary.<br />
2. Why session is required to convet data dictionary.<br />
3. what is the meaning of (#include itccom0010. )<br />
<br />
bye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">1. what is the diff betn . create Data dictionary &amp; convert data dictionary. <br />
<br />
If the software component is appearing in the system for the first time, use CREATE. If the software component already exists, and you have made some modifications, use CONVERT.<br />
<br />
2. Why session is required to convet data dictionary. <br />
<br />
If the software component has been changed, then to make that change effective in RTDD, this session is used.<br />
<br />
3. what is the meaning of (#include itccom0010. ) <br />
<br />
This command &quot;includes&quot; a function file &quot;itccom0010&quot; in your script, so that the script can use the functions of this file.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
