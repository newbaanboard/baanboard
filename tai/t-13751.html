<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to install two separate BaaN environments on the same machine with SEPARATE licence monitors. I mean one Baan with 50 licences and second with 30. I know that it is possible to validate one of them with 80 licences and share licences, but we require two separate licmons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Not possible as far as I know.  The licence is written to the .brand file in the root directory of the machine, and therefore the second environment will overwrite the first!<br />
<br />
The only alternative I can think of would be to install Baan on another machine, with only the binaries, company 000 and the Tools objects.  Licence this new machine, and then point the second environment to this new machine.  This second machine could be either NT or UNIX.  After the licencing you can stop the shared memory, and clean out the new machine to contain only the .brand file, the lib directory and the porting set.  Then only start the licence deamon automatically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, not possible. All the reasons below fit. Additionally the licence daemon is listening on a specific port, which can not be configured. So a seconf licence daemon will not even start up, beciase it can not allocate the TCP/IP port/socket.<br />
<br />
Sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way it will work is if you have a different tools version in the Baan environment, e.g: licmon6.1 (BaanIV) and licmon6.2 (BaanERP). This works perfectly on the one box.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am pretty sure that I have used it in the past, however I could be wrong. <br />

<br />
the sequence numbers are used mainly in an High Availibility setup. In this case you validate two servers under the same licence number, but with two different sequence numbers.<br />
<br />
It is kind of the opposite, from running two licence daemons on the same server!<br />
<br />
But Pat's comment is valid, that you can validate BaanIVc4 and BaanERP on the same server, mainly because the validation and licencing mechanism of these two version is completely different.</div></div><hr />
