<br />
Following is a scenario we currently are experiencing since converting to VPN.  Any help, best guesses or sympathy would be appreciated.  ;) <br />
<br />
Baan Version:  BaanIV c3  (tools)  BaanIV c3/c4 (App)<br />
Both our company and our Parent company have Baan installed on separate servers, separate installations, in different geographical locations.  Till a few weeks ago we had a Frame Relay setup which allowed us to log onto each others servers and Baan applications, e.g. Log on to server 2 from site 1, start Baan and run a program (or visa versa).  We can no longer do this using Baan GUI.  The option dialogue box starts up, as if Baan is going to open, but then simply hangs for approx 5 mins, get a Windows Socket Error and exits automatically.   This problem however does not surface when logging in with ASCI user (ba6.1)<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  What could be causing this?  <br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
Does the VPN and all components in between allow for port 512 (rexec) ?<br />
How are the BaaN server network settings, does it use DNS to resolve client ip addresses ?<br />
Any activity / logging in log.bshell etc ?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply (and sympathy).  Though I'm a techy my skills are related to dev.  I'd like to answer your questions, but I'm not sure how to gather the info for you...  :confused: <br />

Will find out<br />
Any activity / logging in log.bshell etc ?<br />
Checked, there are none<br />
<br />
BTW the error we get is &quot;Windows Socket Error 10053&quot;.  I found a posting on Baanboard related to error 10053.  Seems like a connectivity problem (as you have stated Rob  ;)   )<br />
Just need to find a fix !!!<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to add a firewall in your network, if already have then try to find a suspected switch which may cause network congestion.</div></div><hr />
