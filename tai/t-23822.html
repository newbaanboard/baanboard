<br />
I am getting error message at login as follows:<br />
<br />
&quot;Could not log you on to the database.&quot;<br />
<br />
I established a test server (Installed SQL server 7.0 and BaanERP 5.0). Copied directories Application, dict and  tools from the Live server, updated license information in license file to take the license from the Live server. Also copied fd6.* files from lib folder. Till this stage I was able to login in the Baan. <br />
<br />
After that I have created dump for company &quot;000&quot; from the Live server and created table using the dump in the test server. After completion of this process, I am not able login into the Baan on Test server and gettign error message as &quot;could not log you on to the database&quot;. Any idea, what could be the reason?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I have already checked the file tabledef6.2, its not pointing to the production server but the Test Server. I think the information is somewhere else missing.<br />

This problem is resolved, there was some problem in directory names. <br />
<br />
Now I can log on in to Baan, but I am not able to change the company. Baan always log me on in demo company 902, and I am not able to change the company through the option &quot;Change Company&quot;, other company numbers are not available in list. If I enter the company number (like 001), I got error message as <br />
<br />
&quot;Package combination of company is &lt;Package_Combination_Name&gt; ; Package VRC in Package combination are different.&quot;<br />
<br />
What have to change?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I am still hangup with this problem. Let me tell a bit more <br />
<br />
I established a test server (Installed SQL server 7.0 and BaanERP 5.0). Copied directories Application, dict and tools from the Live server, updated license information in license file to take the license from the Live server. Also copied fd6.* files from lib folder. After that, restored the database from the backup of the Live Server, with the overwrite option. Till now every thing is Ok and I can login into Baan. Further, the problem is as follows:<br />
<br />
Whenever I log into the Baan, I always login with company number 902. I checked in the session &quot;ttaad1100m000&quot; (Companies), the company 902 is not exists.<br />
<br />
When I try to switch to other companies, I got the error message as follows:<br />
<br />
Package combination of company is &lt;Package_Combination_Name&gt; ; Package VRC in Package combination are different.&quot;<br />
<br />
I checked the other Post that NPRao suggested, but didn't get any idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will be thankfull for suggestions and help to resolve this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
the company a user named USER will be logged into should be in $BSE/lib/user/uUSER (file).<br />
You didn't mention that you copied $BSE/lib, only tools, application and dict.<br />
Does company 902 exist in the live environment??? Sounds like you did a new installation and then copied the above directories from the live system to the new one, missing the $BSE/lib. 902 might be a standard demo company.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">13th May 2005, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I mentioned that I copied fd6.* files from lib folder, not all files. Should I copy complete directoy $BSE/lib?<br />
<br />
Yes, your right, I did a new installation and then copied the above directories from the live system to the new one, missing the $BSE/lib. 902 was the standard demo company.<br />
<br />
Yes, the file for user &quot;baan&quot; is exists in directory $BSE/lib/user/. The part of content of that file is as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
unixuser:baan    <br />
usertype:S<br />
pacc:b50c    <br />
compnr:902<br />
language:2<br />
compauth:000<br />
lockdelay:-1<br />
startprogram_gui: ttdskbbrowser -n2 -mmtccom000000001<br />
startprogram_inet: ttdskbbrowser -n2 -mmtccom000000001<br />
startmenu:mtccom000000001<br />
toolbar1:0<br />
toolbar2:0<br />
stp_win_def:0<br />
exec_perms:010<br />
timezone: Europe/Amsterdam<br />
starttime:0000<br />
endtime:2400<br />
<br />
The setting of user &quot;baan&quot; in session USER is entirly different then the setting in the above file, like &quot;compnr&quot; is not 902 but 001. I have also tried to convert the runtime for the users, but the conver runtime DD process run for long time and never finished. Should I change the content of above file manually ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Notice also that a convert will only generate ufiles if changes are made to a user so make sure that you update the remaining users also (from Baan and only then run a convert).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jodijk</div><div class="date">17th May 2005, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">let me get this straight - <br />
<br />
First, you installed Baan 50.c<br />
Then you copied $BSE/lib/fd*, $BSE/application, $BSE/dict, $BSE/tools from live to test<br />
Next, you copied the database from live to test<br />
<br />
If that's indeed the sequence, I advice you to copy all remaining directories and files from live's $BSE to test as well, so the systems are fully cloned.<br />
<br />
If the directory structure on both servers are the same, chances are you can use the testsystem right away, and effectively cloned the livesystem to test. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">18th May 2005, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi friends,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for time and help, finally I am able to work on the new test environment. I have just copied the USER files from the main Server. No other directories are copied as &quot;jodijk&quot; adviced. Now I have a very little problem, when I try to access the BP information, I got the message as follows:<br />
<br />
&quot;Group Company parameter not available&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes jodijk, are you sure that I must copy all other directories from $BSE environment to clone the Live system to Test? Yes, the directory structure on both server are same.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
MRF</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jodijk</div><div class="date">18th May 2005, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say at least copy<br />
$BSE/lib/datecurr<br />
$BSE/lib/compnr6.2<br />
$BSE/lib/roles<br />
$BSE/lib/auditdef6.2<br />
<br />
$BSE/lib/user you already found out<br />
<br />
consider $BSE/lib/help and $BSE/additional_files , depending on whether you have customizations or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">18th May 2005, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi jodijk,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for quick response. I have copied all following files.<br />
<br />
$BSE/lib/datecurr<br />
$BSE/lib/compnr6.2<br />
$BSE/lib/roles<br />
$BSE/lib/auditdef6.2<br />
<br />
After copy above files, I have restarted the shared memory services and then the message &quot;Group Company parameter not available&quot; is also removed. Now the new test server is working as same as the Live Server (like clone of the Live Server).<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for all friends. I will try to document all steps, and after that it will be available to share with other friends.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
