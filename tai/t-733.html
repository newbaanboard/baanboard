<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">8th January 2002, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Which kind of data do you want specifically?<br />
The highest value, the number of unique users, the total of users (even duplicates)?<br />
Also, you're Baan installation runs on UNIX or NT (NT much more limited...)?<br />
<br />
The best way to get full statistics statistics is to use a script that writes data into a common log regarding the user that is connecting and then starts the bshell, called by the ipc_info. Like this you can log any kind of data and later on run another script that extracts what you need from that log.<br />
<br />
Other option would be to get the registerd/unregistered users from the log.licd6.1 and then get some stats from that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
$BSE/bin/licmon6.2<br />
<br />
options - stats, users<br />
<br />
Hope it helps you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">christopherj</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 02:41</div></div><div class="posttext">if you're using UNIX then its easy but you would have to write a script like<br />
while true; do; ps -ef|grep bshell|wc -l &gt;&gt; /tmp/count.lst ; time &gt;&gt; /tmp/count.lst; sleep 5; done<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
your can use licmon6.1 and then user the users option.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">With NT I think you are stuck with licmon which you can run from a DOS box. Possibly you could write a batch script to process these details but MS-DOS doesn't exactly provide the same flexibility as UNIX shell scripting.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you could go for a commercial product that can provide you with these kind of reports, e.g. OST (http://www.ostusa.com) Frontline</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I do agree that Unix is more flexible, however on NT you can use also the -u (usercount) option. Disadvantage is of course that 'hanging' licences are counted as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Licmon does not really provide any good stats, since it only gives you the stats of the moment its run, so no comulative data.<br />
<br />
On NT I would go for the data gathered thru the log.licd6.1 (or log.licd6.2). There are some good free unix utilities on the web that do grep and other similar stuff that allow you to implement a good &quot;script&quot; within a .bat file.<br />
OR you can install cygwin (FREE, see www.cygwin.com (http://www.cygwin.com/)) that provides you with a UNIX layer on NT/2000 and since it includes 'bash', you can use the scripting capabilities to implement a real good UNIX script !</div></div><hr />
