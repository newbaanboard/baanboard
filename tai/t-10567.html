not visible in another company although both the companies have<br />

happening.<br />

<br />
If everything is done completely, this should not occur.  If the 2 companies are in the same package combo - they should see the same components.  I guess, unless..<br />
- Convert to runtime done while the user was in the session, and they have not left yet..?  They would not see the change until they exit and return.  New forms added to a session - they may have to exit Baan and return, especially if you are on NT.<br />
- Any custom logic related to company number in the script...?<br />
- User privelages...?  Does the same user see the form if they switch companies?  Possibly user privelages by company....<br />
<br />
Is the form tab viewable but they can't tab to it / click on it, or is it not viewable at all.  If it is viewable but they can't get to it, it is probably data / logic related....<br />
<br />
Is this in a dem flow or anything..or just off the standard Baan menu..?<br />
<br />
Sorry, no answers, just questions.</div></div><hr />
