<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaymukh</div><div class="date">22nd April 2006, 01:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We have one Production Oracle database users have no problem accessing that. We follow the normal old rule of using ora7_admin6.1 to create oracle users in the production schema/database.<br />
Now, for archiving we created another database in oracle for keeping the archived data. <br />
so what we did created a login id in the new archiving database for each user who needs access to archived data. But for some users it is giving a problem...accessing the database...<br />
I checked ora_users but there is only one entry per user, then how do we separate the two database issue. <br />
One thing may be that we need to give same password for the same user in both oracle database as there is only one entry in ora_storage file. Is that right...<br />
Our baan version IVb4 and oracle7.<br />
Many thanks in advance for any help...<br />
Thanks<br />
