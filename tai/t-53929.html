   Have you tried connecting to Baan with this username on the Baan Server to see if the username is working or not?<br />
<br />

   I take it from your answer that the user is able to connect to Baan from the Baan Server. Could you tell us how your Server set up is. <br />
For instance, Is your Baan server a domain server? Are the users part of this domain or another one? Which server is validating the domain users when they log in to their workstation? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">9th October 2008, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">You mentioned the user xpto in your post, however the attachment complains about a user mfreitag.<br />
<br />
Are you using a bw setting like -set USER=mfreitag  ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luísa Rodrigues</div><div class="date">10th October 2008, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">The user in the example is mfreitas but in the issue i mentioned a xpto user, because this error occurs for all users that are created in a domain.<br />
<br />
I don't have the solution to this issue yet, but i already know what is it's the possible cause.<br />
<br />
I have a Windows 2003 Server, Standard X64 Edition, SP2 with Baan 5.0c Application.<br />
<br />
And a Domain Controller on Windows 2008.<br />
<br />
I tested the connection to a Domain Controller on Windows 2003 server, and i did not get the error.<br />
<br />
So i think there is a incompatible authentication between Server baan and Domain controller, when using users created in that domain.<br />
<br />
Kind regards</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cesar Lopez</div><div class="date">1st November 2008, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">which autentication method are you using?, if you are using user and pwd this will only point to one thing, which is the $BSE/lib/user/ufile, you already told the file exists, so the user may not be able to read it, does the user have permissions to that directory?, is the user in bsp group?, $BSE/log message use to be very descriptive in this kind of problems, can you post it?<br />
