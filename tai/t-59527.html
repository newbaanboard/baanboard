<br />
I am trying to import company data from non unicode ERP LN into unicode ERP LN. On many tables I am getting error &quot;skipped corrupt record&quot; which is caused by having high ASCII characters in single byte fields.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have an idea how to import such data? I checked bdbpost options and find out that there is option -H &quot;Do not allow high ASCII bytes in single byte fields&quot; but I need oposite possibility. I tried with &quot;Disable domain constraints&quot; but without success.<br />
<br />
I know that data in the RDBMS must not contain high ASCII characters in single-byte fields but I want to import data somehow into ERP LN and after that I will try to find a way how to correct my data.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">15th November 2010, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to the new Admin Guide 8.5 or later one.<br />
<br />
High Ascii Tolerance<br />
Important!<br />
The following only applies to ERP LN environments that do not run in Unicode<br />
mode.<br />
You must set the high_ascii_tolerance resource to 0 in the following situations:<br />
▪ If your ERP LN environment is a production environment and you plan to<br />
convert the environment to Unicode.<br />
▪ If your ERP LN environment is a development environment and you plan<br />
to deliver software components or translations. If high_ascii_tolerance is<br />
not set to 0, problems will occur when the delivered components are<br />
imported in Unicode environments.<br />
To set high_ascii_tolerance to 0, add the following line in<br />
the $BSE/lib/defaults/all file:<br />
high_ascii_tolerance:0<br />
Also refer to the latest tools patches -<br />

Solution Description <br />
English Illegal characters removed before unicode conversion. <br />
TOOLS VERSION(S):  7.6_a3, 7.6_a4 <br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: <br />
&quot;Remove high ASCII characters&quot; (ttcor0008m000) <br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
During a Unicode conversion illegal (high ASCII) characters were encountered in the tools tables which were delivered with ERP LN. <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
Session Remove high ASCII characters (ttcor0008m000) is introduced. This session replaces high ASCII characters in Tools tables of ERP LN. <br />
<br />
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: <br />
Unicode know issues and points of attention <br />
<br />
--- High_Ascii issues; error 205 NOHI --- <br />
<br />
In ERP LN 6.1 Unicode environments it is by default not supported to have high-ascii characters in single byte strings. <br />
<br />
In various situations you can be confronted with situations where you receive software or data which does not comply to this rule. This will result in 205 error NOHI <br />
205 ENOTINRANGE - XXXXXXXX <br />
<br />
The NOHI error is a special case error. This error can occur in Unicode environments and environments where high_ascii_tolerence=0 <br />
The error is an indication that a character above 0x7F is stored in a single byte field. Storage of these high ascii characters in single byte fields is in these cases not allowed because it's encoding is ambiguous and depends on the locale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my problem is related to KB 1011165 (error 520) due to single byte environment has different setup for CLEN (it is in domain definition file).<br />
<br />
In example, domain tcdsca (multibyte) has CLEN 120 but in singlebyte, it is CLEN = 30.<br />
As solution, Infor recommended to change all domain files (*.pd) for multibyte string to match new definition.<br />
<br />
Here is my understanding what it should be done but ...<br />
<br />
First step is to export data from production (I can setup ASCII_tolerance:0 inside BSE instead of global variable - it is production and I don't want introduce some new global parameters).<br />
<br />
On LN 10.5 side, I can build data dictionary environment from FP5 (required for data upgrade engine). As I understand, I have to write script to go through pd file, find multibyte string and replace CLEN = 4x PLEN.<br />
<br />
Once it is completed, run import program<br />
<br />
Do I missing something in process or is it any better way to do it ...?<br />
<br />
I cannot believe that I am first in Baan world doing it :)<br />

You can write a shell script and do it.<br />

I'm not sure what does that mean by inside BSE?<br />

Sadly, you might not be the first person to do it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sikima</div><div class="date">26th January 2017, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I wrote small script to read domain files (*.pd) and find 'PLEN' and replace 'CLEN' with 4xPLEN. In addition, I have copied DD from FP5 b61au (standard update) to new environment and run update for a few tables. I think I got correct result (at least no errors in event viewer). In coming days, I am going export data from production and try to update new environment.<br />
<br />
As for setup environmental variables, I am usually set to user level (-- -set xxxx) inside BECS (not BSE) before I put on global level.<br />
<br />
As for Unicode conversion, I have tried with some test environment - it is so dangerous doing that I cannot believe that somebody is brave enough to perform it before updating resume :)<br />
<br />
If any issue in this process, I am going let you know ...<br />

No one updates their resume that they tried to go to Moon or were on failed Apollo missions but they went to  Moon or were on Apollo-13 :)</div></div><hr />
