<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">13th March 2012, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Few months ago we decided to move ERP LN application to a new (virtual) server.<br />
<br />
On the new server I made a fictional installation, I installed FP7 fot tt package and (this time) last PS. Then we copied from the old server Infor folder and moved the database from old to a new server. Now we have on the new server the same version of applications (FP3) and tt package (FP5), as they were on the old server. Only PS is higher due to higher versions of OS and SQL Server.<br />
<br />
Due to certain problems we have now decided to make the upgrade to the FP7 tools, but the upgrade does not do, because there is somewhere information that the installation of FP7 tools has already made.<br />
<br />
When I checked the new server to determine the cause of the problem, I saw that the colleguae made a mistake and he copied Infor folder over the one that was created with a fictional installation. So we have on Infor folder some log files from the fictional installation and log files from fictional installation are present in the stagging area as well.<br />
<br />
My question is what I have to delete (what log files), that I can do the upgrade?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a work around you could pick up the pmc files from the Enterprise Server 8.7 cd and install them directly by using process patches after you have scanned them.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to update your tools Addons as well.</div></div><hr />
