<br />
When i run rc.startjob with BATCH0 as parameter the job get's started. When i look at the database connection, the user bsp is used.<br />
<br />
When i uncomment in the script the line with the variable USER. and change it as below.<br />
USER=bsp         ;export USER<br />
<br />
The script produces the error<br />
&quot;Connecting with bshell...<br />
Connection established.<br />
ba6.2: Not authorized to run as user 'bsp'<br />
Error [main                     ]: Can't connect to bshell<br />
&quot;<br />
I can specify any user there. It does not work<br />
<br />
The goal is to have 2 cron jobdeamons that each have their own locale (One with ISO-8859-1, the other with GB2312<br />
<br />
How can i achieve this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
your profile say you are using OS/400, but the question sounds very Unix like, so I will assume you are using unix for my answer:<br />
<br />
If you run the rc.startjob for example from teh crontab of user root, but with the &quot;export USER=bsp&quot; command, then you need in Baan a Baan user &quot;bsp&quot; with System user &quot;root&quot;. This is most likely not the case. I advise to do the following:<br />
<br />
a) Create two unix users, for example jobiso and jobgb<br />
b) Create two equivalent Baan users, which use these users as system user<br />
c) uncomment the &quot;export USER=&quot;, in the rc.startjob (you do not need it)<br />
d) Maybe add some other commands to rc.startjob to set otherwise required variables (for example for your database etc)<br />
e) Maintain for each user his own cron, meaning log in as jobiso and maintain his cron, than login as jobgb and add his cron entry.<br />
<br />
Then it works as expected,<br />
