<br />
as my account manager from Infor is now since weeks not able to give me any information, if for 5.0c is Polish-language available, I like to ask you all if you have any information about. From Infor-Support I was pointed to check www.snt.pl as the former company www.beelc.com does not exist anymore. But also from snt I get no feedback. So if you have any information how and from whom to get this please post to my thread.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Best Regards,<br />

<br />
we are running a 5.0c Installation with the complete polish localisation (incl polish language).<br />
It comes from beelc in the past, so i think the change is not so small, that the polish language is availible.<br />
