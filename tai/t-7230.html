<br />
When you're linking Baan user to database user, you're linking a user ID used within the Baan system and user ID within your RDBMS. User ID within Baan system (Baan user) identifies who can do what in Baan such as purchase, sales, production, etc. User ID within RDBMS (database user) identifies who can do what in your RDBMS such as change table, add record, delete record, etc.<br />
<br />
I think you can do basic check why it's not working. First of all check the Baan user whether it can be converted successfully to DD. Second, check whether database user can be converted successfully to DD, and also check whether this database user recorded in Baan is really created inside your RDBMS user management (inside Oracle, Informix, SQL Server, DB2, or whatever it is you're using). If both are OK and still the linking (between Baan user and DB user) can't work, then you can probably log a case with Baan Support. It could be possible that it's a bug after all<br />

You edit the file $BSE\lib\msql\msqluser and copy a line and alter the name to the user name.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I had simmilar problem few months ago. Baan user could normally work in application, but when I tried to convert another Baan user to database user I got the same message &quot;Database user baan is not converted to the database. I found out that someone changed value of the field Create user from Using other software to Using BAAN. When I changed value back to Using other software I was able to convert Baan user to database user.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maggie</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 04:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you just check database user, session ttdba0515m000, whether there are database user status are &quot;not created in RDBMS yet&quot;, if such database user exists,  you can't link baan user and database user successful.<br />
<br />
You can directly modify table &quot;ttdba015&quot;, make sure all database user status are &quot;created in RDBMS&quot;, then you can link them successfully.</div></div><hr />
