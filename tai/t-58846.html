<br />
I am in mid of setting up Office Integration with LN FP5.  I have installed the required adapters and created the bus document.  Necessary setups have been done on the client machines such as OfficeIntegration.exe has been copied to c:\temp folder.  Other setups required for office integration to provide functionality in MS products have been completed.  Still I am getting the following errors:<br />
<br />
1. When publishing a template, from MS Word/Excel, it fails to copy the template to server and the template fails from publishing.  The workaround of the same is to copy the template to 'c:\temp' folder on server, then it allows to publish the document on server even from client.  The user publishing the template has administrative privileges on the server.<br />
<br />
2. When a template is successfully published on the server, it works well with excel i.e. data can be moved in both directions, but data can not be pushed to MS Word from LN.  When selecting records and option send to &lt;template&gt;, the system does not do anything.  No message or erros are returned.<br />
<br />
I will appreciate if someone can contribute from his learnings/knowledge to resolve any or both of the above issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

Your advise is working and I could publish the document now.  But it looks strange to me, if there are more than 1 template designers, they will not be able to publish template unless they run there copy of 'tmboaserver'.<br />

<br />
Now your user can run there separate bus component using tmboaserver session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamdnb</div><div class="date">20th July 2010, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I was also thinking on the similar lines.<br />
<br />
Just one more question, I have observed after installing Office Integration components on client, if I try to open the excel workbook by double clicking on file name, it does not show unless I click on 'Office Button' of the Excel.  We are using office 2007.  <br />
<br />
Do you have any idea about this?<br />
