I have generated barcode for item data &amp; it is getting printed nicely on HP Laserjet Printer. But when I am trying to print on Intermec Barcode Printer it is not printing properly. <br />
<br />
What should be the reason for this?<br />
<br />
Second thing if I am joining 2 fields in one variable &amp; trying to generate barcode for that then nothing is get printed. What to do to generate barcode for variables. <br />

You can print barcode from Baan easily on HP Laserjet because it is handled by BWPRINT using Windows printing mechanism. However, I don't think you can control the Intermec barcode printer from Windows for printing sake, i.e. I don't think you can print a MS Word document to the Intermec printer. The Intermec printer requires its own instruction on how to print barcode and most likely it doesn't listen to Windows instruction on printing much. You'd have to read the barcode printer manual to find out how to issue the correct instruction to the printer. Many times this means sending certain character sequence right to the port to which the printer is attached.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">22nd July 2003, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">The Intermec Printers must have forms defined in their own printer language and either saved in the printers memory, or uploaded to the printer as part of a print job.  You then send data fields that fill in the blanks on the form.  The forms defined fonts, barcode type and size, lines, positions, variable fields and data types, etc.<br />
<br />
I have developed my own label application that use a network of Intermed Barcode Printers at all of our six plants to print inventory,Work in Process and Shipping Labels based on the AIAG &amp; ISO requirements for Part Identification.  My Application has 13 forms saved on the printer for use in my application.<br />
<br />
The Printers use a Generic/Text Only Driver in Windows.<br />

I think our 2nd question remains as it is. See I have combined suppose Item Code &amp; Descr in one variable say barcode. I put this field in report layout &amp; set barcode fied to 10. But Barcode is not getting generated while when I make combination as <br />
<br />
&quot;tiitm001.item + tiitm001.dsca&quot; barcode is getting generated. So what should be the reason that barcode is not getting geenrated for variables. <br />
