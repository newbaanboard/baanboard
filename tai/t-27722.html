<br />
this problem annoys me since years.<br />
I use ba6.1 ascii. I want to change a value of a field (while changing a report for example).<br />
So, in the option field I enter &quot;C&quot; and the cursor moves to the field containing the print expression.<br />
The cursor is placed before the first letter the field contains.<br />
If I enter one character, the field is emptied and contains the character I entered. <br />
I can press the [INSERT] key to change to insert-mode. In this case the chars I enter are placed behind the current cursor position and the content of the field persists.<br />
So far so good.<br />
BUT I cannot activate an overwrite mode. Nor can I delete single characters. Neither [BACKSPACE] nor [DEL] key does work.<br />
I looked up text editor commands and standard options ... but can't find the correct ascii values for delete character or overwrite.<br />
Plz help!<br />
I am too lazy to retype all that stuff when I only need to replace 3 of 40 characters :-)<br />
<br />
Thx in advance<br />
<br />
Norbert<br />
<br />
PS: This problem only occurs, if I have to change the first character(s) ... if the cursor is placed somewhere in the filed, overwrite mode is active.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately &lt;CTRL&gt; + Backspace does not work (doesn't delete a character). I am using netterm. <br />
But this was extremely helpful still, as I could find out that the code that works is HEX 7f .... (another emulation program behaved like you described it).<br />
Now I only have to find a way to teach netterm :-)<br />
<br />
Thank you very much! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st August 2006, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Backspace/delete problem:  In most terminal emulators this is the option for &quot;Backspace key sends&quot; - It should be set to 'Delete (DEL)', the common option that messes this up is 'Backspace (BS)'.  The actual 'DEL' key on the keyboard is not used, you have to map the Backspace to Delete in your emulator.<br />
Not familair with Netterm, but this option is available in SmartTerm and Reflections, so I expect it exists in some form.</div></div><hr />
