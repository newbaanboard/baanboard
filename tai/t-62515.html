<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">18th June 2012, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">My co-worker added 3 fields to an existing table in test VRC.  All fields used existing domains.  The next day, my co-worker put new data definition into live VRC, convert to run time, run update statistics on live table and all was well.<br />
<br />
Later, while she was working in test VRC, she got a message that one of the new fields did not exist.  Because the table structure in live was having NO problems, she deleted test data definition, copied data definition from live, back to test.  Convert to run time and she got error 113 which I believe means file locked.  Since she and I are the only users of our test system, we made sure nothing was running which would lock the table and we tried it again.  All subsequent attempts to convert to run time produced error 512 which means corrupt data definition.<br />
<br />
So I open case with BaaN, went on vacation for a week and left this with my trusty coworker to resolve while I was gone.<br />
<br />
The issue is resolved but I am not certain that the root cause was discovered.  For example, the solution was to copy the three domains into test VRC and convert domains to run time.<br />
<br />
Since the domains existed at a higher VRC level, doing a convert to run time on existing domains should not necessary.  However, it seemed to correct the problem so the case is closed.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your opinions / advise.<br />

Does it still work? I am wondering if something corrupted the DD for those domains at the higher level VRC.  I know we have seen something like this but I can't recall the details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">19th June 2012, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for replying Mark.  I have not deleted the domains but will try that.  <br />
<br />
I have considered the fact that in the time frame where changes were made in test VRC, we did not run Informix update statistics.  So we modified a data definition, convert to run time.  Then later, we modified the same data definition with out running update statistics.<br />

Can this post be copied into the DataBase / Operating System forum?  They may post comments.</div></div><hr />
