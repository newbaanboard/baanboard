<br />
1) Assign Session Authorization by Company for all Companies<br />
2)Tables Authorizations by company for all Pompanies<br />
3)Library Authorizations by Package for all Packages<br />
<br />
<br />
Then in the lower level, Session Authorizations by Session , Assign not Authorized and put this session,i,e, Change Company .</div></div><hr />

I have checked in the system. Something you would have done wrong. Or Did you do convert to runtime for the Role Data including the user into it?I mean did you run the session,ttams2200m000?</div></div><hr />
