<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wjhale</div><div class="date">31st March 2014, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Because of age I need to replace our Baan apps server this summer.  We are currently on Windows 2003 Server using c3/wc4 tools to allow connection to SQL Server with Level II DB drivers. We are currently at porting set  6.1c.11 in three tier mode.  <br />
<br />
Because of our configuation, I am only allowed to move forward to porting set 6.1c.19, which means my choice of Windows OS is either Win 2008 or Win 2008R2.  <br />
<br />
The OS choice bring up some very interesting questions; Go with Win 2008 and a 32bit OS or jump to Windows 2008 R2 with BSE running on the 32 bit emulator.  I understand the shortfalls.  32bit means a 4 GB limit.  64bit may give me a bit more memory with the OS and things like backup running over in the 64 bit side with BSE over on the 32 bit emulator.  My experience with emulators is that they are notoriously inefficient and I'm sure that the (x86) crap will give me fits along the way.  <br />
<br />
Any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure about performance under Emulator but it works fine with x64 2008 R2. But keep in mind, Infor will be stopping the support once this version is stopped by Microsoft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your thoughts!</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of my users have had positive comments about system response but I have noticed a big improvement.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
