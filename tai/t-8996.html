Say, I have 2 package combinations PCA &amp; PCB and package 'td' has two VRCs 'vrca' and 'vrcb'. 'td vrca' is the parent of 'td vrcb'.<br />
Now, 'tdvrca' is linked to PCA and 'tdvrcb' is linked to PCB.<br />
Now, in &quot;Maintain PVRC&quot;, in the field &quot;Integration with Package VRCs in Package Combination&quot;, for 'tdvrca' if I want to enter &quot;PCB&quot;, it gives error &quot;Package VRC is not present in this Package Combination&quot;.<br />
My question is why does give this error, when package combination &quot;PCB&quot; is linked to 'tdvrcb' which is child of 'tdvrca'. Hence, 'tdvrca' is in the search path of &quot;PCB&quot;.<br />
So, even though, 'tdvrca' is not present in the search path of package combination &quot;PCB&quot; and not directly present as a leaf node, why does the system not let me enter this VRC.<br />
<br />
Actually, I need to do this as we have two production environments.<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />

<br />
You have this ( vrc, [PC] ):<br />
<br />
td vrcb  [PCB]<br />
|<br />
td vrca  [PCA]<br />
<br />
Even if PCB will see td vrca because it's below it, you can only set a VRC connected to a matching package combination (same level).<br />
So you can set tdvrcb to PCB  but not  tdvrca to PCB - here only to PCA.<br />
<br />
That field is there in case you have more than one package combination using the same VRC, eg:<br />
<br />
td vrcb  [PCB] &amp; [PCT]<br />
|<br />
td vrca  [PCA]<br />
<br />
then you can set that vrc integrated to PCB or PCT (but not PCA as mentioned).</div></div><hr />
