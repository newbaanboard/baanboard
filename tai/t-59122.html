We are trying to mail report in PDF format through BaaN LN. While printing the report in &quot;send message&quot; tab we maintain recipient. Also in services(ttcmf0130m000), for service name &quot;OUTLOOK&quot; we maintain File Type as PDF, still report goes in outlook in .txt format.<br />
<br />
Not sure where is the problem.<br />
<br />
please advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I checked our system and we didn't have a PDF option there.<br />
If you have our own custom CMF code for emails, then you can use the function - cmf.setAttachmentMIME() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_emessage_connector_cmf_setattachmentmime) with the mime-type &quot;application/pdf&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply. We are using LN FP6 where in PDF option is available in ttcmf0130m000. But not sure why it is not working.<br />
<br />
There is an alternate method to send pdf attachment. Create a device with attached screenshot settings.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

You are correct. My screen shot was from FP5 environment and I checked that there is a new PDF option in the FP6 environment. You might have to open a case with Baan Support and follow up with them. I created a test device with your screen shot and got a report conversion error.</div></div><hr />

We have same problem. <br />
Any other attacment works via SMTP or Outlook service.<br />
But when set up PDF as default attachment extension then<br />
all messages send by eMessage connector get attachment in txt format instand pdf.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have anyone have any solutions with this problem? <br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
