We are getting the following Error.<br />
Error 254: Committ transaction has failed in audit server)  on commit_trans.<br />
I believe this is because there is no sufficient space in the Baan server.<br />
I have purged the audit file by running the session Purge Audit files<br />
(ttaad4161m000) by selecting all the companies in the range (except companies like 000.<br />
However it has given us only a few MB of space.Previously when I ran the session(3 monts back) we got almost 1.2gb space.<br />
Please help me in finding a solution. Presently Audit folder shows the space as 850mb.<br />

254 EAUDABORT<br />
<br />
Commit transaction has failed in the audit server action: see log.audit file for more information<br />
<br />
<br />
log.audit should be found at $BSE/log <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe this is because there is no sufficient space in the Baan server.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there or isn't there space on your disk left?<br />
<br />
<br />
However it has given us only a few MB of space.Previously when I ran the session(3 monts back) we got almost 1.2gb space.<br />
<br />
<br />
As audit information are condensed to the maximum, this sounds reasonable. The 1,2 GB had been gathered for which time interval? (When did you delete last before these 3 month?)<br />
Audit is turned on for which tables?<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

3 months back when we purged audit files we got  around 1.5GB, this was after an interval of perhaps 1 year,after that we have done this a couple of times.<br />
1 week back we faced this problem &amp; found that space had come down to just 3MB.<br />
On purging the audit file we got just 150MB.<br />
After 4 days the space again reduced to 2MB &amp; we repeated the process, but this time we got just 60MB. I believe even if I purge the files now I would get only a few MB of space.<br />
At present I have only around 90MB space.<br />
Audit is turned ON for almost all tables. All standard tables have audit on. <br />

<br />
have a look at the max file size with ttaad4560m000. Audit information is added to sequential files per table upto the max file size value, then the next file will be created. <br />
The current sequence cannot be deleted, so a large max file size has disadvantages.<br />
<br />
For the file tiitm001 in company 777 you will find files like:<br />
$BSE/audit/777/atiitm/aitm001777.000<br />
$BSE/audit/777/atiitm/aitm001777.001<br />
.<br />
.<br />
$BSE/audit/777/atiitm/aitm001777.nnn  and<br />
$BSE/audit/777/atiitm/aitm001777.inf, <br />
nnn beeing the sequence actually in use and <br />
the .inf file will have information about the file and current sequenc (I guess).<br />
<br />
By taking a closer look on $BSE/audit and its subdirectories you can find out which tables consume the most space.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you delete audit files on a regular base, one has to ask why you audit in the first place.<br />
<br />
It is rather unusual to audit &quot;almost all files&quot;, especially the tf files are altered very often.<br />
For the files like the item master I would strongly suggest to exclude certain fields from audit, like tiitm001.ltdt (last change of stock) and suchlike, as these fields are altered very very often and there is no gain in monitoring these changes.<br />
<br />
To specify whether fields should be excluded from audit, use session ttadv4127s000, don't forget to convert to runtime.<br />
Keep in mind that if you change the DD, another audit sequence will start too.<br />
