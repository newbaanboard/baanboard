<br />
 So, what were the old settings in db_resource? What did you change? Is it OK now? <br />
<br />
 Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tianalita</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">i have installed baanIV c4 and oracle8 on the new server.<br />
<br />
And i have seen that in the db_resource file, the variable<br />
<br />
dbinit was not present. <br />
<br />
So, i simply append in the file <br />
dbinit:021<br />
<br />
the presence of this variable inthe file is mandatory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Things are not exactely so simple. You may read the document &quot;Oracle Database driver internals&quot; and get more information. <br />
<br />
 dbsinit is not mandatory. What I suggested is a very loose policy. The settings in db_resource are not really independent, you need to corellate them. For example:<br />
<br />
dbsinit<br />
lock_retry<br />
ora_timeout<br />
<br />
  It depends from site to site how you set all these variables. For example, we use <br />
<br />
lock_retry:0<br />
<br />
But this is not a general rule for everybody.<br />
I remember that there was a porting set which said that we should set dbsinit to 01. (I think it was 6.1c.05.02, not sure). Anyway, now we have PS 6.1c.06.02.<br />
<br />
 I am glad that it works fine now.</div></div><hr />
