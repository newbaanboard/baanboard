<br />
With worktop you have a kind of destop in which you can use the DEM browser, menu browser and internet explorer together. You can create shortcut's to URL's and sessions as well.<br />
<br />
I have to say that we have some problems with it for which we don't have an explanation yet. You have to think on, autorisations, sessions that don't start.<br />
