<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thomas_b</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 23:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious if anyone has any ideas or suggestions on automating user setup and maintenance.  We have about 350 users mixed with DEM and menu browser desktops.  We're also using various db restrictions, and company authorizations as well.  DB restrictions are applied on a user role basis.<br />
<br />
Environment - Baan IVc4, SP14, OS Unix, DB Oracle<br />
<br />
Appreciate any feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan_James_Baan</div><div class="date">11th March 2004, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I worked at a client once that had an automated process that used web cgi scripts for user account requests and approvals, then the details were written to a file, which then went through a perl script to create the account on Unix then it fired off a job that ran an exchange scheme that loaded the data into Baan for permissions and DEM and then ran the appropriate sessions.  <br />
<br />
I was never closely involved so I don't know the details, but I do know its possible, because this whole thing ran every night, and the admins never had to do a thing except possible changes to users during the day, and so on.  Which made their life easier.</div></div><hr />
