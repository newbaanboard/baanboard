<br />
Is there any way to use/activate the mouse wheel with the Baan GUI (Baan IVc4).   Environment Variables...BECS variables.... anything?<br />
<br />
With the Logitech Mice, you can enable a &quot;webwheel&quot; function.  Is there anything for Microsoft mice, Compaq, HP?<br />
<br />
If this question was asked before, I apoligize for the repeat.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or the application provides support for the mouse weel (not the case for the BW) or then the operating system provides limited functionality to all applications (by trapping the mouse wheel and then translating into page up/page down, for example).<br />
<br />
Windows 2000 and posterior (ME also) include mouse wheel support, but you need to have a mouse with a wheel in the first place (and drivers if not included with the OS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">16th May 2002, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">As Victor says you need drivers to get this functionallity.<br />
<br />
If your Windows environment is W95, W98 or WMe, and you have a Microsift wheel mouse, you can download form msn site the latest driver.<br />
<br />
In my case I use an IntelliMouse PS/2 compatibe, from this link (http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouse/download.asp?FinishURL=%2Fdownloads%2Frelease%2Easp%3FReleaseID%3D32610%26area%3Dsearch%26ordinal%3D2%26redirect%3Dno) , you can download the driver I use.<br />
<br />
You can configure left, right and wheel clics in general, and also a especific configuration to any application.<br />
If you select specific configurations you only have to look for the bw.exe and we use Tab for clic with the wheel (very usefull).<br />
In some multi occurrence forms, roll wheel only works if you locate the mouse over the vertical bar in the form. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
