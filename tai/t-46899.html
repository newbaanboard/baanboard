The latest SLM unfortunately doesn't support VM-environment and so it won't work...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">2nd March 2009, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">One hint for all those who have tried to install the SLM 2.3x up to 7.x on a virtual machine: Although it is not supported by Infor/SSA, it is still possible to install and run the latest SLM in a virtual environment. The setup only seems to recognize VMWare environments (atm) - running the setup (for example) on Sun's Virtual Box works fine. <br />
<br />
Important: It seems that SLM 7.x recommends a new host ID. Thus the old license.xml doesn't work anymore... Also, as installing the SLM in a virtual environment is not supported by Infor/SSA, it is not recommended to use it for in a live/productive environment.<br />

You just can't install the SLM server on a virtual environment - you can install ERP LN (and other prior versions too).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes you can. Use Sun's Virtual Box for example...<br />

SLM install didnt work on VMware with the staging wizard (the error specifically mentions VMware), but it says you can run the install manually - which DID work in that you get to the [FINISH] button on the install without error<br />
<br />
BUT once its 'installed' it still doesnt seem to work and there's no information as to why.<br />
<br />
When you try and enter licence information you get error that no master licence server is running<br />
<br />
Also, I can't see the SLM service in the list of services.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">4th March 2009, 14:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Afaik you can install it manually, but you cannot install all components (only the client/mmc snapin). So it won't work in VMware. Even if you manage to install all components (for SLM 2.5x you just have to replace the setup.exe with the one from SLM 2.2x), after trying to start the SLM service a popup will show up which says that it doesn't work on VMWare... So, try Sun's Virtual Box (or something else instead VMWare).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">25th March 2009, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The SLM server checks the Mac Address of the virtual network card.  Part of the MAC address identifies the manufactur of the device.  On a VMware virtural machine, VMware is the manufacture. The SLM server shuts down as soon as it identifies the network card. <br />
<br />
If you are using a notebook, install SLM server on the notebook and ERP on the Virtual Machine. You can also point the server.xml file to another SLM server on the network. If the Server has named users, you must be a named user.  SLM also identifies the BCLMID for the development server.  So you will probably not be able to do any development, but you could run the applicaton.</div></div><hr />
