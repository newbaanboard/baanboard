<br />
Thanks for your reply, I missed some information in my question. Companies have an specific VRC strucutre and I want to remove the structure as well as all objects in the spcific VRC (directories and physical objects also). This VRC is derived from a customized VRC and no further derivation from this VRC.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

Check for other sessions -<br />

ttaddv6255m000 - Purge Entire Package VRC<br />
<br />
ttadv6250 - Delete Software Components by Package VRC<br />
<br />
Then remove package VRCs (ttadv1511m000), software directories (ttadv1115m00), remove packages from package combination (ttaad1211m000), then remove the link of company &amp; package combination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried the mentioned session &quot;ttaddv6255m000 - Purge Entire Package VRC&quot; to purge the Package VRC but getting message as <br />
<br />
&quot;Package VRC still exists in Package combination&quot;.<br />
<br />
I tried Package &quot;td&quot; to purge the entire package VRC.<br />
<br />
If first remove that package from the package combination and used session &quot;ttaddv6255m000 - Purge Entire Package VRC&quot; , get another message as <br />
<br />
&quot;Package VRC has no successors&quot;<br />
<br />
Any idea, what should be the sequence of steps to follow.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

- create VRC's<br />
- create PC<br />
- create the company and then its tables<br />
- customize (can be also done before the company steps)<br />
<br />
here you need to do the reverse order:<br />
- delete tables and then the company<br />
- delete customizations<br />
- delete PC<br />
- delete VRC's</div></div><hr />
