<br />
I am not sure for baan iv, but now I already convert to level 2 for a few table (Customization Table) on BaaN ERP.it's seem it's faster then use VB or BaaN read data.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note. BaaN ERP<br />
Database SQL 2k En.<br />
OS: Win 2K advance Server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to update data into BaaN Tables through one VB program, as we are using BaaN 4, Ms-Sql on win 2k. When I enter 100 records through VB only 4-5 records displyed in BaaN<br />
after reorganise I can see 100 records.<br />
As per BGS it is related to driver level problem because level 2 is not supported by baan iv/ms-sql and level 1 can't support 3rd party app.<br />
<br />
Can anybody suggest how to solve this issue? or Can anybody give me docs on BaaN connectivity kit or logic behind algorithm of hash column updation?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

I was told that the upgrade would get rid of the ugly hash columns and potentially cut the db size in half...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">26th July 2004, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you're right - the latest porting set (6.1c.07.04) for Baan 4 supports SQL 2000 in level 2 mode. There is a conversion program to run.<br />
<br />
I haven't been brave enough to try it yet though!<br />
<br />
Advice - test, test, test!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jccccc</div><div class="date">26th July 2004, 23:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious, how much testing have you done and whether you have started running with the level 2 driver yet?  Any advice on what to look out for would be great.  My company is considering the jump...</div></div><hr />

<br />
we changed our testsystem to the second level driver. The performance improvement is great, also the size of the database was reduced by 40%.<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">malutz</div><div class="date">27th July 2004, 09:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hej igen,<br />
<br />
i found a specific documentation that we created ourself and works just fine. If there is any intrest please let me know. Than i'll translate it into english,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">murtaza_asgar</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">We have migrated to level 2 in 2002 (probably the first company in india).<br />
I can site following advantages<br />
1.) Hash column is removed,hence reducing database size and in turn backup time<br />
2.) More complex queries handled by database,hence if your database server is separate then it's utilisation can help along with application server.<br />
3.) Now sisnce column indexes are created , applications which are directly running on odbc protocols will run phenomanally faster.<br />
<br />
We have now no speed issues inspite of exponential increse in database.</div></div><hr />

Install portingset 6.1c.07.06 and run conversion session ottcomsql. Since the server is not licensed yet , i've ommited the maintain system configuration. Now i tried to create tables for new co. Go to query analizer and saw tables still hash columns. Is there aditional steps i must run to put SQL in level 2?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">malutz</div><div class="date">5th March 2005, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you change to level 2 driver in the tabledef6.2 file?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pcolombo</div><div class="date">5th March 2005, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Malutz : I have my problem solved. I followed the following steps<br />
<br />
1) Create 3 databases on ttaad4110m000<br />
          a) 001 . For Tools Only (without Audit)<br />
          b) 002  .All Others tables (without Audit)<br />
          c) 003  .MAndadotry Tables For Audit (With Audit)<br />
2) In all databases  Fill the field parameter with this value<br />
           MSQL_LEVEL1 = 0<br />
3) Dump ALL companies (including 000).<br />
4) Convert RDD in ttaad4110m000 in order to re-create tabledef6.1<br />
5) Exit Baan<br />
6) from command line use bdbpost -k -n -m -f -I &lt;path/file&gt; -Cxxx, for every co. dumped.<br />
7) Login Baan and then reorganize tables for all companies<br />
<br />
Afterwards all co ar in level 2</div></div><hr />
