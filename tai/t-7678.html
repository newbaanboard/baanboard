<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">16th November 2002, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">That does not come from shm settings (we once installed 6 instances of Baan - only tt module - in a 128MB True64).<br />
Check your installation steps, you may be missing somthing there. Did you check if you can access ottiex1288?</div></div><hr />

      I cud carry on with the installation makin sum changes in the<br />
kernel.But now the problem is that i cannot do anykind of <br />
activities like bdbpost,bdbpre,bdbreconfig using the user bsp.<br />
even the demo tables that i created the tables were created but<br />
no data cud be imported in them.I guess there must be sum <br />
problem with the bsp user settings or sum kernel parameters <br />
since neither bdbpost or bdbpre is working.can u plz suggest me<br />
sumthin.<br />
thanx Victor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check for Unix errors in /var/adm/messages<br />
<br />
Any Kernel or Shared Memory problems during installation will be reported there.<br />
<br />
Once you check this log, you'll have a better idea where the problem is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">21st November 2002, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">You mentioned that cannot run bdbpre and bdbpost as bsp, can you clarify this better? Also when you run them, check the $BSE/log.* files for errors and post them here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BWrules</div><div class="date">26th November 2002, 07:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Im done with the baan installation but now theres one problem<br />
I cannot use any print sessions.After i enter the device name <br />
i get an error <br />
  undefined function (get.compnr)<br />
 EXPORT$.UTF8 undefined function.<br />
I contacted support and they said that it must be a problem with<br />
the porting set and i suspect it to be a problem with the standard<br />
objects.I have the proting set 06.03 over here and have sp8 <br />
installed using the batch installer and have also replaced the <br />
bic_global and bic_repgen files.can u plz. tell me which objects <br />
might be creating the problems so that i can download form the<br />
support site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">26th November 2002, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Check objects ottstpstandard, ottstpsplopen and ottstpsplclose  (bic_info6.1 ...). That 6.03 is the latest version or the original instalation one (bshell6.1 -v)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 00:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually there is a bug in the Tru64 environment with shared memory initialization that I ran into at another customer site.  I will check into this later as it is the Thanksgiving holiday here in the US and I am out of the office right now.<br />

     well i upgraded the porting set and now the system is workin<br />
fine.so it was a problem with the porting set.And now i face with<br />
only one problem of migrating from baanbase to oracle9i .I would<br />
like if ne1 of u cud give me sum useful tips on that.I have portset<br />
6.1c06.06 installed on the system which supports 9i .<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">29th November 2002, 05:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Watch out for the Oracle 9i installation.  IT has just been supported and has not had large scale performance testing done yet in customer environments with Baan.  Our preliminary information shows a significant performance hit with 9i and we are researching ways to resolve these issues today.  Depending on your timeline, I would recommend 8.1.7.2 (or best version for your platform) unless you have 2-6 months for a test environment and full scale benchmark to solve the inevitable issues.<br />
