<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently started with a company running IVc3.  After using PMC on IVc4 for so long I forgot how painful the &quot;old&quot; way was to install patches (especially on a system were very few patches have been installed)<br />
<br />
What are the differences between c3 and c4 that would prevent PMC from being installed and running successfully?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back in '98, I was on a project for Nortel where we backported PMC from IVc4 to IVb and if I recall correctly, we had to have the IVc4 tools set and a certain porting set requirement.  However this was done to control delivery and installation of customized software, not standard software.  The standard software was applied (manually) to the custom version and exported using PMC and delivered to Nortel.<br />
<br />
Since, you will not be able to receive PMC patches for IVc3 from Baan, I'm not sure how you intend on using it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">PMC patches are already being delivered for 4c3.  ttiex1284m000 (Import patch) was re-written to accept PMC patches a few years ago.  Import Patch just ignores the PMC related information from the patch.  <br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see the dependency chain for patches we have already applied through Import Patch.  PMC should tell us to re-apply them as they do not exist in the PMC tables.  One approach would be to create entries in the PMC tables based on patch history.</div></div><hr />

In any case.... you are correct you have to create a ton of pre-req entries in the PMC tables...but it can be done<br />
<br />
good luck<br />
