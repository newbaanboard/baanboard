<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alibaba</div><div class="date">5th September 2003, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you NvanBeest very much!but I have other problems about this .<br />
the session tiiex1280m000 export data dictionary of  that module,but they must restore to same edition or application environment.I want make it to alone patch and can import to other edition of baan(e.g I developed  it base C2 environment and I want import to C4 environment),for new sessions or functions or tables and other,I can export/import  data dictionary between different edition environment.but some session of mine refers some original tables of system.if import/export data dictionary, maybe.......:(<br />
<br />
So, can you tell me other method of create .dump file?I want create alone patch file resemble patch file of baan.or not include create tables,only packet session around.but it can be import to other edition or environment and dont influence orignal system.<br />
<br />
BTW, what structure about patch files of baan?<br />
<br />
thanks!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">5th September 2003, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">You can import into a new VRC in the other environment, so I don't understand the problem that you have to restore to the same environment.  As far as I know, there are no differences in the dump files between C2 and C4.  As for the modifications based on the standard C2, these will have to be redeveloped in the C4 environment, since there might be table changes to the tables used.<br />
<br />
To export only the sessions and/or code, excluding the data dictionary, uncheck the option to base the export on sessions, and, on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th form, specify exactly the components you want to export.<br />
<br />
Another way of exporting/importing?  None that I know of!  And creating the patch file yourself?  If you can get the layout of these files I presume it is possible...</div></div><hr />
