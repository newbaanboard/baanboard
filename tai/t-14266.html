Parameter??   JUST KIDDING, there is no such thing.<br />
<br />
Are you referring to the Performance Booster sessions?  Try this link:<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5768&amp;highlight=Performance+Boosters<br />
<br />
Also, for Baan documentation, (sort of), check solution #741 on the Baan support site.  Or the session help for those sessions is really just as good.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for other Performance help, there is a doc for Performance Tracing and Tuning Guide, Dikkie Dik has posted the Baan doc on this link:<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7665&amp;highlight=Performance+Tuning<br />
<br />
If those are not helpful,  let us know the specifics of your problem.  System performance is affected by many things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a lot of parameters in Baan that could negatively effect your performance. Anything in your $BSE/lib/defaults/db_resource<br />
could mess you up if done wrong.. Your best bet would be to log a case with Baan support and ask for the Driver Technical Reference Manual for your database and read it over.<br />

<br />
As far as my knowledge goes, the Functional Parameters drives the way Baan will work for you. It has nothing to do with your Systems Performace . Functional Parameters are generally setup at the time of Implementation with the help of Functional Consultants. The setting of these parameters solely depend upon the Business Process of each company.<br />
<br />
Systems Performance can be improved by the Table Boosters/Performance boosters. Also having a look at the things put in Audit will give you a idea why the system is slow.<br />

Thnx.<br />
