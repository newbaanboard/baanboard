We are on Baan IVc4 on NT. Is it safe to delete the tmp* files under g:\baan\temp directory. also have files type qp000503, qp000549 etc. which occupies more than 1.3 GB space<br />

<br />
so essentially baan does sorting related operations in qp file and for whatever 'xyz' reason , these files are not removed frm system sometimes , so it's for sure safe to delete older qp files.<br />
<br />
Note : you should remove the qp files which are current or latest, since it might be getting created by some user using baan session.<br />

You can add 'qp' files as well as 'tmp' files and old 'bshell' files older then f.i. 2 weeks. Once setup you have not to bother about these files anymore. :cool:</div></div><hr />
