<br />
<br />
What is the recommended server capability?<br />
<br />
1. No. and speed of processor<br />
2. Qty of RAM<br />
<br />
Anybody has experience on this? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I cannot give you advice on sizing personally but did you contact your Baan representative to ask him/her for the latest official sizing guide?</div></div><hr />

They use two NT4.0 sp6 dual CPU system with each 2Gb internal memory.<br />
They have Baan5b with Oracle 7.3.4.<br />
<br />
BUT, this only gives you a rough idea, it depends heavily on which modules you are going to use, what kind of third party products are probably involved, kind of RDBMS etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">26th January 2002, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, are you running any of the heavy modules (PCF, Big projects, etc)?<br />
<br />
How many batch or CPU intensive jobs do you have running concurrently?  Win2000 does not handle this well and you need one additional processor for every 1-2 batch jobs.  I generally do not like to have less than four procs in an app server.<br />
<br />
The database server can probably be a pair of processors.  Each server can most likely have 2-3 GB of RAM.  But this is a rough estimate depending on your answers to the above questions.<br />
