I want this user keep using a license all the time, so that the cron job is trigerred everytime.<br />
<br />
We have noticed that, if we hit the &quot;maximum user license reached&quot; issue, the cronjob user does not get license to trigger the job and it is very important to our business to keep this user occupying a license all the time.<br />
<br />
How can we dedicate a user license to the cron job user? they are all concurrent licenses and we are not using SLM.<br />

<br />
Not sure about your environment. But, on LN when I faced this issue, I created a bat file and scheduled it right before the jobs. What the bat file does is, it restarts the License service and makes sure that no orphan processes are running and makes a way for my job to run without any issues.<br />
<br />
Its been running smoothly since then without any problems.<br />

<br />
what's about using the BaaN Job-Daemon instead of CRON startjob.<br />
<br />
The daemon resides permanent.<br />

With the old license server you can use an option to clear orphaned licenses, use that to free them. However that will not help if all your licenses are indeed are used.<br />
<br />
A better way is to use the SESSION_TIMEOUT to kick out users after they are idle for a certain period. <br />
<br />
However since abottoir is using unix he/she can easily write a wrapper script to prevent all licenses are used.</div></div><hr />

Han, I am curious to know if you can answer what actually happens when the License Server is restarted? Does that actually add's up licenses? Or just kills the non-active bshells? Never was into in-depth administration but had a thought that it might be just freeing the unused licenses.</div></div><hr />
