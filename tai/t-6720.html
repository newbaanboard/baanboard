<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 03:32</div></div><div class="posttext">First, here is the setup:<br />
<br />
BAAN is installed in two computers, one production and one development. Underlying database is ORACLE. Each computer, of course, will have its own ORACLE installation and the related BAAN instances.<br />
<br />
Next, my requirement:<br />
In my spare time (when I can get it, that is!) what I am thinking of doing is writing a BAAN Session that will run in the Development Computer and read a BAAN Table in Production Computer and insert the read record into the same table in the Development Computer. If this works for one table, I will expand it to obtain a consistent subset based on selected criteria to set up test companies with reasonable amounts of data instead of multi-giga-byte approach that has to be followed today. I suppose it will be quite tedious writing the program, but once completed, I am hoping it will be very useful.<br />
<br />
Finally, therefore, my question is: <br />
<br />
What are the set-up requirements (BAAN and ORACLE) to make this happen? <br />
<br />
I will appreciate if anyone can share any experience on this subject.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres an on-going discussion already... <br />
<br />
updating &quot;test&quot; companies (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=23978#post23978) <br />
<br />
I think you have to explore more, into the areas like Remote Database setups and different Oracle SID's in BaaN. I think you also need to be aware that the Table Definitions be need identical.<br />

<br />
2. use the connect string in the database configuration.<br />
<br />
3. assign companies to database configuration.<br />
<br />
This means you can't use the same company number on both systems.<br />
