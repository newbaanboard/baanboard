The steps differ depending on the company you created the definitions for (tools or production). In the case of the production co this is how i would have done...<br />
1) Create Runtime Data Dictionary {ttadv5210m000} with all options Checked. This will be run for all customized packages and not for the Standard.<br />
2) Close Baan<br />
3) Stop and Re-start the Shared Memory service<br />
4) Open Baan and log into the company where i need the table to be created <br />
=&gt;The above two steps can be done by restarting the server too..<br />
5) Create tables {ttaad4230m000}<br />
 <br />
For tools, the first step is replaced by Create Runtime Data Dictionary for Tools {ttadv5213m000}<br />
