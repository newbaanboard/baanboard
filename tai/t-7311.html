<br />
in a exchange scheme that i have created........i need to append a date stamp to the name of the ascii file that gets created .<br />
<br />
currently as always , i have specified a ascii file name in the <br />
tuxch0131s000 session i.e Maintain Table relations Export.<br />
<br />
<br />
is there a way that i can append a date function to the ascii file name i specify in the tuxch0131s000 session i.e Maintain Table relations Export.<br />
<br />
i know that another option is to write a shell script which will append a date stamp to the ascii file name  by renaming it after the export is done......<br />
<br />
but i am just trying to do it in the exchange scheme itself<br />

you could set up different batch numbers with different ASCII file names and execute a different batch number each day.  Maybe even set a condition on each batch to run only for a certain day<br />
so when executing the exchange scheme it will wirite the ASCII<br />
file name only for the current day<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts!</div></div><hr />

Assuming the export session doesn't do the read on this table at the start of the session this should work.</div></div><hr />
