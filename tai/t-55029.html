<br />
I see that the Installation Wizard creates &quot;.nw&quot; versions, but I'm not completely clear on the logic it uses in doing so.  I thought others might've already been there and done that and would have some experiences they could share.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
on which Baan version and platform are you?<br />
<br />
<br />
I assume for now that you are on a Unix platform (on windows there should be norc.start/stop) and running BaanIV.<br />
<br />
In this case rc.start/stop are not part of the portingset. So they are not affected at all. The .nw files must have been manually createed by somebody.<br />
