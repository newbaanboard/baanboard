The action was 99% successful. In the new environment, LN operated with BW, with WebUI. Ming.le was not working, it reported a server error as in the attachment.<br />
We were making a full copy of the environment that we picked up in the new environment, all settings were transferred correctly.<br />
Maybe you have some ideas what we more we can chack.</div></div><hr />
