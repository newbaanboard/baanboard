<br />
Here is one which might be a technical problem but feels like it is more related to BaaN, since this is the only program where printing is either slow or just not very functional.<br />
<br />
I have a user with a new HP p1102 wireless printer, while sending BaaN IV reports to their printer, the printing either takes long or does not happen at all. The client is using a Windows 7 64-bit pc with the BaaN IV B40c.098 version of the becs client.<br />
<br />
Attached is what the printer shows up while trying to print, if I cancel the top option, then the printer works - however the user is a high end user and so does not wish to have to keep doing this in order for their new printer to work. Any of you guys experience the same problem like this?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing from you soon,<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Christopher</div></div><hr />

You need to map your LPT port with USB.<br />

<br />
tried the &quot;net use lpt1: \\Server\Printer /y&quot; option, but still encountering the same problem. It looks like BaaN sends the print job to the spooler service which takes 1 minute to process the print request and then continues sending it onto the printer.<br />
<br />
I am going to play on my computer with this setting as the user is a power user.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experience this problem with their usb printer and BaaN IV? This is only being delayed while using BaaN IV. Microsoft Office 2010 documents print instantly, I would have thought it to be the other way around but not in this case.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
