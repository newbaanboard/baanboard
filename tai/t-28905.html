<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kingsto88</div><div class="date">15th December 2006, 05:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I need some enlightenment. <br />
<br />
I have just joined an end-user company using Baan software.<br />
<br />
I do not understand the baan license setup.<br />
<br />
We have two servers, production and development.<br />
I noticed that their validation keys is the same. Their customer, licence and sequence numbers are the same too. But both the servers have different host names.<br />
<br />
Now I noticed both servers also have same number of users, 30 users. I was told they copied baan from prod server to dev server two years ago. <br />
<br />
My question is :<br />
1) Doesn't the dev server need to be validated once baan is copied over?<br />
2) How do the dev server still have the same number of license as the prod server? By what I understand, the key will not work once the hostname is different. They must validate the new dev server with maybe 1-2 license only for dev work. But now it seems they have 30 licenses on the dev server and it is working fine. I thought also that they must have 2 different seq numbers and 2 different validation key for the two different servers for it to work.<br />
3) Their license6.1 file also have only one hostname respectively. So they do not have license sharing, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
I am confused now. Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

However technically speaking that is not necessary. I assume it depends as well as how things are registered at Baan.<br />
It is possible to share licenses by using the same name in the licence6.2 file.<br />
<br />
1. No, the license information is stored outside the ${BSE}. You need to update the license6.2 file and rerun the patch objects session.<br />
2. Depends on what happened in the past. I can not answer that for you. You probably should contact support to check what they have registered.<br />
3. Correct.<br />
