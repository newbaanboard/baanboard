<br />
        We are 24 hour company. when we use create dump data and other user do transactions within the baan tables are on going.  BaaN will give message on that's user &quot;Error 107 (Record is locked) on whinh260939 (Max retries(10) cannot not continue...<br />
<br />
        Data on table whinh260939 very huge so when dumping data this table will lock it. <br />
<br />
we are using windows 2000 advance server , database SQL 2000 ,  BaaN ERP sp11  porting set 7.1 d 03<br />
<br />
I hope you understand what's I meaning <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot .<br />

<br />
But this is what is really required consistency requirement of backup. Even if hypothetically it were to allow backup while users are online and transactions occur , that backup is of no use because of online transactions and resulting inconsistency in the backup.<br />
<br />
So in ur example u may schedule backups in weekend when people are not online  . Ideal  situation would be to have an extra DB instance in which data is updated (read backed up ) online .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you elaborate on DB Instance and Readbacked up.<br />
<br />
What are you doing at your end for taking sequential dump even when people are working in the system.<br />
<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ours is not a 24X7 company . It's 12X6 company. So we schedule the backup at night  when no users are working on the system.<br />
<br />
Further we have a redundant server with Baan networked license with Baan logic server and DB instance installed in it. Through Baan net, the data are updated online in other server. <br />
<br />
All databases have their own native replication methods and u can use it's native capabilities to such replication.<br />
<br />
There is nothing 'ReadBackedup'. It just implied online updation in other server is online backing up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you give me the setup required for the setup of Baan Logic server and db instance.<br />
<br />
At present we have defined a job which executes at night for taking sequential backups. We store these backups in Cartridges.<br />
<br />
We also have a Backup server as part of Disaster recovery plan. On weekly basis we are restoring the data on this backup server. For this first all the tables are deleted and then created and then tables are restoed from sequential dump. This server is also on network license.<br />
<br />
I think it would be better if I could setup what you have done..i.e. Baan logic server and db instance. Can you give the details.<br />
<br />
Is this an online backup or batch process. If it is online then it must be affecting the performance of the live  server?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Vineet<br />

I will tell u our setup . But that may not be useful to u due to different os and database.<br />
<br />
u search this forum like Disaster recovery  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/search.php?s=&amp;action=showresults&amp;searchid=230864&amp;sortby=lastpost&amp;sortorder=descending)  . U'll find lot of useful information.<br />
<br />
Here is our setup in brief from whatever i could recollect. I am not in front of my system.<br />
<br />
1. Same porting set on both server.<br />
2. Networked license<br />
3. Maintain systems (other server) (ttaad0150m000)<br />
4. Maintain remote users(ttaad2101m000) (ruser files created after convert<br />
to runtime DD)<br />
5. Database definition with a copy to separate server. (Convert to runtime <br />
   DD will create isamdef6.1)<br />
6. Assign tables to database (tabledef6.1 created).<br />
<br />
Please contact Baan support center for more detailed assistance.<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
