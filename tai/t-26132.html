It is not popular among many of the users and some upper level management are suggesting that this timeout process risks data corruption and that I need to selectively turn it off.<br />
<br />
I'd like to solicit comments about this.  Consider this scenario.....<br />
<br />
If someone is posting cash, for example, and leaves the office for lunch without logging off the BaaN system.  While at lunch the timeout occurs.  Does such a scenario pose some risk of data corruption?<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced data corruption as a consequence of utilizing the time out?</div></div><hr />

We did it to control our license. We have exempted some users that are known to have long running processes, and also our batch processes. Most of the exempted users are from the accounting area. How this helps.<br />

We are also using timeout mechanism since last 4 years. We found no issue till date. <br />
The logic is designed in such a way, that, if client is frequently communicating to server then there will be no session out. If client is using some program, definitely there will be time out for BaaN licence but database level there will be no session timeout.<br />
So there will be no issue for inconsistency.<br />

We are also using timeout for around 4 years and we do not have any issue. It will kill only those user which are ideal (not communicating with server) for a period which is set in timeout. Its working perfectly and this also help us to control our baan licences.</div></div><hr />

Search -&gt; Advanced Search, enter timeout in the search field and select the thread of Tools Administration &amp; Installation, that will give you a lot of information threads.<br />
If you do that, one of them will be the following thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9901&amp;highlight=session+timeout)</div></div><hr />
