do a lot by changing layout fonts.look for maintain layouts and font selection. you also have to set the  fixed device font to 'no' or uncheck it  if you are looking at  different fonts for different layouts.<br />
Additionally, you could set field attributes too for every field.<br />
may be an attchement of the screens may help us understand<br />
the exact &quot;nice&quot; difference.<br />
<br />
Some times, Printers and drivers play spooky too.</div></div><hr />
