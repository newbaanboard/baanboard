<br />
We currently have a single-single set-up across our 9 Baan companies. We want to run some testing using a multi-multi company structure. So, on our pre-production server I would like to set-up three new 'multi-multi' companies. <br />
<br />
Can I have a mix of single-single and multi-multi company's set-up on one Baan environment? e.g. companies 501 - 509 are single-single and companies 600, 601 &amp; 609 will be multi-multi.<br />
<br />
These two sets of companies will be independent of each other. Companies 600, 601 &amp; 609 will not need to share/communicate data with 501 - 509.<br />
<br />
The only common objects between them will be the tools tables.<br />
 <br />
<br />

<br />
Like Dave said: You can mix Multi-Multi and Singel and whatever. Howmuch you like. Lot's of our customers are doing this!<br />

Enjoy<br />
