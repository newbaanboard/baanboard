<br />
First idea is create these VRC packages in the second machine, export all related software from machine 1 and import it on 2.<br />
<br />
Later create a new package combination and then change companies to this new created.<br />
<br />
Well in theory this will work but here is the question.<br />
<br />
Data from PMC tables in machine 1 can be exported to machine 2 in order to have the history and dependencies with patches related to this VRC's?<br />
<br />
Will this work?<br />
<br />
Any ideas or comments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless, you are using the same level of tools patches on both but then, another problem would be with the solution history (time stamps and installation order), meaning that a PMC export from one system to the other can mess them all up, so, not advised at all.<br />
<br />
If you need a proper test system, then it must me an exact copy )with extra stuff on it, not vice-versa) of the live. Depending on the level of stuff you already have on the test system, probably the best would be export what you have, copy the prod. to test and then import the former... all depends on what you have already setup!</div></div><hr />
