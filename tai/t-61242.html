<br />
Have any of you had the chance to experience BaaN IV on a system running Windows Server 2008 R2 with Microsoft SQL 2008 R2? I am debating on whether to use porting set 6.1.16 or 8.7. Have any of you managed to get BaaN IV working on this configuration? Which porting set did you keep to?<br />
<br />
I see the technical notes make no reference to BaaN IV with porting set 8.7 or with porting set 8.2b+? Does this mean I am trying to perform the unperformable? Before you ask, yes, both systems are 64-bit.<br />
<br />
I hope someone has performed this test and that it proves successful. Please let me have your comments. Anything to look out for?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">3rd October 2011, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running that OS and DB using porting set 6.1c.14</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">4th October 2011, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The 8.x series portingset for BaanIV is only limited available yet. It will be released soon. For now just stick with the 6.1c version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">10th October 2011, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for your responses, does anyone know when they are expecting to release the 8.1 porting set? If 6.1.14 will work, then I will stick with that one. Was there any special settings you had to apply to get BaaN to work on this configuration or did the straight forward install work for you? What service pack did you bring the BaaN software up to? Is this a live production environment?<br />
<br />
Thanks once again.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">10th October 2011, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The install was no problem. It was on new hardware so we had time to do the install over a few days before going live. The only issues we had were related to Chinese language. ( we are running the simplified chinese localization).<br />
We are at service pack 30 and it is a production machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Lahey</div><div class="date">10th October 2011, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got this working on Server 2008R2 and SQL 2008R2. <br />
<br />
Main issue was I had to patch the installer with the latest porting set otherwise it wouldn't talk to SQL Server 2008R2 as it didn't recognise the version #, I used 6.1c15 porting set.<br />
<br />
Other thing is that SQL Server has to be installed with Latin1_General_BIN2 collation or Baan won't install. The Master DB in SQL Server has to be in this collation too, so make sure you set it during the installation otherwise its a right pain to change it after the fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">13th October 2011, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there, ok, so have got my hands on all my software requirements. Are you sure it has to be Latin1_General_BIN2? I am busy installing it with the Latin_1_General (attached configuration), have not yet tried to install BaaN IV. I got this setting from some old documentation I have in installing with Microsoft SQL 2000 Server and this configuration was used. Does the BIN2 have anything to do with the &quot;Level 2&quot; mode they require. I must say, SSA at least provided screen copies of the installation whereas Infor have gone to simple state a few words.<br />
<br />
I will attempt the install with this configuration and let you know if it succeeded. Thanking you all for your valued input.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">13th October 2011, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there BaaN guru's,<br />
<br />
Ok, so I have got to the point where I am trying to install the BaaN server software side and am receiving the following errors. I am able to connect to the server through SQL Server Management after enabling &quot;SQL Server Browser Service&quot; under the SQL Server Configuration Manager. I have also enabled &quot;Named Pipes&quot; under the SQL Server Network Configuration of SQL Server Configuration Manager. I am obveously stuck as to progress from here. Should I be trying to install the latest porting set from BaaN before proceeding to try and install the Master CD?<br />
<br />
I hope you can offer some better insight? Mike, was this where you got stuck and where you changed the SQL DB to Latin1_General_BIN2?<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to note. Thanking you all for your assistance, will greatly appreciate any help to get me a bit further. Thanks in advance :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">13th October 2011, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, used the Infor CD that was shipped to me, created a seperate folder under one of my Windows directories and copied the files over from the CD into the folder. I downloaded porting set 6.1c.15 and replaced the &quot;Installation Wizzard&quot; folder with that of the latest porting set. I then found that the server had not started the &quot;SQL Server Agent&quot;. After starting this agent using the SQL Server Configuration Manager, the installation proceeded.<br />
<br />
It is busy running as we speak, thank you for all your efforts. - solution 22899038 for porting set<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">14th October 2011, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I am ready to migrate my data from my old BaaN IV server, currently on &quot;Service Pack 16&quot; and wishing to integrate it into my new replacement server currently on &quot;Service Pack 23&quot;. What is the best method of doing this? Would you choose &quot;dumping tables&quot; then &quot;importing tables&quot; - repairing any new dimensions added to the tables in sp17-23?<br />
<br />
Does one need an extra license from Infor to use the &quot;Office Integration&quot;? I have performed a search for solution 126530 and Infor have requested me to contact my support representative.<br />
<br />
Look forward to receiving some advise on these two questions, thanking you in advance.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">14th October 2011, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using a multi byte set up so have the DB collation set to CHINESE_PRC_BIN.<br />
<br />
For migrating the data we copied the dict folder from the old server overwriting the dict folder on the new server. Then moved the data with bdbpre/bdbpost. Then ran create runtime to update the dict folder with the new sp definitions. Whole process took about 24 hours for 15 companies and around 100 Gb of data</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">17th October 2011, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok Gary, so you first bought the new server's sp level to the same as the old server's sp level, then moved the dict folder from the old server to the new, is this correct? When you say you ran the &quot;runtime data dictionaries&quot; to update the dict folder to the new sp level, you did not need to apply the sp's again?<br />
<br />
What command strings did you use when using bdbpre and bdbpost, how did you get a list of tables which needed to be repaired?<br />
<br />
Sorry, as you can see, I am more of a visual and practical applications person as opposed to an extremely technical knowledgeable person.<br />
<br />
Thanking you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">17th October 2011, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">We started with a basic install using the new porting set. Mostly to get the registry settings correct as they are stored differently in server 2008 that in 2003.<br />
We then copied the whole bse folder from the old server to the new server.<br />
Then installed all of the service packs.<br />
We then overwrote the dict folder that had been updated by the servic epacks with the original from the old server.<br />
Then did the export and inport<br />
Then did a create runtime to rebuild the dict folder <br />
<br />
pm me and I can give you more info on the bdbpre/bdbpost commands, but basically we created a file with a list of tables we wanted to export.</div></div><hr />
