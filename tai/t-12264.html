Question about making jobs...<br />
When you want to make a job and there it is a date field on the form (or more of them) then BaaN asks you to answer on:<br />
&quot;Consider the difference between entered date and system date ? No&quot; <br />
<br />
Q: When you have to answer with YES and when with NO ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsteenwi</div><div class="date">21st July 2003, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">You want to run a session in a job. You want this session to run every week, with the static date of 01-01-2003. In this case, your answer should be &quot;NO&quot;. BaaN will run your session every week, with the date set as 01-01-2003.<br />
<br />
  You want to run a session in a job. You want this session to run every week, with as dynamic date one-week-back. (So, in the case of today, the date should be: 14-07-2003.) In this case, your answer should be &quot;YES&quot;.<br />
The first time BaaN runs the job (today), it will run the session with the date set to 14-07-2003. Next week (on 28-07-2003), BaaN will consider the difference between the system date (on the moment you created the job) and the input-date; the difference, being 7 days, wiil also be used the next time the job runs. Ergo, when the job is run on the 28th of July, the session will be run with the date set to 21-07-2003.<br />

<br />
Think in terms of + (plus) and - (minus) for example<br />
<br />
Lets assume that today is the 5th.<br />
<br />
enter +3 in the date field and answer YES.<br />
Your job will run with the date of the 8th.  When this same job runs on the 6th it will have a date of the 9th.  On the 7th it will have the 10th etc.<br />
<br />
enter +3 in the date field and answer NO.<br />
Your job will run with the date of the 8th.  When this same job runs on the 6th it will have a date of the 8th.  On the 7th it will have a date of the 8th.  On the 8th it will run with a date of the 8th etc. <br />
<br />
By saying no you are &quot;hard coding&quot; the date parameter.<br />
<br />
A common use would be if you wanted to run the same job every Sunday and have it report on information for just the previous week.  Run the job on Sunday with a -7 and answer YES.  The difference from the system date and the entered date is 7 so your report will always look at the past 7 days when it runs.<br />
<br />
Hope this help you out,<br />
