During installation of Baan Vc application, we have encountered errors while the step : Adding groups and users to Oracle. As a result the files ora_groups and ora_users are empty.<br />

These errors are displayed when ora8_srv6.2 from $BSE/bin is executed.<br />
Are there separate binaries for Oracle 9i to be downloaded and copied in $BSE/bin?<br />
<br />
We have done a fresh installation of Oracle 9i and it is not an upgrade from Oracle 8i.<br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered a smiliar problem during installation of Baan Vc, if so can you please let us know the work-around or solution for the same.<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to install the Oracle kernel extension for AIX in order to be able to continue with the instalation. See solution:<br />
<br />
133559 <br />
<br />
You must download and install the extension using the file provided there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your response. The Baan case number resolved my problem. <br />
<br />
This is the response I got from Baan UK Support for posting my problem as a case on the support website:<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Unfortunately this installation is not dealt within the standard support contract but can by dealt with via our consultancy team.<br />
<br />
I can ask our technical consultants to contact you should you wish or alternatively you can contact your account manager <br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If only they had given me the solution number life would have been much easier:D .<br />
<br />
Thanks again!:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
on AIX 5.x (AIX 5l) you could not install Kernel extentions, beause AIX5.x is a 64 bit OS and there are no kernel extensions are availible for 64bit mode.<br />
<br />
It is only possible to install  a 64bit Version of Oracle DB.<br />
<br />
Please refer to BaaN KB and to Oracle Metalink.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I quote the note:<br />
<br />
*********************<br />
 pw-syscall              8.1.x, 9.0.x             AIX 5.x <br />
 (v3, 64-bit enabled)    32-bit and 64-bit <br />
 <br />
Note: To check whether the kernel extension is 64-bit enabled, please use the &quot;strings&quot; command on the kernel extension binary to see if it prints  &quot;Supported Oracle Instances: 32-bit &amp; 64-bit.&quot; <br />
***********************<br />
<br />
This solution worked for me. I had the same error. Then I installed the extension and the problem was solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tejask</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 11:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All,<br />
<br />
The solution Stefan Ninu has mentioned worked for me too.<br />
<br />
Here is what we have ... a 64bit OS (AIX 5.1) and a 64bit Database (Oracle 9.2) however, Baan ships Oracle8.1.x libraries which need a 32bit kernel extension.<br />
<br />
To make it work you need to swtich your kernel to 32bit by using Baan solution 133559.<br />
<br />
As per the Baan solution(work-around):<br />
The given kernel extensions can not be loaded on a 64-bit operating systems, although the kernel extension are for both 32-bit and 64-bit. For the time being the operating systems needs to be booted in 32-bit mode until there is a fix.<br />
<br />
Use command:<br />
bootinfo -K<br />
To report whether the system is running a 32-bit or 64-bit kernel.<br />
<br />
I guess we just have to wait for Baan to come out with a new set of libraries for Oracle 9.x which can run on a 64bit kernel.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The solution for me was to install the kernel extension. I tried this on AIX 5.1 and it worked fine. I did not have to reboot the system in 32 - bit mode. The kernel extension was loaded successfully.<br />
<br />
 Now I am trying the same on AIX 5.2. I am trying to install the extension but I get an error message:<br />
<br />
SYS_SINGLELOAD: Exec format error<br />
libpath = &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
 Should I boot in 32 - bit mode ? Which is the AIX command for doing this? <br />
 Thanks !</div></div><hr />
