When trying to install the 6.1c.07.13 porting set in a cluster environment it always sugest the hostname (it's impossible to change) of the other node for installation. After it aborts the installation process reporting that it's not possible to do a remote installation. This behaviour occurs in both nodes of the cluster.<br />
I've already cleaned the lib\install folder and also the Local Settings\Temp in the My Documents folder of the installation user and it's the same.<br />
Does anyone know anything about this.<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

This is an old problem.<br />
As far as I remember I solved it after finding a logging files directory from an old porting set installation.<br />
This directory had several files that were pointing to the other node.<br />
After deleting the directory the porting set installation program executed sucessfuly.<br />
