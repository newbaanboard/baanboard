<br />
I am planning to upgrade baan production server from IVc to IVc4 over a weekend. Due to very limited time(system shutdown), I would like to complete most of the steps in advance so that I can minimize the down time and also would like to make the system ready as much as possible (no baan support help during the weekend). I am planning to follow the following steps: Please let me know if you see any problem with this approach:<br />
<br />
Baan IVc to IVc4 upgrade<br />
<br />
1. Install baan IVc on new server and copy the BSE environment from<br />
   production server to this new server<br />
<br />
2. Install SQL server and restore baan production database from backup onto this new server<br />
<br />
3. Configure the application to point to this new restored database<br />
<br />
4. Run install or update CD for IVc4 to upgrade this new server<br />
<br />
5. Apply all service packs (tools and application)<br />
<br />
6. Create a new custom VRC derived from PMC (patch VRC) on IVc4<br />
<br />
7. Copy/merge all the customizations to this new VRC<br />
<br />
8. Change one company package combination to this new VRC and test<br />
<br />
9. If tests are successful; change the package combination back to original Package combination<br />
<br />
Production Database upgrade Over the weekend<br />
<br />
10. Export only tools company data (bdbpre) from new server (above server)<br />
<br />
11. Import tools company data into Production<br />
<br />
12. Point the new server (treat as application server) to the production database server<br />
<br />
13. Change the package combination of the compnies to new custom <br />
      package combination (IVc4)<br />
<br />
14. Point the users to this new application server<br />
<br />
15. Configure/upgrade the old application server<br />
<br />
16. Remove the test database from new app server.<br />
<br />
Schedule Level 1 to Level 2 driver conversion at later date<br />
<br />
Database size: 100GB<br />
SQL version: SQL 2000<br />
Windows server 2003<br />
total production companies: 6<br />
<br />
Basically, my approach is make an application server upgraded and ready prior to production database upgrade and export the tools company data from test database to production database and point the new application server to production database server.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your help.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
