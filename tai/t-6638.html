<br />
I face problem &quot;Error 2 during split .file&quot; when I scan solution file for installation of BaanIVc4 sp10.<br />
<br />
After it,I start the Check solution to install,and many error message occur in the message windows with the following text:<br />
&quot;individual solution '156434' could not be found&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any one help.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we also sometimes encountered such errors. It happened when solution was downloaded with errors or was downloaded only partially. E.g/ you have only part of the solution not till end of its file. Try to download it again from baan technical support site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a more and more common problems either with incomplete solutions or with bad patch errors. <br />
<br />
I have seen problems where these kind of issues can stop SP installs in thier tracks and need a small amount of GMT to complete, not the best of solutions for what is designed for an easier way to install patches. <br />
<br />
So when you get a bad patch, you need to download that patch from the KB and re-scan it, remembering to overwrite when you scan (otherwise it doesn't work), then continue with the install of the SP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Also is a good idea to compare file size which is posed at Support site and that being the result of downloading. If the last is smaller that the initial of course it is no good to scan once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">12th September 2002, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">GTM for installing should not be necessary. Download problems and file transfer problems account for error -2 (file not found) when split file (when extracting the contents of a solution dump based upon its Table Of Contents: a part of the file is missing).<br />
<br />
Comparing file size can help if the files got truncated, but also in a bit-stream sometimes bits get flipped... in that case the bytesize may be correct, but if you do a binary compare (Unix:diff  or NT:fc) you will be told if your redownloaded file matches the original one.<br />
<br />
One work around when the status in PMC tables are wrong (installing) for rescanning, you can also do this repair on file system level:<br />
1) Go to ttpmc0100m000 and read out the first pathname (for solution dumps) assume ${BSE}/pmc<br />
2) Determine the Base VRC for the solution (assume B40_c, with file extension stnd)<br />
3) Download the solution file in that directory:<br />
$ cd ${BSE}/pmc/B40_c<br />
$ ftp ftp.support.baan.com<br />
&gt;user: anonymous<br />
&gt;password: *<br />
&gt;bin<br />
&gt;cr off<br />
&gt;cd updates/B40_c<br />
&gt;get &lt;SolNr&gt;stnd<br />
&gt;quit<br />
4) Compare the downloaded solution number with the previous downloaded version<br />
diff &lt;SolNr&gt; &lt;SolNr&gt;stnd<br />
(or fc &lt;SolNr&gt; &lt;SolNr&gt;stnd)<br />
5) if different (very likely) then move &lt;SolNr&gt;stnd over &lt;SolNr&gt;<br />
6) if not different then download again :) and start over with 4<br />
7) restart installing in ttpmc2101m000</div></div><hr />
