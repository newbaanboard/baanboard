<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mikejakowetz</div><div class="date">25th February 2003, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks, <br />
I have a small problem.<br />
<br />
I have some develpment work which needs to be rolled out to a small subset of our users.<br />
<br />
I created a new VRC on top of our existing VRC.<br />
<br />
the problem is that I cannot move users to the new VRC.<br />
I get the error message: Package combination of company is B40b_fil; package VRCs in package combination are different.<br />
<br />
BaaN Australia say that production company must be linked to the same VRC of the users who will be working in that company.<br />
<br />
if this is the case, how do I let all my users work in the same company, with some of them seeing my new Modifications, and the rest seeing what they already had seen?<br />
<br />
I used to be under the impression that the vrc's were like layers.<br />
ie. development vrc --&gt; production vrc --&gt; patch vrc --&gt; standard BaaN Vrc.<br />
The layer a user is logged in on, determines which level of modifications that the user will observe.<br />
<br />
We run BaaN IVb on HPUX10.20 with an informix database.<br />
<br />
cheers and thanks in advance.<br />
Mike  :confused:</div></div><hr />

Refer to the link - Changing Company of a user (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7494) <br />
<br />
You can change a company belonging to a different package combination as long as there are no Tables/Domains/Runtime DD differences. [Atleast, this is valid in BaaN-5.2 version, I am not sure on the other BaaN Versions, please validate]</div></div><hr />

Companies are attached to Package VRC's, and cannot be attached to more than 1.<br />
<br />
You cannot have one company look at 2 different Package Combinations, so one company cannot look at 2 different versions of a given component.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sorry Lisa, I differ with you and thats how we implemented in all our QA and Production Environments and it works. <br />
<br />
Disclaimer- Please refer to my quote.   :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">25th February 2003, 23:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think we disagree - you can change the company to point to a different VRC...but you cannot have the same company point to 2 VRC's at the same time.  Is that your take?<br />
<br />
Edited:  I think you are saying that a user could switch to a company that is not in the same VRC as they are, as long as the RDD is the same.  I would not disagree with that either, though I have not tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">26th February 2003, 00:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I got your point now, your right we dont have differences :)  <br />
<br />
To make things clear for our understanding -<br />
<br />
Companies are linked to Package Combinations and not VRCs.<br />
<br />
Package combinations can have same/different VRCs.<br />
<br />
A company can be linked to only one package combination at an instant but a package combination can be linked to many companies.<br />
<br />
One can switch between companies linked to different package combinations as long as the Domain/Table-DD are matching else the tools will give an error message.</div></div><hr />
