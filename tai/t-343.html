<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chadwickh</div><div class="date">31st October 2001, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to migrate menu components from our test to production environments generated from DEM when the load is low, usually late at night to avoid interfering with online users. I've been trying to come up with a method to install these from a Baan job to avoid these late night logins. The first thing we do is remove the menu components from production by running ttadv6250 - purge software components by package VRC. It prompts you with an &quot;Are you sure? Yes/No&quot; question. When I run this from a Baan job, it aborts the session as a prompt can't be processed from a Baan job. Anybody have any ideas on this? I've tried an enhancement request but I feel it isn't on anybody's list. I'm considering an Oracle script to remove the records from a cron entry.</div></div><hr />
