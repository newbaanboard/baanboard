We slowness problem when 'Edit' any pgm.<br />
Example: When we edit a pgm of a session [Hold session / Display 2/Pgm/Edit], the editor opens correctly, but when you close the session window is concerned with the clock on windows [thinking ].<br />
Long time to return the mouse, so that each variation is endless. Sometimes, with the option 'Show' also passes.<br />
<br />
Any help??? Thanks to all.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
As i see, you are on Unix/Solaris ?<br />
<br />
try to use vi editor directly on server.<br />
If the slowness is gone, there's a problem with the network connection.<br />
By using an external editor, BaaN creates a *.tmp file of the source at the local client.<br />
By leaving the editor, the original source is updated by the content of the tmp file.<br />
(Or access rights in the source dir are not set properly)<br />
<br />
Above is done by using EDIT and SHOW option with external editor.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I can not use 'vi'. Our programmer uses 'UltraEdit' locally [it's easier for him] and each time you make a change it takes a very long time to save. We have another machine, where changes are made, but this is not happening to us. Any suggestions???<br />
Thanks for everything.</div></div><hr />

While I have used both vi and UltraEdit, I became a fan of UltraEdit for the syntax formatting (especially for very long programs with a lot of internal documentation).<br />
<br />
Bernd is right in that Baan will create a .tmp file on your developer's PC.  When the changes are made and saved the file is then copied back to your Baan server.  <br />
<br />
If it is working on one server and not the other then there is a difference between the two (especially if you can see the performance difference using the same PC running UltraEdit).  It could be the network path between the two, or the permissions on the server.  You can also make sure that both servers have the exact same patches are applied in TT.</div></div><hr />
