    Is it possible to Change the Name of Baan server running on Windows 2003/SQL2000 without having to re-validate the licence? I have seen some contradicting replies to earlier threads on the same topic and so it would be great if someone could give a final word on this matter.. <br />
<br />
Here is what i have done and the problem i faced..<br />
I changed the server name, changed the hostname in Licence6.1 and also the database server name in Tabledef6.1..<br />
Should have worked, if going by some response to earlier threads, but the licence service failed. It wouldnt start again. I had to run the Patch Objects after Crash session to get into Baan. No matter what i did afterwards, i was facing the 7 days limit untill the old hostname was brought back...<br />
<br />
So if someone out there knows how to do it successfully without re-validating, do let me know... or shall we conclude that this is not possible..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..<br />

Quoting from that document...<br />
<br />
When must you generate a new Security Key (SK)<br />
=====================================================<br />
You must generate a new SK when the following occurs :<br />
-On the machine where the LICD program runs,the hostname is changed<br />
-On the machine where the LICD program runs,the hostid is changed<br />
-If the NODE where the LICD program runs is to be integrated into a pool<br />
-If the NODE where the LICD program runs is already integrated into a pool but the members of this pool are changing.<br />
 <br />
Most of this events can be planned,except for the system crash.<br />
Obviously, you must send the new SK to your local Baan CS&amp;S rep.and ask for the new corresponding VK.<br />
 <br />
NOTE :<br />
Under Unix, the hostid is retrieved from the motherboard of the computer.<br />
Under NT, it is a computation (?)of the MAC addresses of all installed network adapters.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Now, anyone here who has successfully changed the hostname (on a windows server) without having to re-validate is welcome to share How it was achieved...<br />
