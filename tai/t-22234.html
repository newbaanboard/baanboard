<br />
are you using any &quot;Third Party Tools&quot; for printing for example sales orders? We use a tool called &quot;Streamserve&quot;. With that tool you can also send emails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">3rd November 2004, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I don´t use any tool for print in Baan.<br />
<br />
I find, reading the forum, there is a program called &quot;blat&quot; to send mails.<br />
<br />
I'll try with it, but if any body know how to open outlook (or excel) across citrix with baan, please say me.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

I don't know much info. on citrix, but I have made a good utility using blat.exe, which is frequently being used by our users. We have different plants at different geographical locations connected with fibre optics, people always moving here and there. Also configuration and maintenance of outlook at different locations is difficult job. By using this utility, they can send urgent mails to their seniours and our customers/suppliers.<br />
<br />
Finding it very useful. Screen-shot attached herewith.<br />

<br />
Yes, you can send messages to external person. You can search here for readme.txt of blat program, you will get syntax and examples as well.<br />
