IF we have selected the adadpter whiel installing the LN then no  need to installed it again.<br />
Also Connector installation is required on server as well as in client.<br />
yes,Server site and Client site setup is use same installer of Infor 6.2<br />
yes,Client site not require to have Centarl Configuration console.<br />
To create balnk xml file and add only follwoing line<br />
<br />
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;root&gt;&lt;/root&gt;<br />
<br />
Then you can open the Centarl Configuration console and do the needed configuration<br />
