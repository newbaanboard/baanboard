<br />
Is there any information out anywhere,without contacting Infor first that may be of some assistance ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any pointers would be much appreciated<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

Wouldn't recommend to go for the that old windows version. Use a up-to-date one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have just been told that our porting set is 8.5a.02<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

<br />
The best bet could be, please check your current porting set and decide on what porting set you wanted to move onto Windows, once you have that clarity, please see read the technical notes of the new porting set which you are planning for, that will have information about the DB and OS versions.<br />

<br />
The latest portingset is supported on windows 2008 SP2, 2008R2, 2012 and 2012R2. You should know as well that windows 2008 is running out of support at 1st of january 2015 (mainstream support) so it's wisely to use windows 2012.<br />
<br />
Supported databases are oracle 11.2  and sql-server 2008 SP2, 2008R2 and 2012. Go for the latest sql-server version if you want to use that.<br />

Sounds like getting the right porting set for the chosen windows version<br />
