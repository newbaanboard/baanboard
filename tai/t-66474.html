<br />
I am totally clue less, why BAAN is behaving like this. I am trying to take the sequential dump of table for package &quot;td&quot;. But after taking the sequential dump when I checked the error log file and find error &quot;table can not be locked&quot; for tdsls all and tdpur all . e.g. tdsls040,tdsls041, tdpur045. Then I dnt have much choice and took  data backup by separate module wise. e.g. tdsls, tdpur, tdind, tdinv, tdilc. when I checked the error log there is no such table lock error.Backup is perfect.<br />
<br />
I could not understand why I am getting such error when I run for package td only in full range. where as ti,tf and tc I find no error while I took back up in full range. <br />
<br />
Please advise why such unreasonable error is coming and kindly advise what steps I should take as a corrective measure. I have attached the screen shot of the standard session.<br />

<br />
When I run the sequential dump, there is no user logged into baan.<br />
I checked the error log also, but could not found any clue.<br />
<br />
But surprisingly when I take backup module wise for td , there is no locking issue. when I take back up for full package td to td and all modules, it throws error into log file &quot;table can not be locked&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a message about a error at database level in the event viewer/log.oracle ? I mean something like ORA-xxxx.<br />
Sounds like a threshold value has been reached. There are default Oracle values that dont suite Baan (max open cursors and stuff like that).<br />
If this is the case you should find something in the event viewer or alert.log/log.oracle8<br />
