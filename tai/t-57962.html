After installing BW97 and Worktop 2.4.17 on Windows 7/64Bit I have the following problem:<br />
<br />
I configured in the BW-Client a working default configuration but when I try to configure the worktop I get the error message &quot;You do not have a BW enviroment. Make sure you have onfiguration files (.bwc) and default configuration&quot;. And I have no optio n to do.<br />
I know the reason why this happens. <br />
The reason is that I startet the BW and Worktop first time as an user without administrative rights, but I dont know how to solve this problem.<br />
I have uninstalled and reinstalled the applications.<br />
The same error.<br />
Even a System Restore to a point before first time installing the application doesnt help.<br />
First time I have had this problem, I have reinstalled Windows( it was XP ) but now I have no direct access to the PC.<br />

<br />
when you mark your working default config in BECS and then go to &quot;Tools&quot; and &quot;Options&quot; you can change the path were your bwc file is stored (Local/Roaming/Public/Custom). You should change the path to Roaming or custom and then try to configure a new wtd file. Hope this helps.<br />

I have found this option and tried it and it works then for the administrator user.<br />
But for the other user it doesnt works even when i gave this user administrator rights.<br />
<br />
The result was that I have access to the configuration but when  I tried to configure the worktop the login box appears and i can access to baan( the baan option dialog come up and i  can start the baan shell via this dialog and the ps-command shows me that the ottstoledaemon was startet ), but the worktop says me that he is waiting  for the connection.<br />
Its very curios because when  I go to the bw configuration from the worktop the configuration dialog from the LN client appears and I didnt install the LN-client.<br />
<br />
After the last ( the third ) system restore the computer isnt accessable anymore from the VPN-Connection.<br />
So I think I will have to reinstall this computer.<br />
<br />
But for the future: Does anyone know where are the settings stored, so that this problem remains after a system restore?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot modify the Becs / tool / options / profil storage path, this variable is set automatically in 'custom' with the install path of the client BW100.<br />
How you can modify the value to public, roaming or local ?<br />
<br />

You can solve it using 'worktop_client.exe' instead of 'worktop.exe' at worktop\bin folder.<br />
This application works fine to create the .wtd file. After that, you can keep using worktop.exe to open the configuration file.</div></div><hr />
