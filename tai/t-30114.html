Font size is different from every printout from different PC. Especially a PC was formatted, all font size and spacing are different form previous setting. How could it be? All client PCs are running Windows XP and 98. Thanks all gurus.</div></div><hr />

  Thought these sort of problems were sorted out with the LN version but i guess not. <br />
Ok, so if i were to do this on baan4c4, <br />
1) I would first check on the Report and find out what fonts are in use in the sections that goes hay-wire. <br />
2a) Then i would see which PC prints it out properly and then copy the settings on that Computer, like(font settings in Bwprint) and even the BWPrint.exe file to the PC's which were having problem.<br />
2b) Another way of doing this step is like what Jo had suggested. You could go to the registry settings under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Baan\bwprint\ and record the font settings to the PC that isnt printing properly. <br />
<br />
Last but not least, make sure that the printer names under that registry key doesnt have individual font settings...<br />
<br />
This ought to do the job..Then again, this is baan4c4 way of tackling the print problems..You could give it a try..<br />
