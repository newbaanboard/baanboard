Live Server Name, Test Server Name <br />
 <br />
Stop your baan license service on the test server(if its running in demo then this service will be turned off by default). Optionally add the live server address and name to the host file of the test server(i.e if they are on different subnets)<br />
 <br />
If it doesnt work after the above steps then you could do the following step too..<br />
In the session Maintain Security code/validation keys {ttiex3102m000} enter the same customer code, license code and organization name as your live server and change the seq. number to 2..<br />
 <br />
I hope it works..<br />
 <br />

 <br />
P.S: The above setting is for a windows platform..</div></div><hr />

In that case U'll have to choose the same in RSC, submit RSC  to Infor Baan , get new brand file generated on both machines ( if u want license server to run on both server i.e. u enter both server name in licenses6.1 ) . <br />
<br />
I have not tested a scenario where u include only the name of production server in licenses6.1 of the test server excluding test server . I think that should work and should enable u share the license .</div></div><hr />

    You can go about doing this with the help of shared licenses which is what we have done on one of our sites. The only difference being that both the machines are Live or Production Servers. <br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your replies guys.<br />
<br />
If Live server name is A and test server name is B.<br />
I have put in test Server licenses6.1 &quot; A,B&quot; and restarted the bshell but its not working.:( <br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply <br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">29th July 2007, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Stop the Baan licensing Service and then edit the license6.1 file and enter only the name of Live Server (ServerA in your case). Make sure that Test Server can see the Live server and pinging either server name or ip gives a result and doesnt time out..<br />
It wouldnt be a bad idea to enter the ip address and Live Server name in the host file of the test server)...<br />
 <br />
sk<br />
P.S: The above step should get you a license from the live server as it worked on my test server. Make sure the license service on the Test server isnt running and the license6.1 file on the test server shows exactly the same thing as the file on Live server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
    Thanks for your reply.<br />
    But I have to do changes in test server license6.1.<br />
    No changes are needed in live server license6.1,Right?<br />
    May be my questions are basic.But have to be bit careful when i am woking    on licensing issue :)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">29th July 2007, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Its better being carefull than sorry. <br />
Yes, you are right. There is no need to do any changes on the Live Server. No changes whatsoever!!!<br />
Only edit the Licence6.1 file on the Test Server and stop the licence service on Test Server!!<br />
 <br />

license6.x file of A should point to A (no changes here)<br />
stop and disable BaanLicenseServer of B, change license6.x file of B so that it also points to A</div></div><hr />

       Problem is sloved.thanks for your help.<br />
but i think after changing the  test server name  to live server name in license6.1 of test server no need to start the licensing service of test server as we are sharing the live server licenses with test server.<br />
<br />
please correct me if i am wrong.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
