Does anybody have any experience running the following configuration or know any reasons why we shouldn't upgrade to this :-<br />
<br />
AIX 5.2 (64bit)<br />
Oracle version9.2<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In general, there's no reason not to upgrade to your stated specification.  Go for it.<br />
<br />
A few minor comments:<br />
<br />
* Checkout the recent press with regards to IBM licence issues with AIX :)<br />
<br />
* Consider whether to install 32 or 64 bit Oracle.  64bit will probably run slightly slower<br />
<br />
* Oracle version 9.2 is very new and maybe less reliable or robust than earlier versions.  Though taking into account de-support for 8i is already announced installing this may give some element of future-proofing.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<br />
Havn't heard anything or seen any press coverage relating to AIX/Baan licencing. Please could you enlighten me on this?<br />
<br />
We were expecting 64 bit to perform better than 32 simply from a logical point of view. Why do you think 32 would be better?<br />
<br />
Thanks again - Mick</div></div><hr />

Checkout this thread for discussion on AIX:<br />

<br />
Basically SCO have revoked the authority of IBM to use AIX.  So the future for AIX seems slightly uncertain.<br />
<br />
Computer Weekly has lots of articles on this:<br />
<br />

64bit Oracle favours very large databases.  Ones which have say a shared memory size greater than 2Gb.  Baan doesn't have the necessity for this power, or a large shared memory.   64bit Oracle will double the memory footprint, the binaries are are larger, and the subsequent throughtput through memory is thus slower.  Yes more powerful, but not faster.<br />
<br />
Also note that Baan have not released and are not going to release a 64bit Porting Set - so the Baan Application will always be processing in 32bit anyway.<br />
<br />
Though the : 64bit OS - 64bit Oracle - 32bit Porting Set, is a very popular combination amongst our members with no reported problems.</div></div><hr />
