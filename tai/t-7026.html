I was looking at some postings and I found this and I have a question... when we were running Crystal Reports we often saw that there was a Driver process related to that with out a bshell. Does that mean, based on the above statement, that Crystal did not consume a Baan license?</div></div><hr />

<br />
never forget, that &quot;licd does not notice&quot; does not mean<br />
it is legal.<br />
<br />
For example licd counts concurrent licences, but most Baan customers have named licences. licd will never notice, but <br />
some of my clients got anyway a nice letter from Baan reminding them of this fact.<br />
<br />
The same could be true for db-drivers and so on.<br />
<br />
But otherwise you are right. 500 crystal users can access your database, even though you might have only 5 Baan licences.<br />

<br />
Based on your posting can you explain why our Crystal reports fail when our licence limit is hit with message cannot logon to server ?</div></div><hr />

Can't log onto the server or can't log onto Baan?  You can do some database queries without opening a bshell.</div></div><hr />
