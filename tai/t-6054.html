<br />
is there any way to start external applications(on the client) like Word or Excel or any such application from within baan client . <br />
<br />
We want to start these applications both from DEM as well as Baan Desktop Manager . <br />
<br />
We are on Baan V b running on unix and Baan clients on  Windows based machines.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />

<br />
Within DEM you can model so called &quot;file based activities&quot;. These activities can point to a Word document, an Excel sheet, etc. If you want to run the Word or Excel application instead of the document, just use &quot;winword&quot; or &quot;excel&quot; as the file to run (same command as you would enter in the &quot;Run&quot; option from the Start menu in Windows itself) .<br />
<br />
Within the Desktop Manager it is not possible to model external client applications, only Baan sessions and server commands. <br />
<br />
If you are running 5.0c you can use Worktop as interface instead. This is a new interface replacing the Desktop Manager, DEM browser, Process Viewer, Menu browser and more. Within this interface you have a Outlook-alike Shortcutbar in which you can create shortcuts to Baan sessions, DEM activities, Help texts, URLs and also Word, Excel, etc. But unfortunately it is not available on 5b yet.<br />
<br />
