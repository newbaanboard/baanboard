<br />
I would like to take sequential dump of entire company and am trying  to use the following:<br />
bdbpre6.2 -p b50cprod -t &quot;|&quot; -C 600.<br />
<br />
I am getting the below error:<br />
either the -N or the -I option should be specified'<br />
<br />
what is the option to take the entire company seq. dump without specifying the -I / -N option (-I option needs a file containing the names of tables while -N option needs the name of the table)<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can also use the session - Create Sequential Dump of Table - ttaad4226m000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms</div><div class="date">20th June 2002, 02:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
My aim to use bdbpre instead of create seq. dump session (ttaad4226m000)  is to speed up the process (I understand that running bdbpre from command line ) would reduce (by more than 40-50%) the time .<br />
<br />
Will going by your way have the same effect as the bdbpre  being run from command-prompt (i may not use progress - indicator)??<br />
<br />
if there is no option with bdbpre which takes all the tables of the company than; I paln to get all the tables for a company in a flat file using table ttadv420 and than run bdbpre?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">20th June 2002, 02:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think there should be a large difference in the speed of executions from the session and the command line option.<br />
<br />
The session also uses the bdbpre binaries. <br />
<br />
But when executing from the session, the table is verified in the current VRC tree based on the package combination and then verified if the table is existing in the database/company or not. If present then its the table dump is taken.<br />
<br />
If you are using the command line option we bypass those checks.<br />
<br />
Taking off the progress indicator might save you sometime, but with this 3-GL program you would be staring at your monitor if the program is done executing or not, and have to check the status with the ps command or use the process session. The progress indicator is a convenience for this situation.</div></div><hr />

-N option is used to specify one or more tablenames <br />
bdbpre6.2 -p b50cprod -Ntiitm001  -t &quot;|&quot; -C 600<br />
-I option is used to specify a table list file to take sequential dumps.<br />
<br />
create a file with all your table names in it ,each in one row,<br />
in this format.<br />
ticms001<br />
ticms002<br />
ticms003<br />
..........<br />
tdbcd990<br />
<br />
the command below will read the tables list from  the tables.600 file and will create the dump file of all the tables listed in the tables.600 to /dump/dmp.600<br />
and will also create a dmp600.err  error log file .<br />
<br />
bdbpre6.2 -I /dump/tables.600 -E /dump/dmp600.err -C 600 &gt; /dump/dmp.600<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope This Helps <br />

bdbpre6.1 -t&quot;|&quot; -o.  -Nttadv130 -C000 <br />
field no5 (or 6?) specifies tables(=3?), paste the first 3 fields together, sort (-u) to get rid of double entries and voila' - you have a file that holds tablenames. Edit this file and use it to dump the tables listed.<br />
This is from memory, but it sure works<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">16th October 2002, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are Oracle, you can use the oraX_pre.sql<br />
scripts provided with the porting set located in $BSE/lib/ora<br />

Then just bdbpre6.1 -Iora.tables.pre.XXX -t&quot;|&quot; -CXXX<br />

if you're not oracle you can probably use those scripts to<br />
help you write one for your DB.<br />

bdbpre from the command line isn't going to be any faster<br />
than from create sequential dump from table... but I personally<br />
think its eaiser to control, and i like to set my environment variables on the command line.<br />

<br />
You might have only half the story here.  You will only save time if you run are trying to make a dump and then create tables from that dump (i.e. reading and writing at the same time).  From the command line you can &quot;pipe&quot; from the bdbpre to bdbpost and this will save on processing time in a big way.  Running bdbpre alone from the command line will not save you any time over running the session ttaad4226m000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">As I mentioned before, the best way is to build the table list from a select statement from your database and then do your bdbpre on each table of that list. I've build such a script (Oracle DB) where:<br />
<br />
- it only gets the tables that have non-zero rows (you save a lot of time since most of the tables are empty, so why loose time dumping them?)<br />
- dumps each table individually and<br />
- when finishes for each one, starts a compress in the background - very usefull for big companies by saving a huuge ammount of diskspace.<br />
<br />
It even checks each dump log and copies the errors (if any found) into a global log that then is checked at the end to know if any problems where encountered.<br />
<br />
With this we not only managed to reduce an 8 hour dump to a  2,5 hour but also managed to go from 4GB to way less than 1 GB of filesystem usage.</div></div><hr />
