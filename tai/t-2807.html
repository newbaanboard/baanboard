<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">14th May 2002, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I've set-up a printer inf file to use proportional fonts when printing medium size text. When I print, my report fields are squashed together. <br />
<br />
The line in my inf file reads - middle=\E(s1p12h4099T, This is for a HP Laserjet<br />
<br />
I have come across a solution (78854) in the Baan knowledge base which explains the problem I'm having, it's something to do with having lines that contain text fields. But this solution is already loaded on my system. What else could be the problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I do not have manual right now, else I could give a more concrete example, but it is quite easy to figure out from the manual (the PCL reference).<br />
<br />
[And if there no compelling need to use them, avoid proportional fonts. You can grow old very fast ... :-)].</div></div><hr />

Baan uses spaces to outline the columns and spaces in proportianal font doesn't give you the same distance between the columns.<br />
<br />
What you can try doing is to define one of the user fonts to use proportianal fonts and change the fields in the report to use that user font. However I am almost sure that columns containing number fields will still have the same problem.<br />

I will try to change one of the user fonts, but I've taken on board what you are saying Han.<br />
