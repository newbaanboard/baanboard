<br />
I have PVRC  B40Vc4Ns which derived from B40Tc4Ns and<br />
we do customization in B40Vc4Ns and copy it to B40Tc4Ns<br />
<br />
now I want to delete all the components from B40Vc4Ns by comparing with<br />
B40Tc4Ns, except latest i.e. which are newer than B40Tc4Ns components<br />
<br />
Is there such session available or how it can be done?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

You need to specify the B40Vc4Ns VRC and it will delete all components that are equal to the one in the B40Tc4Ns VRC. But keep in mind that it does not have a notion of 'newer'. It has a notion of 'different'. So components that are different are kept in B40Vc4Ns.</div></div><hr />
