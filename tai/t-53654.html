Yes it should be possible. We are on 5.2/6.1/LN Versions I am not sure of all the implications in Baan-4 version. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">13th September 2008, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using a (hardware) load-balancer in front of 4 application servers. Jobs and some heavy users are running on/using directly a fifth application server which is also the backup maschine for the db-server (HAS).<br />
<br />
So in total we have 6 servers: <br />
4 with a loadbalancer in front for the normal users, <br />
a db-server <br />
a backup db-server which is also used for heavy users and jobs.<br />
<br />
The $BSE folder (except of $BSE/log and some special files which needs to be unique for each server) for all servers is placed on a SAN and shared by nfs. <br />

<br />
It's nice to know others have had success with something before going off on a wild goose chase.</div></div><hr />
