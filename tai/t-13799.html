The contents of $BSE/lib/audit_spec is :<br />

and the $BSE/lib/tables_audit has all the parameter tables name only no Y or N on either side. There are 87 lines<br />
e.g. <br />
cpcom000<br />

<br />
your profile shows, you are running windows, but your &quot;ls&quot; output indicates you are on unix?<br />
<br />
Let's assume, you are on Unix.<br />
<br />
I would be completly stunned to hear, that you have no tabledef6.1 file in $BSE/lib. You should not be able to do anything in your DB or see anything!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Can not be!!!<br />
<br />
If so, go to &quot;Assign tables to databases&quot; and do a create runtime. This will create the tabledef6.1<br />
<br />
Then log in again. maybe your problem is already gone.<br />
<br />
If not check the entries in tabledef6.1 for the &quot;tt&quot; tables in company 000. They do not need any auditing. So switch it off.<br />
<br />
Also check the audit6.1 file in $BSE/lib to be on the save side.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

<br />
yes u r right, the tabledef6.1 file is there with the entry:<br />
*:*:informix(INFORMIXDIR=/iconnect2.8,INFORMIXSERVER=baanc4,INF_LEVEL1=1):Y<br />
<br />
how do i exclude the tools tables from this?<br />
<br />
Also, bot the problems are still there.<br />
<br />
the file $BSE/lib/auditdef6.1 is empty.<br />
<br />
Also, i realised that during the installation of c4 there is a step in which the manual says <br />
Insert a new database named AUDIT. As a description, use AUDIT Database. The type of database depends on the running RDBMS. Select the Audit Trail check box. Clear the Force to Read and Copies Present check boxes.<br />
<br />
i did not do that step...i have uploaded the data ..can i do it now?<br />
<br />
thanks for that quick reply..<br />
<br />
Awaiting</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, the entry in your tabledef is strange or wrong.<br />
The last &quot;Y&quot; indicates, that these tables shall be audited, which is definitely not what you want for all your tables.<br />
<br />
For starters I would change in tabledef6.1 the last &quot;Y&quot; to a &quot;N&quot;.<br />
Then your initial error is gone!<br />
<br />
Second, you should define as described in the installation manual, one database without audit and one database with audit on. then you assign all normal tables to the database without audit and the parameter tables to the database with audit. If you loading of data was successfull and the two database are essentially the same (apart fom the audit), then you can do this any time.<br />
<br />
Third you have to define your audit directory in &quot;Maintain audit dirs&quot; or so to get a auditdef6.1.<br />
<br />
That should clean up your setup mostly.<br />
<br />
If you do not install Baan frequently, then it pays to follow the installation manual (mostly :-)<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanlover</div><div class="date">2nd December 2003, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">ur problem was due to the wrong info given in tabledef6.1 file. There u r defining the tables with audit on and the location of the audit files are not given in auditdef6.1 file. If u see ur log, it was giving error 2(means not able to read the required files). Pls create two database with one &quot;audit on&quot; and another with &quot;audit off&quot;. Assign the tables, which r required to be audited with database &quot;audit on&quot; and other  without audit. Before doing that, u can make the entry of tabledef6.1 file with the below text<br />
<br />
*:*:informix(INFORMIXDIR=/iconnect2.8,INFORMIXSERVER=baanc4,INF_LEVEL1=1):N   and can start working.</div></div><hr />
