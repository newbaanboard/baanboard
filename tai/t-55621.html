<br />
If so, how do you handle maintenance issues?  Are there any third-party vendors out there (presumably a Baan-partner with source code) that can support Baan for less than what Baan charges?<br />
<br />
How would you handle the situation where you need to get a new license key because you upgraded your server and do not have a maintenance agreement?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts or comments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My experience is if a customer does not pay maintenance you won't get a new licence key. Yet I also work for customers who do not pay support...  <br />
Before Baan was Infor you could always get a key, if you ever bought licences and payed maintenance in the past. <br />
<br />
There are certainly source code partners, but that does not help if you suddenly had to restore your Baan environment to a new server.  <br />
<br />
