<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KBacca</div><div class="date">15th March 2011, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok - this is kinda odd....<br />
<br />
Working in LN - I created a customized version of the report:<br />
 &quot;Reconciliation Data by Business Obj. (Detailed)&quot; (tfgld449521000)<br />
copied it to a new report number (tfgld449523000) and gave it a new name.<br />
I moved this from our test to our Production environment - and performed a &quot;Create Runtime DD&quot; on the Session (tfgld4495m000).<br />
<br />
All worked well...<br />
<br />
My customer asked for a similar report to be created and added to the session - so I copied my newest report (tfgld449523000) to a new number (tfgld449524000) and gave it a new name - and made the needed report changes.  <br />
<br />
However - when I did a Create Runtime DD on the session - the &quot;Select Reports&quot; pop-up session contains the same Report name for both of the new reports I added.<br />
<br />
The name appears wrong only in the &quot;Select Report&quot; pop-up session - when I get the &quot;Select Device&quot; session (ttstpsplopen) - it shows the Report Code and correct Report name at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
I've tried removing the report from the session - and re-adding it - but it doesn't seem to correct the problem. <br />
<br />
I've included a picture that shows the &quot;Select Report&quot; session with 3 customized reports showing - the one highlighted is not showing the correct name - it should read &quot;GKN - GRNI Report&quot; - as it shows on the &quot;Select Device&quot; session.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I missing something - has anyone run into something like this before?<br />
Is there some secret that I missed about report names?<br />
<br />
Much appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many thanks - that did it....I wasn't sure what the ttadv1243m000 session would do - I didn't think the Report name was a &quot;label&quot; - but apparently - it worked.<br />
<br />
This was happening in my DEVELOPMENT/TEST environment - when I imported the changes into the Production environment - everything was working fine - but the TEST system still showed the inaccurate report name in the &quot;Select Report&quot; window...<br />
<br />
Many Many Thanks!</div></div><hr />
