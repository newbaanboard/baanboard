After convert table tdpur041 to run time, I found the table lost about more than 20,000 records. Why does this happen? Is it the problem of Baan system or Oracle? Is there anyway to avoid the error? <br />
Please help me to find out the reason. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
there could be several reasons for this:<br />
<br />
a) You created a unique index on this table and the 20000 rows broke the unique constraint. In this case bdbpre will discard them.<br />
<br />
b) the bdbreconfig will first dump and then load the data again, so if your database is full (ie. oracle can not extend the table), then some data might be lost<br />
<br />
c) If you archiving directory gets full during a bdbreconfig, then it might happen, that the bdbreconfig times out for single rows, but proceed with the next one anyway. In this case rows are also skipped.<br />
<br />
There might be other reasons, but all of them can be avoided.<br />
<br />

We had a similar issue and there is a fix for it.<br />
TOOLS VERSION(S):<br />
7.1_a, 7.3_a <br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
&quot;Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary&quot;  (ttadv5215m000)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
When a new unique index is added to a table, this may result in duplicates on <br />
this new index. Execution of session Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary with <br />
checkbox Reconfigure Tables checked, results in skipping of lines with <br />
duplicate index. No warning is given. Lines are simply removed.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
A new option is introduced in session Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary <br />
&quot;Ignore Errors&quot;. When this button is checked (the default situation) the <br />
session works in the old way (errors are ignored), when this button is not <br />
checked the tables with duplicate index won't be reconfigured. The errors are <br />
logged in the logfile log.bdbreconfig6.2. The user can get rid of the <br />
duplicates and do the Reconfiguration again.<br />
<br />
This solution contains a Functional Modification. Please read solution <br />
&lt;sol_nr&gt; 134994 &lt;/sol_nr&gt; for the background of Functional Changes.<br />
<br />
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:<br />
This solution needs a relatively recent porting set (less then one year old). <br />
For Baan environments with tools version 7.1_a porting set 7.1d.01 (or later) <br />
is recommended. For recent porting sets  you are referred to generic solution <br />
105618.<br />
For Baan environments with tools version 7.3_a porting set 7.3a.01 (or later) <br />
is recommended. For recent porting sets you are referred to generic solution <br />
131704.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope u r talking of the directory in case we run bdbreconfig via command prompt ... am i right.<br />
<br />
and in case he runs via session only then in that case bse/tmp will be his default archiving directory. I believe that tmp does not have any limitations with respect to size.<br />

It can  not exceed it's maximum limit. It will definitely have upper limit.</div></div><hr />
