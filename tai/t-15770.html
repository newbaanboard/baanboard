<br />
Originally we were on BaaN IV c4 with sp14 on win 2000 , porting set 6.1c.07.02 , in order to make web top working baan told us to install a solution , we installaing that solution and it's related dependencies.<br />
<br />
now whenever we try to execute any print or update session baan crashes, they suggested us to go for porting set 6.1c.07.03, &amp; also to download 2 more solutions i.e. 13758 &amp; 114812. ... and also instructed us to install sp15. <br />
<br />
We have updated the porting set also i.e. moved on to 6.1c.07.03 , now problem is we are not able to install the solutions through PMC told by baan because the moment i click on Continue button , baan login crashes, what should i do ???<br />
<br />
isn't it a typical problem ??? any hints ??? i personally feel that baan will send us the extracted objects for ttstpopen or the &quot;Print to Device session &quot; so that it doesn't crashes ..... just a guess .<br />
<br />
Can somebody suggest as to what should i do , so that issue could be resolved by the time baan revert back to us.<br />
<br />

<br />
Run &quot;Create Runtime for Tools&quot;<br />
Logout/in again<br />
Optionally run &quot;create Runtime&quot;<br />
Logout/in again<br />
<br />
If you are on Windows, reboot your serber to make sure, you do not have any old objects in your shared memory.<br />
<br />
Then try again.<br />
<br />
I hope you are doing all this on a test system. If you do not have one, tha nthis is the time to ask your management for some budget for this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">26th June 2004, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe a bit more of a directed approach is needed:<br />
<br />
a) When yoiu say crash, what do you mean? Any error messages? Any errors in logs/Event log?<br />
b) Which components did the installed patches change?<br />
<br />
Normally a create runtime is never wrong. Start it with tables, domains and sessions marked with a complete range. unmark the bit about help, which just costs time.<br />
<br />
Again I hope you are doing this on a test system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yaah it updated lots of tools components at that time, right now i cannot take the report since it closes the baan client along with all the sessions.<br />
<br />
i went through the technical details of porting set 6.1c.07.03, and it say that they have reolved this problem &quot;Not able to print any session &quot;<br />
<br />
but it seems that i have to go to service pack 15. :( <br />

<br />
Before you do that, do a quick search on Baan's support site for<br />
&quot;report archiving&quot;, you may have run into that. <br />
<br />
It requires 3 tables to be created, but you can't use &quot;create tables&quot;<br />
becuase it needs a report.. so you have to do it via GTM.. There is a solution on the site that tells you which tables.<br />
<br />
The sessions crash if you don't have the tables, but I don't remember the error. It might be the same as what you are seeing.<br />

<br />
i tried searching for the same on the baan support site, but unable to figure out.<br />
<br />
could u please let me the know the solution no. in case u know.<br />

<br />
Here' the meat.<br />
<br />
Create Runtime DataDictionary for Tools (ttadv5213m000) is necessary after installing this solution. (Option &quot;Also Dump Data Definitions&quot; set to Yes)<br />
Without this action it will not be possible to print anymore.<br />
The error &quot;Fatal error: domain ttaad.doct doesn't exist&quot; in ttstpsplopen will occur in case you don't run the Create Runtime Data Dictionary for Tools (ttadv3213m000) session.<br />
Also create the tables ttaad340, ttaad341 and ttaad342 in company 000<br />
The create of these tables should be done using ttaad4100. <br />
Select the table and a message will popup &quot;File does not exist, allocate ?&quot; Answer this question with Yes and the table will be created.<br />
<br />
2 important patches are already made for Report archiving: solution 140470 and solution 140492.<br />
A problem with importing archiving is solved in Solution 141165.</div></div><hr />

Most of these problems, like the one that is beeing discussed here probably related to 3 missing tables, is now avoided if you do that, there are no more excuses regarding that you do not know what convert parameters you should use after and additional actions to take (like creation of tables and so on).</div></div><hr />
