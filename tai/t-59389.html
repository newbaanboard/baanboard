<br />
Wanted to discuss something with anyone who has experience.<br />
<br />
We intend to do an FP5 (Old Machine) to FP6 (New Machine). <br />
<br />
We're thinking of using a intermediate machine to install FP5 and the associated customizations and data from the old FP5 machine and then upgrade this intermediate machine to FP6 and then export out the data to the FP6 machine.<br />
<br />
Will this method make sense or are there any pitfalls to watch out for? Or does anyone know of a way to directly take FP5 data into an FP6 environment?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ian</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basicly this is possible by putting the fp5 dict runtime files in your fp6 installation and run a create rdd. However don't forget that you have to run the upgrade engine as well to reflect table changes! Before running the upgrade engine you should validate all your data.<br />

<br />
I would:<br />
<br />
1) Clone the old machine to the new machine<br />
2) Update Portingset and Enterprise Server to 8.6 on the new machine<br />
3) Install FP6 in a new package combination with new update VCs on the new machine<br />
4) Change Package Combnation by company from FP5 to FP6<br />
5) Run the Data Upgrade Engine<br />
<br />
It depends on the amount of data if you can do it in one run or if you have to split the migration to the new hardware and the Feature Pack Update in two steps.<br />

<br />
Probably cloning the machines is the path we will choose as we were thinking avoiding having multiple FP's in the machine. <br />
<br />
It also makes sense if I can have an FP6 installation with FP5 dd and upgrade it from there, but probably would avoid this just to ensure everything in the new server is all native FP6 stuff. But I might look into giving this a try.<br />
