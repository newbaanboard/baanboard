<br />
I have observed that some my Clients, if got irritated with the time taken by  some session they using the &quot;start bshell&quot; option in the &quot;option diaglog&quot; and kill the session forcefully.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain me the impact of doing this. Secondly can I disable the feature of start bshell in the option dialog screen.<br />
<br />

<br />
killing a running session with the described method has roughly the same effect as closing a form by cklicking the right hand &quot;x&quot; of Windows. This will only stop this object, not the whole bshell.<br />
<br />
You can stop users by calling this shell by taking the authorizations for this object away. I think it is: ottstpshell<br />
<br />
By the way, do not confuse this with a proper Unix shell, which would be the object ottstpvtemul.<br />

When the session is forcefully terminated, there is a possibility that the session is still taking the resources at the backend!!<br />
I think it can be disabled by ottstpshell, but I am not sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 On Option dialog screen ;<br />
   <br />
  start shell<br />
  enter   ps       (displays all users Unix processed)<br />
  enter   kill   &quot;pid number&quot;   (of session, report etc).<br />
  enter   exit      (returns to option dialog screen)<br />

<br />
Don't compare it to 'x-ing' out of a windows program, compare it to 'ctrl-alt-del-ing' out of a windows program. It is messy and might leave all kinds of debris behind that potentially will affect your system performance.</div></div><hr />
