<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 05:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I have upgraded the porting set to 6.1c.06.06 from 61c.06.01.  This caused barcodes to no longer print (we use BWPrint for barcode printing).  Now here's the problem:  We print logos on reports using a scalable font (a popular free solution that is mentioned in several posts on this board and others).  The line spacing for the logo only works correctly with an older version of BWPrint (B40c.40 or lower, otherwise the report layout with the logo takes up too many lines on the report) but in order to fix the barcoding issue I have to use a newer version of BWPrint.  Any ideas on how to fix the spacing issue without changing the methods we use to print barcodes and logs?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a solution in which a description is given about how the fonts can be selected in bwprint (using regedit etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">My problem is that the fonts are already selected and everything works well except the line spacing on the logo layout.  I tried changing line spacing with BWPrint in preview mode but this changes the spacing for the entire report rather than just the selected layout.  Currently, we're having to use two Baan profiles (one for printing reports with barcodes and the other for printing reports with logos) which is certainly not ideal.  Help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">take a look at the bic_rpt file (or others), maybe after the porting set was realeased, Baan went back as fixed these files to fix the barcoding problem ? if not try using the &quot;old&quot; version (if you have them) and recompling and running the report to see if the bar-coding works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">The barcoding functions as long as the user has a newer client installed.  It's the extra spaces now taken by the logo that I'm trying to fix.</div></div><hr />
