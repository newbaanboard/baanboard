<br />
I had logged an incident with infor for their help. They told me to take the back up of $BSE and then run session Create run time data dictionary for tools. (ttadv5213m000)<br />
<br />
As Kozure suggested I tried to create the text file in the same folder where the dump is. I could create it.<br />
<br />
I am attaching the screenshots for this problem.<br />
Please go through it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">5th February 2009, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">A patch is usually a single file with a few other files consisting of the component list, error file.<br />
<br />
When you have the listing you supplied this is done through Export Data Dictionary.  You need to use Import Data Dictionary and not import patch to get this in.<br />
<br />
Data Dictionary lets you import and export based on a package, and often is used for a range of components.  If you have components across different packages, you need to create a dump for each package.<br />
<br />
A Patch allows multiple pataches and individual components to be combined into a single distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chinaar</div><div class="date">9th February 2009, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All!<br />
I am trying to import localization patch provided by Infor.<br />
There are series of patches from 1.2.1.1 to 1.2.1.404.<br />
<br />
Few months back I had done uploading of patches where the first patch consist of 245 patches combined in one patch.<br />
All other patches are individual patches.<br />
<br />
That time I had uploaded patches till 334. <br />
The 334 patch consist of socket server session (tcind9011s000).<br />
So socket is currently running on 1.2.1.334.<br />
After uploading theses patches, I did CRDD.<br />
<br />
Now I am trying to follow same procedure for uploading rest of the patches,<br />
It is not allowing me to do so.<br />
<br />
Bcoz of the error occured I tried to import normal customized session from Import data dictionary wizard also.<br />
It starts the process and gives error in between.<br />
<br />
I am attaching the Import Data Dictionary Error.<br />
<br />
Please go through it.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

I got help from Infor.<br />
<br />
The solution was to take the dump of ttadv244000 table, then delete that table and then create the table using same dump.<br />
<br />
I am unable to understand what does that process means.<br />
<br />
Please let me know.<br />
