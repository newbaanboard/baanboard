<br />
We have installed Baan IVc4 in a new Windows 2008 server. <br />
Backend: MS SQL Server 2005<br />
<br />
After the installation, we observed that all the application/tools session has some problem on showing the maximum range of a form field. If the form field has used fmax($#) for defining the maximum range for an item field then instead of &quot;ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ&quot; some junk characters are shown in the session. <br />
<br />
Please find the attached screen shots. We tried to Convert to run time activity also. But it didn't resolve the issue. <br />
<br />
Can someone help us on how to get it fixed.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You should check KB 22821988 on Xtreme for the related info. The values can be 'z', '~' or 'Ã¿'. It depends on several factors like the Unicode Env. which comes with LN has a command character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note this from the support matrix, sql-server 2005 isn't supported anymore in the latest portingsets?<br />
<br />
On July 1, 2014, Microsoft will withdraw support for MSQL 2008 and MSQL 2008 R2. Infor <br />
recommends customers to upgrade to a later version. <br />
On January 1, 2015, Microsoft will withdraw support for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server <br />
2008 R2. This means that as of January 1, 2015 support for the 32-bit porting set for Windows will <br />
stop. Infor recommends customers to upgrade to a later version.</div></div><hr />
