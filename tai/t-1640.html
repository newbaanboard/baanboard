<br />
     We have Baan4c/Informix/HPUX11.<br />
<br />
     I have installed a dump in incorrect VRC. Please tell me how to uninstall the dump without remove the VRC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for help</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">This should not be tried if the dump has had some pre-recs done to it that are linked to other solutions. I have seen before some major problems with removing pre-recs on dumps.<br />
<br />
Also should be pointed out that removing service packs this way is never a good idea too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are using PMC then there should be no reason for a patch to go into the wrong VRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:39</div></div><div class="posttext">It could happen if there is two or more PMC patch levels set up, ie multiple localistations. Then a patch could be 'accidentally' installed into the wrong VRC level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guojun</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Patvdv:<br />
<br />
     Thanks for your help. I knew how to uninstall the patch file via PMC, but this time I have intalled a dump, I don't known how to delete the dump file which been installed with out remove the VRC. Could you please tell me detail?<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops, for that there's no real undo. What you can do is to identify first all objects that were part of the dump. Then delete each component in the application and runtime data dictionary. Use the necessary care with this action though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">But Pat, you also have to recover the last copy of the objects otherwise you will be falling down to the next level of them. If there has been previous patches to that object then you could be sending this guy into a big mine field.... Maybe best to get Baan to dial into the system and allow them to do the work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes doh! I was forgetting a couple of things in my logic :( You need indeed to have the previous versions of your components available somewhere as well. In case it's all new stuff then my previous comments stand.<br />
<br />
Mm, I am not so  ure if BGS would fix this but probably best to *try* to get them involved first.</div></div><hr />
