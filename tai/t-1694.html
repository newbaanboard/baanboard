<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this is possible. You just have two seperate enviroments and companies set up. <br />
<br />
But you also have to remember to set up your PMC correctly, as you would not want to get patches mixed up. Plus you also have to consider drive space as you will have twice the normal about of enviromental objects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we have installed Baan IVc4 in our subsidiaries in Japan and China with multibyte languages and it is absolutely no problem to have multibyte language and english language user on the same company. We switch also the language for a certain user from multibyte to english and that is also no problem.<br />
<br />
Please take care that in the bw configuration on the 2nd form the NLS is set to the locale of that country. Otherwise you might face problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julia0726</div><div class="date">8th May 2002, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">hi phoenix,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply but we logged this case to Baan Support and they say that &quot;it is not possible to have different users using Chinese and English language in the same company&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know yet if I should inform the customer about what BGS proposed to us. <br />
<br />
But we agree with you that it's possible but there's no way here to prove it like if we can only have installation using multibyte language.<br />
<br />
how???<br />
<br />
julia:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix</div><div class="date">8th May 2002, 10:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Julia,<br />
<br />
that it is possible you can see in the attached document.<br />
<br />
If I would switch the user from language 2 to o (Chinese)<br />
all forms will be in chinese language. <br />
<br />
But to be able to have an user on laguage 2 in a multibyte<br />
language environment the BW Configuration has to be set<br />
up  in a certain way. <br />
<br />
If you need further information do not hesitate to contact me.<br />

<br />
thanks you're so sweet.<br />
<br />
You mean when I want  a specific user  to use Chinese Language I'll just go to Maintain User Data to change the Language of that specific user to Chinese (o).<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<br />
Did you try the BW command option -<br />
<br />
-- -set BSE_LANG=value to change language (2=English, etc.)<br />
<br />
I think that might work for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 07:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Phoenix,<br />
<br />
                Did you do a translation of the forms to appear in chinese or teh BW client took care of that? Any extra info will really be appreciated in terms of installation.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Abuibra,<br />
<br />
in the attached document you will find some screenshots from our chinese installation. The reason why some fields are not able to be displayed correctly is because of my local pc settings. On a pc installed whith chinese language settings (MS Windows) they will be displayed correctly.<br />
<br />
During the installation you will have to install the chinese localisation including the chinese language options for forms and reports. Because of this all known functionalities are available. Therefore it is also possible to print with a chinese user reports in other languages. This is depending on the settings in the customer or supplier master data.<br />
<br />
When a chinese user is entering data the chinese &quot;character&quot; will be build out of a combination of latin characters. Therefore automatically a small box will be opened where the user enters this combination and the chinese character will be displayed in the field the user is currently in. This workks fine and the chinese users are used to this procedure as this function is used in many other applications.<br />
<br />
Please take care that because of the multibyte charaters the growing of the database is higher than in normal installations.<br />
By the way: the installation should be done by a technician of Baan China or of a local partner. The system administration can be done by a normal experienced admin.<br />
<br />
Bets Regards,<br />

Why is that, can't we do it ourselves? or is it because of the government laws?<br />

 <br />
I'm not sure how much experience do you have for installation of baan IV. <br />
<br />
Installation of Baan IV English is more easy than Multibyte version. Installation of Baan IV multibyte has some deep tricks you have more knowledge to get things run smoothly. <br />
<br />
If possible, you can try to do it for test.  <br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix</div><div class="date">6th June 2003, 08:13</div></div><div class="posttext">That is absolute correct.<br />
<br />
From the legal point of view there are no restrictions.<br />
<br />
One special thing is the printing of invoices. Here you have to<br />
use a certain range of numbers you will have to ask for from<br />
the local authorities. Sometimes you have to use special papers<br />
for the invoices (depending on the person you are talking to).<br />
<br />
In any case you have to give a report to the authorities which <br />
will give information on the use of these numbers. There is a<br />
add-on available calles golden tax. We are using it and so far<br />
it works fine.<br />

<br />
We now need to implement old english BaaN IV (with Czech localization) in China, but we need to do some customization like on Phoenix screenshots (exactly same). Do you have some tips for this? We have multibyte installation of BaaN, but we are not able to write chinese letter (question marks are shown).<br />
Or do you have any contact to company in China/Europe who know how we can do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

<br />
Below is the brief of the problem we are facing:<br />
<br />
Baan 4c4 installed with SP33 and translation pack installed till 22 for Simplified Chinese <br />
It’s a multy byte installation with DB collation as Chinese_PRC_BIN<br />
We are able to login in English and all function working properly.<br />
But when we login with user language as Chinese most of the menus are not opening (found missing menus, and menu fields in o language, and even labels are also missing for the session which are opening).<br />
In this setup we have already created all the required package combination, VRCs, and companies and data of these companies is also migrated using seq dump, which is working in English language.<br />
If there is a way to correct it please suggest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Navin Tenani</div></div><hr />
