Changing the bsp user password is not really an issue. You can just change the password on OS level (NT/UNIX). The only thing to keep in mind is that you should check whether you have external tools/procedures depending on a fixed bsp password or not. e.g.: shell scripts with a hard-coded password etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">30th April 2002, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running Baan 4c3 on Informix and in our set up changing the bsp password is DEFINATELY an issue. <br />
<br />
This I believe is because we only have one db user for Baan and all users connect to the db as bsp. <br />
<br />
This was basically how our system was setup and to change the bsp password as well as changing it at os level we have to edit the inf_users file adding the new password in an encrpyted format to every line for every user using an awk script that a consultant passed onto me.<br />
<br />
I have done this a couple of times but as a rule try to avoid it.<br />

In your circumstances it is an issue. I am used to having and much prefer a 1-to-1 relationship where user management is concerned.</div></div><hr />

Many thanks<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough we do have a 1 to 1 as Pat mentioned/assumed but were considering changing to one as Neal has. Your responses have helped us therefore in both ways</div></div><hr />

<br />
in my environment, i have many to 1 password setting<br />
<br />
for eg.<br />
<br />
user bsp is linked to database user bsp<br />
all other users also linked to database user bsp<br />
<br />
whether it is many to 1, or 1 to 1, changing the bsp password in the OS should not affect the password of database user bsp.<br />
<br />
so why when i change the bsp password in OS, i can no longer log into Baan?<br />
<br />
the password in inf_users file is the encrypted database user bsp. It is still showing that because we do not touch this file when changing the bsp password in OS. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />
