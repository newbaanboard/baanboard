<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sarosh</div><div class="date">22nd September 2002, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a Baan ERP server (Baan IV c4) on Windows 2000 Server with Oracle 8i. Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 is installed.<br />
<br />
Some Baan config information:<br />
<br />
B40 c4 SP 8<br />
Tools - B40c4<br />
Localization - B40Lc4bci2<br />
Porting Set - 6.1c.06.02<br />
Port. No. - PA.1729<br />
<br />
I would like to implement user password policies like password aging, password history and also allow users to change their passwords themselves.<br />
<br />
I understand that the recommended way to implement password policies on a Windows 2000 network is through Group Policy implemented on a domain.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, I set up a separate domain controller using Windows 2000 server with Active Directory and created a domain user account for an existing Baan user account. Then I configured the ERP Server to be a member server of the domain. Successful so far.<br />
<br />
Now, when I try to logon, the operating system level logon is successful. But when I try to connect to Baan, I get the error 510 (Database not on). <br />
<br />
Then I tried putting the domain user in a Global Group on the DC and included that group in the local users on the ERP server. Still no luck.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any help in configuring the servers / network to allow user password policy implementation.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards.</div></div><hr />

Do you get any errors that suggest that the database has not started, maybe due to the DB admin user not being in the right domain?<br />
<br />
I think the main problem is that Baan has not been fully tested in an Active Directory setup, having just installed a AD system, I decided to leave out the Baan server from the collection of AD servers. Just in case a problem like this occurred. <br />
<br />
Plus, the policy does not account for Baan logins. Baan just takes to ID and password from it, the rest is Windows based, therefore no nice messages when you log into Baan about your password is about to expire!</div></div><hr />
