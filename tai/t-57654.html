<br />
We are in the process of rebuilding our server configuration as we are setting-up the virtualization (VM WARE Installation image ESX 3.5 and ESXi 3.5) of our servers among them Servers supporting ERP ln FP1.<br />
<br />
As of today we have ERP LN (FP1) installed on 3 different physical servers (Windows OS) among them 2 TEST versions BUT with one distinct/separate SLM manager installations for each.<br />
<br />
We would like to know if we are allowed to:<br />
<br />
1.	Still run correctly those 3 ERP LN installations on separate Virtual  machines WHILE / BUT with 3 distinct SLM installations on one same<br />
                separate and physical server to support those 3 ERP LN installations on VWMARE. <br />
<br />
                :confused:    OR<br />
<br />
2.	Can we have only one single SLM installation supporting those 3<br />
             distinct ERP Installations residing on 3 different VMWare machines?<br />
<br />
I hopÃª my query is clear enough..? :o<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Bobby</div></div><hr />
