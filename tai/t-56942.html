<br />
I am facing this strange problem. This is on ERP LN 6.0.<br />
<br />
I have defined 2 ROLES as given below For company# 450.<br />
<br />
1. DEFAULT - <br />
'Session Auth by Company' - for Co.#450 - Print and Display.<br />
(Thus this includes all sessions of 450)<br />
<br />
2. APCLRK -<br />
Here I have defined some exceptions in 'Session Auth by Session'.<br />
Few sessions have FULL AUTH and<br />
Few sessions have NO AUTH<br />
<br />
When I link these 2 roles to a User.<br />
All FULL AUTH session work as expected but NO AUTH sessions open in 'PRINT/DISPLAY' mode. <br />
<br />
I am not sure what's going wrong.<br />
As per the User Management Doc. 'Session Auth by Session' is on Priority 1.<br />
<br />
Please advise. It's urgent. :(<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it seems that there is a Conflict in your Roles, try to put all the authorizations you need in one Role not in two. And make sure to convert changes to Run Time DD<br />
<br />
try this solution and if it doesn't work please send me the Role Browser for these Roles ok<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">11th October 2009, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You always &quot;add&quot; authorizations when combining two roles, you cannot &quot;take away&quot; an authorization that one role grants by adding another role that hasn't that authorization. So, if the user has the DEFAULT role, he/she will be allowed to &quot;Print and Display&quot;, no matter what's in any other role that's added on top. Priority on where you define that (session level, module level etc.) is not taken into account here!<br />
<br />
Think of roles as little blocks that add some particular authorizations that are *needed* for that (and only that) role, So the basic &quot;default&quot; authorization that every user gets should be as restricted as possible (no authorization except for display in standard tool sessions (like those needed for selecting a printer etc.).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />
