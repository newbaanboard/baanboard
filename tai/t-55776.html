<br />
<br />
1.Created Windows OS User(lnuser1) as a regular user <br />
2.Created ERP Ln user as (lnuser1) and converted to run time<br />
3. Assigned ERP Ln user to DB user baan and converted to run time.<br />
<br />
I am unable to login through webtop/worktop. However if I make the 'lnuser1' part of admins group in Windows US it works. <br />
<br />
Question 1: I do not want to make every user part of Admins in Windows-please advice if there is a solution for this.<br />
Question 2: Is it a normal practice to use one DB user for all the ERP users? What conditions necessitate the use of multiple DB users?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you login Baan via Webtop/worktop, the user have to own the related access right. in your description, I don't know whether you have grant the user with proper right.<br />
<br />
Action:<br />
 Create some roles , and grant the access rights to the role. then in hte user data session, assign the related role to the user. don't forget convert them into RTDD after you change data every time and re-login to use the new setting .<br />
<br />
the role access right control the user access the system, you can do this by package, module, session, company number, table etc.</div></div><hr />

Remove the admin right from lnuser1. <br />
Create a new group on OS . <br />
Assign that group to lnuser1. <br />
Now give rights (RW) to this new group for  $BSE.<br />
Hope this will work.</div></div><hr />
