 <br />
I have switched from the old BaaN server to the new one .. All the data has been came to the new server except the cutomization portion. Now,to transfer my all customised sessions &amp; reports from my old server to new server I am trying it through ttiex1284m000  export data disctionary it coninues to build the dump file upto 30 gb  even for one session. Or if any other session is there ( or some other method to do this) then plz let me know in this case.</div></div><hr />

I'm transferring each day more than once some new developped sessions or other customizations, and I cannot believe that! Are you dumping baan completely?<br />
<br />
Anyway, a &quot;dump&quot; is a set of files, dump.e, dump.l and components and eg. dumpd01.Z, dumpf01.Z, dumpo01.Z, dumps01.Z and dumpt01.Z. The .Z files are compressed. For one session, some kilobytes are common.<br />
<br />
I normally do not use 'Export based on Sesssion' - maybe because I know what I just developed ;-). So, on Form 2 I decide which parts to export and on Form 3 I enter the ranges. <br />
<br />
For your dumps, maybe you could use that scheme to export part by part?<br />
