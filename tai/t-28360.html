<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanDeveloper</div><div class="date">10th October 2006, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">This new thread is meant to replace a previous thread introduced yesterday with the title &quot;Where is BSE set?&quot; and hopefully pose a more focused question since the replies generated by the previous post are not producing an answer. When selecting &quot;File&quot;, then &quot;Run program...&quot; from the main menu browser and then typing &quot;ksh&quot; with the &quot;Run external program&quot; box checked - a sub shell is started with the prompt &quot;bshell6.1&quot;. If i type &quot;echo $BSEA&quot; at this sub shell prompt it does not echo the last two lines in /etc/profile which are as follows a) BSEA=$BSE/application, b) export BSEA. I verified these lines with the command &quot;tail /etc/profile&quot;. If i type &quot;env&quot; at this same command prompt I see other environment variables set which leads me to believe that bshell6.1 is being initialized by some other source - can any one direct me where to look. The replies to the previous post seem to re-iterate the need for exporting the environment variable in /etc/profile but this has  been verified.</div></div><hr />

Check what is done in the home direcotry of the user<br />
also have a look at $BSE/lib and $BSE/lib/defaults directory for the file bse_vars<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">11th October 2006, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to Dave's note in the posting: bse_vars (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=28201&amp;highlight=bse_vars)<br />
The search path is something like:<br />
1. $BSE/lib/defaults/all<br />
2. $BSE/lib/defaults/db_resource<br />
3. $BSE/lib/defaults/bshell<br />
4. $BSE/lib/user/u&lt;username&gt;<br />
5. $BSE/lib/bse_vars<br />
6. ~/bse_vars<br />
7. $SESSION_TIMEOUT<br />
<br />
it will take the last one of those (in sequence) that it finds.</div></div><hr />

I was quite excited about your reply because it introduced the configuration file &quot;bse_vars&quot; along with a potetial search patch. While this file may set vars accessible to the command getenv$() [which i do not know because I am not trying this] - does it work for the procedure I described? I could not get it to work with bse_vars defined in either my home directory &quot;~/bse_vars&quot; or $BSE/lib (which is where i found an existing file and appened the line &quot;BSEA=/xxxx/xxxx/xxxx/application&quot;. Did you try it in the way I described and have it work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">23rd October 2006, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">What you ask for is not possible. Calling a ksh will only go through the .profile if it called as root shell (Log on procedure). This is not the case if it is called from BW. You can test this in the following way:<br />
<br />
- logon on on on UNIX level<br />
- unset your BSEA (unset BSEA)<br />
- start a new ksh<br />
- check the value of BSEA (echo $BSEA)<br />
<br />
kind regards,<br />
