<br />
I just finished installing SP16.<br />
I noticed something strange during the table reconfiguration. <br />
<br />
Before, during the reconfiguration phase, I could look at the $BSE\tmp directory and find the R.&lt;tablename&gt; file and see which table was being reconfigurated at the time. However this time I could not find the R.* files anywhere. <br />
<br />
Is this related to any functional change in this part of the software? I've a friend which told the same thing happened to him and he could not find the R.* files anywhere during the reconfiguration. (of course, in the end the tables are reconfigured, so the file exists somewhere...).<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Fred<br />
<br />
P.S.: By the way, my portingset is 6.1c.07.02.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked the system while it was reconfigurating the tables. The refint.exe process was present. Perhaps Baan was just rebuilding the reference counters and taking a  long time to do it (checking tfgld106 for example) and that's why I could not see the R.* file.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone comment on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I was just creating RTDD for tccom001.<br />
<br />
First while the bdbpost was running it created the R* file in the \BSE\tmp folder; after a while it had started refint.exe and during this time the R* file was not there, may be the bdbpost was completed.<br />
<br />
Now I need a help pls, in one of the reconfig R.tdsls041140 the file got stuck here and it is not removed from tmp folder; later we found the very table data of tdsls041 was itself not there; Event Viewer reported the Ittdsls041140_1a does not exist. How do I restore from the R* file. Can I use the session Create Table from Sequential Dump. Will it work..?<br />
<br />
Appreciate any ideas pls<br />
