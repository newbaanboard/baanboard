Doing a keyword search on &quot;license&quot; on the postings should find previously suggested ideas as this question has come up before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pemcgriff</div><div class="date">6th February 2008, 00:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done the search and ended up with more questions than answers. We are looking at writing a script to enforce limiting the number of licenses.</div></div><hr />

However, with that said, the basic idea is to replace the ipc_info call to bshell to a wrapper script inside of which you would call check to see how many licenses that user is currently using via licmon against some type of limit and then use the bshcmd command to send back a message to the BW client PID that they aren't allowed to login because they already have x number of licenses in use and then to exit or if they are below the limit then to call the bshell as usual.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">1st April 2008, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, closeidle prevents multiple Baan logins from the same PC which unless people have more than 1 PC on their desk would solve your problem.  It can be set differently per PC, so some users could login once, some twice, some unlimited.  Also, it handles inactive users in the neatest possible way - therefore freeing up further licences without loss of data.</div></div><hr />
