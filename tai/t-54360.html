Hello All,<br />
I´m migrating my operation from HP-UX to Intel-RedHat ES.<br />
My problem is the following:<br />
When I try tu run shmvalues6.1 to create share memory, appear the following:<br />
<br />
$ shmvalues6.1: cannot execute binary file<br />
<br />
I'm suspect that shmvalues not come with the porting set, and it is a SO native program. It is correct?<br />
Where I can find a Linux native shmvalues6.1?<br />
<br />
My porting set is:<br />
Product ver.: 6.1c.07.20<br />
Port no : PA.3694<br />
<br />
Any Ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the LN versions:<br />
shmvalues6.2 removed<br />
With 8.3a, shared memory allocation was changed. There was no longer a need for bin/shmvalues6.2 and lib/shm_param. The delivery of shmvalues6.2 has been dropped with this release.<br />
<br />
[UNIX/Linux] Shared memory allocation changed<br />
With porting set 8.3a.01, the allocation of a shared memory segment changed; the memory segments are allocated dynamically instead of based on the predefined addresses in $BSE/lib/shm_param with a default fixed size. Use previous shared memory manager behavior It is also possible to fall back to the previous shared memory behavior by using the parameter file $BSE/lib/shm_param.<br />
The binary shm_values6.2 is removed, so you can no longer generate a new shm_param file. To fall back to the previous shared memory behavior you can change $BSE/lib/defaults/all by adding the following line:<br />
shm_compat_mode:1<br />
On AIX, this can give a problem with default start 30000000 value because of the link option maxdata=20000000 -&gt;<br />
Start value might need to go to e0000000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
shmvalues is part of the Baan portingset, did you change the proting set to the red aht version?<br />
What do you get, if you execute a &quot;file shmvalues6.1&quot; in $BSE/bin?<br />

This is the output that I get:<br />
shmvalues6.1: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version1 (SYSV), for GNU/LINUX 2.2.5, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), not stripped<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, I have changed to a Linux porting set, to 6.1.c.07.20<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

please read the technical notes for porting set 6.1c.07.20.<br />

Shmvalues6.1 removed<br />
6.1c.07.17<br />

With 6.1c.07.13 shared memory allocation was changed. There was no need<br />

Thanks for your time. I have already readed the technical notes for my porting set, and apply what it is recommended, but when I try to start the shared memory, apper a messge that says: shmparams file, empty.<br />
<br />
Any other idea?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juergen</div><div class="date">25th November 2008, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">strange, but how did you start the shared memory.<br />
manually ($BSE/bin/shmmanager6.1 -i) or with the script $BSE/etc/rc.start_shm ?<br />
<br />
If you use the script, did you use the new version coming with the porting set ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">25th November 2008, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Jurgen,<br />
Actually, I can´t star the shared memory. I´m using the new file that comes with the porting set.<br />
<br />
I´m reading a file where recomends that I can use an old version of shmparams, to create the shmvalues.<br />
<br />
I'll give a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">27th November 2008, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
Just for inform you. The problem was solved using an old program from porting set 7.0. After create the shmvalues, the shared memory succesfully started.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, after a long trip to get Baan running under RedHat ES and Oracle 10g (both on 64 bits) I´m thinking to upload a document where it describes the problems and solutions.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">27th November 2008, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I just read the Technical Notes to the 6.1c.07.20 Portingset and in there it clearly says, that the shmvalues binary and shm_param file is not needed anymore.<br />
<br />
I think what happened is the following:<br />
<br />
You changed the portingset, but you are using an old version for rc.start_shm in $BSE/etc. Here the script first checks, whether the shm_param files exists and if not, tries to create it by running shmvalues. This failed (because shmvalues) is not available, and the script aborts.<br />
<br />
I think two thinks would have done the trick:<br />
<br />
a) Create a dummy shm_param with the touch command.<br />
<br />
b) Alternatively chaneg rc.start_shm to skip the check.<br />
<br />
In a way you did (a), but the dummy looks very real!<br />
<br />
Could you test this on your system?<br />
<br />
