<br />
I am looking for some feedback on Webtop and Worktop... from end users.<br />
<br />
For both Worktop and Webtop a lot of usasbility research was done. I have been working on the look and feel and the ease of use of the products in the past few years.<br />
<br />
I would really like to hear everything you have to say about the products. What do you like? What dont you like? Are the products usable? What should we change?  anything... (concerning usability of course :) )<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your responses!<br />
regards <br />
Kim</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. The icon for the messages is very small. <br />
<br />
2. The Navigation inside the DEM models is complex since you always have to use the right buttom to go up a level, it is not intuitive.<br />
<br />
3. I love the history part and the shortcuts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kim ten Brink</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 09:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, thanks for the reply. I am not sure however what you mean exactly with your first 2 points.. sorry..<br />
<br />
-what do you mean with the icon for the messages? is it when you attach a note to a treenode? that theres a little yellow icon? (caus that one is very small, you are right)<br />
<br />
-and what button do you mean for navigating up one level?<br />
<br />
I hope you can explain to me what you meant and then I can check it out and see if I can change them.<br />
<br />
thanks!<br />

<br />
1. You are rigth is the small icon for the notes, its difficult to see it when you attach a note to a session in the menu tree.<br />
<br />
2. When you are in the naviation pane and you are using DEM, it gets difficult to navigate from the top level of a process to the sub-process , and the sub-sub-process and then go back to the main process again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are starting to use the Worktop fpr BaanIV right now. Some comments:<br />
<br />
a) we do not have any uuse for the  note/comment functionality<br />
<br />
b) We liked a lot the shortcuts!<br />
<br />
c) It would be nice to be able to define a couple of sessions, which start up automatically. This could be easily achieved via a &quot;startup&quot; folder for shortcuts.<br />
<br />
d) I liked the history too.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Markus</div></div><hr />

good to hear that worktop has reached Cyprus.. :) <br />
<br />
The idea about the startup sessions is actually a very good one. I talked about this right away with the Worktop product owner. we will see what we can do.<br />
<br />
About the notes, there are more people asking/commenting about this. The use is not too clear for everyone. The way I use it myself, is that i sometimes need small reminders with sessions. So I know with certain sessions, I need to check something or do another action which I sometimes forget.  (maybe a session code, or password or something)<br />
Then the note is useful.. <br />
But I can understand that not everyone will use them.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the info.<br />
We are right now discussing new functionality, so everything is welcome!<br />
<br />
regards,Kim</div></div><hr />
