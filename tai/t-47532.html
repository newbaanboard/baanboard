<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">31st January 2008, 09:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I just checked it on my system and maybe I can put some light into it. First, I figured out my bshells pid (ps -ef | grep bshell). Then I used  bshcmd6.1 -p -s -w &lt;pid&gt; (as described by bshellcmd6.1 -U). Then I checked the latest files in $BSE/tmp but saw nothing new; normally there should be a file $BSE/tmp/bshell.&lt;pid&gt;. After I gave the bshell the focus (just by clicking once on the bw client), the file was generated. Its content looks like:<br />
<br />
Command 1 (arg '') issued by user &lt;....&gt;<br />
   PID   PPID   PGRP SESSION            TICKS FLAGS    S CMP MEM<br />

And there is another thing: When the user has set e.g. &quot;-- -keeplog -logfile /tmp/myfile&quot;, you won't see anything in $BSE/tmp.<br />

<br />
It depends on which user is exciting the command and on what user your executing it. If you have the right permissions it should work.<br />
Check this link where I was testing it:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showpost.php?p=106192&amp;postcount=3<br />
<br />
What is the command you were trying?<br />

<br />
You should make sure that:<br />
1) Your are executing the command with root.<br />
2) The Bshell ID is still active.<br />
3) Find the right (enough time) for waiting. In the last example we increased the waiting seconds from 5 to 10.<br />

<br />
This is mainly because busy bshell pid is unable to communicate its sub-process due to existing heavy work load .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">11th August 2009, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a Windows server, Baan IVc4.  The command bshcmd -p -s -u 10 -w 1996 does nothing as well as bshcmd -p 1996.  My bshell is only running tiitm0101m000 so it's not doing too much to respond to bshcmd.  I have an open support case but they don't seem to be able to find anything wrong.  They sent me a new bshcmd because there were issues with my porting set but it still doesn't work.  I remember there were some registry settings or environment settings at one time that caused bshcmd not to work but I don't believe I have them set.  (heap size and sort.exe errors is what I remember) Also, I saw reference that you need to log in as user root.  In Windows, is logging in as the baan user account equivalent?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">12th August 2009, 14:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I'm not really experienced with Baan under M$, but the environment variable $BSE_TMP is very important for bshcmd, as it uses the temp-dir to create the report. $BSE should be set also, path has most probably been set correct, otherwise the command wouldn't have been found/executed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">13th August 2009, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">BSE_TMP and BSE are already set in the environment variables.  I also run fillenv and set user = baan.  I get the same result.  Nothing.<br />
<br />
I found the reference to the command that fixed the sort.exe errors but disables bshcmd.  You set it in your all file in lib.  It's no_ipc_msg_window:1, however, I do not have that command in my all file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">13th August 2009, 07:25</div></div><div class="posttext">bshcmd -p &lt;bshell.pid&gt; works at our end . I ran this in rdp console mode . IF u are running the same in normal rdp mode , probably it may not be working .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">17th August 2009, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">let alone remote desktop.  It's true, I do get an error though if I run it in straight remote desktop without console but even when I run it directly on the server, I get nothing.  I don't get an error but it doesn't do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">17th August 2009, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure it doesn't do anything at all? Did you check the BSE_TMP directory for new files after issuing the command?<br />
As I posted before, I have seen this behaviour (bshcmd &quot;not doing anything&quot;) when $BSE_TMP hasn't been set properly.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">18th August 2009, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an entry for BSE D:\Baan and one for BSE_TMP D:\Baan\tmp, both of which are correct in environment variables.  I checked the tmp folder for something right after running bshcmd on a PID but there was nothing.  What I mean by doing nothing is, after I hit enter, it goes back to the command prompt with nothing else apparently done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th August 2009, 06:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically bshcmd -p queries a process and nothing more . So it should have process query rights which administrators  by default have . Does  baan user at ur  end belong to administrators  group . Have u run the same as administrator .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">19th August 2009, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Baan is an administrator and I also tried to do it with my user which is also an administrator but I got the same result.</div></div><hr />
