<br />
I have a job that was running fine but suddenly someone changed the form field of the session. I do not have an audit trail enabled on tt tables, is there any alternative?<br />
<br />
thanks and regards<br />

Or did they change the input to job and now it has issues?  The first thing that pops into my mind is do you have a test system that you copied or cloned from production?  If it was critical enough I could have had our dba's restore from backups into a different company - then use that test company to get what I needed for production.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Mark.<br />

They just did the change in the input to the job which has issues. I just wanted to know who has made the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">11th January 2023, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">In Tools you can click on the session and see who made the latest change. <br />
But in general, the tools hold no history other than first version and last change.<br />
<br />
When a formfield is added or removed from form used in job then also the input in the job table must be changed likewise.<br />
<br />
But again, when someone changes the job-session setting (like used form fields during job execution only) in table ttaad503 there is no history unless you set audit trail on this table. Then also note: audit trail on tools sessions require to be set on tools company...</div></div><hr />

They just did the change in the input to the job which has issues. I just wanted to know who has made the change.It must be one of your super users, or one with specific permissions to alter job settings. This narrows down to a reasonable group of people whom you can first ask: who did it, then who did it not to get your answer...:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
