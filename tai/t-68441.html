does anybody know a way to write log entry (e.g. to a file), when a user logged in into Baan?<br />
<br />
We (IT department) are regulary tested and have to proove that the user account has been disabled/deleted if the user leaves the company etc.<br />

<br />
In ttaad2100m000 there is a History option (ttaad200.hist).<br />
<br />
Checking this option for a user will log at {$BSE}\lib\TIME.HIS the sessions executed by the user, and the main menu object ottdskmbrowse (executed at login).<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

If you are HPUX, you can use the last command -<br />
<br />
LAST,LASTB(1)         Linux System Administrator’s Manual        LAST,LASTB(1)<br />
<br />
NAME<br />
       last, lastb - show listing of last logged in users<br />
<br />
SYNOPSIS<br />
       last [-R] [-num] [ -n num ] [-adFiowx] [ -f file ] [ -t YYYYMMDDHHMMSS ] [name...]  [tty...]<br />
       lastb [-R] [-num] [ -n num ] [ -f file ] [-adFiowx] [name...]  [tty...]<br />
<br />
DESCRIPTION<br />
       Last  searches  back  through the file /var/log/wtmp (or the file designated by the -f flag) and displays a list of all users logged in<br />
       (and out) since that file was created.  Names of users and tty’s can be given, in which case last will show only those entries matching<br />
       the arguments.  Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus last 0 is the same as last tty0.<br />
<br />
<br />
 We (IT department) are regulary tested and have to proove that the user account has been disabled/deleted if the user leaves the company etc.<br />
You can query the /etc/passwd and the /etc/shadow files for the info.<br />
 In ttaad2100m000 there is a History option (ttaad200.hist).<br />
This option also work IF you enabled the History in the User Data Template and also that you have not purged the TIME.HIS file</div></div><hr />

<br />
@RedBatz: I'm a bit scared about the heavy logging that will cause. We have nearly 700 users, and each session start will create a log entry to that file.<br />
<br />
@NPRao: We're on unix, but I cannot use last, because our users are using the GUI and therefor there is no unix login.<br />
<br />
At the moment, we have a glue script that is called before bshell gets started and that works fine for 99,9% but the 0,1% give 100% of work, discussion and so on. The Problem is, that we do not log &quot;when a user logged in&quot; but &quot;when a user &gt;&gt;tried&lt;&lt; to log in&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">14th December 2015, 21:15</div></div><div class="posttext">'last' will work, because even with GUI, there is still 'under the hood' unix connection required. You can check by running the last command for a user whom you know is no longer using BAAN (hopefully you have yet to take action to remove his access.)<br />
<br />
Although, it will take some shell programming to get only the one record that is interesting. 'last' command gives all instances of when the user last logged in, assuming that the 'last' 'database' has not been cleaned up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">15th December 2015, 07:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny. We're also on HPUX, but I cannot get that working. A user which is now running Baan is not displayed by 'last &lt;unix-login&gt;'; our /var/adm/wtmps is beeing regularly archived which can be seen by the line &quot;WTMPS_FILE  begins at Tue Dec 15 04:00:02&quot; - but now it's 6:39 and the user has logged in 6:37.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">15th December 2015, 07:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Meanwhile, I raised an incident at Infor and got called back. I was told that I'm not the first one to ask about that. After some technical discussion we came to a simple solution: Write a small 3GL script that does the logging (to  file(s) or database, one record per user or per user and day or ...), create a session for that and create a startup session group that uses this session; link all uses to that startup group (ttaad2105m000).<br />
<br />
I've already tested that and it Looks fine!<br />
