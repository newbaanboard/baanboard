Is there any way to Sign Out the user  in Infor LN UI ?<br />
There is no sign out button in LN UI.Only Restart button are there.<br />
<br />
My version is &quot;Infor LN UI 12.0.4&quot;<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; Scenario.<br />
When i close the User id from First system and trying to login in Second system, System show me the message that ID is still active in other device.<br />
<br />
In that case how do i properly sign out the user from my First System?<br />
Or <br />
Any workaround for this?<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

If yes, click on your user name on the upper right corner. <br />
If you are not using the standalone Version, there's no way of logging out, I'm aware of.</div></div><hr />

First of all Thanks for your valuable reply.<br />

And also i didn't see Username in my top right corner.<br />

<br />
I've been referring to your Login-URL. If it Ends with &quot;standalone&quot; it is the standalone link. (I've quoted a part of my Login-URL in my answer, as an example how the URL is looking like on our LN system.)<br />
<br />
If you don't see your Name, you're not using the standalone link (I guess).<br />
<br />
If you're not using Ming.le (we don't use it, too), LN UI seems to have some start options:<br />
<br />
http s://infor-ln-prod.xx:8445/webui/servlet/login<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
http s://infor-ln-prod.xx:8445/webui/servlet/standalone<br />
<br />
You may know the URL of the Admin-console to:<br />
<br />
http s://infor-ln-prod.xx:8445/webui/servlet/admin<br />
<br />
We have configured the first one (standalone) to use single sign on.<br />
<br />
Standalone will show an additional line with the logoff Option and the ODM menu where you can open documents linked to IÂ´LN data.<br />
<br />
It may be that you can configure standalone mode to show the sign-out option. I never did this, but Infor lists a a solution/KB explaining how to do so. Please refer to KB 1707475.<br />
<br />
There's a note in the article: &quot;Only domain user who are LN user can access Standalone url for LNUI&quot;<br />
The KB article describes how to Setup SSO Login (I think); never did the setup myself).</div></div><hr />

I think your Version of the LNUI may be to old to support standalone mode.<br />
<br />
Description: Problem Description:-Is there Logout Option on LNUI ? <br />
 <br />
Resolution:<br />
The LNUI does not have any Logout option. The only option is to use the LNUI with fslogin in Mingle, then there is option for Logout from Mingle, that will also logout the user from LNUI.<br />
<br />
With LNUI 11.2.4 , LNUI support Standalone mode, once the configuration are done, one can use the standalone url for LNUI, With this standalone url LNUI supports SignOut from LNUI.</div></div><hr />

Now i got the actual issue.<br />
<br />
By the way i am using Non-standalone LN version (&quot;____:8313/webui/servlet/login?defaut)<br />
