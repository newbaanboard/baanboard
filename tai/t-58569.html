<br />
We are on ERPLn FP2 and facing strange issue in ODM. A user is able to do easy file linking in one company (comp 500). But when he tries to do same thing in another company, he is unable to do as when he zooms from field Type in session dmdoc4540m002 to see available document types, nothing appears. We have given fulldb authorisation to the user.<br />
<br />
Requesting you all to help in this regards as we are totally stuck. We have also logged case with infor but even they are unable to get any clue.<br />
