  <br />
I am working in LN 6.1 and I have a big big problem,  <br />
  <br />
I want to install a standard solution by PMC and I checked if exists any component customized and it shows me one report and this says me that exist one component in one VRC but I looked for in ttadv2530m000 and I saw that isn't. Then I looked for at SO level and there was the component, then I erased this, then another time I checked if exists any component customized and it shows me one report and this, says me that exists one component in one VRC and I still shows me the same result.  <br />
  <br />
Anybody can tell me in where PMC looks for components customized?</div></div><hr />

ttadv2530m000  is for Program Scripts and not Reports (ttadv3530m00)<br />
You should just not remove components out from the OS. There must a reason why you have a customized component. Make sure to check if has any custom code changes or not and then remove it the right way with the appropriate Tools sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">15th July 2009, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">For reports PMC uses the data that is shown in session &quot;Display Objects by Report&quot; (ttadv3536m000). So, if the report is there in an Object VRC that is derived from the PMC Update VRC, it will be reported as a customization. You can try to remove it with session &quot;Delete Unchanged Objects by Report&quot; (ttadv3236m000). But, this session will not delete it if the report uses components that are in customization VRC. In that case you can get rid of the report by copying it to your customization VRC and delete it again. In this way the object will be removed in the dictionary as well.</div></div><hr />
