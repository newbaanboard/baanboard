I'm facing a weird behaviour of this command. Sometimes it works perfectly for a user and other times for the same user it outputs an empty result instead of the correct one. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to overcome this behaviour ? Did anyone face this problem before ?</div></div><hr />

May be bshell too busy to answer within certain retries and bshcmd6.1 returning without output.</div></div><hr />

For another user it works.<br />

Do you know what could be the reason of this behaviour ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just for the record, I found out that (at least in our system) user bsp can use this command on his bshell processes and it will work. But bsp can't list the sessions of the user george! same thing with user george, I can view my sessions but not bsps's (george &amp; bsp are both super users).<br />
<br />
I thought it was a permission thing so I logged on in root and this command worked great for all users!<br />
<br />
Maybe there are some settings/configurations that have to be done first!<br />
