              I have a query, in a Baan 4c4 system on Sun Solaris &amp; Oracle 8i, table ttadv335 has been corrupted. <br />
                Is it possible for us to take a sequential dump of the table from a Windows system with Oracle 8i &amp; same porting set and place it in the solaris environment.<br />
<br />
                Please let me know of any issues.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

There are version differences in the dump formats, but the same porting set should accept the same dump format.<br />
<br />
However, table ttadv335 isn't dependent on porting set; it contains information from the standard program, solution installs, customizations, etc...  Unless the two systems you are dealing with are at exactly the same service pack level with all of the same patches installed and the same report customizations, there is a good chance that the tables are identical.  That being said, if you have a downed system, it may be your best bet (unless you have a backup?).<br />

If  a particular VRC has problem, u can export reports in vrc through ttiex1280m000 and import it through ttiex1285m000 . <br />
<br />
Already compiled reports will not have any problems with corruption . If compile any report , take a backup of the same .</div></div><hr />
