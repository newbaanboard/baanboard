<br />
can you post a little more detail? Like, what events do you see on the client? on what OS is the ERP running? if it's UNIX; do any logs in the $BSE/log get updated? if it's Windows; do you have any events logged in the application events?  <br />
Is the ERP configured in a 3 tier configuration or 2 tier configuration? <br />
What OS is the client? <br />
<br />
Normally a 10053 is caused a network problem; client could need a configuration change  in the TCP/IP protocol; the disconnects could be due to new hardware such as routers or switches; a network problem between DB and application server; bad network cables... you see the sources of the problem could be several. <br />
You have to ask yourself as well, has this always happened? if not, since when did this start happening? and what changed?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
If your ERPLn application &amp; database are located on single machine then try to ping from client to your application server using -t option and moniter if any breackages are coming in reply.<br />
<br />
If DB and App are located on separate machines, then ping from app server to db and check if any break coming in reply.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
