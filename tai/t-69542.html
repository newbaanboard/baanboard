<br />
Relative newcomer to ERP systems in general. We just went live with Infor LN, upgraded from baan IV. The entire organization is set to use LN via the webUI. Only 2 of us have the worktop environment for tweaking reports and such.<br />
<br />
The person in charge of implementation at our organization, who also did virtually all of the maintenance in baan IV, swears up and down that it is impossible to print reports directly from the LN webUI to a local printer. This is causing everyone to have to print to display first, then print the resulting PDF to their local printers. The only printers we can print directly to are the WIndows Server Printers we have set up with static IPs on our file print server. From what I've read in the documentation it looks like you should be able to print to a regular Windows Printer device if you have the BWprint application on the client machine. Is this the case? It seems absolutely silly to me that we wouldn't be able to print documents to a local printer on a brand new system. We don't have many of the larger server printers so a lot of production/warehousing/sales/etc personnel are obviously unhappy. In baan IV everyone had the application installed on their client machines and printing was never an issue.<br />
<br />
Any general guidance or information would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

In that case you have to print to pdf and print or use indeed the windows server printers.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by local printer? When using WebUI, the report is opened as an internal tab or in a new tab in the Web Browser. And the printing can be done similar to how you print from any other website. So, Theoritically can be printed to any printer configured on your machine. <br />
<br />
Can you eloborate the definition of local printer?</div></div><hr />

I mean any printer attached to a client PC. In our organization's case, mostly by USB connection.<br />
<br />
In baanIV the path to the different printer devices was simply \\computer_on_network's_name\printer_name<br />
<br />
This doesn't work in LN. I guess due to the webUI. Seems rather silly that we'd have to buy server printers just to print documents directly to printer.<br />
<br />
Printing to display first and then to device works yes, but certain documents that have barcodes need to print directly to server printers to get the barcodes to show up. <br />
<br />
It seems like such a huge step backwards to have to print to server printers in order to do what we've done for 15 years with regular printers in baanIV. We now have an entire department printing all production order documents to a single shared printer because it's the only server printer nearby.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Barcodes, if printed without using any custom drivers should be visible even on the web browsers. That is, using bc$() function and not using any application which generates the code and injects the generated barcode into the O/P stream.<br />

Actually, it would depend on how Infor would have seen this change... when the industry is shifting towards cloud based and web based... Infor would want to stick to the trend and go with the flow. Not much of a comment here, but that is just my view.</div></div><hr />

I'm not exactly sure why this is. Unless we have something set up incorrectly in our system. What would I even begin to look for to make sure things on our end are set up correctly?</div></div><hr />
