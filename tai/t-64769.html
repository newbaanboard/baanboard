When zooming to a session LN assumes a dialog box window to the child.<br />
Because of this some of the indexes became unavailable not sure why.<br />
I also noticed that there are sessions like tccom4510m000 that when zoomed open as child on a dialog box and have all the indexes available but do not apply the view property of the index.<br />
Does anyone know how to do this?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Available Indices by Session (ttadv2101s000)<br />
Use this session to indicate which indices of the main table can be used in the session. If you run a session, you can switch the indices allowed by using the Change sequence option.<br />
If you start the session, the available indices of the main table are shown by default, with the Active check box cleared. You can indicate which indices are applicable for this session and you can define a sort code for an allowed index.<br />
You can also define the start index of the session. The start index is the index with sort code 1.<br />

Main Table The package code of the main table, usually the same as the package code of the session itself. If they are different, the session's package VRC must be in the same package combination as the package of the main table. This can be defined in the Package VRCs (ttadv1111s000) session. <br />

I've already dealed with the unavailability of some of the indexes when the session was zoomed from another.<br />
Don't know why but now they are all available.<br />
My actual problem is that LN by default always zooms sessions using a dialog box window.<br />
This means that the view property of the index is not taken in account.<br />
Is there a way to change this behavior or do I have to use start.session whenever it's necessary?<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

As far as I know the zoom option (zoom.to$() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_starting_and_stopping_programs_zoom_to) is a dialog window.<br />
 Is there a way to change this behavior or do I have to use start.session whenever it's necessary?<br />
Yes, start.session() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_starting_and_stopping_programs_start_session) gives the option -<br />
<br />
mode - Specifies the start mode for the new session. Possible values are:<br />
    MODAL The parent session is blocked until the child session exits, in case of a multi-occurrence the session will be started as a zoom session.<br />
    MODELESS Parent and child are parallel sessions that can be manipulated simultaneously.<br />
    MODAL_OVERVIEW The parent session is blocked until the child session exits, in case of a multi-occurrence the session will be started as an overview session.<br />
For dynamic sessions, other possible values are:<br />
    SINGLE_OCC The session is started as a single-occurrence (details) session.<br />
    MULTI_OCC The session is started as a multioccurrence (overview) session.<br />
Note: you can combine one of these with one of the other three; so e.g. MODELESS+SINGLE_OCC<br />
Also,<br />
 I also noticed that there are sessions like tccom4510m000 that when zoomed open as child on a dialog box and have all the indexes available but do not apply the view property of the index.<br />
You can customize the indices/views and enabled them.</div></div><hr />
