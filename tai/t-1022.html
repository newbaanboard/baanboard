<br />
Has anyone executed a job using &quot;Job Daemon or rc.startjob&quot; instead of their currently used &quot;Activate Job&quot;?<br />
<br />
I have tried executing Job Daemon or rc.startjob in our office but it seems not working.<br />
<br />
The following were the steps I have done please advise if I missed anything here.<br />
<br />
1. Run the session Maintain Calendar. Create entry on this session e.g. TIME<br />
2. Run the session Maintain Dates by Calendar. Create entry for the date and time.<br />
3. Run the session Maintain Job Data with the following entries.<br />
<br />
Job: TEST<br />
Desc: test job<br />
User: bsp<br />
Creation Date: 02-08-02<br />
Periodical: yes<br />
Job waiting after Execution: yes<br />
Calendar: TIME<br />
Period: 0<br />
Finish Date: <br />
Next excution date: same as Finish date<br />
Maximum duration: 0<br />
Status: Free<br />
4. Make job for session to be executed:<br />
I set the device to printer and also tried ASCIF (output to file)<br />
<br />
5. On the command line I login as root and execute the command:<br />
# rc.startjobdm.TEST<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

Most of the time you have to edit both scripts before they work. You have to specify the user in which it has to work. THe users should have the company as default in which the jobs are specified.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the jobdm is really a deamon. You only have to start it, all jobs will start automaticly if the have the status 'in queue'.<br />
<br />
For rc.startjob you have to change the user as well. That one you have to pass the name of the job since it only runs one job. The status of the job should be 'free'.<br />
<br />
With the jobdaemon you should see a bshell ttaad????m000 process running, it also creates a application lock.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't work, check the scripts, they write some logfiles which you can check.<br />
