<br />
I need some advise for moving the new version ln6.1, currently 2-tier baan IVc4 runs on sun/informix (tbase for archieve, test comp) &amp; crystal info. <br />
<br />
As the activities grow my headeach also grow. :confused: , leaving the application details out i need some help on the setup and hardware.<br />
<br />
Read through several discussion on 2/3 tier setup and it seems that most people suggest to use hostmode. personally i agree that network connectivity cannot beat internal I/O.<br />
<br />
However on the same box there is another problem, when the database get too busy it will effect the respone time on the application side. <br />
<br />
I'm planning to go for ln6.1 / win2003 / ms sql 2005 this time. <br />
<br />
- Should i use 2 tier or 3 tier ? <br />
    <br />
- Infor propose to me use cognos, can anyone give me some comments in compare to crystal report ?<br />
<br />
- What kind of hardware/servers that you guys would recommend? ( sizing of 30 users, 2 comp ) <br />
<br />
- Have anyone tried using mssql merge replication for ln6.1 ? <br />
<br />
any suggestions will do, thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Hi <br />
<br />
We have Crystal XI with Baan IVc and use the &quot;Connection Kit for Baan&quot;.<br />
But now we are migrating to LN 6.1. And now we want to use again the &quot;Connection Kit for Baan&quot;. But unfortunately this is NOT SUPPORTED with portingset 8.3! <br />
Business Objects told us, that they don't go for porting set 8.3.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

Just try to put in more than one processor and agood bit of memory. Aboloutely no need to split up DBMS and Application server here. Well, at least as long as you don't have 100 concurrent users using Crystal on the same database...</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for all the previous advice. the new ln i have choosen 2 tier configuration, using wink2k3/sql2005 on hp dl580 hardware at the end. <br />
<br />
the installation run quite smoothly, because we setup multibyte system for english &amp; japanese, hit some error during pmc stage, that was a known bug and dwl the new solution, after that everything works fine.<br />
<br />
after some testing and tweaking, the japanese language works fine now under worktop but on webtop we can't get it to work, on webtop japanese lang the display become square box. <br />
<br />
anyone have any idea what have been missing out on the webtop installation for japanese?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
regards<br />
