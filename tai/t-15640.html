<br />
Old topic, renewed again - anyone had success with installing Baan on Linux?<br />
<br />
We have Triton 3.1B and I would like to move it to a linux environment once it reaches the end-of-production-life.<br />
<br />
Putting our 3.1B installation onto a Linux server at that point in time makes sense, as we can support it with in house parts &amp; expertise, and we wouldn't have to carry support contracts with our hardware vendor.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions/ideas/etc?  Problems with bit versions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">14th June 2004, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Does 3.1b uses the same portingset as IVc? If it is it can work however since it's not official supported yet you will have a problem with the license. You can not license your linux box so you need another supported box to run your license on.<br />
<br />
IVc works fine with the un-official linux portingset. <br />
<br />

<br />
we are running now since 3 months IVc4 with the linux porting set 6.1c.07.03 (controlled release) without any big problems. Our DB is Oracle (9ir2), but BISAM support is also included (not tested by us), the OS is SuSe Enterprise Server 8.<br />
<br />
The general available version (6.1c.07.04) should be coming soon.<br />

<br />
What about 32 bit/64 bit compilation, etc?  Our dev environment is on an HPUX 64 bit system, and my linux &quot;test&quot; environment is a PII dual 350...<br />
<br />
I have a copy of our dev server in a linux enviroment but I get the message &quot;/triton/bse/bin/ba6.1: cannot execute binary file&quot;<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

You need to have a copy of the linux portingset.<br />
<br />
The shared c-libraries V5 are delivered with your linux distribution (at least with Suse).<br />

I looked on the baan support ftp site and I could only find i386, HP8000, ALPHA, etc...The shared c-libraries V5 are delivered with your linux distribution (at least with Suse).Ahh - I thought when you said shared libraries you meant baan libraries.  I'm running Redhat Linux 9, 2.4.20-8smp...  Do you happen to know where I could find this, or at least point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />
