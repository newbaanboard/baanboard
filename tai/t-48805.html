<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hmbmeister</div><div class="date">29th February 2008, 00:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have some username greater then 8 characters that are working.  <br />
For example:  user a logs on to windows as randerson and to baan as rander2.<br />
user b logs on to windows as jjohanson and to baan as jjohans2.<br />
<br />
Both user a and user b currently work.<br />
<br />
I set up two new users that have an Active Directory login of 9 characters (similar to user a and b) and they don't work.<br />
<br />
I've asked infor and two consultants and we don't know why user a and b are working but the two I set up are not.  <br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

It should be set to &quot;jjohanson&quot;.  Also, do you have a &quot;-- -set USER=jjohans2&quot; in the bwc for user b?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hmbmeister</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">How about this?  Can I make a user in Baan that does not have an Active Directory username?  For example &quot;test&quot;.  I want to be able to log on to the domain as me and use &quot;test&quot; to log into Baan.  Is that possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 23:54</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  When you set up the Baan user test, set the system login field to your domain user name.<br />
<br />
2.  In your bwc file configuration, add this to the command section &quot;-- -set USER=test&quot;<br />
<br />
3.  Log in;  For username and password, use your domain user information.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't work, please update the post with any errors.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hmbmeister</div><div class="date">6th March 2008, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.  That makes sencse and it worked.  However, is there anyway of setting up a Baan user that does not require any Active Directory or Local User authentication?  <br />
<br />
Basically, I want to set up &quot;test&quot; in Baan only.  Is that possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">6th March 2008, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Afraid not.  You have to authenticate against something, either the host machine, or a distributed method (AD, LDAP, etc...).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
