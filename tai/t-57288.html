I have my demo LN installed on my vmware reads from SLM host XP and this is  normally runs only 30 days. How can I direct this to read from our live SLM server? And also how to install porting set 8.5a01 from 8.5a?<br />
Thank you in advance for the advice you will share.<br />

How to upgrade the portingset is described in the technical notes belonging to the portingset. You can find it at the same location as where you download the portingset.<br />

I changed the SLM server name in the servers.xml (%SLMHOME\etc\servers.xml) but still the system is reading from my local SLM server located in my XP host even after restarting both my vm and the host.<br />
<br />
I followed the installation procedures in the manual by stopping the services in the Infor Manager and stopping also the SLM services in the host XP but still when I'm installing the porting sets the system don't allowed because the environment is in used. What else do I need to stop?<br />
<br />
NPRao,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions and I will follow this after doing this porting sets 8.5a01 and 02.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<br />
Probably some files are in use: check eventlog/logfiles to see which ones. Simply rename them and hit the retry button.<br />
