The components to be exported must be specified in a ascii file. Check the help text of the session to find out how to specify the components.</div></div><hr />

This would have been useful dozens of times over the last decade!   How long has it been available?  What version did it appear?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the tip.</div></div><hr />

The session was already available in 1994, when I started with Triton 3.</div></div><hr />

I am Sachin. I have just started working on Baan and I have similar problem as of yours, i.e., I want to export a session.<br />
<br />
I want that I just specify the session code and related components be selected automatically and dump be created.<br />
<br />
I posted this problem and then, i found that you also had similar problem. I have already  tried to use &quot;Export data dictionary&quot; session by selecting &quot;Export based on session&quot;, but it's not working. It selects all the components in the VRC.<br />
<br />
I am using BaanERP.<br />
<br />
I would be very much thankful if you let me know the solution. <br />
<br />
regards,<br />
Sachin &amp; Dharmesh.</div></div><hr />

While selecting Based on Session option,<br />
<br />
Are you selecting Session Object also to dump or not? If you do not select that it used to dump all the components of the VRC. Just check..!<br />
<br />
The other solution which is best to follow for any development is to maintain the Project and Customization Parts.  On users put Auto zoon to Project parts as enabled.. so whenever anu developer copies the component to development VRC, it automatically pops up for adding the part to the project. Then you can export the project components to port anywhere. Just check if it is feasible in your case or not..!<br />
