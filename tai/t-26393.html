<br />
Can anyboday tell me what are the steps in involved in upgrading the porting set.<br />
<br />
Currently we are on baan porting set 7.1c (baan5c, solaris2.6)and planning to upgrade our database from oracle 8i to oracle 9i. When I contacted the SSA , in order to be compatible with oracle 9i,we should atleast be on the porting set 7.1d01/02/03.<br />
<br />
I would like to know the process of upgrading the portign set, what are the steps involved. I have never done this before. so any kind of information will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You can't be SSAs instructions for this - Start with Solution #105618<br />
Read it completely. <br />
<br />
Now read each solution for every porting set between your current porting set and your new porting set. Look for solutions to install, product advisories, etc.<br />
<br />
In the porting set 7.1d.01+ there is a technical notes pdf file - that gives you detailed instructions on how to install.<br />
<br />
That should do the trick, it's really not difficult to do the install, the key is not getting bit in the A$$ by solutions or products that are de-supported.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

You cannot get general instructions for this posted here - Start by reading SSPA solution #105618<br />
Read it completely. <br />
<br />
Now read each solution for every porting set between your current porting set and your new porting set. Look for solutions to install, product advisories, etc.<br />
In the porting set 7.1d.01+ there is a technical notes pdf file - read this to get you detailed instructions on how to install.<br />
<br />
That should do the trick, it's really not difficult to do the install, the key is not getting bit in the A$$ by solutions or products that are de-supported.<br />
If you do not feel confortable from all those readings, get somebody experienced to do it for you.</div></div><hr />
