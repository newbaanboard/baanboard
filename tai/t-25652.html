<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">16th November 2005, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We are planning a migration from IVc3 to c4.  Thus far we have installed, migrated data and converted.  We are testing this conversion and I am having a problem in exchange exporting one of my tables.<br />
<br />
A recompile of the script generates 16 errors which can be viewed in attachment.  To isoliate the problem, I have created a NEW exchange scheme in the IVc4 environment, created the batch, ascii file, ascii file formats and set up the export table relations and field relations.<br />
<br />
When I create the export script, I still get the same error.<br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered this error before?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th November 2005, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - this looks like the error we got when we tried to export the tppdm600 table. Too many fields in the exchange scheme.  In our case what we did was keep removing fields until everything compiled - if I recall correctly each field removed dropped the errors by 2.  So in your case you might have 8 fields to many.<br />
<br />
Then at that point we re-did the whole exchange scheme to only export the actual fields that we needed(project dates, etc.).  Is there a reason you can not just use a table dump?</div></div><hr />
