<br />
We upgraded our live environment to STND/TOOLS weekly dumps 26/05, porting set 7.1d.09 and associated bic and bshell files.<br />
<br />
All looks well except simulate orders cprrp1210m000 performance has been impacted.  This has gone from running for 1 hour to taking upto eight hours to complete since the upgrade :( .  This is the same for all our logistic companies.  <br />
<br />
No error messages in logs, it just is taking a long time to run.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone got any ideas as to why, or had a similar problem after upgrade.  Logged a case with SSA but thought someone on here may have some input.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />

I have done this but it doesnt seem to shed amy light on log sql statements.  the longes one was 0.63 of a second.  I have sent a profile to SSA to see if they uncover anything.<br />

Any further advice.<br />

if it works then Im my view you have to optimize the object using sqltrace..<br />

<br />
It looked like a solution in the weekly dumps was causing this issue.  This has been removed and the jobs now run fine.  Have taken this up with SSA to find out way forward regarding solution.<br />

thanks for the help<br />
