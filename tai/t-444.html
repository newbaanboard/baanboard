<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sgabor</div><div class="date">20th November 2001, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to sift through the various sources of information on bdbpre and bdbpost.<br />
<br />
I know how to create a sequential dump file using BDBPRE and want to script the sequential dump along with a load.<br />
<br />
I plan on using the command line:<br />
<br />
D:\BAAN\BIN\BDBPOST -kmnif -I L:\CO160.DMP -q L:\CO160LOAD.ERR<br />
<br />
to do the load.<br />
<br />
If I was doing the load from ttaad4227m000 and checked ignore referential integrity constraints I would be prompted to run ttaad4225m00 after the load to repair the reference counters.  <br />
<br />
Since the -n ignores referential integrity constraints do I need to run bdbreconfig or ttaad4225m000 after the bdbpost load?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Run the reference check/repair afterwards.<br />
<br />
That is, unless you are sure that the data you are loading does not comprimise reference integrity - as maybe the case for certain tables.  If you're not sure, then run it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kamaljit</div><div class="date">21st November 2001, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">if your dump is huge say greater than 10GB ...you can just select the options data indices and reference integrity in session ttaad4225m000. <br />
<br />
On the other hand for a small database go ahead and do a reorganize  with repair refernce counter activated.<br />
<br />
If one is sure about the data then u need not reorganize tables .....though this is not the said practice. We have around 40GB of data and recently we distributed our complete database without reorganising tables ....the system is working fine.<br />
<br />
Do let me know if this helped you and post your views also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerhard</div><div class="date">21st November 2001, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are running Baan IV or older Triton versions, you have to run the refint part of the session ttaad4225m000. Don't check &quot;Data and Indices&quot;, because this would dump and reload the data again. If you use the -n option for bdbpost, the refcounters are not updated, so this has to be done afterwards.<br />
<br />
If it`s Baan ERP, you are work√≠ng with, you need to do it only for the txt tables, because in all other moduls, reference counters are not used anymore.</div></div><hr />
