<br />
did you set &quot;Create Tables for Different Company&quot; to yes?.<br />
If in your test company tables already are created, you must decide if you want to override or append the data. Also the format of the dump is important. Fixed or with seperators.<br />
All these settings are to be checked.<br />
<br />
I donÂ´t believe that there is a difference between single and multi site, but of course, you have to care about tables, that are linked to another companys.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

2002-08-19 14:09:06.309<br />
#$!pre-dump!$#00017cv<br />
Some older 6.1 portingsets inserted those lines when dumping, but generated errors when trying to post them again.  Removing these lines fixed that.</div></div><hr />
