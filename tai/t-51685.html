<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aaristotle</div><div class="date">9th May 2008, 07:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I am attempting to implement the ODM (Object Data Management) module in ERP LN FP3 / Tools 8.4.1a.<br />
<br />
I have installed the software on the server, loaded the default data into the dm tables all as per the install manuals.  I have also loaded the Infor ERP Integration software and the ODM/Office integration software on to my PC.<br />
<br />
I have configured the Central Configuration Console with the appropriate Bus component, and the Adaptor client for my PC.  I have tried running either the tmbdeserver or tmboaserver on the server with the appropriate bus component. I am also running the vault server on port 4001 on the server.<br />
<br />
I am now trying to use ODM however I have the following problems:<br />
<br />
I am unable to enable the paper clip icon within LN. (I have enabled ODM in Implemented Software Components)<br />
In Word or Excel selecting the menu option SSA ERP ODM / Register file in ODM produces the error message: &quot;Default Backend could not be found, check you adaptor configuration&quot;<br />
I am unable to edit the Common ODM parameters as per the manual (values are greyed out)<br />
I am unable to add libraries. (I have been able to define a Vault work area on the server)<br />
<br />
My main problem is probably not quite grasping the overall concepts of how everything relates in ODM, however there may also be issues with using 8.4.1.a tools which apparently has altered the underlying technology ie tmbdeserver rather than tmboaserver, and more of the drivers incorporated into base tools than before.<br />
If anyone can give me some pointers or knows of any additional documentation or training guides it would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
