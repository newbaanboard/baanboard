<br />
I am having a procedure received from one of my colleagues but I have never used this procedure.<br />
<br />
You can follow the following steps<br />
<br />
Step 1: Install the Baan on the Test server using the master CD.<br />
<br />
Step 2: Take the sequential dump of the sessions<br />
<br />
            ttiex3100m000,<br />
            ttiex3101m000, and <br />
            ttiex3102m000, from the live server <br />
you can take the sequential dump using the the session ttaad42226m000.<br />
 <br />
Step 3: Import the sequential dump of the sessions which you had taken from liveserver onto the testserver, to import the sequential dump you can use ttaad42227m000.<br />
<br />
Step 4: Edit the file in test server under $BSE/lib/license (in unix) or $BSE/lib/license6.1 (in windows), here include the liveserver name followed by a (,) commo and then followed by your test server name.<br />
<br />
Step 5: Configure the application by running the session ttiex3225m000.<br />
<br />
Step 6: Install all the service packs on the test server as many as you have on the live server.<br />
<br />
Best luck</div></div><hr />

I hope you had changed tabledef6.1 on your new to point your new database on new server.<br />
<br />
What is the error you are getting with bdbpost on new server?<br />
Follow below procedure:<br />
1. Open command prompt<br />
2. Change directory to %BSE%/bin --&gt; fillenv<br />
3. set USER=baan<br />
4. run bdbpost command.<br />
<br />
Let me know the error?<br />
Thank you<br />
Srini</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smarrapu</div><div class="date">12th January 2006, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also move the database using sp_detach and sp_attach command or full backup and restore on new server.<br />
<br />
After the above procedure, you need to correct the orphan database users. You need to link them back corresponding SQL Logins. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">13th January 2006, 12:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
in $BSE the lib directory is very important.<br />
Here you find files beginning with fd6.1.<br />
These files contain the package VRC informations.<br />
According to what you wrote, you didn't copy the $BSE/lib directory.<br />
Also the $BSE/lib/user directory contains the informations which user uses which company and which package combination .. <br />
<br />
I would try to copy $BSE/lib directory too, although, as you have imorted the company 000, a convert to runtime data dictionary should recreate these files. Don't forget to convert the users to runtime, this will recreate the files in $BSE/lib/user<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about this case.<br />
is it possibe if I build my test server from backup of my live one.<br />
we do backup our live server using tape.<br />
<br />
could I just restore the backup to my test server.<br />
is it possibe. we've backup baan folder from live server.<br />
the problem is we have to use diff host name.<br />
anybody has experience on this on<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David Eagar</div><div class="date">16th January 2006, 07:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this can be done (we are using this method in Baan 5c), however there a quite a few steps involved, mostly resetting ownership / authorizations etc on the test server</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have test server identical like production server. Instalation of test server is simple:<br />
<br />
Install base instalation of Baan on test server .<br />
<br />
Stop all baan services.<br />
<br />
Then rename Baan dir on test sever and on tests server copy whole baan dir from production sever. <br />
<br />
Make backup baandb database from production sever and then restore that backup on test sever.<br />
<br />
Delete and recreate baan users on baan test.<br />
<br />
Start all baan services.<br />
<br />
On this way you will have identical instalation of baan on test sever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wei_smooth</div><div class="date">17th January 2006, 05:41</div></div><div class="posttext">hallo eibrahimovic,<br />
<br />
<br />
do I have to change the data base mapping on the test server.<br />
because in live server we put the DB on drive E<br />
and in the test server we put the DB at drive C<br />
<br />
do you used a different host name ?<br />
if I wanto used a different host name what should I do?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eibrahimovic</div><div class="date">18th January 2006, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello<br />
<br />
We use different hostname, and we have same disk mapping like on prodution sever. BSE dir is on c:\, and database is on D:\. <br />
Data comes from test sever because in client we specify with ip address our test server. Licences comes from production sever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">agoes.s</div><div class="date">28th April 2006, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi eibrahimovic,<br />
<br />
I'm already did what was wrote here.<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
1.  Can i make my testing server not take the license from live server?<br />
Cause now when i'm log in to my new test server. the license in live server was took.<br />
<br />
I tried to change the filelicence6.2 in lib folder, i change it from the name of my live server into the name of my test server.<br />
and when i click baan, it gave me message &quot;You have no license anymore to start the bshell&quot;<br />
<br />
Please advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smarrapu</div><div class="date">3rd May 2006, 00:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
You can do below.<br />
1. Change the %BSE/lib/licence6.x file to your development server.<br />
2. On your developmen server, open BW configuration --&gt; put session --&gt; ttiex3228m000  in the command field.<br />
When you run this session, it will give demo licence for 7 days. You need to re-validate the server with in 7 days. <br />
3. Login to Baan -&gt; When you login, the session 'patch objects after system crash' ttiex3228m000 will start. <br />
<br />
This is work around. <br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Have you or anybody succeeded in setting up a exact copy of your production server to test server. If so can you please give me directions on how to go about it ? I need to do the same next week and look forward to your views ?</div></div><hr />
