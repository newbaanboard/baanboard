<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thaykhov</div><div class="date">19th August 2009, 07:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Guru's<br />
<br />
I have a senario where I have 3 companies A,B and C.<br />
<br />
In coy A they have their own BP Table (AR BP's Only)<br />
In coy B they have their own BP Table (AR BP's Only)<br />
In coy C they have their own BP Table (AP BP's Only)<br />
<br />
I want coy A and B to read coy C's BP table as well as have their own. Is this possible?<br />
<br />
The reason for this is we would like to create a service company to pay supplier on behalf of all entities but would like the AR information to remain the same in each individual company.<br />
<br />
Is this possible? I know I cannot add another tccom100 record in the logical company if the table already exist in the physical company.<br />
<br />
You help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Thay</div></div><hr />
