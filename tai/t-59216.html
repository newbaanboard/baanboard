<br />
I want to know if anyone has IVc4 tools on IVC3 application and with Level II SQL drver. We are on IVc3 and want to go to level II SQL driver, and we have following choices<br />
<br />
1. Run level II driver on IVC3 tool. This is possible but Baan said they won't support this configuration<br />
<br />
2. Run IVC3 application on IVc4 tool set and level II  driver. Baan apparently support this. If some one has done this, then what issues they faced it.<br />
<br />
3. Migrare to IVC4.<br />
<br />
The reason we would like to migrate to IVc4 is <br />
<br />
1. Order number series<br />
2. Since we are on IVc3 we can't do like webptop, AFS etc (though there is no need as such)<br />
3. Integration with PDM and storefront are supported on IVc4.<br />
<br />
But these are not good enough reason to justify the migration cost. <br />
<br />
We think that the testing required fo IVc4 tools and IVc3 application would be considerably less than going from IVc3-&gt; IVc4. We also have lot of standard table changes and customizations.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I do believe there would be more testing with a 4c4 upgrade based off the new functionality involved(don't ask because I no longer remember all the issues). Mainly we did it for Finance since there were changes to our extension only in 4c4.  With the tools upgrade you just have to run through all the sessions/processes you company uses to validate they work.  The users would at least be familiar with them.  I do seem to recall several new parameters and forms changes in 4v4.<br />
<br />
Plus - with 4c3 you could do afs. We were doing that before we converted to 4c4.  Not sure about webtop.</div></div><hr />

Most of the issues are in the switch from Oracle to SQL.  The actual IVc4 tools upgrade is not too difficult.  It's basically just performing the install.<br />
<br />
The level II conversion requires dumping and reloading all your data.  However, there are some shortcuts you can do in SQL to accomplish the same thing in a shorter time frame than bdbpre/bdbpost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">17th September 2010, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Vincent &amp; Mark,<br />
Thanks for your reply. <br />
<br />
Do we need to watch for something when moving to Level II on SQL. Our assumption is that since migrating to IVc4 may affect functionality of certain session, so it needs to be extensively tested, while just doing a tools upgrade do not call for such extensive testing. What kind of testing is suggested when doing just Tools upgrade?<br />
<br />
I am not concerned of actual convesrion process. We are trying to identify how much time is needed in testing out in both scenarios. If we need to go through the same amount of testing, then I think we would go for IVc4 upgrade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">17th September 2010, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest change I can think of in tools is PMC.  This is the new way of patching that actually has dependencies between solutions and does checking of those dependencies, can download automatically, and let you know about customizations that use the objects in the solutions being installed.  However, you may not be using that much because I don't believe there will be solutions for the IVc3 application side.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, just test as you would for any other upgrade.  Make sure people can do their daily/weekly/monthly jobs.  Not necessarily a full functional test but enough to make sure that all tools interaction is working correctly.<br />
<br />
For the level II upgrade, you just want to make sure that the tables have real indexes and no more hash columns after the upgrade.  In theory, you can save 40% +/- of disk space because of the loss of the hash columns.  If the indexes are there and the hash columns are gone, and everything is functioning correctly, you should be good.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

U may also need to upgrade db / os if upgrade to latest porting sets in B40c4 .<br />
<br />
To use largger number series SP15 is mandatory .<br />
<br />
Also may need to relicense the level 2 driver and some tools correction program to run (all documented in driver migration process) .</div></div><hr />
