<br />
We are running on HP Unix Server with BaaN V c4 and sp19.<br />
<br />
When i go to unix prompt and execute command &quot;date&quot; , it returns me correct date and time, and then that very moment when i take a new BaaN connection and then see via licmon, it shows diff. time in licmon, although it shows correct date.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that when u take the new baan connection the date/time is captured via licmon that very moment , so ideally the time returned by unix command and time returned by licmon both should match ... am i wrong ?<br />
<br />
If i am not wrong, then any idea, as to why licmon shows wrong time ? is it something to do with Daylight saving or some O/S , baan patch issue ? :o<br />
<br />
Can someone try the same on their system and let me know whether it matches with my observation ? :)<br />
<br />
Refer to attached screenshot.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

as far on my understanding, the date that shows licmon6.1 (on my case), shows the date and the time when that user set up a connection with baan...<br />
You can observe a 2 minute delay between I accessed to baan and the time when I execute date command.<br />

Yaah 2 min delay is quiet understandable, but i dont know why in my case Licmon is giving wrong time ? :(<br />
<br />
I feel probably its some Tools or porting set Issue.... since binaries like licmon are delivered in porting set ... just a wild guess<br />

<br />
if your licd was started as part of the bot process, then maybe the process is running under a different timezone. in Unix the selected timezone is mostly not a setting valid for the machine, but simply an environment variable. So if the TZ variable is different, then it will display a different time.<br />
<br />
Try simply to kill and restart the licd as root user and see, whether it males a difference.<br />
