Suddenly at 5:15PM yesterday, we did start getting this enclosed errors for every user who is entering Sales orders. Whenever I try to open a table tdsls400 through GTD, I did have the message that tdsls400.crep not found &amp; table definition for tdsls400 not found. I did not able to open that table even for view. We didnt change any table definitions or didnt load any patches. Since we didnt find source of the issue in 40 minutes, our management decided to reboot the production AS/400 server. Once we reboot the server the issue had gone. Baan support said that some thing was happened in the database level for that table, that is the reason why Baan did gave those errors. Any one has the same experience? What was really happened in Baan or Database? How we prevent the same in future?<br />
<br />
Log file enclosed.<br />
Appreciated for your feedback.<br />
Thanks,<br />

This sounds like a Baan Bug to me and sound more like something, which would happen on a windows platform. (Sorry for the pun, could not resist :-) )<br />
<br />
But if this happens next time, then make sure to check the following.<br />
<br />
a) In which package combination is your user working?<br />
b) What is the description (fields) of the table in that PKG?<br />
c) How does the table in Oracle (desc command) really look?<br />
<br />
I would always trust here the runtime files (dict, user etc) and not, what's in the development tables of Baan.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on logs and Baan experts opinion we believe that this issue was caused due to wrong table/domain definition in shared memory. And also noted that the same issue was happened to other AS/400 Baan customer last year. I hope this is rare in AS/400 (first time I am seeing in my 3 year AS/400 experience)<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
