<br />
When you load a solution that has a fair few number of pre-requisites you won't necessarily know if any of these pre-reqs have special instructions. Should you always convert/create runtime anyway after loading a solution with dozens of pre-reqs?<br />
<br />
I appreciate that you wouldn't get so many pre-reqs if you kept up to date with your SP's and weekly dumps. But as a rule I don't fix anything that's not broken!<br />
<br />
I would be interested to know what other people do when faced with a scenario such as above.<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
If none is found, I do not run anything.<br />
I a domain or table definitions is found, I check the text of the solution that installed it/them to see what kind of action must be taken.<br />
<br />
I only one solution is to be installed, without dependencies/co-requisites, I always have a look at the components to be installed and read the solution text if needed, fo any actions to be taken.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have several languages other than 1 to 4, make sure that in a regular base you run copy software components.</div></div><hr />

(I don't work on Production system but on development systems).<br />
When I install Tools Solutions I do the &quot;Create RDD for Tools&quot; after each solution.<br />
Typically when you install solutions for application (not Tools) they are no dependancies with Tools Solutions.<br />
Tools Solutions only depends on other Tools Solutions.<br />
For both sessions I use all the options (reconfigure tables or &quot;also dump data def&quot;) : if there are no changes, only a check is performed by Baan. It takes a little more time but it is safer.<br />
<br />
In a general way, it is recommended to use SP instead of weekly dumps.</div></div><hr />
