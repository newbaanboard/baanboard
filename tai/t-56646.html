<br />
I need some help here.<br />
<br />
I have a test LN FP2 server. I had temporary license on this server that got expired. I applied for another temporary license key which I got from Infor.<br />
<br />
I have applied that key in BCLM, but even after that when I try to login through worktop, I get the message &quot;No License to run bshell&quot; and I cannot login. Howvere, If I login through weptop or through BW, I do not get this error message and I can login to LN.<br />
<br />
Please suggest, what could be the reason for this.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Jatin</div></div><hr />

<br />
or maybe you can try to restart the license services, but with single user logon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BW is not giving any error log...nothing in event viewer. <br />
I have run bclmclienttest..and that give the result as 'ALL OK'.<br />
<br />
I have also tried restarting the services and the server as well..but doesn't help.<br />
<br />

<br />
You have to get the latest SLM version, the generic solution for SLM is 209192.<br />
Also post your license.xml<br />
have you tried with the SLM? sorry but i'm not familiar with the BCLM, maybe the others can help you. <br />
BCLM is an older version of SLM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think i have a similar problem on our sales team where he used FP2 and he cannot enter thru worktop and can only do it on the webtop.<br />
<br />
and to solved it i install the latest SLM, just like the NPRao said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jatin_sanghi</div><div class="date">4th September 2009, 07:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to all,<br />
<br />
I have installed the latest SLM 7.1 and relicensed the server..and it works fine.<br />
<br />
But, still have confusion on why this has happened. The same server with old BCLM and portingset/bw got licensed successfully earlier, then why not time time.<br />
<br />
