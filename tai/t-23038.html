When running some jobs in order to see the difference between our old and new system we see that Baan isn't getting out the maximum out of the boxes, not cpu bound, not disk bound, network utilization is just a few %.<br />
<br />
I can see that using ssts_set_rows, RDS_FULL etc. helps a bit but how can I get more out of it?<br />
<br />
Is this just caused by the network latency or e.g. by sqlnet? <br />

I have used the following settings and it worked good for us for increasing the speed of the bdbreconfig. <br />
<br />
[DEV:bsp]/app/lms/lmss/opt/bse/lib/defaults&gt;cat db_resource.fast<br />
use_shm_info:1<br />
dbsinit:01<br />
ora_init: 0111000<br />
rds_full:500<br />
ssts_set_rows:5000<br />
ora_max_array_fetch:5000<br />
ora_max_array_insert:5000<br />
nls_lang:american_america.we8iso8859p1<br />
nls_sort:binary<br />
oracle_home:/app/common/oracle/product/8.1.7.2<br />
ora_temporary_tablespace:TEMP<br />
[DEV:bsp]/app/lms/lmss/opt/bse/lib/defaults&gt;<br />
<br />
Then add to the BWC script or the job activation script -<br />
<br />
set USR_DBC_RES=lib/defaults/db_resource.fast  -set USR_DBS_RES=lib/defaults/db_resource.fast <br />
<br />
Warning - this might cause more issues if used in the regular mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
especially for Batch Jobs 3-tier setup will never run as fast as in hostmode. You are right this is mainly due to network and sqlnet.<br />
<br />
the settings of nprao will help, as they increase the amount of data send for each network trip. <br />
<br />
Additionally you might look at the parameters tdu and sdu in the sqlnet documentation. These increase something like the size of packages used in sqlnet, if I am not mistaken. Additionally make sure you switched of any kind of sqlnet tracing both on the Application and database server. Look here for the variable &quot;EPC disabled&quot;.<br />

In 3 -tier the load is balanced on the application server, network and database server. For each server you have to see how much time it takes per CPU and compare this to the actual CPU speed. Then you see that there is also some network stuff that gives some performance decrease.<br />
<br />
If both systems have the same CPU speed, the maximum of 50% of a CPU will be measured on both systems when bshell+driver consume the same as the database. <br />
<br />
If possibe, try to run your jobs in hostmode as it saves a lot of networking time and in most cases the CPU speed of the DB server is better compared to the APS server.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Using combo mode gives us 5% performance gain in C/S mode, 14% in full host mode.<br />
<br />
Using large buffers (like ssts_set_rows) didn't make any difference.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the response.<br />
