In short a new program script contains the new functionality, and calls all the functions in the original standard program like a dll.  You lay your customizations on top of the standard script.</div></div><hr />

Any method or workaround to achive this using Authorizations.<br />

Alternatively you could put the table data authorisation on tdpur040 by order type, which could prevent the user deleting the header - but they could still delete the lines. Better than nothing but not ideal.<br />

In Baan V , you can give permission on a session to control what actions are allowed, I think even by specifying by data.  In Baan IV you can not set such permissions on the session.  Something like Rush  is the best way to go.  Why would it be your last option.  There are many pluses to taking that option.  It is quick and Painless.</div></div><hr />

I agree with EdHubbard.Because order type doesn't be stored in purchase-order lines(tdpur401),you have to find a field to save order type(equal or similar as),maybe you can ask user enter order type in unused fields,then create a role which cannot delete records from tdpur400/tdpur401 and grant the role to those users.<br />

The version under consideration in SSA ERP 5.0c.<br />
Toolswizard, please explian, how you can control what actions are allowed at the session level, without touching the source code?<br />
<br />
We can take a delete action as an example.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catwalk</div><div class="date">9th February 2005, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">This is continuation of earlier post..<br />
<br />
More specifically, How can we control the delete action at the session level if the Order type = &quot;a specific value&quot;?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
This session allows to specify a specific value to a field through which the authorisation can be controlled.</div></div><hr />
