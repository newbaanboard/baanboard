<br />
How can I get rid of this? <br />
Can I just delete the entries on Unix-level?<br />

Kind regards<br />

So, first make sure you don't have a definition in tools and then you can safely delete it from the runtime dd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is, why I ask: I deleted from tools table and found it afterwards still in the Data Dictionary.<br />
If now some runs &quot;create tables&quot; within that range, the table will be created without any definition in the definition table.<br />

If for some reason it doesn't you can manually delete it without repercutions.</div></div><hr />
