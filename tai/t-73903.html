<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th June 2021, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue is this:<br />
(1) tpcin9280m000 does not run in production. Runs the system out of memory and then aborts.  Working SR with infor on this.  <br />
(2) In dev we just upgraded to newest porting set, it solves the tpcin9280m000 issue.  But some sessions like maintain forms aborts and kicks you out of the system.<br />
<br />
So since finance now wants a run of all the billable cost reports I was thinking - he maybe I can point the dev data to the production database.  I would leave the dev company 000 pointed to the current dev company 000, but then point the rest of the tables to production database?  It makes sense in my head, but not sure it is really a good idea.  Or maybe leave all of that alone and just add the production company tables to the system.  We are using oracle as the back end database.<br />
<br />
Possible? Thoughts or concerns?  I might not have thought of everything.</div></div><hr />

Make backup, install new PS, run the reports for finance, restore original PS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th June 2021, 21:07</div></div><div class="posttext">That might be an option.  The problem is the billable cost reports really take days for us to finish all of them.  While the system is really reference only right now - we still have people using things like display boms (which also aborts, then kicks you out). Not sure I found every session that does the same thing. Worries me with the way the porting set broke stuff.  Wish I had a spare server sitting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th June 2021, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Which brings up another question when we updated to 19c we were told to upgrade porting set also.  So is anyone running oracle 19 for 4c4 on the 9.1c porting set?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">18th June 2021, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably completely unrelated but we had something similar recently. I tried to turn on audit for tiedm010 table and any users opening maintain p-boms would have the session open then immediately close. no idea what i screwed up but undoing it fixed everything</div></div><hr />
