<br />
That is not a big issue, we can solve it.<br />
<br />
First, let me know exact message occurred in Event Viewer. Did you tried by manually starting it? Is this a same server where your licence daemon was earlier placed? <br />
<br />
Did you tried running ottiexpatch from command of bshell environment?<br />
<br />
Keep posting these answers.<br />

<br />
I was just reading your other post &quot;licence transfer&quot; here and seems you played lot with licence6.1 of prod. server.<br />
<br />
If so, it might be a small issue.<br />
<br />
Can you please verify IP address of your licence daemon (where actual licences are placed) server is same which is entered in your licence6.1 file of your production server?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
In Baan IVc4, u can check if licmon executable is running or not in your task manager. It should ideally start from the startup service, but it may have been commented in the script.<br />
<br />
If licon is not running, you can start it by going to path &quot;$BSE/bin&quot; and double clicking on &quot;licmon&quot; executable.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">30th July 2007, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">In none of the posts in that thread does anyone mention about changing anything on the Live Server. <br />
.......There is no need to do any changes on the Live Server. No changes whatsoever!!!<br />
Only edit the Licence6.1 file on the Test Server and stop the licence service on Test Server!!<br />
<br />
The final post underlines it. Changing the License file on the test server would never bring upon this sort of a problem. Atleast i can vouch for it based on my test environment.<br />
 <br />
So what really happened?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">30th July 2007, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">You still havent mentioned about what recent changes took place on this server where the license service isnt running. <br />
=&gt;Prior to restarting, what are the changes that was done on this server? Did you install any software? Did you change\edit any BSE\lib files? <br />
=&gt;Is Baan getting connected after the &quot;License service is not running&quot; message?<br />
=&gt;When the licence service isnt running, Baan would atleast login allowing you to access the Tools\Software Validation sessions. Is this happening in your case?<br />
=&gt;When you try to manually start the Licence service, what is the error message you are getting? Are the other services (Shared Memory, Logic Services) running? <br />
 <br />
Let us know..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">30th July 2007, 10:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you try disabling the antivirus service that loads on startup and then try restarting the server? Installation of Antivirus software shouldnt affect your License Service or Baan for that matter. However in your case that seems to be the only change that has happened on that server off late so might as well try negating the effect of the antivirus software by disabling its services and restarting Baan/Server.<br />
 <br />
Could you also see through the event viewer and find out what are the eror messages you got prior to restarting and after restarting. Not just whats related to Baan Licencing but Baan in general. Should give you some indication as to what went wrong...<br />

This means that something happened to your brand file (maybe your AntiVirus moved your brand file?).<br />

The following thread is for Baan V but this is more or less valid for BaanIV: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=16669&amp;highlight=brand+software</div></div><hr />
