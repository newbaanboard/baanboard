<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">28th February 2007, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday a opened a threat because I had a problem with copying a session from on vrc to another. It was my own mistake and now I'm a step forward.<br />
<br />
But now again something strange happens, hopefully not again my fault :( <br />
<br />
After copying the session and saving and agreeing the question for also copying the forms I get the subsession for this. After filling it, in my opinion in the right way, I get the error message &quot;form code not allowed&quot;. All looks ok and the forms are not present in the target vrc. I also get this error in the next subsession for copying the report - &quot;report code not allowed&quot;.<br />
If I try to change the name of the target form or report code to a complete new one, no error appears, but anyway nothing is copied.<br />
<br />
I copied in this way many time in our life system and don't know whats wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

The amusing part is once i skip the copying process, it still copies or transfers the forms and reports from the source VRC to the target. <br />
<br />
Off late i have adopted the policy &quot;if it works, it aint needed fixin&quot;<br />
<br />
In you case however, its strange that nothing is being copied. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">1st March 2007, 11:25</div></div><div class="posttext">In the subsession 'Copy forms by sessions' (ttadv2201s000), you have to enter a form-code/name for the new form in the field 'To form'. When not, the field 'To form' is defaulted to the same form code as the old one, which is not allowed, therefor you receive the message 'form code not allowed' which is totally justified.. <br />
<br />
Normally you give the same name you gave your NEW session, with a '1' added at the end. You say that this doesn't work, this must work? Check your package vrc, and the entered (new) session name. Go to the new session in ttadv2500m000 and via 'select' choose 'forms' to see which form is linked...<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />
