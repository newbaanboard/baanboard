There are times when a report is not getting created. No record is inserted in the device que, but the sales orders are being updated and moved from sales status step 1 (print order ackcnowledgements) to 8 (generate outbound advice). Not sure if this is a tools issue or an issue with the print order acknowledgements (tdsls4401m000) session. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

If the time is round midnight and you are deleting the old printjobs in the same time, it could be the bug.<br />
<br />
We deleted the old printfiles at midnight. But baan did delete the actual created files also (the date of the files during creation is 0. Baan deleted between 0 and the end-date.... . So was only an empyt file to print).<br />

Hello,<br />
not only deleting the temporary files may effect this.<br />
Also deleting sort files in time when the job is executing may cause this problem.<br />
Maybe a delete job is executed by CRON ?<br />
