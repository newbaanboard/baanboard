<br />
Thanks in advance..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. I first thought that it won't help to assign owners and set permitions to 'Read-Only', since then the options re-arrange icons' and 'icons by application' etc are still available for the other users. <br />
<br />
However, after looking further I saw that the users won't be allowed however to save their changes (provided that the field 'permitions' in ttdsk200 is set to 'Read-Only'), so that's good enough for me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cheeyangt</div><div class="date">19th March 2007, 03:07</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a few desktops created for a few users. however there are some users that have left the company and i would like to delete the desktops of such users.<br />
<br />
when i look into ttdsk200 using ttaad4100, all the desktops are linked to the same desktop ID (desktop ID 5). this means the desktops of active and resigned users are all linked to desktop ID 5. If i were to delete the desktop of those resigned users, will it delete the desktop of those active users as well since all desktops are linked to ID 5?<br />
<br />
appreciate some help. thanks.</div></div><hr />
