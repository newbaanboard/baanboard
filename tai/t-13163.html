<br />
Scenario:<br />
- We run B50.0b, with Porting set 6.2a.03.03. <br />
- In ttaad1200s000 the 'Table def. in Shared Memory' is clicked on.<br />
- In ttaad4150m000 for type 'Program scripts' (only) standard tt dll's are entered.<br />
- When running trace: -- -dbgsrdduse -logfile trace -keeplog, all the 'Table dump .........' lines appear with 'load from disk'.<br />
-  First session start-up takes up to 35 seconds.<br />
<br />
Is the fact that the trace shows 'load from disk' normal? Or is it a bug? Is that the probable cause of the slow start-up? Can it be solved WITHOUT upgrading porting set? Any workarounds? I saw 2 solutions on the Baan-support site: 133869 &amp; 126805, they seem to indicate exactly my problem, and it is mentioned that for B50.0b/c this was solved from PS 7.1d.02 on. I am not able to upgrade porting set currently. However, is it maybe possible to upgrade specific files/dll's individually in order to get this problem solved?<br />
<br />
<br />
I would very much appreciate your information / advice regarding this issue!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

Unless you are trying to tell me in very short, something like this: &quot;yes, the problem is caused by a bug which results in the shared memory tables still being read from disk. this problem has been solved by PS 7.1, so this will for sure solve this problem for you. for the rest there is absolutely nothing else you can do in order to enhance the first session start-up; you're stuck with this performance issue until you upgrade your porting set&quot;........????:eek: <br />

Please specify.</div></div><hr />
