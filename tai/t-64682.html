You can attach documents into the WORK area and view documents in the VAULT.  You can copy a new revision from the VAULT to WORK and edit it BUT if you try and release it back to the vault it gives this error:<br />
<br />
Connection Refused - The copy operation of '$BSE/tmp/filename' from erptest01 port0 to 'pathname on IP address', port 2001 has failed.<br />
<br />
I have checked that the java process is running on the server, and it is.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check if it works with Port 4001 in session dmdoc5500m000 for your Host.<br />
<br />
Also, check if firewall is not turned on. Check this KB #1006332 on Xtreme to get more details.</div></div><hr />
