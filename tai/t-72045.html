<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">florian.battke</div><div class="date">19th July 2019, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear all, <br />
<br />
I hope someone can help me with this as I really am stuck now. This is something I have done multiple times with no problems, and now I cannot get it to work any more:<br />
<br />
Setup:<br />
I have two companies, 300=&quot;b61a9dev&quot; and 100=&quot;b61a9tes&quot;.<br />
<br />
== What works ==<br />
I have added a new field &quot;fbtest&quot; to table tdsls400 in company 300. I convert to runtime, reconfigure tables. In my oracle server, I can query the field e.g. by,<br />
SELECT t$test FROM baan.ttdsls400300;<br />
In the data dictionary, I can see the changes in <br />
/Infor/ERPLN/bse/dict/ddb61a9dev/dtdsls400 (e.g. the line &quot;:NAME:tdsls400.fbtest&quot;).<br />
All is well.<br />
<br />
== What does not work ==<br />
Now I do the exact same thing on the other company:<br />
I add the new field &quot;fbtest&quot; to table tdsls400 in company 100. I convert to runtime, reconfigure tables. I notice that the usual messages &quot;Reconfiguring tables&quot; and &quot;Repairing referential integrity&quot; do not appear, the process is finished instantly.<br />
The field is not visible in the oracle db:<br />
SELECT  t$test FROM baan.ttdsls400100;  --fails on unknown column.<br />
The data dict file (/Infor/ERPLN/bse/dict/ddb61a9tes/dtdsls400) is untouched.<br />
<br />
I have tried adding fields to other tables in company 100, that works.<br />
I have tried adding fields to other tables in other companies, that works.<br />
I have tried adding the field in tdsls400, company 100 with differing name, domain, label. None of that works.<br />
I have tried the reconfigure tables command focused only on my table, on the whole package, on the whole VRC, with and without reconfigure tables, nothing works.<br />
I have removed and added the field to the table multiple times. Doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I have checked the log files. No mention of my table in any of them, specifically not in log.reconfig.<br />
<br />
I have checked table ttadv502000 and can see that after adding my field it contains an entry (b61a9tes,2,tdsls400,0,0) which disappears when I reconfigure tables despite nothing happening to either table or dictionary.<br />
<br />
I have recreated the complete data dictionary for that company, no result. However, then log.reconfig says &quot;tdsls400100 C0 0 No reconfiguration is needed&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Any hints on what is wrong with my system or where to look further will be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />

<br />
I add the new field &quot;fbtest&quot; to table tdsls400 in company 100.<br />
<br />
It is not clear how can/did you add a new field to a company? You have to add a field to the table in the VRC that is linked to the Package Combinations (b61a9dev and b61a9tes) and then execute the run-time sessions (ttadv5210m000, ttadv5215m000) for the Package Combination(s) so the Data Dictionary files to be regenerated and the new fields to be applied to the Database. <br />
<br />
Refer to -  Companies and Users  (http://www.baanboard.com/node/44) <br />
<br />
 Version Management  (http://www.baanboard.com/node/43)<br />
<br />
so you can have some clear understanding of the concept of the Package VRC's, Package Combinations and Companies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">florian.battke</div><div class="date">22nd July 2019, 08:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear NPRao,<br />
<br />
Thank you for trying to help and sorry if my wording was unclear. I understand about VRC, that is not my problem. I was using the company numbers in the text because of the more obvious link to the database table names (that have the company number as suffix as in tdsls400100 / tdsls400300). I mentioned the VRC for those companies in the intro.<br />
<br />
And I know how to regenerate Data Dict or apply field to the database - as you can see from the fact that I did it successfully in the Package Combination b61a9dev, and from my statement that I did it successfully on other tables in b61a9tes. <br />
<br />
My problem is that it does not work for _one specific table_ in a _single VRC_.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After adding the field in tdsls400 Table in Company 100, you did crdd,<br />
What did the log log.ottadv5215 say?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">florian.battke</div><div class="date">22nd July 2019, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Ajesh, mark_h, <br />
<br />
Thank you both for helping me with this!<br />
<br />
I have tried again, doing these steps:<br />
- Opened the table tdsls400 in ttadv4520m100 (Tools/App.Dev/Domains&amp;Tables), - Added new field &quot;fbtest&quot;, domain tc.ynna, default tcynna.no, no label.<br />
- Convert to Runtime DD (+Reconfigure Tables, +Runtime Directories) in Session ttadv5215m000 over the whole of b61a9tes, all packages, all tables. Process prints no errors and finishes in &lt;1 second, no messages shown.<br />
<br />
The log directory does NOT contain a logfile log.ottadv5215!<br />
<br />
<br />
I was also suspecting the permissions, but couldn't find anything wrong. Here's the two relevant files for tdsls400 in the two VRCs:<br />
-rw-rw---- 1 bsp app_ERP 11649 19. Jul 15:20 ddb61a9dev/dtdsls/dtdsls400<br />
-rw-rw---- 1 bsp app_ERP 11649 19. Jul 14:55 ddb61a9tes/dtdsls/dtdsls400<br />
Both files are the same size because I removed the extra field in ddb61a9dev (company 300) after my test.<br />
<br />
And here are the folder permissions:<br />
drwxrws--x 2 bsp app_ERP 16384 19. Jul 15:28 ddb61a9dev/dtdsls<br />
drwxrws--x 2 bsp app_ERP 16384 19. Jul 15:29 ddb61a9tes/dtdsls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">florian.battke</div><div class="date">22nd July 2019, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just run a complete rebuild of the dictionary (ttadv5210m000, +Check before create runt.) over b61a9tes and checked log.reconfig.<br />
<br />
It says:<br />
2017-09-22[12:17:44(UTC-02:00)]:bsp: Bdbreconfig check started by session ttadv5210m000 and pacc b61a9tes<br />

<br />
Then I ran the same session, limited to package &quot;td&quot;, but with &quot;Check before creating runt.&quot; unchecked.<br />
This noew recreated the dict in dict/ddb61a9tes/dtdsls/dtdsls400, but the new field is still NOT present there, and in the oracle db the column has not been created.</div></div><hr />

Hi Mark<br />
<br />
Its ttadv502(Tools company) for Table Def/Domains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">florian.battke</div><div class="date">23rd July 2019, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ajesh,<br />
even with nobody logged in, the problem remains the same.<br />
<br />
I had already checked ttadv502. It does contain some rows for package combination b61au, but these I dare not touch. Please see my initial post where I have mentioned what happens to ttadv502 when I try to add the field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd July 2019, 23:30</div></div><div class="posttext">At this point I would log an issue with Infor.<br />
<br />
I know in our case we would get out of sync between oracle and the data dictionary.  When that happened I had several things I could try to do to get them back in sync.  Sometimes deleting the field would work and recreating RDD.  Sometimes I would have to move .old files back into the data dictionary, then re-add the field and RDD again to get it to work.  The only time on our 4c4 system I have seen this happen is when things get out of sync between oracle and the data dictionary - or the permissions were in correct on the DD files.<br />
<br />
Have you tried completely removing the table from that VRC and reconfig?  Let it revert to where it is derived from.  Then copy the table back into the VRC and do another RDD.  Make sure you see the data dictionary files getting updated.  Then try adding the field.</div></div><hr />

It's a linux server, so no event viewer, sadly.<br />

Typically a dev environment is built off of a production environment.  The production environment should have all changes except for the last change you made.  So all of the other fields should be there and you are just adding this last field.<br />
<br />
Even though it is customization fields the CRDD should still work.  I would think they would support that, only way to find out is to log a support incident.</div></div><hr />
