<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dieter</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using BA and BW. With BW we can set up a secured connection between (PC) client and Baan Server (e.g. with SSH and Putty). Is there any way to do the same with BW ? With the standard BW anyone who has a physical connection to our network can read with a sniffer all traffic and we donÂ´t like that :-)<br />

You might be able to forward the BW traffic into the SSH tunnel using the SSH port forwarding functionality. I haven't tried this myself but in theory it may work :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there anybody out there who has done it in the past and could provide some details about the configuration ? <br />
We are using Unix on our servers and Win98/W2k on our clients.<br />
