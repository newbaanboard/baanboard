Log_mesg: WARNING: Running low on memory<br />
<br />
What memory is this message referring to server or client side?<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
I think that refers to the servers memory.<br />
<br />
Remember: A bshell process allways run on the server. The client just gives you a view on it.<br />
<br />
Is it a selfmade Session?<br />
<br />
In this case check how often you do a commit.<br />
<br />
Doing a single commit after updating lots of datas often causes problems because baan (or the DBMS) must store to much transactions during the procedure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">21st May 2002, 01:39</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to check on the memory statistics using -<br />
<br />
<br />
Print memory usage to file and show file being used:<br />
bshcmd6.2 -m -l &lt;bshell_pid&gt;<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
check the swap/system/reserved memory using the <br />
<br />
Glance tools, or top command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">12th June 2002, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">OK<br />
<br />
I've ran some further testing on this problem. On the same server and same Baan system I can run the same update session in four other companies and I do not receive any 'Low on Memory' errors.<br />
<br />
This would indicate to me that system memory/swap space resources are sufficiently set on our server.<br />
<br />
I have confirmed that the session script commits one record at a time there is no large rollback created.<br />
<br />
Is there anything else that you can suggest needs looking at.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
We have the same error by session Update Cost prices (ticpr2220m000) .<br />
The session runs over 3 days and we are getting the error .<br />
<br />
I found some solution suggestions on bgs You can find it in the attached file .<br />
<br />
hope this will help you .<br />
<br />
We haven't solve our problem yet . If you will solve it please let me know. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Caner</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply Caner,<br />
<br />
I too have been given the same documents by BGS<br />
<br />
I don't think our issue is related to memory as we can run the same session in other Baan issues without errors.<br />
<br />

 When a session is running for a long duration of time and it exceeds the process size maintained for the system, it aborts with this error. <br />
Probably you would also have got an error /* Display Server Termination or likes */<br />
<br />
Run a session and monitor the process size using top or similar tools. Compare the size of process when it aborts with the process size maintained<br />
<br />
I guess this should be it......</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had the same problem while running a specific session.<br />
Generate GRP orders).<br />
The session got looping, because some data of one record was not consistent. <br />
After changing the data, the problem had been solved and no error of: running low/out of memory.<br />
Is it possible to do a dbs.log on that session, so that you are able to retrieve the record, which the seesion is trying to update?<br />
Then take a look for the data, if it is correct.<br />
<br />
GN</div></div><hr />
