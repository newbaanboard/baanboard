<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">15th May 2012, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running LN on Unix. I want to send some print files directly to a shared map on a Windows machine in the network. How can I set up a Device in LN to achieve this? If I just use ascii with 'rewrite file' and enter the shared Windows folder (\\...), it gives me an error that it cannot write the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">18th May 2012, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not familiar with LN, but as far as I know, it is not possible for BAAN installed on a UNIX environment to directly put files on a WINDOWS network folder. On the other hand, it could be a permission issue with the target folder that can be fixed by the windows admin.<br />
<br />
In BAAN IVc the way I do this is as follows:<br />
<br />
- in a customized program script, after creating the output file in (for example) /tmp in UNIX, call the server2client() function to transfer the file. This function takes the target file name in the format like \\folder\filename.ext. If for some installation, it does not, it will work with the remote folder mapped to a drive letter.<br />
<br />
- again, in a customized program script, create the set of FTP commands that will ftp the file from the UNIX machine to the windows folder. This, of course, requires the windows folder to be set up appropriately with an IP address - this can be set up by the windows admin. [The ftp script is pretty basic:<br />
<br />
<br />
unset noclobber<br />
(<br />
echo user FTPuserID ftppw<br />
echo ascii<br />
echo cd &quot;remoteFolderInWindows&quot;<br />
echo lcd &quot;/tmp&quot;<br />
echo put &quot;unixOutputFromBAAN.csv&quot;<br />
echo quit<br />
) | ftp -n -i nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn<br />
<br />
<br />
where nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn is the IP address assigned somehow by the admin gurus to the root of the remoteFolderInWindows. The admin gurus also create the FTPuserID and its ftppw. The cd to remoteFolderInWindows is optional if you do not need it - the file will then be 'put' in the root folder by FTP.</div></div><hr />

In somecases we wrote our own device drivers to first convert it to ascii(using ttstpconv) and then run the server2client command.</div></div><hr />
