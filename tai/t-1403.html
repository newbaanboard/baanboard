For now, every 90 days, the password will expire. We have to go to each user station to login as root in order to run inf_admin6.1 to change informix as well as Unix password.<br />

Anyone have similar setup like mine? Any suggestions to let the user able to change their password themselves?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can also look for hints on ora_maint6.1 as it more or less does the same thing as inf_maint6.1. Have a look at this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=705&amp;highlight=%2Amaint6%2A) for more information on how to use ora_maint6.1<br />
<br />
If you want to use the forum's search engine to look for similar posts, use the search string *maint6*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yeoea1</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 05:07</div></div><div class="posttext">btw, can this script able to run with normal user login or still need to login as root?<br />
<br />
srinivas, may I know what is the statement &quot;. /baan/baan4c4/env |** Set ENV &quot; function? <br />
<br />
I am searching for this &quot;env&quot; file in my server since we may have different path. So far I found the file in &quot;/usr/bin/env&quot; not sure whether it is the same file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 05:41</div></div><div class="posttext">It works for normal users also. They can change only their passwords not that of others.<br />
<br />
If in your system the BSE environment is automatically sets in then you need not give this statement (i.e. if your BSE env is set in then $BSE means bse path otherwise system will not be able to recognise $BSE variable). This is not the /usr/bin/env file which I think related to user env settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yeoea1</div><div class="date">22nd March 2002, 09:02</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, I have tested the script after some modification to suit to our need. <br />
<br />
However the &quot;-q&quot; parameter is not a valid parameter for inf_maint6.1. I understand that your script is trying to check whether the informix password is consistent with the Unix password. Since &quot;-q&quot; is not valid, any other ways to accomplish this check?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yeoea1</div><div class="date">19th April 2002, 07:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry this is a bit late but I need help.<br />
<br />
After much testing, I found that the inf_maint6.1 only allow root or informix user to run. It does not allow normal user run. :(<br />
<br />
What can I do to let normal user run the inf_maint6.1 command?<br />
<br />
btw, I m trying to synchonise the password of user key in during the command passwd since users can have typo error when they key in the second time prompt by the script.<br />
<br />
Any help and suggestion is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-c InformixAdminUser -i InformixAdminPassword<br />
<br />
Just make sure that your script is not readable by the users bu only the owner so that they cannot see the Informix admin password.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is because the version I m using is too low? Since the version of inf_maint6.1 I m using do not have the -q parameter as well as the -c and -i :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">19th April 2002, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked on a portingset 6.1c.06.02, maybe older versions did not have this options (we're on oracle).<br />
You can get the inf_maint6.1 from an upper version, backup your current and replace it with the newer, it should work fine (accepting those extra flags) without really upgrading your portingset!</div></div><hr />
