<br />
We're having problem with the import of some of our data, particularly our Contact list, tccom140, with the following error<br />
<br />
30,3,205,,ABC101,,,,,,,,,,,EN,1041914121,0,,0<br />
<br />
and our engineering BOM, tiedm110, with the following error<br />
<br />
30,2,&quot;tuxch021707.06&quot;,&quot;Incorrect record: number of fields or field contents doesn't correspond with ascii file format&quot;,         WBMD1C0001,0303,10,         WBMD1L0001,2,0,0,0,100,,0<br />
<br />
For the latter, we've checked the the engineering BOM tiedm110 table structure but found that indeed we already conform to its structure. So we have no idea what happened.<br />
<br />
Anybody has any clue what happened? Thanks very much<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">21st March 2003, 13:55</div></div><div class="posttext">most prolly one of the field contains a &quot;,&quot; (which you seem to use as delimiter), so the number of fields isn't correct any more.<br />
Try using &quot;|&quot; as delimiter.<br />

<br />
Thanks but the number of fields are correct, no extra comma was present.<br />
<br />
We are just going to use a simple API script to port these data in. I'm sure it will go through using API. There's just something funny with Exchange from time to time, I guess. Have a nice weekend<br />

That might also creat this type of errors</div></div><hr />
