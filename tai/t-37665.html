<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swheat</div><div class="date">19th June 2007, 01:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone,  I am new to Baan.   I am trying to create a data dictionary as a reference to use when I write reports.  I have seen posts from others who have done the same but I am not able to get the results I want.  I know there are reports in Baan I can run but I cant get the info in the format I want - plus this is a good learning experience so I'll put in the extra effort.<br />
I want a report with these columns:<br />
<br />
Table Version<br />
Table Release<br />
Custom (t$cust)<br />
Table Name<br />
Table Description<br />
Field Number<br />
Field Name<br />
Field Description<br />
Field attributions (type, length, etc).<br />
<br />
I want to know how I filter for the most current version/release? Some fields have various releases while others have only one.  For example, for field cisli.srno, rows exist for release B50 and B50U in tttadv422000 but in tttadv140000, rows only exist for release B50.<br />
<br />
My sql (thus far):<br />
<br />
select<br />
adv422.t$vers as &quot;Ver.&quot;,<br />
adv422.t$rele as &quot;Rel.&quot;,<br />
adv422.t$cust as &quot;Cust.&quot;,<br />
adv130.t$cpac || adv130.t$rkey as &quot;Table Name&quot;,<br />
adv130.t$desc as &quot;Table Description&quot;,<br />
adv422.t$fdno as &quot;Field Num&quot;,<br />
adv422.t$fdnm as &quot;Field Name&quot;,<br />
adv140.t$desc as &quot;Field Description&quot;<br />
from tttadv422000 adv422<br />
join tttadv140000 adv140<br />
					on adv422.t$clab = adv140.t$clab<br />
					and adv422.t$cpac=adv140.t$cpac<br />
					and adv422.t$vers = adv140.t$vers<br />
					and adv422.t$rele = adv140.t$rele<br />
					and adv422.t$cust = adv140.t$cust<br />
join tttadv130000 adv130<br />
					on adv422.t$cmod || adv422.t$flno=adv130.t$rkey<br />
					and adv422.t$cpac = adv130.t$cpac<br />
					and adv422.t$vers = adv130.t$vers<br />
					and adv422.t$rele = adv130.t$rele<br />
					and adv422.t$cust = adv130.t$cust<br />
<br />
where adv422.t$cpac = 'ci'   -- select this pkg for testing only<br />
and adv140.t$clan = 2<br />
and adv130.t$clan = 2<br />
and adv130.t$kdes = 3<br />
<br />
order by<br />
adv422.t$vers,adv422.t$rele,adv422.t$cust,adv130.t$cpac, adv130.t$rkey, to_number(adv422.t$fdno,'9999');</div></div><hr />

Packages by Package Combination (ttaad1121m000)<br />
<br />
You can refer to the session Package VRCs (ttadv1511m000) to understand the VRC derivation structure. You can also use - Print Package VRC Derivation Structure (ttadv1414m000)<br />
<br />
To refer the Table Definitions, you can use ttadv4520m000.<br />
<br />
The label pickup algorithms for ttadv130 and ttadv140 can be more complicated SQLs.</div></div><hr />

In this case you don't have to bother about the right versions, because those functions always return the data of the highest VRC in the current package combination.</div></div><hr />
