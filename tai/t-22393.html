<br />
A few days ago, due to some problems our BaaN server went down. We had to restore a few months old SQL backup. But we had current seq. dumps for tables (including Tools company 000 table dumps). Then  we created tables from a that new sequential dump (we first deleted tables - then created the same tables from seq. dump one by one) . Server opened and BaaN worked. But, as we could not delete company 000 tables, we could not restore tools tables. As a result of it, developments (new sessions, domains etc.) we had made for a few months did not work in new condition. My question is how can I restore company 000 tools tables ? <br />
<br />
Urgent reply appreciated !<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as you are locking certain tools tables, if you are logged into Baan, it is safest to load tools tables from the commandline.<br />
<br />
check your help for the bdbpost command. It has lots of nice (?) options and is actually called also by the session you are using.<br />

Firstly I would like to thank for your kind reply. But my OS is NT and using SQL 7.0. I checked the help files for bdbpost6.1 , but there is not any SQL commands for that .exe file? Can not I use bdbpost ?<br />

NAME <br />
bdbpost6.1 - Creates a database table from a sequential dump or<br />
<br />
appends data to an existing database table.<br />
<br />
SYNOPSIS <br />
bdbpost6.1 [-AiklmnRuUvV] [-D seq dir] [-d Dr type] [-e file]<br />
<br />
-t sep] [-x] [-c compnr] [-C range of company no]<br />
-p package_comb] [pattern]<br />
<br />
DESCRIPTION <br />
bdbpost6.1 reads either from its argument or from the standard input and creates a new database table if that table does not exist. It appends data to an existing table if the option 'append' is on. bdbpost6.1 also checks current data dictionary information with the information in the dump, if they do not match it gives an error. If the current data dictionary is not present it creates a data dictionary (e.g. dtimcs/dtimcs023) based on the dump. For each table bdbpost6.1 prints information such as the table name, indexes, the number of records and errors (if any). <br />
<br />
<br />
bdbpost6.1 can be run in the following ways:<br />
<br />
-	Using a sequential dump created by bdbpre6.1. <br />
<br />
  Example:<br />
       on system 1:<br />
             bdbpre6.1 -dbisam -Ntimcs016 -C000-003 &gt; timcs_dump<br />
        on system 2:<br />
             bdbpost6.1 &lt; timcs_dump<br />
<br />
<br />
-	Using sequential dumps (-x or -t option of bdbpre6.1) from other databases. In this case the option -D is mandatory to get the directory name in which .S files are stored. <br />
<br />
  Example:<br />
       bdbpost6.1 -dinformix -t&quot;|&quot; -D./seqdir<br />
       bdbpost6.1 -doracle -x -D./seqdir<br />
        -D : Path for sequential files (.S or .F)<br />
       -t : Separator. If you want to load a sequential dump<br />
            containing separators (e.g. dump from UNIFY has<br />
            separator '|') care should be taken that the file name is<br />
            the table name with extension '.S'.<br />
        For example:<br />
           If you want to load a UNIFY sequential dump into the<br />
           table ttimcs016000, first move the sequential dump to<br />
           the ttimcs directory with name 'ttimcs016000.S'.<br />
           bdbpost6.1 -Dttimcs -t&quot;|&quot; will search for a .S file in<br />
           ttimcs and if that file is found, the corresponding tables<br />
           are created or appended.<br />
         WARNING:<br />
           With the -D option all .S files in that directory are used<br />
           to create/append the tables, so care should be taken to<br />
           remove unwanted .S files before running bdbpost.<br />
         -x: If you want to load a sequential dump with a<br />
            fixed-length record without any separators (.F files, e.g.<br />
            dump from dBASE-III), care should be taken that the file<br />
            name is the table name with the extension '.F'.<br />
         For example:<br />
            If you want to load a dBASE-III sequential dump into the<br />
            timcs016000 table (ORACLE organization).<br />
            bdbpost6.1 -doracle -Ddbase -x will search for an .F file<br />
            in dbase and if that file is found the corresponding table<br />
            is created or appended.<br />
<br />
<br />
In some of the above examples the database driver type is retrieved from $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1. If you want to use a specific database driver for a particular conversion you can use the -d option.<br />
<br />
Database driver can be of the following types:<br />
<br />
-	BAAN Base    (bisam)<br />
	-	BAAN Base TP (btam)<br />
	-	ORACLE         (oracle)<br />
	-	INFORMIX       (informix)<br />
<br />
Enter the name between the brackets, see also at 'bdbpre6.1'.<br />
<br />
The following parameters can be used for bdbpost6.1: <br />
<br />
    -A  : Append to an existing table, if duplicate records exist do<br />
          not overwrite them from the dump. Print duplicate record<br />
          summary at the end. Create table if it does not exist.<br />
    -c  : Company number for which tables will be created.<br />
    -C  : Range of customer numbers for which the bdbpost<br />
          operation should be carried out. This must be the last<br />
          option specified in the command (only pattern may<br />
          occur after this).<br />
    -d  : Database driver type.<br />
    -D  : Directory name for ASCII files to be loaded.<br />
    -e  : File to store names of unsuccessfully created tables.<br />
    -f  : Tables are created by first inserting all rows and then<br />
          creating the indexes (if DBMS supports this).<br />
    -k  : Existing tables are deleted.<br />
    -K  : Existing tables are deleted after a backup is made.<br />
          (if DBMS supports this)<br />
    -l  : Listing of table name(s) in the dump.<br />
    -m  : Disable domain constraints.<br />
    -n  : Ignore referential integrity constraints.<br />
    -R  : Append to an existing table or create a new one, if a<br />
          record already exists, it is replaced by the record in the<br />
          dump. A summary is given at the end.<br />
          Note that only the existence of the primary key will be<br />
          checked. If a primary key exists, the record is replaced.<br />
          When the primary key does not exists, but a secondary key<br />
          exists, error 100 (Duplicate record) occurs.<br />
    -t  : Specify the used separator. Needed while loading an<br />
          ASCII file from another database.<br />
    -u/U: print usage information.<br />
    -v/V: print information about the version of bdbpost.<br />
    -x  : Load ASCII file (.F) with fixed length records.<br />
    -i  : Ignore domain range error and skip record<br />
    -p  : define package combination<br />
    &lt;pattern&gt;: Pattern to specify tables which are filtered out of<br />
               the dump. Wildcards as '*' and '?' are allowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
By using the -f option tables are created faster but a few things should be noted:<br />
<br />
-	Interrupting bdbpost results in table inconsistency.<br />
	-	An index can not be created in case of a duplicate conflict.<br />
	-	For large tables, the adding of indexes can take a long time ( &gt; 15 minutes ). <br />
<br />
 EXAMPLES<br />
    bdbpre6.1 -doracle -Nttadv000 -C000-010 &gt; dump<br />
     bdbpost6.1 -dbisam &lt; dump<br />
        ( Creates (appends) all tables in dump )<br />
     bdbpost6.1 -l &lt; dump<br />
        ( Gives you names of tables in dump )<br />
     bdbpost6.1 -C000-005 &lt; dump<br />
        ( Creates/appends tables only in the given customer range )<br />
     bdbpre6.1 -doracle -Nticom000 -C000-010 &gt; dump<br />
     bdbpost6.1 -C000-005 'ticom*' &lt; dump<br />
        ( Creates/appends tables only in the given customer range<br />
        and where table name matches the pattern 'ticom' )<br />
     bdbpost6.1 -R -C000-005 'ttadv*' &lt; dump<br />
        ( Creates/appends tables only in the given customer range<br />
        and where table name matches the pattern 'ttadv'. If duplicate<br />
        records exist they are replaced by records from the dump )<br />
     Converting from one database organization to another<br />
        bdbpre6.1 -dbisam -Nttadv099 -C000-999 | bdbpost6.1 -doracle<br />
        ( From BAAN Base to ORACLE organization )<br />
     Loading from other databases<br />
        bdbpost6.1 -doracle -Dunify -t&quot;|&quot;<br />
        (UNIFY to ORACLE)<br />
         bdbpost6.1 -Ddbase -x -dbisam<br />
        (dBASE-III to BAAN Base)<br />
<br />
<br />
WARNING If the -d option is not used, the database driver is retrieved from $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1. Furthermore, if a remote driver is specified in tabledef6.1 the database table from the remote machine is used but the data dictionary is taken from the current machine which may cause great difficulties.<br />

<br />
 Recovering corrupted BAAN Base tables<br />
<br />
It may occur that the index of BAAN Base tables is corrupted due to, for instance, a power failure. In most cases only the index is corrupted but not the data itself. The database tools bdbpre6.1 and bdbpost6.1 make it possible to rebuild the corrupt index. This facility is only available for BAAN Base (TP) database organizations.<br />
<br />
The procedure for recovering: <br />
 <br />
<br />
1.	Make a sequential dump of the corrupted table by calling bdbpre6.1 with the option -r. If the -r option is given, only the data file is read and the corrupted index file is ignored. <br />
	2.	Load the sequential dump into the BAAN Base table, using bdbpost6.1. <br />
<br />
   Example:<br />
        bdbpre6.1 -r -dbisam -Ntimcs001 -C000 &gt; dump<br />
        bdbpost6.1 -dbisam &lt; dump</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to restore tools tables (company 000) from &quot;create table from sequential dump&quot; session. I have overwritten all of the tables with the dumps. There was not any serious error. But now all sessions became &quot;subsession&quot; in menu browser and I can not run any session. It all says &quot;activating subsession not possible&quot; ? What is the problem? <br />
<br />
Please urgent help !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 09:06</div></div><div class="posttext">What does &quot;there were no serious errors&quot; mean?<br />
<br />
Your symptons are strange indeed. In my experience dumping all (!) tables fomr 000 and loading them with bdbpost (not from the session) always works.<br />
<br />
You have to be carefull with one thing: It is best to dump the 000 tables as a bigdump without seperators. Especially older portingsets had problems with seperators and company 000, because some of the 000 tables (menu layout, form layout, ..) contain binary data.<br />
<br />
What happens, if you call a session by code, for example tiitm0101m000?<br />
If it works, then your menu is corrupted. If it does not work, then actually something seems to be wrong with your sessions.<br />
<br />
Is this on your production or test system?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zyilmaz</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 09:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Markus,<br />
<br />
Firstly, thank you very much for your interest. <br />
<br />
With &quot;no serious errors&quot;, I mean there were some delete (605) or write (606) errors. I ignored referencial integrity constraints (in session) then I could restore these tables. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I used &quot;|&quot; seperators while dumping tools tables. Is not there something can be done in this situation? <br />
<br />
When I try to call the session by code it says &quot;no permission for ttdskxxxxx&quot;. So it does not call the session by code. <br />
<br />
One more thing, -of course all of these were in test company but I have some valuable develeopments in it, so I would like to restore it- I restored the tables one by one in numerical order. I think there must be a logical order -references etc.- . Can you tell me about logical table order to restore ?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
as mentenioned before, you should have dumped the tools tables into a big dump because your field-seperator (&quot;|&quot;) may occur in a table. If this is the case, reloading the dump will fill the wrong fields and lead to all sorts of unpredictable errors.<br />
This is what I would do if I were you:<br />
get awk onto your NT box<br />
build a file called awkcountf with the following content:<br />
<br />
#----------Start of file<br />
BEGIN{FS=&quot;|}<br />
{ar[NF]=ar[NF]+1}<br />
END{for (i in ar) print i &quot;:&quot; ar[i]}<br />
#---END of file<br />
<br />
control each of the tttxxxyyy000.S file with awk:<br />
awk -f awkcountf tttxxxyyy000.S<br />
You will receive a sum of records with equal number of fields ...<br />
so if you only get one line this means that this file is not corrupted (no &quot;|&quot; occured) ... if you get more counts, the you will have to have a look at this file.<br />

<br />
Norberts advise is a good one. This will show you which sequential file will be wrongly interpreted. <br />
<br />
One question for Norbert: If he knows, which file is &quot;corrupted&quot;. How would he fix it?<br />

<br />
tricky question.<br />
Depending on the size of the file and the number of 'corrupted' records either manually (vi) or a more sophisticated awk script .... I would have to see the file to think about it. <br />
Also it might be possible to create a new dump of the table in question to see whether and to what amount the table has changed ... so that the editoring work could be reduced to a minimum.<br />
But I do think that this could be done.<br />
