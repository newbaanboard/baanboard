<br />
I have a quick question:   When you perform a sequential dump (copy) of a table, it uses a bdb_&quot;command&quot; -- I *think* it's bdb_pre6.1...?<br />
<br />
That being said, does that command &quot;lock the table&quot; why the data is being unloaded?  <br />
<br />
I only ask because the Corp IT Admin kicked off a sequential dump of a sales hist (dpsls050) table which was linked to another table (tdsls041) and after he kicked off this dump, it locked the entire sales dept up (they were entering line items), and they couldn't do anything until his dump completed.<br />
<br />
So I'm just curious.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help on this issue!<br />

Bdbpre locks table, you should use it only when you have no users loged or you can create fatal errors to users and some database corruption. (I've seen it on central invoicing package)</div></div><hr />
