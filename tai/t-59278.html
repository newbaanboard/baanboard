<br />
I want to put a debug object in such way that only under my own baan-login this object is used. And other users still use the default object.<br />
<br />
I remember something about putting the path in some file which Baan creates during changing paths for objects. But don't know details anymore.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
regards, baldie</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fd file modification is i guess nice option.<br />

<br />
I think this is the best solution for debug for single user. Try to edit the file similar as $BSE/lib/fd6.1.&lt;package combo&gt; and copy the original line to make the changes similar as {TestUser}otd:/tmp:${BSE}/application/tdB40_c4â€¦<br />
<br />
Make sure you add this line above the original one as this file's priority is from top to bottom.<br />
<br />
Next, just put the debugging object under the folder /tmp and the debugging mode is only for the TestUser.<br />
<br />
I remember there is a manual regarding to this but just could not locate it now. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
