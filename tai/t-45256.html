1. We took the back-up of the data using ttaad4226m000 (Create sequential dump of table)<br />
2. We installed weekly(tools) and monthly(application) patches of july, aug, sep, oct at a time. We followed all Pre and Post Installation instructions which are mainly compile labels, convert to runtime for tools and running correction programs.<br />
3. We reloaded the back-up of the data using ttaad4227m000 (Create table from sequential dump).<br />
4. In all companies, for most of the sessions, we are getting the error 'Error 512 Corrupted Data Dictionary' while opening the sessions.<br />
<br />
Can anyone pl suggest what to do to solve this error? <br />
Many Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but I am a little bit confused now. That you back-up the data I can understand but why reloaded them again as far as I know the data is still there so you don't have to reload the data anymore.<br />

Is it wrong?</div></div><hr />
