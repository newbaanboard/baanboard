Currently our company using ERP LN with certain number of concurrent user.<br />
We have one company (say company code: 888), if we want to make a new company within our existing server (say new company code: 777), do we need to buy a new license? <br />
<br />
I got the email from one of Infor Sales that if company 777 is not 888's subsidiaries, than we will need a license.<br />
<br />
I thought as long as it is in one server and owned by the same owner, we can use our LN license. Creating a new company code will no need for addtional license. CMIIW.<br />
Or is it possible to have multiple license in one server with only one environment?:confused:<br />
<br />
Fyi: both 888 and 777 is owned by the same person.<br />
Both 888 and 777 will be place in one server, one database and even operate with the same user. Both comapny will be live.<br />
<br />
I'm an IT, do know much about legal matter.<br />
<br />
Any advise of reference will be highty appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards, yenrysugi</div></div><hr />

If however legal entity behind new company is not covered in sla then u have to either buy new licences or assign some of existing licenses paying infor assignmt fees.</div></div><hr />
