<br />
Recently, I need in BaaN Live system to upgrade related patch, the upgrade involves 2 table modifications,3 session increases,a kernel_032 update, add a report. We already passed in the BAAN test system confirmation, but I do not know how to safely upgrade the system in Live BaaN.<br />
<br />
I want to do a backup at first, in the case of an accident, it can be restored to its original. But actually I do not have the operating manual , i don't know how to do a patch backup.	<br />
<br />
Could you give me some detield instruction?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">16th August 2013, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">you can &quot;Refresh&quot; your Test environment with components and db from Prod. In case something happens you have the same exact environment. When applying patches, those are delivered in PMC solutions that you can back out anytime once installed. I also suggest to have a team of &quot;core&quot; users to verify the changed functionalities. Good luck.</div></div><hr />
