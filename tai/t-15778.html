<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">positive</div><div class="date">26th June 2004, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We have the following environment:<br />
<br />
Baan Server (machine name 'baan'):<br />
OS: Windows 2000 server<br />
BaanIVc4 <br />
porting set 6.1c.06.03<br />
BSE: d:\Baan4c4<br />
<br />
Remote Server (machine name 'remote'):<br />
OS: Windows 2000 server/Windows 2000 Professional<br />
BaanIVc4 <br />
porting set 6.1c.06.03<br />
BSE: c:\Baan4c4<br />
<br />
We try to connect the Baan server via the Remote server using a Remote bshell.<br />
<br />
We already have the Baan user (ubaan) on the server<br />
The database user also exists<br />
We created the remote user and converted it to runtime (rbaan)<br />
We moved this rbaan file to $BSE\lib\user of Remote Server<br />
We set the BSE_REM on the Remote server to 'remote' (i.e. Remote server name)<br />
We created a bwc on the remote server with the following config:<br />
hostname: remote<br />
connect as: baan<br />
pwd: baan999 (this is the password used for the database as well as remote user)<br />
BSE: As on remote server i.e. c:\Baan4c4<br />
<br />
The ubaan file exists on the Baan Server.<br />
The Baan server as well as Remote Server contain the OS login baan with the pwd baan999. On both machines baan belongs to the administrator group.<br />
<br />
Now we run the rbaan.bwc on the Remote Server BECS client and we get the following error:<br />
Not authorized to run as user 'baan'<br />
Windows Sockets error 10053<br />
Connection with server broken<br />
<br />
We do not have any change in the network setup. We have done this in the past and it was working.<br />
The regular ubaan (non-Remote shell mode) login works fine.<br />
<br />
We also checked the Event Viewer on Remote Server and noticed the following errors:<br />

We do not know why does it look for the hostname REMOTE in the rbaan file?  The rbaan file generated by Baan tools has only the following information:<br />
<br />
baan d:\baan4c4 &lt;encrypted password&gt;<br />
<br />
We tried adding a REMOTE host entry in the rbaan. As expected it did not work. It got a timeout error while trying to connect/locate the server.<br />
<br />
We have seen the other threads related to 10053 and none of these help since this was working in the past with the same setup and there is no change in the network.<br />

Is that a typo? <br />
<br />
BSE_REM on &quot;Remote&quot; should be &quot;Baan&quot;<br />

shouldn't this be:<br />

<br />
I tried BSE_REM as baan and yet it does not work. When BSE_REM=baan it gives the error 'Error 1 Unknown err'<br />
<br />
Klaas,<br />
I have tried small cases and that too does not work.<br />
With regards the to the \ and / slashes, how do you get that setup? This error message is displayed in the Event Viewer so I am not sure where does it pick this from. Do you have any suggestions?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">positive</div><div class="date">28th June 2004, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked the session. It has only one entry with the following values:<br />
System Name: baan (all small case)<br />
BSE Path: d:\baan4c4 (all small case)<br />
Work station: not checked/false<br />
Local Print: not checked/false<br />
<br />
So there is nothing to change in this session, I guess? Any more suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
<br />
Remote user file (r file) does not have to be moved to remote server . It contains references to the remote system. IT must remain in baan server.In remote server separate remote user file (r file ) has to be created. <br />
<br />
Further on remote server also there should be user file (u file )  if BSE_REM is not set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">positive</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 09:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The remote machine and the baan server clocks were not in sync.<br />
The rbaan file was kept only on the remote server (not checked if keeping on the baan server would create a problem or not)<br />
The BSE_REM was made to point to baan server and not the remote server.<br />
The ubaan file should not be kept on the remote server. It should be only on the baan server. (maybe Hitesh's is right that if BSE_REM is not set then ubaan should be kept on the remote server but we have not tried this).<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for your time and suggestions. <br />
