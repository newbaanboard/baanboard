<br />
I have recently inherited the administration of a Baan system, my understanding is that it is LN/Baan 5.<br />
I can manage most operational tasks in the system, but am struggling to add Roles to existing Employees.<br />
The Roles have been configured for many years, as have the Employees, so both should be good to go. <br />
However, when I have added a Role to an Employee, such as Price Maintenance, the user does not see the 'new' role when they log into Baan.<br />
Are there some further steps that I need to take to make the newly added roles available to the user?<br />
<br />
Thank you :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">2022newbaan</div><div class="date">2nd December 2022, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply. I'm afraid I am not familiar with desktop regeneration. This is certainly not something that I have seen within Baan or any handover notes that I have received</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd December 2022, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Well never done it myself either - but in 4c4 I run tgbrg4100m000, I would select our project model, then click on employees.  Once the screen comes up I could select employee and then click on generate users.  When they screen comes up I generate a single user or a user range.  Then just fill in generate company permissions.<br />
<br />
Note - I have never done this and I do not if your version is the same or not.  Our baan 4 system is basically read only.  The person who maintained these retired several years ago.  So me and some others have to wing a few things from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">2nd December 2022, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan 5 and later don't require the desktop generation (at least I think it starts in Baan 5).  Really not sure why the new process wouldn't show up on their desktop when you add it to the employee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd December 2022, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">That is interesting - no convert to runtime or anything?  Fancy baan 5 and LN. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">2022newbaan</div><div class="date">5th December 2022, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks for the replies. <br />
The roles seemed to magically appear with the user after a few days even though I had them log out and back in many times.<br />
Another one of the mysteries of Baan...</div></div><hr />

I'm having the problems on inserting additional session/module in user authorization.<br />
Could anyone help me?<br />
<br />
tq in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th December 2022, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Start you own thread and provide more details.  What sessions are you running and such.  It appears LN is different that 4c4 - I just add permission and do CRDD for the user.  And for dem flows I add a role and regen desktop.</div></div><hr />
