<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redwards</div><div class="date">16th August 2002, 23:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a quirky little problem with Baan menus that I can't figure out. I've been spinning my wheels for the last hour and have exhausted my knowledge on this.<br />
 <br />
Anyway, I'm trying to copy a menu structure in the dev package combination from tccom001002f to tccom007002f but it keeps telling me that tccom007002f already exists even though I've deleted all of the menus associated with that including 002f-1, 002f-2 and 002f-3. I've dumped the menus, created runtime DD etc. but the copy still won't go through. When I log in under that menu, it still shows the old menus so I know it's still there but I can't for the life of me figure out why it's still sticking around.<br />
<br />
Also, if I change a menu in dev, change to my tst package and copy it over, it says it already exists and then offers to overwrite it. When I do the same thing from tst to liv package, it just tells me it already exists and doesn't offer the overwrite capability.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
