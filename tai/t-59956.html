I have a question regarding decimal and thousand sign.<br />
<br />
My customer has two companies. In both the companies the software language must be English: labels, forms and reports must appear in English for the company users.<br />
<br />
My problem is: for one company, users must have &quot;.&quot; as decimal sign and &quot;,&quot; as thousand sign, while for the other company users must have &quot;,&quot; as decimal sign and &quot;.&quot; as thousand sign. <br />
<br />
Since decimal and thousand signs are specified on software language, this is a problem.<br />
<br />
Users of the two companies are different: they belong to the same system, but if an user works on a company does not work on the other: there is no overlapping.<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility to implement this avoiding to create a new language and copying all the language-dependent software component to the new language? <br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Luca</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes it is possible but not with the baan standard.<br />
<br />
We had this issue once with an system running in us and mexico.<br />
<br />
It was not only confusing but also dangerous e.g. cheque documents.<br />
<br />
The solution works as follows (unix tru64, baan iv):<br />
<br />
There are 2 datecurr files on the system. One is original for your settings for language &quot;2&quot; named &quot;datecurruk&quot;, the second is modified (e.g. datcurrus) where the thousand and decimal sign is changed.<br />
<br />
Within a login script a text file containing the &quot;special&quot; users is checked. If the user is e.g. us company, then the current datecurr file is replaced on os level with one of the source datecurr files (either datecurruk or datecurrus).<br />
<br />
This avoids having a special us englisch language.<br />
<br />
One possible risk could be that the copy process is not 100 % stable, but we never had this issue with this system.<br />
