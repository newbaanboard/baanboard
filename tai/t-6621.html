wot can b the possible reason for this. and how can it b solved....<br />
any suggestion...</div></div><hr />

in the file DiskAccess you can see if the normal user gets error 13 (permission problem on disk files) or not.<br />
<br />
If not, then did you convert the session to RDD (ttadv5210m000)<br />
Did you make the new session (in a new module) so that in the $BSE/application there are files (or directories) with ownership root?<br />
ls -altrR ${BSE}/application/* | grep root<br />
If so you should run the command<br />
chown -R bsp:bsp ${BSE}/application/*</div></div><hr />

<br />
The usage of unix user root is not recommended for Baan.<br />
If you generate logs and Baan starts a new logfile with this user,<br />
then this will also belong to root and the next user can not write it and so on.<br />
<br />
Just don't do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">10th September 2002, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I definitly agree on that. User root is for OS system maintenance only.<br />
<br />
But what I meant was to make it visible where what things go wrong if you do things like that. Within Baan user root equals permission problems. Once you understand what goes wrong and why, you will not do it again. Once you have been told, you still must have trust in the one who tells you.<br />
<br />
In my practice as a father I learned that it is only of little use to just forbid things. When you explain why they are not allowed to do things, they will tend to be more obedient.<br />
<br />
There may also be other things except for permission issues, but I addressed that too, I think.</div></div><hr />

 starting/stopping Baan<br />
 (re)-License Baan<br />
<br />
Any other tasks should be performed by either the generic super user 'bsp' or as any other user. <br />
<br />
A consistent working practice will not get you into file permission problems as you have now.</div></div><hr />

I got ur point and thanx for valuable suggestions. i have changed my working attitude. now i work through bsp. but i still unable to understand y is it happening so. earlier when i used to work with user root it work was visible to every user. now when i work with user root the files created by root are not having permission to other groups.(only to creater and group). and root is of sys group so any user from bsp group cannot execute any of the object created by root. y is it so...</div></div><hr />

Have you changed the umask for user 'root'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GAURAVGUPTA9</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">wot is this umask of root. i didn't change that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suggest you do some research on what the 'umask' is and how it affects file permissions. Here's a good pointer:<br />
<br />
http://unix.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-cmd-umask.htm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">You  might want to check to see if the default permissions set for root allows read access by other groups.  This default is set by Unix and can be changed by using the umask command, but if you ever do a switch user (su command) to root without reading root's .profile (su vrs su -), the system default permissions for root<br />
will be used.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />

OmeLuuk:... Did you make the new session (in a new module) so that in the $BSE/application there are files (or directories) with ownership root?...(see above)<br />
It could be that your session started in a new module (or even package) that caused a new directory to be made in the $BSE/application that had root permission where the objects themselves are bsp:bsp readable?</div></div><hr />
