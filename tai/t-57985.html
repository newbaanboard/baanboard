<br />
The common solution for the maintenance of those files IS to just delete them periodically.<br />
<br />
Do you have some specific logs that you're referring to that are outside of that range? like dbs.log or bshell.#### that's growing large?<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
as Dave said, these files are needed by the application.<br />
LOG files are stored by standard in $BSE/log<br />
TMP files are handles in $BSE/tmp<br />
<br />
Write a scheduled script to remove all tmp* older than e.g. 8 days.<br />
<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
a commandline utility (25,00 $) delete.exe will do.<br />
You're on windows ?<br />
<br />
DELETE.EXE is a Win32 console application that deletes files. Win32Console application means that it runs in a Windows 98, ME, 2000, or XP command prompt. It is an improvment over the DEL or ERASE internal command that comes with the operating system. Delete's features include: * allows multiple file specifications on the command line; * optionally deletes Hidden, System, or Read Only files; * optionally prompts for permission to delete any file; * optionally deletes files in directories below the current one; * optionally removes empty directories below the current one; * optionally overwrites files before deleting them; and * optionally deletes only files dated before, after, or between dates. * optionally deletes only zero length files. * optionally deletes only files that are not present in a reference directory (useful for mirroring a directory structure when used with Xcopy). DEL16.exe is the old DOS version of this program that runs under pure DOS, and can't see long file names.<br />
<br />
e.g. delete /S /D10 c:\temp\*.tmp will delete all file older than 10 days.<br />
<br />
Have a look at : http://www.simtel.net/product/view/id/59653<br />
<br />
On unix do it by cron like :<br />
<br />
40 21 * * 1-6   find /daten/tmp -name &quot;tmp*&quot; -mtime +14 -exec rm -f {} \;<br />
<br />
OR :<br />
<br />
Windows powershell :<br />
<br />
$now = get-date get-childitem . -recurse | where-object {($now - $_.LastWriteTime).Days -gt 30} | remove-item<br />
<br />
<br />
Only examples, you have to modify to achieve your requirement.<br />
<br />
