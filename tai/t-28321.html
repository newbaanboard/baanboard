Nowadays we occasionally get this message. In order to  solve this problem we improved program to kill mongol processes. But this is not enough. If we apply licmon6.1 -k and <br />
licd6.1. I wonder that does it affect user who currently use system ? AFAIK I doesn't affect the user who currenyly use the system but it effects only users who try to login . Beacuse they couldn't login because of licence engine restart. I know olny this effect. Is that true ? . In fact , we should get addtional licences. OR How can hadle this problem in Baan IV ? <br />
<br />
Thanks All for your comments...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Despite of this it is not recommendable to restart the licence daemon to free licences, in fact, you are using more licences than you paid for and therefore this is not legal.  If Infor would find out, ( currently a lot of customers are audited by Slams.uk ) you will have an major issue.<br />
Despite of the fact that it is technical possible to restart the licence daemon and free licences it is not legal, the only legal way is to buy additional licences or check the Baan usaga internal ( do users really work in Baan or do the same users use multiple licences ).<br />

If the already logged in user is idle for some time after you restart the licence deamon, then this user doesn't use the licence.  When he starts a new session, at that time the system will check for available licence.  No if there are no more licences available, this user will also get the licence avalilable message.</div></div><hr />

Thanks All for your comments...<br />

I actually understand your question in such a way, that you kill zombie processes and want to free the licenses bound by them. This is naturally not illegal, but quite ok.<br />
<br />
In the recent portingsets you can use the &quot;licmon6.1 -c&quot; option to clear all licenses of processes, which do not exist anymore. If you have several application servers, then you need to execute this on each of them.<br />
<br />
If you do not want to upgrade to a newer portingsets, then it is most likely enough to swap the licd6.1 and licmon6.1 binaries.<br />
