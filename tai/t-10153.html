<br />
I want to make easily way to change the company number after copy company instead to use the tfgld9xxxm000 sessions. <br />
The process of changing the company number taking a lot of time using the tfgld9xxxm000 and fill the Informix logs and data files, especially the tfgld tables.<br />
<br />
1. Can I use a script to replace the &quot;old&quot; company number string to &quot;new&quot; on selected files with separator?<br />
<br />
2. Is there any available script to do that?<br />
<br />
3. Do I have to run the tfgld9xxxm000 sessions after loading the &quot;fixed&quot; tables files?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Kereni</div></div><hr />

<br />
as always, I recommend to use awk.<br />
You will have to do the work though to identify the fieldnumbers of the fields that are populated with the company number.<br />
This is the hard work.<br />
Once you know the tables and their fields, it will be very easy to write a script that changes all these fields.<br />
It will even be possible to write a script that scans the dd-files to determine tablefields that contain company-numbers.  <br />
With grep -l tcncmp * in the $dict/dtfgld I find that 39 files might contain companynumbers - so it seems advisable to automate the process.<br />
If you want to start on this one and need help, email me <br />

<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as I have a bit more time, I will upload a script that, for BaanIV, does exactly what you require.  It scans the dd, dumps and fixes the necessary files, and posts them to the new company.  The version I have only works for single-single companies at present, but does this very well.<br />
