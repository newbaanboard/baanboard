DTS, ETL Handler etc are these available in 5.0b? Does Openworld provide any possibility of integration with 3rd party DW tools?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exchange scheme are prospective ETL tools. As long as a datawarehousing application can read in ASCII files, xchange schemes can functiona as the perfect ETLs.<br />
<br />
Baan itself has something called Decision Manager, which is fading out. SSA is working with Cognos to come up with a Datawarehousing solution using exchange scheme.<br />

<br />
Baan Exchange may help in ETL but only in E part. If you're building a data warehouse across multiple software then for sure you need something to do the transforming before loading<br />
If time is of the essence, then you might wanna wait for the ready-made solution SSA is working with Cognos. But if not, then you can buy a specialised ETL software (more expensive alternative) or create your own ETL tool (more economic alternative). Building data warehousing itself shouldn't be an expensive exercise. However, you might wanna get a good, ready-made BI (Business Intelligence) software to run on top of the data warehouse once it's done to greatly increase its ease of use<br />
