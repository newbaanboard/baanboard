<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">telgar</div><div class="date">3rd April 2002, 23:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I am creating a new users document, explaining what the buttons and dropdown menus do inside of the sessions.  In IVc2 we have a dropdown menu called 'Workflow', what is under here?  I have not found a session where it is activated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">4th April 2002, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">The Menu is used when you are using the Workflow facility of Baan: You model business processes within DEM, and the sessions within those processes are presented to the users in the right order by some sort of scheduling system.<br />
<br />
So, the Menu gets activated only if the session is called from the workflow client.<br />
<br />
The whole functionality is more or less alpha software in Baan IVc2. I do not know if in any higher versions the workflow facility of Baan software is mature enough to be used in a production system.<br />
