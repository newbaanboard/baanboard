<br />
I've been able, from my PC, to log on as that user and send a report from Print Production Orders session to the printer.  I cannot log onto their PC as their user or me and do the same.  When i do this the request sits at a Premature status in the Device queue.  I never see the request show up in the Windows driver printer queue.  I thought maybe it had something to do with the Baan client but we're both running the same one.  Baan is running in a Windows environment too.  The printer in question is also the default printer on the PC.<br />
<br />
any help would be great!!</div></div><hr />
