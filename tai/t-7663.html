<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to describe a probem we have with ttaad4100 session in Baan IVc4. One of our customized tables has the record size over 1000 bytes. The table can be opened in ttadv4100 in normal way. Then we want to modify one field for a group of records - option 5 (modify record). A form to select a field appears, which shows field name, element #, start position and end position. Start and end positions fields have only 3 digits, so when we try to select a field with start position &gt; 1000, an error message apperas. More, if we select a string field, cursor goes to start position and system does not accept any input. So it is not possible to use that option for string fields with star position &gt; 1000.<br />
<br />
We have also a Baan V environment, where the problem is corrected.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know, if there is a correction for BaaN IV available?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can issue command right at database level. For example on SQL Server, you can issue this at its Query Analyzer:<br />
UPDATE table_name<br />
SET table_name.field=value<br />
WHERE conditions<br />
The command might differ from one database to another. As in case of modifying through GTM, pay very serious attention on what you are modifying. Be very very careful. Test the command. Back up associated tables first if you're not absolutely sure of what you're doing<br />
