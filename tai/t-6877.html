1.<br />
which step in the installation procedure creates Software Components under corresponding file folder. <br />
2.<br />
Which mechanism does PMC create the components? Cause now we installed same product (such as Baan Dimension, Baan Cable)and its SPs based on different standard Baan IVc4 sps. one is based on BaanIVc4+sp8; one is on BaanIVc4+sp10. But we found the components are different. For example:<br />
m600 based on BaanIVc4+sp8 <br />
m610 based on BaanIVc4+sp10<br />
File folder cpB40C_c4_m600 is empty, however, file folder cpB40C_c4_m600 has severl subfolders(tcprmp2;mcprmp2;mcprpd2)<br />
<br />
In my opinion, we have just installed same product based on different baan standard SPs, the components in these two file folder should also be the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you do a create runtime Data Dictionary??<br />
Do the Pack_Comb have both VRC's?<br />
The cpB40C_c4_m600 and _m610 are VRC's i suppose?<br />
And _m600 has no files and _m610 has files?<br />
