<br />
then the only thing you need to do now is to launch a Reorganize Table and Domain ttaad4225m000 for all Companies and Tables -- in an open range-- with all users disconnected which means blocking the bshell.<br />
<br />
Since I see that they are almost all Finance sessions, the consultants MUST carry out consistent tests on the most important sessions and make sure everything is OK.<br />
<br />
Do not move in Production without testing ! and most important DO a full backup of your servers before any change.<br />
cheers.</div></div><hr />
