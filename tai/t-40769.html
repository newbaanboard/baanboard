The requirement is to switch from the current package combination to some other package combination and create records in that package combination. only super user has got the rights to access all the package combination so we can use Switch.to.company() but normal user cannot use the function.Can a normal user be given rights to access more than one Package combination? Or is there any other solution to meet the requirement.</div></div><hr />

If the normal user has development capabilities and has been given access for instance to td and ti for all modules, then the user can change current package.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At any point of time, a user can access only the package combination that is linked to its ID in maintain user data and the tools package combination (to access 000 company).<br />
<br />
Can a normal user be given rights to access more than one Package combination? Or is there any other solution to meet the requirement.<br />
<br />
1. If the user doesnt have authorization to session &quot;Change Company&quot; (ttdsk2003m000), then he wont be able to access any company other than default one directly.<br />
2. Also, if the User doesnt have company authorization to access a perticular company, he will get a message no authorization.<br />
