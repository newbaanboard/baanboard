<br />
I use crons to start the jobs.  I can see in the unix cron log that the job started at 10PM last night.<br />
<br />
Right after it started there is another message line in the log that ends with rc=127.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what this means?</div></div><hr />

If you want to diagnose *why* it failed you will need to examine the $BSE/log/log* files.</div></div><hr />
