<br />
I was installing a patch and turns out that the patch was corrupted.<br />
The installation is half done and fails at one point giving error &quot;Solution ******* cannot be installed in update VRC&quot;.<br />
I want to disconnect the patch from session ttpmc2102m000.<br />
I changed the status of all the solutions in the update VRC to available through GTM.<br />
Also in installation runs Ive changed the status to ready.<br />
But Im un able to disconnect the patch.<br />
In the session process patches the status is still installing.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">21st January 2016, 03:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually in such cases, When you enter the Process Solutions Session, the system asks &quot;Installation is in progress,Do you want to continue?(Y/N)&quot; and in such cases if you say yes the process is restarted from where it has been left of.Do You face such question?<br />
<br />
When i faced the similar Issue, and again after continuing the process of Installation the system hangs, i deleted the Solution in Process Solution from GTM. In this case you might need to check what dependencies the Solution entails and uninstall every Solution dependent on this and delete from GTM.<br />
<br />
What system is it Test or Live? Would suggest to go ahead with Solution deletion in case of Test System.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st January 2016, 08:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Better to look in the log files, for example log.iex1288. That may give the clue why it fails. Solve the root cause and restart the installation.<br />
If you really want to go forward with hacking the tables: look also at the status of the patch itself and in the installation run you need to set the busy field to 'no' as well.</div></div><hr />

The reason for error was that pmc could not save components needed for deinstallation. When I unchecked option &quot;Save components&quot; I was able to install solution. But, if you do so it will be not possible to uninstall this solution.</div></div><hr />
