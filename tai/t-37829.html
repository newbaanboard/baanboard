<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">So i installed ERP Ln 6.1 FP3 on a test server and according to the documentation(Technical Notes - Enterprise Server 8.3), i was told that(after installation) in the session Maintain Companies {ttaad1100m000} the company 050 would indicate that it needs upgrade and which is wrong as its a fresh installation. To get around this the document suggests to run session Data Upgrade Engine {ttspt1200m000}. Now the problem is after running it and restarting i still find the upgrade needed checkbox still checked... and each session i open, it throws a message &quot;This company(50) should not be used because it needs a data upgrade&quot;...<br />
 <br />
How can i fix this? <br />

Cleared it and ran the process and the checkbox &quot;Upgrade Needed&quot; in Maintain Companies got cleared as well...<br />
