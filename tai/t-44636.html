     Please check the following problem of webtop<br />
<br />
Problem <br />
<br />
We are not able to use baan webtop. The first screen (Menu) is coming up properly but after that the response of the application is so slow that every session to open itself takes more than 5 minutes.<br />
After one click, we have to wait for 5 minutes to go to next click, so it is impossible to work with the application.<br />
<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
We are using SSA Baan erp 5.0c with SP15 (On Unix server with oracle), we are using baan worktop also and both this application is working fine as of now.<br />
We have installed baan webtop version 4.1 build KA0150 on windows server and configured to work with baan erp 5.0c<br />
<br />
The response of this application is so slow that we are never able to make this live, we are testing only with 1 user and still the response of the application is very slow.<br />
<br />
We are using tomcat web server and we have done default configuration.<br />
We are using internet explorer to check it, we have tried it on IE 6 and IE 7 and both the PCÂ’s the response is very slow.<br />
<br />
Awaiting for your reply ASAP<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

If at any point you would need to get the support from Infor, i suggest you move to Webtop 8.2. That would be the first thing they would tell you to do when you contact them. Moreover there seems to be much improvement(so they say) in the latest edition... <br />
Coming to your problem, did you run the &quot;Online Form Cache Initialization&quot; from the webtop admin? Try it out if you havent, should improve the speed at which sessions open...<br />

 <br />
Been there myself...sometimes you need to remind them about the case..Do not be misled about the 365 days support as you still got to sitout saturday and sundays..<br />
 <br />
The above.. by no means is to diss anyone...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">19th November 2007, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">For the Infor Webtop to start any session it needs to convert the form definitions into a format that it recognizes. This is the reason why it takes time when opening any session in Webtop. The delay can be reduced by doing this conversion process(Online Form Cache Inititalization) before-hand. It creates the form definitions in an xml format inside a pre-defined folder(set during the conversion process) for all the packages in the range provided(at the time of executing this process) of the same package combination the user(baan user login) belongs to.<br />
