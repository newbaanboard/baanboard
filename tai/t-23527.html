Is there any setting somewhere which determines after how much time of inactivity bshell should go in sleep mode ? <br />
<br />
<br />
We are on Baan 5 b , Tools Porting Set 7.1c <br />

<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

...like screensaver? You have to solve this with the screensaver of the client pc. If you are using ASCII Terminal eumulation, you can set the time out seconds in the user management (not for GUI).<br />

You may set the resource variable in $BSE/lib/defaults/bshell file.<br />
Add the following line to this file:<br />
<br />
session_timeout:20<br />
<br />
After inactivity period (20sec in this sample) connection to bshell will be lost.<br />
<br />

<br />
the unit for the session_timeout variable is minute and not second.<br />

the license.. is that what you are looking for? <br />
<br />
If you want a resource to tell the bshell to &quot;sleep&quot; in the process <br />
state, that's not available.<br />

Yes, you absolutely right, but I do not understand benefit of &quot;sleep mode&quot;...<br />

<br />
Thanks for your replies !<br />
<br />
Actually i  want to stop bshell to go in sleep mode . I will try to explain the problem  below .<br />
<br />
 we are  trying to send data to an external system using  Net List (OW) Script (Baan 3 GL) . Sometimes during network transfer system hangs . In Such situation , we have to get back the control back to Baan 3GL script . For this , we have set a timeout . This   works ok in case data is less . When Data volume is huge , bshell goes in sleep mode and control does not return to baan unless we start some session or do some activity in the same bshell .<br />
<br />
Another work around we are trying to start another 3GL in background to keep bshell awake . <br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance for your help/suggestions/comments</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although - i've seen in some cases that changing your ora_timeout to a a lower value will help with the problem - but that's usually when the bshell falls asleep waiting for the DB to return something..<br />
<br />
you could run a kill -CONT &lt;pid&gt; in a loop as well. or your other workarounds are equally as good. <br />
