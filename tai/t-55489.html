<br />
Since you are on the same Version, going to a new release usually has some conversion programs to go to the next release.  4c4 was the service pack release for you.  Over the last several years, service packs became releases and the stoped incrementing the service pack number 4cX.  So you need to review each service pack for new functionality and decide to install each service pack and run the conversion programs supplied.  Or export and import the data into the new table structures and initialize any new fields and turn on new functions.<br />
<br />
You could do a test and add the 4c4 VRC's and simply change the package combination and see what problems develope during a system test.  It may be more cost affective. <br />
<br />
I would come up to the latest porting sets as there are some new web enablement features, webtop, and webhelp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rwnido</div><div class="date">21st April 2009, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Boss is there any support for BaaN 4c3 in any latest version of Webtop? or is there any browser base client available for BaaN 4c3?<br />
<br />
Thanx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">21st April 2009, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my thoughts, but I have not tried it.  You should be able to update the porting set which includes the binaries and a new tools version.  Your forms would have to be converted to dynamic forms.  Then you should be able to use the Baan IV version of webtop.  <br />
<br />
Again, these are just my thoughts.  I would like to hear comment from anyone who has updated anyversion of Baan IV and is using webtop.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">21st April 2009, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a customer who is on Baan IVc4, SP 16 or 17, using Webtop.  No major issues.  I know Webtop is not officially supported on IVc3, but I am not sure if that's due to a technical issue or they just don't want to support lower than IVc4.<br />
