<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">11th October 2006, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Dear Friends,   AFAIK when we run reconfig for one table from Baan,(ttadv5215s000) it runs reconfig for all tables that take places in ttadv500,ttadv501,ttadv502,ttadv503. My aim is to run reconfig only for one table. It shouldn't take into datas in that tables consideration.<br />
One way is to delete other datas from 500s tables for the package combination.But this is not good way. I saw something in Baan Solution number 453. <br />
<br />
# bdbreconfig6.1 -Ntimcs016 -C100<br />
Reconfigures timcs016 for company 100. <br />
<br />
Does this commands provide my need ? I am not sure about it? OR this commands do same thing in (table reconfig-&gt;ttadv5215s000) and except not for all tables. <br />
<br />
THanks All !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">16th October 2006, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Why don't you just use form ttadv5210m000 (for data dict changes) or ttadv5214m000 (for forms and menus) instead?<br />
<br />
The difference between the sessions called &quot;convert to&quot; and &quot;create runtime&quot; in baan is usually, that the &quot;convert&quot; sessions look up the runtime indicators, while the &quot;create&quot; sessions just convert what you specify.<br />
<br />
But I am not a hardcore developer, so I might not 100% correct here!<br />

When I choice this option it reconfig all tables that take place in ttadv500-504 for my current pack. Is there any difference in working methods of convert RDD and yours ?<br />

Sorry, where is a reconfig choice?</div></div><hr />

Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">16th October 2006, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to tick the &quot;reconfigure tables&quot; option, otherwise it will not chnage even the one table you want to change.<br />
<br />
How is it behaving, if you limit the range of tables accordingly? Is it still first reconfiguring all tables, which are listed in the ttadv5xx tables?<br />
<br />
In that case, I fear you have to delete the &quot;not wanted&quot; entries in ttadv5XX. You can honestly do this without much risk. Whenever I come to a customer site with a doubtfull &quot;runtime state&quot;, I delete all runtime indicators and let a full &quot;create runtime&quot; run. The &quot;create runtime&quot; will then compare the data dictionary description in the tools tables with the runtime files in the dict directory and reconfigure only the changed tables. Obviously we doa backup before such an operation.<br />
<br />
I do not think calling bdbreconfig directly will help you. If I am not mistaken, tzhe bdbreconfig assumes a dict file with a &quot;.new&quot; ending and will then convert accordingly. But the new dictfile must first be created by one of the &quot;create/convert&quot; runtime sessions.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope, I could help you at all with my comments and did not make things more complicated, then they are! If you want to, I can also transfer your thread to the development forum, which might be able to help you. Please do not startz a second thread by yourself though.</div></div><hr />

e <br />
Is that true ? or it reconfig all tables in ttads501-504. May be I can test it but I am not sure about command above .I hope  Someone knows it !<br />

<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">16th October 2006, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">One remark about the session &quot;convert to runtime&quot;. <br />
If you modify or create a table and that there are new table relations for some fields, then in the tables listed in ttadv50x, you should not only find your table but also the related tables because some information therein must also be updated. <br />
This is the reason why we do mostly the convert on all the ranges, when all changes are ready. <br />
<br />
For your problem I don't see any other solution than to remove the modifications that you don't want.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">16th October 2006, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right ! But Someone who do these operaitons should know details of it . That's why I know that this table is not related with other tables and I want to run reconfig that doesn't effect or run other tables that need reconfig. May be those owns to my colleague's tables. It is not my business. Do you understand what I mean . My case is reason of this . In fact it is important for big Baan Client. There are thousands of tables. If I run reconfig ,<br />
it can cause to crash of system. I think that there should be  option like that.<br />
On interface there can be enter one table but it runs for all tables that waits reconfig. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which VRC? If it is the live/production VRC, you maybe have a big problem This would mean that the VRC isn't OK... . In this case, you should have to do the recofigure of the actual tables first - or clean the ttadv5xx tables if the Baan client has changed the tabledefs with db tools (with Level 2 no problem), started the convert without reconfigure and forgotten to clean the tables (wouldn't be the first one :o).<br />
<br />
In my opinion it is most import to clarify this before any action.<br />
