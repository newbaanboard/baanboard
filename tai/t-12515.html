<br />
you can try out following.<br />
<br />
Before login to baan to activate the job, rename the 'compnr.old' file from $BSE/lib directory.<br />
After login to baan, again make the 'comopr.old' as 'compnr'<br />
Acivate the job.<br />
<br />
This should work.<br />

<br />
I am activating the jobs in the evening while leaving the office say arount 6 pm.and actual Job starts at 11:30 pm when people stops working in Baan. <br />
<br />
Renaming file compnr will affect the other users working in baan ?<br />

<br />
I would suggest that you run the complete save-job under unix.<br />
The program to use is bdbpre6.1, enter bdbpre6.1 -U to see the parameters.<br />
(The session &quot;create seq. dump of tables&quot; calls the same program by the way) <br />
Create one file for each company to be dumped, containing the names of the tables that have to be dumped (so here you can leave the logical tables away).<br />
Create these controlfiles by first dumping ttadv130 and filter the tablenames from this output.<br />
Be careful when testing bdbpre with big files while users are working, as it locks the table until it has been dumped.<br />
But if you have a test system, you can easily test it during the day. bdbpre only writes to seq. files, it doesn't change the baan tables so really there is nothing to fear (except the table lock, but this only when really big files in use are concerned).<br />
The main advantage is that you can start several bdbpre-jobs parallely, reducing the runtime to a minimum. <br />
If you have further questions, feel free to email me <br />
