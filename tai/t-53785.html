Any help would be apprecciated.<br />

<br />
You can easily compare objects on os-level, you seem to use solaris, try the dircmp command.<br />

You can also try &quot;&lt;STRG&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt;+8&quot; on the Session giving you some object information.<br />

Does somebody know what is the table (ttadv) where object information is stored?<br />
The information from your screenshot is stored in the tools table ttpmc201.<br />
<br />
Because some solutions only contain objects and not the sources (Script/Library Object) we want to compare the objects with our customizations (in a report).<br />
When you use the option from the specific menu - check to install or check &amp; install, the reports will give you the information if you have any customized object in a higher VRC.<br />
The problem is that we only know the table where scripts are stored<br />
The scripts are stored in encrypted form in the PMC bundle. You cannot directly view it unless you install (extract in some older Baan versions).</div></div><hr />

I guess we will use the option &quot;Check Customizations&quot; in ttpmc2204s000. It's a pitty that the object components are not managed in a ttadv table since other components are. So, if you get only objects in a solution, and you have customizations, then you have at least to compile the customized source.<br />

Refer to the thread - Application data dictionary vs. run-time data dictionary (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=53406) for more info about which software components are stored where. This helps in understanding the Baan architecture.</div></div><hr />

BTW: Objects are stored in table ttadv239.</div></div><hr />
