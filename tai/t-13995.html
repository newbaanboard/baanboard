<br />
When we access itemmaster by record by record, when the system found junk/multi byte character in the itemcode, the session terminates and send a message &quot;Process 8- Fatal Error :Error 305 (Wrong row returned ) on SELECT, Can not continue.<br />
<br />
We have able to locate the error. the records are combination of english and arabic character in the item code. we want to delete this records. even through GTM we are unable to access this records. <br />
<br />
Looking for help.<br />

What BaaN help says is,<br />
The table index could be corrupt for this error message.<br />
<br />
If it is just selecting particular records from Item master,<br />
maintain a signal code in Item master for the records you  have identified as junk and give the condition in your select statement in the session to deselect the junk records.<br />
<br />
It mite work if the index is not corrupted.<br />
<br />
Else you can do a Reconfigure table before proceeding with the session.<br />
NOTE: <br />
1 Contact your system administrator befor eproceeding on this reconfigure <br />
2 Mandatorily Reconfigure in single user mode(when no users logged into system).<br />
<br />
Revert back if you have any queries before proceeding.<br />
Have reconfigure as your last option.</div></div><hr />

So if there are multibyte characters in it , it will throw error 305. <br />
<br />
Now u may do following in consultation with Baan support.<br />
<br />
1. Export table using exchange (standard export may not work)<br />
2. Import the clean data after dropping the table.<br />
<br />
This should be done when nobody is working in Baan. Further also check about references.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the help. We are also planning to take dump and reload. few clarification needed.<br />
<br />
We will upload the data without referential integrity. if we do that it will take long time since we have more than 1.5 lacs itemcode. if we do that, is there any problem in future?<br />
