<br />
I am trying to import data dictionary (as bsp) using ttiex1285m000, but I keep getting &quot;Error -1 during seq.puts -2&quot; error message. I have checked directory permissions on all the directories in the applicaiton directory and they are just fine. <br />
<br />
Looks like it is trying to write to a file and either that file is not there or it doesn't have the permissions. Is there a log file this session writes to and may be that log file is missing? Any help/suggestion will be appreciated.<br />

* The session which u r using DOES NOT accept patch code, i hope that the directory which u r specifying contains many files, like dump.l, dumpd01.Z etc etc .<br />
<br />
* Also check whether the dump u r trying to import was transfered using binary mode.<br />
<br />
99% its not expecting any log file to be present.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">23rd September 2005, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to import a dump and it has all the multiple dump files and they were transfered using binary mode. <br />
<br />
When I look at the old dumps that I have imported successfully in the past, the import data dictionary session always write two files in the dump directory:<br />
<br />
iex1288.ready (which is 0 byte)<br />
installed.path (and this has the path to where the objects were put e.g. ${BSE}/application/tcB40C_c4_prd0). <br />
<br />
Now when I try to import and get that reported error, and if I look in the dump directory, I do see the installed.path file but with zero bytes and no path info and iex1288.ready file is not there at all. I guess the *.ready file gets written after successful installation but presense of installed.path file with no path info is strange and not sure what has caused this problem.</div></div><hr />

If all seems ok, run the session with debug (search on DBSLOG).</div></div><hr />

The issue was with that the BSE variable in BW Configuration was pointing to a different environment and hence causing the error.<br />

Thanks for the suggestions.</div></div><hr />
