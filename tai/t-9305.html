<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">19th March 2003, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any way to force a script to take the default value for an ask.enum and continue on when the session is running in a job?  The ask.enum produces an error and kills my process (or at least prevents it from running correctly).  Surely there is a way around this...:eek: <br />
<br />
BTW, at the moment, this is for Baan 4.</div></div><hr />

You can code it in your script as -<br />
<br />
	if not (api.mode or job.process or background) then<br />
		if ask.enum(&quot;zmadm0002&quot;, zmyeno.yes) = zmyeno.yes then<br />
			start.process()<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">19th March 2003, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I should have gone into more detail.  What if there is no code available for the function in question or it is not allowed to be changed?  For example, the ask.enum is in a library function or several function layers deep in a library call.  What then?  Is there anything that can help here?</div></div><hr />

but if its standard Baan and &quot;Make Job Process&quot; is an option, then this should not happen and it is a bug.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I am trying to run a session that has &quot;Make Job&quot; available.  That's irritating...<br />
<br />
The other route I attempted to pursue was using AFS and answering the question ahead of time.  However, this system is a 4c3 system and that AFS function isn't supported in 4c3.  One suggestion I heard was to update the ttstpapihand library and standard program to the 4c4 versions.  What are the potential problems with this course of action???</div></div><hr />

program doesn't have the job part down correctly, its probably buggy in the AFS handling area too...<br />
