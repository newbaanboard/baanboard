The following files are always ones that Baan ask you to update, can you tell me what they do?<br />
<br />
ostpsplopen<br />
ostpsplclose<br />
ostprepdll<br />
<br />
Are they to do with reports?<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">15th March 2002, 03:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The stp directory, stands for 'standard programs'. They are used by alot of different processes. The ones you have mentioned are only for reporting;<br />
stp - indicates standard program<br />
spl - indicates spooler functions<br />
<br />
thus, the ostpsplopen is the function that handles the opening of the spooler and ostpsplclose is the function that handles the closing of the spooler. These are activated during a rprt_open (brp.open or by the tccom0010 function, if used) and the rprt_close (brp.close or by the tccom0010 function, is used). The ostprepdll, is for standard reporting requirements (such as sending the information to the report, using rprt_send, brp.ready).<br />
<br />
NOTE: both the help information and session information, are language dependent (hence the ottstp2 directory).<br />
I don't know of any documentation that details in depth, the use of each of the objects in the ottstp directory, but there is usually some information regarding what the objects do, in the baan knowledgebase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I knew that they were the Baan standard programs but what I didn't know is what each program does. I tried the Baan KB but that's fairly useless. Perhaps they should have a link to this site there's more help available!<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks for the explanations<br />

P.S. How's life in NZ, what part are you from?</div></div><hr />

NZ isn't to bad. Still a fairly freindly country (especially the south). I'm from Auckland, which is a little unfriendlier and more fast paced, but has everything within a couple of minutes.<br />
<br />
Just a pity, that it's really Rugby orientated. You see a third division NPC (National Provisional Championship - basically our rugby union leagues or divisions) final, but don't see the national soccer team play. Considering soccer is the highest played and watched team sport in the world, means NZ is trying to isolate itself, to the detrement of popular sports. It's unfortunate, cause it means that we are probably not going to see much of the upcoming Soccer World Cup. The stupid thing, is that soccer is the highest played team sport in NZ as well (due to the junior leagues, as a lot of parents make their kids play soccer, to avoid injuries. It's not until they get older, that rugby becomes the popular sport with them). Otherwise, our sports teams aren't doing to badly (seeing as you are from Surrey, I will avoid mentioning the recent test match, as I believe England may have won, although one of our players (Astle), pulled off a rathing amazing innings).<br />
<br />
Weather is starting to get a little colder (although we didn't have a proper summer). We are almost into Autumn (or Fall, depending where you are from), officially it starts in April (again, depends who you talk to).<br />
<br />
Hope all is well with you. How are things in UK? Are people confident, or still a little concerned about the events happening in the Middle East (and the incident last September)?</div></div><hr />

It will give a lot of information on:<br />
Declared variables<br />
Functions declared (inclusive profile info)<br />
Used string variables (with also the SQL statements)<br />
Idents<br />
and a lot more information.</div></div><hr />
