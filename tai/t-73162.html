I am looking for help with upgrading tools from FP7 to 10.7.<br />
For now, I have tools to fp7 and up to 10.5 but this was installed  by someone else with who I don't have contact. I found a specific solution on Infor Xtreme (KB 2079809), but I don't know if it's enough to use only what is written there or something more? Please help me step by step.<br />
Thank you very.</div></div><hr />

You have to check if you need to install some PMC solutions in existing version before upgrade. Check what portingset set you need for tools version 10.7 and if this portingset support your OS and DB version.</div></div><hr />
