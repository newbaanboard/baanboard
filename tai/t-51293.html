Problem:<br />
Getting &quot;unknown reference error&quot; (see attachment) while opening session Display Inventory Transaction By Item {tdinv1501m000}. Getting this for all users including baan. No problem while opening or working with Enter Inventory Transaction by Item or Print Inventory Transaction by Item...<br />
<br />
Solutions tried so far..<br />
Ran Remove User Defaults.<br />
Ran Reorganize Tables for tables tdinv001, tdinv100 and tiitm001..<br />
Checked the items existing in inv100 with that of itm001 and found that all were accounted for and that the item reference does exist...<br />
<br />
Anything else i can try out to fix this problem? <br />

<br />
edit or display the session form and look at the field data for &quot;item description&quot; (tiitm001.dsca). In property field &quot;Inp./ref. Express.&quot; is should be the following default entry: &quot;tdinv100.cmbg,tiitm100.item&quot;. If this is missing then the Standard Programm doesn't know how to retrieve the item description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">1st May 2008, 11:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Vahdani,<br />
   To start off, the session (forms) has never been customized but still i checked out the standard version and found out that both the &quot;tdinv100.cmbg &amp; tiitm100.item&quot; were present in the Input/Ref Expression field of tiitm001.dsca. <br />
<br />
Since this problem is only at one of our sites (company), i did a comparison of fields between the sites. On the problematic site i found out that there was an extra field listed in the Maintain Form Fields. The field in question is tiitm001.czed (Containerized) and the interesting part is that its not used on the form. In the Input/Ref Expression of this field, the value tdinv100.item is present. I tried changing it to either 0 or 1 (since deleting option is greyed out) but it gave me different errors while opening the Display Inventory Transaction By Item session.. (Not sure if this is the reason behind the Unknown Reference error)<br />
<br />
As far as the difference goes, other than the extra field the problematic site is on SP 18 while the others are on SP19. Could this (also) be a factor? If so, is there any way to fix this without applying SP19? <br />
Last but not least i thought of taking an object dump of this session (from other sites) and restore it in a customized VRC at the current site but then if the field is used in the script then i could be in a spot of bother.. so awaiting further suggestions before taking that attempt..<br />
<br />
Any suggestion is welcome...<br />

so<br />
<br />
if you suspect a data error try:<br />
1. run the failing session with the following in your BW config:<br />
-- -set DBSLOG=01570 &lt;session code&gt;<br />
<br />
_The file will be big_ <br />
<br />
In windows it's in $BSE/tmp in unix it's probably in your home directory.<br />
<br />
2. vi the file and from the bottom up search for 606 (i think that's reference does not exist, i don't have the errors in-front of me) you could also look for 303.<br />
<br />
basically though, just read backwards, you should find the record it's looking for.<br />
<br />
Plan B is to <br />
1. run a -- -dbgobj -keeplog -logfile /tmp/bla.txt &lt;session&gt;<br />
2. compare the objects from that output and make sure they are where you expect them to be... (frequently you'll find an object in your custom VRC that you didn't expect and it's blocking a newly patched object)<br />
