<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
I have this problem with some users could not login although the license is available for them to use. The problem is that whenever they login using their ID, it opens up the option dialog and the exits without launching Baan at all. <br />
We had :<br />
1) Bring down and up again Baan daemon on both servers<br />
2) Recreate their ID alternately with other ID temporarily.<br />
<br />
Solution 2) works temporarily. So we need to know why this instance happen and this is the first time we encountered this scenario. <br />
Kindly help as we have already logged a call to Baan Malaysia and they have actually escalate this matter to Baan Holland but they still could not rectify what has cause this problem to happen. <br />
Currently our users are using alternate IDs but there are many of them affected. So is there any way to check why this happen.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

It will help the folks on Baanboard in troubleshooting your problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However when we try to login using the similar id as above in our production database server, it can go through. <br />
For your information, prior to this, our engineer has rebooted the production application server which is due to some technical problems. Previously we did not encounter this problem at all and our users are able to login without any difficulties. <br />
<br />
1) Is there any other ways i could check apart from the log files because the information gathered from the log files is quite meaningless and does not really help in rectifying the problem.<br />
<br />
2) Can we check certain files(user files for eg.) or others which may be corrupted when we rebooted the server earlier. If there is where could we check and how do we perform the checking.<br />
<br />
Thanks. Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">renyc95</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. We are using those remote users. But all the files for the remote users are there under the /lib/user directory and no one has removed those files or any of such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">When you say 'recreate users with other ID', do you mean recreate the remote user in Maintain Remote Users and have them use the same System User to login to the database server? Is there any pattern who can and cannot log in? (e.g. root, bsp, super users, normal users) etc. Have you changed any (system) passwords that may prevent users from logging in? Have you file/directory permissions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">My two cents:<br />
What files are opened and what is the difference with succesfully logged on clients when running with the command box option:<br />
   -- -keeplog -logfile openfile.txt -dbgfdev<br />
<br />
If you have only the option dialog box started, can you open a shell there? If so can you release your license with typing:<br />
   killall<br />
   exit<br />
<br />
Will you be able to logon with the same user (is it sometimes failing or everytime) afterwards? Is it always and alone the same one user or not? What is the result of a diff between a succesfull loggin in persons rfile and ufile compares with someone who cannot login.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">renyc95</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 02:28</div></div><div class="posttext">1) We created users (for eg. user that have problem loggin in - leett01), we create another ID for him - leett05 (both unix and baan). <br />
<br />
We don't really have any pattern who can go in and who cannot. The thing happen intermittenly where by at one time the user can go in but the other users could not. So we would not know what seems to be the pattern. <br />
Similar to bsp, sometimes we can go in and sometimes we could not even though there are enough licenses to go in. No, we have not changed any system password for users or the superusers.<br />
<br />
2) The option dialog is opened when the user try to login, but it was opened for a while before it exits altogether. And we can also check that the user is able to occupy the licence for about ~10 sec then it exits without starting up the menu.<br />
<br />
Its not always the same user can go in. Sometimes the user can go in at x time but could not at y time. Im not sure about the difference of the r file and u file between those who can and cannot login. Is there any way we could tell because i check the files are the same for those who can and cannot login.<br />
<br />
Attached is the file (openfile.txt) for both users 'bsp' and 'pleong01'.  At this time, 'bsp' is able to login but 'pleong01' could not. So maybe comparison can be made and check at which point the connection been terminated.</div></div><hr />
