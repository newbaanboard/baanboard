we need to upgrade this configuration, but we're thinking do it first in a test enviroment... separate server..<br />
<br />
How could I make a copy??  just transfering files?? or Do I need to reinstall everything?<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
For the test server this does not have to be an issue, because you can let it leech its licenses of your production environment, but once you upgrade your production system, a back-up won't do you any good. You will have to re-license with Baan.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, you will receive an adequate grace-period to fix your licensing, and Baan is really quite quick and responsive (usually overnight in my experience), in returning you the updated keys.</div></div><hr />

I need to upgrade to Win2000 server &amp; SQL2000, it is for performance improve.<br />
<br />
but, does baan works if I copy all files to another server?? the problem is that I don´t have the Baan cd installation..</div></div><hr />

Baan's key-generator actually looks at the IDs of various hardware components and will know if you try to trick it like that.<br />
<br />
But why not use your available license server?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don´t know how much risk is upgrade directly on production server, is the first time I do it in Windows enviroment.<br />
<br />
so, any help is really appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 01:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess your plan was to upgrade to a new server and then to dispose of the old one?<br />
<br />
Isn't that just a complicated way of making a back-up? ;)<br />
<br />
There's always risks involved in these kinds of upgrades, so as always you just need to make sure you have a sufficiently large window (just ask for twice your estimated time) and a safety-net.<br />
<br />
A test server could be helpful to do a dry-run and meet the unexpected.</div></div><hr />
