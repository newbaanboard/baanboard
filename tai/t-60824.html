<br />
I am trying to upgrade my ERP LN 6.1 from FP3 to FP5. Here are the details of my installation <br />
<br />
                        Old Version                          Upgrading To<br />
Porting Set              8.4 a                                8.5a<br />
Enterprise Solu.        8.3                                   ES 8.5<br />
Feature Pack            FP3                                  FP 5<br />
<br />
My OS is Windows 2003 and DB SQL server 2005. <br />
<br />
I followed the Pre - requsities and instructions given in the manual from INFOR. <br />
<br />
Porting Set installed after many retries. But when i try to install tools PMC and ES 8.5, it gets hanged half way.<br />
<br />
The Wizard installs the BWC File and it opens the ottiex1287 (Import Data Dictionary ) and scans the solution. Then it tries to Check and INstall solution. and it opens many a window of ottiex1287 more than 100.. So i had to kill this process as something is going in the loop. <br />
<br />
I Checked the log file and the message which i am getting is the following.<br />
<br />
<br />
FATAL ERROR: Cannot lock Update VRC 7.6 a ; there is another process running for this Update VRC<br />
<br />
Your input would be very useful for me to complete this installation as its in Live server :(. <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
