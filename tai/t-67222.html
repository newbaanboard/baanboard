<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theoriginalmrmi</div><div class="date">5th January 2015, 20:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  We're running Baan as a legacy application, it's just used for reference.  I'm starting to get concerned about the age of the hardware so I'm looking for options for migrating it.  I put most of Baan into vmware.  We're running an older version of SLM that does not support vmware.  We don't have an active support agreement with Infor so upgrading it is not an option right now.<br />
<br />
I moved the Application portion of Baan onto a vm, the license server is still physical.  I should rename the license server to a different host name so that it doesn't conflict with the application.  If I rename the server, will SLM stop working?  My understanding is that it's looking for the same mac address.  I've never done this before.<br />
<br />
Do you think Infor will let me get the latest SLM 7.3 from somewhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
