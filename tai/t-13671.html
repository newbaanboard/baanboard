<br />
We are running BaaN IV c4 with ms-sql server 7.0 as db on Win NT 4.0. Currently there are about 20 concurrent users<br />
<br />
When i see the process manager of NT , i can see for each login there is a ntbshell.exe running as well as there is a mssql_srv.exe ( database process ) running for each login, using licmon I got the process id of the user and then compared <br />
it with ntbshell process id , now my question is how do i create a <br />
linkage between ntbshell process id and database <br />
process id i.e. linkage betweeb ntbsheel.exe and mssql_srv.exe ??<br />
<br />
Since at times one of the user if runs a heavy report and it takes <br />
too much memory / cpu consumption then how can i kill his baan login ? if i try to killk ntbshell.exe or the mssql_srv.exe using Win NT then it says Access denied, how can i kill it.<br />
<br />
If somebody know how do it at SQL Server Enterprise Manager level or at MS-SQL Server Query Analyser level, then kindly let me know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">20th November 2003, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">You can usually kill the bshell by going to a command prompt and then typing &quot;kill process.id&quot; where process.id is the number shown in the task manager.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you will still get access denied though. In SQL server, Baan tends to be mapped that all users are logged in as user Baan so it is hard to say which process you would kill there. Actually, as you point out it is the mssql_srv  process you would want to kill anyway.<br />
<br />
Something that might help is ProcessExplorer from www.sysinternals.com - I think it is free for personal use as well!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can highly recommend the Process Explorer mentioned by EdHubbard. It is a very good tool providing lots of relevant information about the running processes. <br />
<br />
You can see them in a tree-form, so that you see easily which mssql_srv.exe is linked to which ntbshell.exe, and you see exactly which process is started by which Baan-user, under which NT-user etc.<br />
<br />
One remark:<br />
It's not recommended to leave the Process Explorer running automatically the whole time, but rather activate it manually [View -&gt; update speed &gt; paused], because the tool requires a lot of cpu-usage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />

<br />
It is possible!<br />
<br />
You can us the command &quot;tlist&quot; to find out wich process belongs to the ntbshell process of the user.<br />
The option -t shows a process tree. With the pid behind the process name, you know wich process to kill.<br />
<br />
The command tlist is in the NT Resource Kit.<br />
<br />
/lakoon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">21st November 2003, 04:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all of you, I will download and evaluate the software, since currently I don't have access to MS SQL Server.<br />
<br />
In case of any doubt will revert accordingly.<br />

You can find the proces number &lt;pid&gt; with licmon -w<br />
<br />
the bshcmd and licmon can be found in the baan\bin folder.</div></div><hr />
