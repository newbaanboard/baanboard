<br />
We are trying to install LN FP3 onto REDHAT 4 UPGRADE 5 ADVANCED Linux Server.<br />
When we tried to install ASM from Windows 2003 Server (we have Staging Area built in there), the system requires Linux's user and pwd. We put bsp and password and installation software tries to connect to Linux box using Rexec, and then receive the following error regarding REXEC connection's problem(no much descriptive error).<br />
<br />
We already verified:<br />
<br />
1) Port 512 is available we verified this thru this command from Windows terminal.<br />
<br />
telnet &lt;Linux ip server&gt; 512<br />
<br />
2) Rexec Service is up and running onto Linux Server, we verified this true<br />
<br />
chkconfig --list | grep rexec<br />
<br />
rexec on<br />
<br />
3) Windows machine's ip is listed on /etc/hosts on Linux Server  <br />
4) Rexec service could be used from Linux Server<br />
5) There are no firewall issues between Linux Box and Windows machine, since firewall was disabled for this tests purposes<br />
<br />
Now when we receive installation error , tried to issue rexec command thru this command<br />
<br />
rexec  &lt;Linux ip server&gt; - l user -n ls<br />
<br />
And then execution hangs and after about 5 minutes had to close terminal window since there were no response<br />
<br />
Is there any configuration file that i must to verify on Linux?<br />
 <br />
Thanks In advance.<br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />

If you have verified that you have R-services (rlogin and/or rexec), are installed (by default Linux Red-Hat have not bundled that RPM´S and should be downloaded from Red hat´s network.<br />
<br />
By the description of your case, I´m assuming that you have done that. So, if you can´t have response using command:<br />
<br />
rexec &lt;Linux ip server&gt; - l user -n ls<br />
<br />
I´m suspect that you have problem with reverse resolution done by REXEC.<br />
Please check on file  /etc/xinetd.d/rexec some similar to this:<br />
{<br />
disable = no<br />
socket_type = stream<br />
wait = no<br />
user = root<br />
log_on_success += USERID<br />
log_on_failure += USERID<br />
server = /usr/sbin/in.rexecd<br />
server_args = -D<br />
}<br />
<br />
-D argument disables de reverse resolution.<br />
<br />
Stop and start the REXEC service and try again.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
