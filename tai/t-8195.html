<br />
I made a fully automated session and it's working OK under manual execution. This session is a print session which will automatically execute print.data followed by end.program upon initialisation of form. I disabled all buttons in the form. The main part of the program under print.data are written using API. The session will also automatically direct all error messages the main part to a file without needing user interaction. It's fully automatic<br />
<br />
Now I have a problem, this session doesn't seem to be running properly under job mgmt. The job session history states that the session was executed, but I can't see the error file created (I deliberately pass wrong data so the error report would come out). What happened?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, guys (&amp; girls)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">20th December 2002, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, ~Vamsi for your &quot;help&quot; through the thread date.num() and job (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6326). I found that thread after a long search and try channeling all flow through cont.process first. It works. Only minor drawback is that it's not fully automated anymore. It won't run off job mgmt if I set the cont.process to be run upon initialisation of form (even when I set it to do so only when it's not under job mgmt).<br />
<br />
cont.process is a weird command in B5c. It's not present in list of standard commands, but seems to be having prominent role in B5c programming. Probably it should be put back as a std command?<br />

<br />
the choice.cont. process is indeed documented - 4GL choice sections (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_4gl_features_4gl_choice_sections) <br />
<br />
You can find the notes there -<br />
<br />
<br />
The following commands are supported for backward compatibility only. Support is not guaranteed in future versions of the software. <br />
<br />
cont.process <br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of keeping the cont.process in the form section, you might try to keep that option as the default option/button in the user defined form commands. So when the form is activated through the job management that is still executed. You can keep the script in debugger and look for the flow of program.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can also use the statements like in the form/group(incase you are using the new DFE) intialization section -<br />
<br />
<br />
group.1:<br />
init.group:<br />
	if job.process then<br />
		start.process()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you out.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />
