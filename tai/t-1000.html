<br />
2) The procedure how to install the Service Pack is always included in the Release Notes. Make sure you read these carefully as most of them require special preparation steps.<br />
<br />
3) You should alway install a Service Pack with all users logged off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">11th February 2002, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Also be careful of which porting set you are using and in some cases the client software as well. <br />
<br />
Plus always make sure you put aside plenty of time to work on the system as installing a service pack can take some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 14:50</div></div><div class="posttext">before you even think about loading a service pack, you need to do some testing.  I just upgraded Baan5c from service pack 3 to SP6.  Service pack 5 had some showstopping bugs which forced us to move to SP6 in one go.<br />
<br />
Luckily we found all this out on the test environment!<br />
<br />
We defined a proper test plan involving the most important business processes.<br />
<br />
We have gone live this week with SP6 (+ a couple of extra patches, porting/tools sets etc) and all seems well.</div></div><hr />
