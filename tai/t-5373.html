HPUX 11<br />
HP4050 printer<br />
JetDirect card print server<br />
<br />
We are sending print jobs from Baan, we can see the print request in SAM. But the print request does not get processed and just sits there. The printer is ONLINE, we can see the printer via the JetDirect web manager and the staus is shown as ready. We can ping the print server.<br />
<br />
If we stop and restart the UNIX spooler the jobs are sometimes flushed through other times they are still sitting as requests visible in SAM.<br />
<br />
We you see the print request in SAM the file thats trying to be printed is a called something like tmp006504960. Where should this file be? I've looked under $BSE/tmp but it cannot be found here. Should I expect to see anywhere or is it removed once the request is passed to UNIX?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Here are some checks you can do:<br />
<br />
1) If you have JetAdmin installed then check the printer's log file in /opt/hpnp/tmp. You can also use the /opt/hpnp/bin/hpnpadmin to query status information. See hpnpadmin -? for options.<br />
<br />
2) Your request should be located in /var/spool/lp/request/&lt;queue_name&gt;. You can check LP scheduler log files in /var/adm/lp<br />
<br />
Hope it helps a bit!</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing I didn't mention is that the printers are at a remote site on our WAN. The problem is not consistent, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Could this be some form of timeout issue? When pinging our response times are sub 100ms so I doubt this is the problem.<br />

If you are on the HP-Unix, try using the lpstat command -<br />
<br />
lpstat(1)                                                         lpstat(1)<br />
<br />
 NAME<br />
      lpstat - report line printer status information<br />
<br />
 SYNOPSIS<br />
      lpstat [-drst] [-a[list]] [-c[list]] [-o[list]] [-p[list]] [-u[list]]<br />
      [-v[list]] [ID...]<br />
<br />
 DESCRIPTION<br />
      The lpstat utility writes to standard output information about the<br />
      current status of the line printer system.<br />
<br />
      If no arguments are given, lpstat writes the status of all requests<br />
      made to lp by the user that are still in the output queue.</div></div><hr />
