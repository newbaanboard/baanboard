<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">txarmel</div><div class="date">27th August 2008, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">We are migrating our BaaN IV c4 installation to a new machine with W2003 and BaaN IV c4 and SQL Server 2005.<br />
<br />
We are having trouble generating the BaaN users. <br />
They only work if the user is generated as a local user in the server, with domain users we get the message &quot;Error 514. Probably no permission .......&quot;<br />
<br />
The strange thing is that if we go to file msql_users in /baan/lib/msql and I look for the line of a specific user i.e user karvil, it says something like &quot;karvil:karvil:*Ewapkx#A'IiH/H5IYK+\~QJia#e+vV&amp;:baandb&quot; .<br />
If I ichange it to &quot;KARVIL:karvil:*Ewapkx#A'IiH/H5IYK+\~QJia#e+vV&amp;:baandb&quot;, that is, change the first code to capital letters, it works OK and I can get into BaaN normally.<br />
<br />
Has anyone got any idea why this is happening?</div></div><hr />

There were some cases that after portingset upgrade customer had to change OS user on Windows form &quot;Baan&quot; to &quot;baan&quot; to resolve such error. Anotehr way is probably what you did - to change line in xxx_users file from &quot;baan:baan:...&quot; to &quot;Baan:baan:...&quot;</div></div><hr />

Certainly by portset 0717 the issue was clear.  (Do not run portsets 0718 or 0719 on a Windows platform, there is a fault.)</div></div><hr />

Indeed, it probably will.  But all our AD user names include capital letters, and in the Baan User Maintenance the System Login is shown in lower case.  This arrangement works fine (except when you get a porting set error, as we had recently).  Of course, we are a Windows shop - different rules may apply for Unix servers.</div></div><hr />
