<br />
Need to enquire on a couple of things. I am testing out scheduled jobs on a ERPLN 6.1 and running on AIX 6.1.<br />
<br />
Right now I am using the bsp user and find that when I use the rc.startjobdm script and create the BSE_COMPNR and PACKAGE_COMB, It will start the jobs as required based on the company number and packages that the bsp user has access to.<br />
<br />
Now my question is how does ERPLN know which user is linked to which job? Is there a variable for this? For example, i want to use the user name &quot;User1&quot; to run jobs for company 123 and to use the user name &quot;User2&quot; for company 300?<br />
<br />
Creating multiple users at the OS level and at the LN level will get things going but it seems like a tedious way to do things. There are potentially some companies the bsp user does not have access to so I am looking at how to go about this. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ian</div></div><hr />

Alternatively, you can create multiple batch bspxxx [100,200 etc] accounts for every company. The company &amp; package combination are defined in the user data.<br />

This is determined by the job owner on the job in a company.</div></div><hr />

I'm a bit confused about the use of multiple users called bspXXX ... even with multiple users and the default company along with the package VRC being stored in the user data.. Doesn't the rc.startjobdm executes based on which OS user is running it and won't allow jobs to run for the other bspXXX ? If i were to use the rc.startjob, it means i would have to create crontabs for multiple users?<br />
<br />
I was hoping a single user can control jobs for multiple companies. That was the original idea why i approached it by using the rc.startjobdmXXX but found that this is a tedious way to go about things.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the assistance so far... I am seeing if there is a more intuitive way to do things cause Job management I think can get pretty messy.<br />
<br />

You can do it with one single os user but you will need more users in baan having os user set to that single user created in the os.<br />
<br />
You need these users in baan/ln in order to be able to use different companies/package combinations.<br />
On the other hand, if just use a single package combination you could use logical table to link several job tables to one single company. The job daemon can handle this, it will change to the correct company during running the job.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, using crontab is normally a more practical way to run jobs because the jobdaemon only uses a single bshell to run the sessions. It has been explained before on this board.<br />

I will probably give this a test a little later.<br />
<br />
I've not worked with Crontabs before but i might give that a try.  Using the rc.startjob in a crontab does look like a more explicit and obvious way to keep track of jobs running. But at the moment, I'm still making use of the jobdaemon to figure out the concepts of the job scheduling within LN..<br />

You can use the search option on the forum to refer to the existing discussions with keywords - rc.startjob, cron, job scheduler etc.<br />
<br />
Refer to the following threads -<br />

<br />

<br />
Actually I've been testing out the both the job daemon methods and cronjob commands on my own a bit.<br />
<br />
I found that the BSE_COMPNR and PACKAGE_COMB variables in the rc.startjob/rc.startjobdm can be used to overwrite the package vrc linked to the LN User data package and run jobs. I find this would be easier than having multiple LN users linked to a single OS user (I've not tried this yet though).  I'm not sure the full pros and cons yet but i'd rather have a single bsp OS and LN user with multiple job scripts file pointing to different VRC and company numbers than having a single OS user/Multiple LN users with multiple scripts anyway.<br />
<br />
I probably need to test out job scheduling on Windows soon as well... At least I got one OS out of the way.<br />
<br />

Yes you can use those options. Your environment might be less complicated than ours. We have an external batch scheduler, which calls Baan jobs, shell scripts, ftp scripts to other integration systems, daily/monthly/weekly/repetitive jobs etc. There are ~5,000 jobs and ~50,000 executions per day, needs a better way to sort the company (40+) based and also environment based (dev, qa, prod). So we have batch account per company, which doesn't have authorization to work in another company, this avoids wrong jobs fired or other mistakes that might occur when an Application Production Support is restarting jobs in case of any failures etc. Some of the support staff is dedicated to specific company/business units and some work across multiple.</div></div><hr />
