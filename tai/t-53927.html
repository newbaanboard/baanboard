Until today I thought there must be a &quot;save.defaults()&quot;, either with help a button, or just somewhere in the code of the program.<br />
<br />
Just now I checked a session which has explicitly no button, no menu item and no line in the code to save the defaults. <br />
<br />
Now I checked the contens of the table for my user and found a lot of sessions, I don't know if that are all sessions from baan. I never saved in all that sessions the defaults!! This must be a kind of standard behavior if a session is closed.<br />
<br />
Strange is also the contens of the ttadv990.rcrd field. Sometimes there are &quot;readable&quot; names of fields sometimes only columns of numbers.</div></div><hr />

   The data that you see in the field rcrd are indeed from Baan. This table can be seen as the Memory table for Baan sessions. Whenever you save and exit from any session, Baan stores the information that you exited from in this table. The next time you open the same session, you will see the same data that was displayed the time you exited from the session.<br />
For instance, go to the session Maintain Sales Order and search for a particular order. Then click on Save &amp; Exit. Go to the table ttadv990 and check for the username and company you are logged as and in and then search for the session tdsls4101m000. You would be able to see in the field rcrd, the sales order number you saved and exited from. <br />
<br />
sk<br />
<br />
P.S: you could delete these values from ttadv990 by running Remove User Defaults {ttstpdeldeflt}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">8th October 2008, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sukesh,<br />
<br />
that is what I'm assumed. Thank you for the confirmation!<br />
<br />
The reason why I ask is: We have a certain user -only one-. For this user we have to use ttstpdeldeflt to delete records of a certain session out of this table. Otherwise he can't continue to work with that session because he get errors. We have to do this with intervals of days or weeks. <br />
<br />
The question is: How can that, somehow corrupted or in some other way wrong values, be filled into the table?  There is no button and no code to save the default values for this session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">8th October 2008, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
   My guess is that the Save &amp; Exit button might be holding the script that records the data in the form at the time of clicking the Save &amp; Exit button on that form. How it corrupts the data for the users is beyond me as we never faced such a situation. Is this happening for many users or is it always related to a particular session?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">8th October 2008, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">All sessions that have the start option 44 &quot;get.defaults&quot; automatically do a save.defaults when you exit. Alternatively, lots of sessions allow the user to save the default values (options/...).<br />
 <br />
I think problems sometimes happen for the following way:<br />
user opens a productions order / sales order / ...<br />
now, lets say user is on vacation, and something happens to the order<br />
the user is back, but the order is missing.<br />

<br />
I think günther's proposal comes close to the problem. Baan standard saves the values automatically, although if our start option is 6 'def.find'.<br />
The option &quot;save.defaults&quot; is not active for this session.<br />
<br />
At the moment I don't know how the user works with the session. I will keep an eye on it. I will also watch the contens of ttadv990.rcrd for this session and user. <br />
<br />
Btw: The session is a customized version of tdpur4501m600<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support</div></div><hr />

<br />
In this table you find the default values for the session but also some data related to the windows values used by the user .<br />
See in the maintain user the flag save and restore windows default.<br />
When the user changes the length of different fields on the form this is also saved ==&gt; this saves strange records with binary values.<br />
  <br />
If you change something in the form (order of the fields, suppress a field etc..) when the user call  this session the form is then filled with invalid data and if you fill a numeric field with text this can give problem<br />
<br />

    The way a user exits the form also counts here. If you just click on the &quot;x&quot; button on the top right hand corner of the form or even File&gt;Exit option, it doesnt create any entry in this table. A user has to select the Save &amp; Exit option from File menu or the Save &amp; Exit toolbar button in order to log an entry in table ttadv990.<br />

A long time ago since I opened this thread. Once thank you all for your assistence. Because of the fact that it happens still sometimes that we have to delete the user defaults for a certain user, to remove some obscure behavior of the session, I tested what you wrote above. I exited the session with the top right &quot;x&quot; but I got anyway an entry in ttadv990.<br />
Strange, maybe it is because I am on Baan 5 or I did something wrong? But it should the interesting enough to post that in this old thread.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
