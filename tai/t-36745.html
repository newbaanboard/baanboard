  This topic has been mentioned before and it was quite evident from the exhaustive list of hits i got for the keyword &quot;Backup&quot;. But i didnt find any of them mentioning about certain issues like..when is the right time to run a Sequential dump of table(s)? or Which backup suits a particular type of business(24/7)? Right now we have both SQL backup(complete once a week, differential the rest of the week) and Sequential dump (daily at 1am). However, in the last few days we noticed in the backup log some of the tables were skipped because of record lock. We do have deliveries happening at night time and so kicking out users is simply out of the question. <br />
Questions:<br />
1) Its known fact that users have to be off while backup is taking place, but then tell me what would a 24/7 company do when it comes to backing up(using sequential dump i.e)? <br />
<br />
2) Would sql backup be enough as it could be done online with absolutely a small footprint on the server resources?<br />
<br />
3) What else do i backup in that case? Entire /$BSE folder?<br />
<br />
4) How would my restoration procedure look like in case i depend on just the sql backup? <br />
<br />
These questions may have been answered before but i never found any results from those who have tried..<br />
<br />
So..anyone?<br />
<br />

Sequential dump tries to get an exclusive lock on the table if there is any pending transaction/record-lock then it fails.<br />
<br />
I am not sure of MS SQL Server Advanced Options, but we use daily incremental and weekly full backups with Oracle.<br />
3) What else do i backup in that case? Entire /$BSE folder?<br />
Also depends if you have Open World and the value you set your $BAANHOME?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">4th June 2007, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">As i said in my post, deliveries do take place at the time the backup is running. Call it pure coincidence or not, but now days we find tccom010 and tdinv001 locked in all daily backup log which means my sequential dump doesnt include these two tables in it. My previous notion about sequential dump session was that it would stop anyone from accessing the table while its running. It seems its not so...<br />
<br />
We dont use open world, as yet but instead we use BCK + AFS..Bearing this in mind, what are the folders tthat i would need to save along with my SQL backup(complete+differential) to bring up a Baan environment in the shortest time on perhaps another server...<br />
<br />
thank you for your replies..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">7th June 2007, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">From a former Baan Sys. Admin. on UNIX and Oracle (with RMAN), our backup policies were the following:<br />
<br />
Oracle archive log backups were trigered when their filesystem was getting X% full (we had quite a lot of them, so this ensured we had them backed up asap and the filesystem free for more)<br />
<br />
Daily: Oracle online backup<br />
+ $BSE filesystem backup<br />
+ Incremental remaining OS filesystems<br />
If the business allowed it, we would have a weekly offline backup of everything; If not, in the weekend we applied the daily backup but the OS backup would be a full<br />
<br />
If most of your time you are changing data, your $BSE backup may be a bit irrelevant, since you will not need to sync your APDD/RTDD in case of data restore, and thus can change it to a daily incremental (just backup the differences) and full on weekend.<br />
<br />
We never took Baan dumps, restoring by DB means was always faster (each company was setup on their own tablespaces, one for tables, other for indexes).<br />
<br />
You may need to review the above a bit and adapt it to MS-SQL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">9th June 2007, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Victor,<br />
  Thank you for your valuable inputs. As of now, we are taking a weekly complete &quot;online&quot; backup of baan database and an &quot;online&quot; differentials taken daily. When you suggest to take $BSE filesystem backup, do you mean the whole $BSE folder or some of the folders inside it? <br />
While restoring, as a part of recovering a failed baan environment, what would the be the sequence in which i restore the backed up data?<br />
If i understand right, then would it look like the following:-<br />
1) Install OS &amp; DB <br />
2) Apply DB Service packs to what it was before crashing...<br />
3) Install Baan(base installation without service packs)<br />
4) Stop baan services<br />
5) Overwrite the new $BSE files with Backed up $BSE file from the crashed server..<br />
6) Restore complete and differential SQL backup of baan database<br />
7) Restart Baan services (and hope to God it works)<br />
8) Apply for new license keys..<br />
??<br />
Please let me know if its correct...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">12th June 2007, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not familiar with Windows; on UNIX you just need to put back your OS and backup client software and then restore the DB binaries, database, $BSE (full), patch objects after system crash (I think it was called that...) and request for a new Baan license.<br />
<br />
On Windows it is more tricky because you need to get your DB to the same patch level (thru installation!) and also need to install Baan to get the services setup before you can start restoring your $BSE and database.<br />
<br />
You need to get confirmation of your steps from somebody used to do recoveries on Windows...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">12th June 2007, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried the above approach, the one that i listed and upon restarting Baan, i got the error message &quot;Cannot continue in ttadv002000...&quot;..<br />
<br />
Could the presence of BCK hamper this approach? I am not sure if the installation of BCK writes any files to the windows folder..<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />

but if  one table goes corrupt, then how do I restore it back without sequential dump. i understand that in this solution sequential dump is not being taken.</div></div><hr />

If you looked at the steps, there is one backup thats done at the SQL level. If you have a SQL Db Backup then you could restore the single table by restoring the backup to a test db and copying the table using either SQL statement or DTS...<br />
 <br />
Bottomline, you got to have atleast(minimum) one type of backup of your Baan Data. Whether its a Sequential Dump or SQL DB Backup thats upto you...<br />
