<br />
please use the search option regarding this topic, because there are many threads which discuss this.<br />
<br />
Some general notes:<br />
The Baan application communicates with the database through a database-specific driver. This driver translates application queries into (database) native SQL queries. As a result, the Baan application is database-independent.<br />
<br />
Level 1 driver<br />
For the databases supported by the Baan software, a so-called level 1 driver is available. Level 1 signifies that the Baan database driver splits complicated Baan SQL statements into simple queries for the database server in an optimal way. As a result, the Baan software, rather than the database, performs the optimization of the SQL statements.<br />
<br />
Level 2 driver<br />
A level 2 driver receives all queries from the Baan Virtual machine and sends these queries almost directly to the database. If applicable, the driver adds a hint to the query for optimal execution by the database engine.<br />
<br />
Before you start to install Baan, you must decide whether you want to work with the Level 1 driver or with Level 2. To change a level after the installation,<br />
you must carry out a conversion of the entire database. For the latest Baan versions, Baan recommends Level 2 for new installations.<br />
<br />
