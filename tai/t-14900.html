<br />
1. You can change job's status (in ttaad5100m000) to:<br />
- in queue<br />
!!! If you try to change it, it is said: &quot;Job has been activated&quot;. BUT! - it is just waiting and not execute even its time already comes?!?<br />
<br />
2. If you 'activate job' (ttaad5203m000) the job's status becomes:<br />
- wating<br />
!!!When the time comes it executes as it has to be.<br />
<br />
Till today I've always used the second choice. But I wonder why &quot;in queue&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;In Queue&quot; status is resererd for the Job Daemon (if it is running).  The Job Daemon runs as a Baan service.  If you have it running and the job's next execution time is set to &quot;in queue&quot;, the job will run without having to keep a session open to &quot;parent&quot; it.<br />
<br />
Our Job Daemon never did work correctly from our original install, but I have seen it working at other locations.  It does make things much easier for job maintenance.  I hope this helps.<br />
