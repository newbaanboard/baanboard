<br />
Can it be installed on the same Server (Windows) as 4c4 or does it need a dedicated server/database.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">30th March 2009, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">it shouldn't a problem. you just need to specify a different $BSE and port number for your blogin/logic service.<br />
<br />
licensing is different so you don't have to worry about over-writing your brand file.<br />
<br />
the DB part might be a little difficult, if you don't object to installing it into it's own database within SQL Server then you should be fine.<br />
<br />
I know it has been done but i'm not sure how easy it is. (and my info 4 years old.. something may have changed)<br />

The BSE value will direct the login to the right Baan Software Environment (BSE).  You will be giving the database a different name.  You might have Baan or BaanIV for your current environment, this one may be called ERP or ERPLN.<br />
<br />
Give VMWARE a thought also.  You can experiment, and when needed you can restore the VMWARE server back to the initial install and start again. If you are using it to train users, you can refresh it back after each class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">13th April 2009, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I had issues getting the LN install to run at all.  It would error out.  I worked with support for almost 3 hours via a WebEX trying to get the install to run.  NO luck.<br />
<br />
Support agreed that there was nothing wrong with my system but could not understand why the install  would not run.   That's where he left me.  He said that he needed to check with development.<br />
<br />
Well, I got it to run after I figured out what they were doing.  The problem was they did not give full path names to the commands they used durring the install.  After tracing the commands they were trying to run, I added the folder to my Windows path enveronment variable one by one.<br />
<br />
Eventually after adding the paths, the install ran without errors.<br />
<br />
I now have both 4c4 as well as ERP LN on the same box. The same instanace of SQL Server had a database for each.  They both run OK.<br />
<br />
I got webtop running last Thursday.<br />
<br />
So, not it is on with the testing.  We have Infor comming in tomorrow to present their plans on upgrading.<br />

<br />
i'd say be careful with that. <br />
<br />
Baan 5/6 Logic service will let you point to baan 4. but baan 4 might not let you connect to baan 5/6.<br />
<br />
but it's been a while so who knows.<br />
