<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">11th May 2006, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We are in the process of configuring a new company for our China operations. I am setting them up on a local server here in Canada and plan to port it over at a later date when I travel over there.<br />
<br />
We have a number of shared tables that I share with our local environment that would need to attach eventually to logical tables in China server. I may need to add data here and there into those shared tables however on the local server...<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can set up logical shares to the REAL tables on our China server from our Oshawa Server?<br />
<br />
Worse comes to worse, I'll just import the changes but I was just thinking about this and was curious if others have crossed the same path before ....... :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
With TWO_TASK, meaning SQL-Net you can technically achieve a connection, but you would need a guarenteed QoS of at least 10Mbit, better 100Mbit to obtain acceptable performance. I doubt strongly any Provider in the world can offer this and I also doubt strongly any customer in the world is willing to pay this for a chinese branch.<br />
<br />
On top of this, you will have latency issues, which will end in timeout errors on the SQL-Net layer. Guarenteed latency is even more difficult to obtain from a network provider.<br />
<br />
Honestly, you forget the idea and seperate the two installations completely.<br />

I also agree with you, but i had also mentioned that Good bandwidth is required. latency issues definately will be there... as no service provide is full proof.<br />
<br />
anyway thanks for your feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">12th May 2006, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, thanks for the info. Our problem is the reliability and latency of connection here, that's for sure. If it was better, we'd have them on our one server with the other companies we run from here.  Looks like I'll just import the changes to the shared tables when the time comes ...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice !</div></div><hr />
