<br />
Have you checked if the problem was on the generation of the dump (how are you doing it?) or in the backup solution (fbackup or something?). When you create a company dump, you usually specify an error log, check what's in there. Also, if you use a job to export the company, did you checked the job history to check is it run ok?<br />
<br />
(this are just a few ideas of what to check, you need to post more details on how your dumps/backup is done...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
808 dump is OK, and contains data.<br />
802 dump is OK, and it seems that it does not contain data.<br />
<br />
You need to review/explain your concept of a failed dump on your checks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">25th February 2003, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">If the table that was dumped had data on it, the dump file contains (your first example):<br />
- header information<br />
- table data dictionary information<br />
- data<br />
<br />
If the table contained no data (empty, most tables in Baan or temporary tables) the dump file contains (your second example):<br />
- header information<br />
- table data dictionary information<br />
[ no data! ]<br />
<br />
When you're exporting a table, you [should] always generate a log file also: if exports are done thru Baan, don't leave the log field empty; if thru a bdbpre6.1, pipe the command into a log file.<br />
<br />
This log file should be checked to see if records have been skipped or for other problems, this is the correct way to see if the dump was succesfull or not. Myself, I run a <br />
egrep &quot;rror|match|DD|corrupt&quot; &lt;log_file&gt;<br />
to see if something went wrong.<br />
<br />
For further information abour exports, search the board on keywords &quot;bdbpre&quot; and/or &quot;export&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">28th February 2003, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">the egrep command is used only to evaluate the log file.<br />
First you have to create one *g*<br />
bdbpre6.1 -Ntdsls045 -Emylogfile -pB40Cc4 -C100 &gt; tdsls045.dmp<br />
should give a dumpfile named tdsls045.dmp and a logfile called mylogfile. <br />
If you want to have a look at this logfile (vor example with vi), you won't see much, as this logfile echos all output from bdbpre like it would have been seen on the screen. (cat mylogfile and you will see what I mean).<br />
Therefore we usually evaluate this logfiles with grep or egrep.<br />
cat mylogfile | grep error <br />
for example will show all lines that contain the pattern &quot;error&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope that made it a little clearer <br />
have fun<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest to get some tools training to get the hand on this things... (you're administering the server by yourself or there's a Baan sys admin around?)<br />
<br />
How are you exporting your tables, thru bdbpre6.1 or thru the Baan session ttaad4226m000 (Create sequential Dump of Table)?<br />
<br />
I don't expect you set it up thru bdbpre6.1 otherwise you would know the answer of the previous questions already.<br />
So, I assume you're using the session mentioned above; so, on that session, you should fill the field &quot;Name of error file&quot; with a file &lt;-- and this is the file that you should check for errors.<br />
<br />
You have to look at the file using other tool because grep is a UNIX command only (but there are other utilities similar for Windows).</div></div><hr />
