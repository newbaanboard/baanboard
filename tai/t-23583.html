<br />
We are running SQL Server 7 as well as 2000 on same BaaN server<br />
<br />
Situation :<br />
<br />
Instance Name : myhostname<br />
database name : baandb<br />
co.                 : 000 co. <br />
<br />
Instance Name : myhostname\newinstance<br />
 database name : newdb<br />
co.                 : 900 co. <br />
<br />
i have pointed my 000 co. to sql 7 via tabledef, now i have created a database in SQL Server 2000 for test co. 900, i tried giving the instance name/dbname in tabledef, but it din't worked, while doing bdbpost for this 900 co. it says &quot;Cant lock table&quot;<br />
<br />
I refer to the event viewer also , seems that baan is unable to contact the database which i have defined in tabledef for 900 co..<br />
<br />
can somebody tell me the exact syntax for tabledef6.2 if i would like to acess a different db within same instance<br />
<br />
currently tabledef is something like this <br />
<br />
<br />
*:000:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=myhostname):N<br />
*:900:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=0,MSQL_SERVERHOST=myhostname\\newinstance):N<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
so, i would like to know the SQL Server HOST correct syntax for second line written in tabledef6.2<br />
<br />

<br />
each user can only be associated with 1 group, so you can't <br />
split tools and logistics companies like that in this sense.<br />
<br />
the only thing you could do would be to have to have a &quot;baandb&quot; in a different instance.<br />

<br />
that means i have to take 000 co. also to my second instance, because if i take only logistics, then since 000 will not be there , it won't allow me to start baan.<br />
<br />
so finally acc. to u it should be <br />
<br />
instance name : second instance<br />
db group : newdb<br />
database name : newdb<br />
co. : 000 as well 900<br />
<br />

<br />
You can set this up nicely via the baan tools menu. Create a second database definition in maintain database definitions and assign this database to your company in  tables by database.<br />
<br />
(I am using 5c/Oracle.)<br />
<br />
The only problem I had is that I can't use the combo driver (I have a call open for this problem).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
could u please tell me the exact syntax for the below mentioned code <br />
<br />
[code]<br />
*:900:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=0,MSQL_SERVERHOST=myhostname\\newinstance):N<br />
<br />
[\code]<br />
<br />
I just want to access the second instance within the same SQL Server , currently in event viewer it is getting captured while doing bdbpost as if the sql server does not exists, so i believe there is some syntax problem in <br />
MSQL_SERVERHOST=myhostname\\newinstance<br />
<br />
i have created a new db with the name baandb in new instance, but still unable to connect.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />
<br />

<br />
Finally i was able to do it with the same syntax as mentioned below, the only mistake which i was doing was that the baandb group was not having proper permissions which i created manually via exterprise manager.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
