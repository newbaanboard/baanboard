<br />
I am about to embark on a mission to load service packs 6 through to 16 on our pre-production system and I'm after any advice from people that have gone through the process of loading service packs.<br />
<br />
Whilst I'm sure I will encounter loads of issues during the install are there any 'nasty' problems lurking?<br />
<br />
Are there any 'tricks' that can save me time during the scan and install?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
the savest way of installing Service Packs is to follow the Manual as closly as possible. We shortly lifted our System from SP6 to SP12. The test-system that we tried to do as quickly as possible got a bit instable so it had so be set up from scratch.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the bad news<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">8th July 2004, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">And don't forget to check the latest solution for the last service pack (i used to check all, just in case something was missed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">8th July 2004, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my experience:<br />
We are running Baan5c. I loaded pre-request Tool solution, SP11 and 12 in the test box one after another.<br />
To save time in Production, I did scan the Tools solutions, SP11 and SP12 and start install the Tools solution first.<br />
I start getting error Registry is not correct, then I called Baan and Baan asked me to uninstall the SP11 and 12 (through GTM). Once I taken out those service packs, I was able to load the Tools patch and then again I did scan SP11 and SP12 .loaded SP11 and SP12 in the production.<br />
<br />
Summary is before SPs scan in to your system, you better to load all pre requested Tools solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">11th July 2004, 01:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure that you have installed PMC version2 (+fixes), this contains a lot of improvements and for multiple solutions (like a SP install), for the same component, only the last one is really installed while the others are archived for uninstall purposes, saves a whole lot of time.<br />
<br />
I know that it was planned PMC v3 with even greater improvements, haven't been following this, maybe this one is already released?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to all,<br />
<br />
I have loaded up to and including SP15 and I am now waiting for SP16 to be shipped from Baan.<br />
<br />
Although the exercise took a long time it all went smoothly with no issues. Quite straightforward really.<br />

Was 15 much longer than the others.?<br />

We are on SP12, and about to load 13 14 15.<br />
( up to 20 if we have time. )<br />

<br />
I've managed to find a spreadsheet with the approxiamte timings of SP install times.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

I also am very interested in the runtimes, would you be so kind to post them here?<br />
<br />
AT this moment where on SP8 and during the Xmass holidays this year we are planning to upgrade to the latest SP.<br />
<br />
Second thing I was interested in was how many customizing was done in your system - The work put into our system is much, and I am a bit scared that the upload of the SP's will give us a big headache.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your information.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Dries</div></div><hr />

<br />
The SP timings are attached above.<br />
<br />
We developed a test plan that reflected our business processes. This also tested our customisations.<br />
<br />
Ideally you would have a test server where you could load the service packs and get the business to test Baan.<br />

I think I missed it last time. **wednesday blindness**;) <br />
<br />
We are indeed setting up a test enviroment (at that time an exact copy of the productive system). Allas it will be very hard to test the effects on all &quot;interfaces&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks  for you info and help.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
