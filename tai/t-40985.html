<br />
Before SP Upgrade a lot of analysis and testing is required especially into &quot;Functional Changes/Additions&quot;, &quot;Existing Customizations&quot; and &quot;New Bugs&quot;...<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to talk to consultants from Infor regarding this....<br />
<br />

  You didnt mention anything about the nature of your trouble. Could you list down a few? Are they functional ones or technical ones?<br />
 <br />

<br />
I got similar problem with the one Robby described here.<br />
One of the error message was:<br />
&quot;read row error 512 on tipcs000800(error0); error 512 (corrupted data dictionary)&quot;<br />
Then we contacted Infor for support. These are the steps they gave us:<br />
1. delete record in table ttadv500 - 505 in company 000 &amp; restart the server -&gt; but the problem stil exist.<br />
2. then, they told us to Reorganize Table, with these options selected:data &amp; indices, reference integrity &amp; repair reference counter. But after 39 hours of running this session, the problem stil exist<br />
3. in the end, their analyst log in to our system and delete the pcs parameter table.<br />
<br />
I'm just curious, based on your experience, what is the cause of error 512? Because we run the SP installation as instructed in the CD but we still got this problem.<br />
<br />
Another problem is, some of the new features and some objects seems missing. For example, when printing Packing Slips and Generating MRP, we got an error message &quot; Sorterror128: The sort process was aborted&quot;. Eventhough the printing process &amp; generating MRP process still running, the error message is kind of annoying.<br />
<br />
Another example, when Transfer Planned MRP PO, we got this BW message: &quot;process 619-error: unknown formfield 'busu'&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am really grateful if you can share your experience on these problems.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Justine</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
1. CRDD is done without &quot;Reconfiguration&quot; which may cause these problems.<br />
2. Some latest solutions need to be imported into the system, which fix these bugs.<br />
<br />
These things have happened with us too....and measure cause could be Incomplete testing by the product owners for various scenarios...Also, the process of Upgradation is quite complicated</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank's for your insight.</div></div><hr />

Sorry for the delay in answering as i am on my vacation and so staying away from a comp as much as possible...but didnt last long...lol<br />
So has your problem gone or still pulling out your hair? Did you apply the SP 12-18 one by one or did you use any sort of batch utility(1-18) one?<br />
Secondly, before updating to any service pack, do take a sequential dump along with a DB backup and a BSE backup...If things do go awry later, these three could help...<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">j3ruk07</div><div class="date">4th September 2007, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sukesh!<br />
<br />
I hope you did enjoy the holiday... :D<br />
<br />
Actually, yes.....I still face some problems with this. <br />
<br />
The sorting error is still exist. <br />
<br />
Some of my users can't connect to Baan so in the mean time we gave them temporary user name. I already logged this case to Baan Support but so far they only asked us to run CRDD and restart the server when no users are connected to the server. But there's no effect and Infor hasn't give us any solutions yet.<br />
<br />
Lately, the application seems to hang. Yesterday, it took more than 2 hours just to finalize 4 batches. Today, some of our users can't login to Baan, they said that it looks like the login process was hanged. When we checked the server's process &amp; memory usage, there weren't any extraordinary process that occured at that time.<br />
<br />
When installing the SP, we used batch utility to upgrade from our latest SP (at that time): SP12. But the process stuck when at SP 18.<br />
<br />
We do back up the DB, BSE &amp; sequential dump before installing those SPs but we found that re-stroring them back is too risky.<br />
<br />
Your insights on this issue are very much welcomed..... :D<br />
<br />
thank's</div></div><hr />

Yup i am enjoying my time away from work..<br />
Regarding CRDD, did you run it for Tools or for Application? ttadv5213m000 or ttadv5210m000??<br />
Before you run this, please clear out all the temp files in the temp folder of baan...make sure this happens when there arent any users on...Even Baan(super user)... are you running this(crdd) using the baan super user account?<br />
 <br />
Surely the restoration is risky but i would say it had a 80% chance of succeeding if you had done it at the time you faced the first problem. But if you were not sure, then it was best left alone..<br />
 <br />
You said the batch utility failed at SP18..Care to explain this further? As i remember there were two files you needed to scan &amp; process..one for tools and one for application..in that order. and after that comes the populating of pmc tables (4 or 5 of them) using ttaad4100..<br />
So at what stage did you get stuck?<br />
 <br />
