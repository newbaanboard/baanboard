<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_user</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running Baan IVc4 (Sp14+latest porting set) with SQL Server 2000 (SP3) on Windows 2003 Server (sp2).<br />
<br />
We have some sessions hanging, and for that Baan asked me to update the standard program (10923), which requires another solution (add nt package to Update Package Combination) as a prerequisite in PMC.<br />
<br />
Now when I add nt package to the update VRC and start reconfiguring I get the error -13 during seq.unlink file &quot;{$BSE}\dict/ddB40Sc4/dtffas/dtffas001&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am running this as administrator, and I have checked the file permissions / directory permissions. I cannot figure out why I am getting this error duing the reconfiguration.<br />
<br />
Has someone seen this problem before ..any suggestions please ?</div></div><hr />

It may be that your shared memory needs to be updated also to reflect that new package (with NT you never now...) but since you had already problems (and those may be the ones triggering this error), have it checked with Baan.</div></div><hr />
