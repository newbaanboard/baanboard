<br />
            I have plan to migration from IVc3 to IVc4.  I will rent server for do testing. so I have a question.<br />
<br />
I have Live Server is IBM unix and Informix database with BaaN Ivc3. and I will rent one server and I will install unix and Informix database and install BaaN Ivc4,service patch 11.<br />
<br />
so if I use Create Sequential Dump of table from BaaN Ivc3 and Create Table from Sequentail Dump to BaaN Ivc4 on rent server.<br />
<br />
1. Is work? <br />
2. what's difference change from baan ivc3 and baan ivc4 ?<br />
<br />
         if everything complete. mean that's I have two server , one is baan ivc3 and other is baan ivc4. Then I need to do clone hardisk from baan ivc4 , and format hardisk from live server and use image file from clone hardisk. so in the end I will have 2 server running baan ivc4. and return rent server to vender.<br />
<br />
3. Do you know which software and do clone on unix os.? I have norton ghost but I don't is it work or not?<br />
<br />
<br />
4. any idea for migration<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks..<br />

<br />
Basically to migrate your data you need to do the following<br />
a) install baanIVc4 + fixpacks<br />
b) create 2 pakage combination (ex. B40c4new and B40c3old. --&gt; this create runtime data dictionnary (RDD) <br />
c) copy your baaanIVc3 RDD in the B40c3old directories. After this never create un runtime data dictionary in this package combination <br />
d) create the compagnies that you need in package B40c3old<br />
e) export your data from BaanIVc3 and import them in the BaanIVc4 compagnies that you just created<br />
f) change package combination by company ==&gt; this reorganize your data and set the structure of tables to the new baanIVc4 structure<br />
<br />
Remark;<br />
If you have done some customization on tables or domain you must redo this in BaanIVc4 (in package B40c4new) BEFORE migrating the data<br />
<br />
and don't forgot: test and retest <br />
:) <br />

Did you try the procedure explained by pconde? <br />
<br />
as mentioned in point 3 &quot;copy your baaanIVc3 RDD in the B40c3old directories&quot; ...which directories need to be copied?<br />
<br />
we are planning to move from baan4c3 to baan4c4 and hence would appreciate if anybody  can share  their experiences ...tips and/or pitfalls?<br />

The RDD directories are located in the dict library. ( by default in the same library that contans the  bse library<br />
<br />
Therein you find the many libraries naming<br />

<br />
The steps mentioned by forsms2002 are good. Pls follow the below steps to do the migration.<br />
<br />
1. Create an another database instance on the same server<br />
2. Do the c4 installations on the same server( in a diff volume).<br />
3. Load all the required SPs in the c4 env.<br />
4. Create one live and one test package combination in the c4 env <br />
5. copy(or export/import) the data dictionary of the live package combination of c3 to the test package comb of the c4 env<br />
6.  take a sequential dump of a live comp from c3, put it into the test env of c4. <br />
7. change the Package combination of the test company of c4 to live package comb of c4<br />
8. Do the required testing of data and application<br />
9. Finally take the sequential dump of all live companies and import that into c4  and the new c4 is ready to work.<br />
<br />
10. Here, u can share the same licence of c3 into c4 env. Copy and paste the security key and validation keys from c3 to c4, and validate the c4 env(b'cause u r using the same h/w config for c4 also).<br />
11. Now, u can work in both env ie c3 and c4 and can share the same lic across both the environments.<br />
<br />
The above mentioned steps and already done by me and have used both the environments together for sometime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms2002</div><div class="date">14th November 2003, 08:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks baanlover for elaborating the steps. My sincere thanks for that!!<br />
<br />
Since you have already done, <br />
<br />
We will be doing this on Unix.  <br />
<br />
Point 1 )do you have anything to share about taking any backup of (brand file,etc) before i start the c4 installation on the <br />
<br />
existing c3 LIVE server?<br />
i.e. installing c4 on a different volume will not touch anything to the existing LIVE server..right?<br />
<br />
Point 2) Regarding validation of new c4  i will do the foll.<br />
1)Run maintain requested system configuration and there make entries as per c3 (can i run this on LIVE c3 to get the <br />
<br />
details..it should not effect the validated enviornment!!)<br />
2)Run Maintain Req. System Tools on c4 and make it as per c3<br />
2)No need to do &quot;Print Req. system conf.&quot;<br />
3)Execute Maintain Security Code/VAlidation Key i will do the copy of the following fields of c3 and paste in C4:<br />
Customer, License Code, Seq. no, Org. name, Securirty key, validation key (tools), validation key software (Standard)<br />
4)execute Validate Tool set <br />
5) exeucte Configure application<br />
OR <br />
<br />
can i just take table dump of some table from c3 and put it into c4 (say for e.g table ttiex300) and execute Validate Tool <br />
<br />
set and then execute configir application?<br />
<br />
Point 3) The $BSE will be different for c3 and c4 (c4 will be on new volume).. so will this hold good for  Point 2 above<br />
<br />
Point 4) One more thing, after installing c4 standard software and at the end of first service pack installation, normally, <br />
<br />
one has to  run &quot;Patch objects after error solving&quot;. This session requires the system to be validated. But , if I bypass this <br />
<br />
step and go ahead and install all the service packs and than at the end of all service packs, i validate the system and do <br />
<br />
Patching, will it work?<br />
<br />
Point 5)How much time do u thing it will take for (1)installation and (2) migration (assuming ours is a medium size c3 setup)<br />
(i guess since the c3 is live, i will have to do it on weekend as otherwise c3 will be very slow...is that right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Awaiting for comments on Points 1,2,3 4 and 5.<br />
Once againg thanks a lot for the responses..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">14th November 2003, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;existing c3 LIVE server?<br />
i.e. installing c4 on a different volume will not touch anything to the existing LIVE server..right?&quot; ==&gt; you have today a definition for BSE. You need to define a new  for the baanIV c4 environment so that the baanIVc4 installation occurs in a different environment than the baanIVc3.<br />
<br />
You need also to define a new instance for the database. The only librairie shared is the .brand6.1.  (and the operating system)<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;can i just take table dump of some table from c3 and put it into c4 (say for e.g table ttiex300) and execute Validate Tool<br />
set and then execute configir application?&quot;<br />
<br />
I think that there are more than 1 table  (i'm now on baanerp so i cannot control it)<br />
<br />
&quot;Point 5)How much time do u thing it will take for (1)installation and (2) migration (assuming ours is a medium size c3 setup)<br />
(i guess since the c3 is live, i will have to do it on weekend as otherwise c3 will be very slow...is that right? &quot; <br />
<br />
Best is to test:  Create a dummy vrc in the baanIVc4 environment. copy therein the data dictionnaries of you live c3 environment. Create the company(ies) in baanIVc4 and set them in in the dummy VRC.  Export your data from c3 and import in c4. Run then session change company from VRC.  Hope that it can be done in one weekend ==&gt; depends of the amount of data and the  system.<br />
<br />
All customizations done in c3 must be redo in c4 before this <br />
<br />
and don't forgot : test and retest!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanlover</div><div class="date">14th November 2003, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  U should never touch brand files and no need to take backup of that, b'cause c4 will be using the same file to validate the env.<br />
<br />
 In unix, this is the main adv that the c4 will not touch the c3 env, b'cause it is not registery based(like windows). The only thing is, u need to change the $BSE &amp; $BSE_TMP path for the Login name BSP and set that to the path of C4.<br />
<br />
2. Regarding Validation, run the session Maintain Security Code/VAlidation Key (ttiex3102m000) and fill the values for the security key and valid keys(u can do it at the end of migrations). Even if u r not validating the c4 env, right from the day u install, it will take the c3 lic, u will never get 30 days lic info, b'cause it will take the details of c3(since the path will be same for both). It may ask u to configure the applications.<br />
<br />
3. $BSE will be(should be) diff for both(since the volume are diff.<br />
<br />
4. Ur c4 will be running with the c3 lic, so there is no question of demo period. U can patch the objects.<br />
<br />
5.  Regarding time, it depends on the system config and the u should never do all the c4 activies when users are using c3, b'cause it will slow down the c3 env. U should always do it either on weekends or on holidays. <br />
<br />
Hope it will help u. Do write me back. if any further help is required.<br />

If i install b4c4 on a rented server with the same environement (i.e. OS/RDBMS/Apprx. similar hardware); tell the users to do the testing; once everything is OK; than can i just move the entire BSE enviorment from the rented server to the existing live server or i will have to re-install c4 on the c3 env. as discussed earlier?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that  copy all the bse environment is not so easy:<br />
<br />
you have in the bse environment many data  about<br />
1)  compagnies linked to the database instances.<br />
2) structures of tables/domain/software = company 000<br />
3) runtime data <br />
if you copy the BSE environment you need also to the company 000 data.<br />
<br />
Therefor I suggest the following steps to migrate from rented server to production server (after  you have do all the testing phases): <br />
<br />
a) have the c4 environment ready + a dummy c3 VRC and copy therein your data dictionnaries from c3<br />
<br />
b) install the data from c3 in the dummy vrc  and change companies from VRC to reconfigure the tables<br />
<br />
c) backup  all BSE environment + database (data + software)  from c4 and reinstall on prod server ==&gt; you need a new licence validation key from baan : (AFAIK they are not open the weekend) . Also be carefully about the<br />
server names, production server need probably to be named as rented server.<br />
<br />
d) when you have the validation key patch your software ==&gt; now the users <br />
 can work.<br />

as suggested by pconde, steps (a) and (b) has to be taken in the rented server. and than the scenario will be like &quot;Relocating an Existing Enviornment to a new host&quot;.<br />
<br />
step (c) i.e. backup all BSE environment + database (data + software) from c4 and reinstall on prod server ...must be done on a new volume of the existing c3 server...<br />
i.e. restore all files in  BSE of rented server onto the new volume<br />
then, create another database instance <br />
then,restore data of company 000 and the live company data of rented c4 server.<br />
then, to login, in the BECS window give the details as per the new settings and login...then, validate baan <br />
then, open it for users.<br />
<br />
will the above necessiate validation of c4 twice (one time for the hardware+software combination of rented sever and second time for the upgraded server?<br />

will this work??? or am i missing something...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">20th November 2003, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
<br />
here an extract of the baan solution<br />
&quot;<br />
The Licence Server is a program (LICD) that listen to licence requests issued by running BSHELL's.<br />
<br />
It is a background process : On UNIX, it is called a daemon, on NT a service.<br />
You can monitor the activity of LICD by the following :<br />
The log files :<br />
Every user connection or disconnection is registered in the log files.<br />
UNIX : see ${BSE}/log/log.licdx.x , NT : Use the event viewer (eventvwr.exe)<br />
.<br />
.<br />
The Licence Server is completely independant from the Baan logic server (where BSHELL processes run).<br />
<br />
Once a machine is branded (i.e. the BAAN.LIC file has been created) the only necessary staff to run the Licence Server is :<br />
- An environment variable named 'BSE' that points to some directory<br />
- A sub directory named 'bin'<br />
- The LICD program in this directory<br />
- A sub directory named 'log' where log files will be created (Unix)<br />
<br />
The BAAN.LIC file (brand file) is read by the LICD program at startup, where all necessary information will be retrieved :<br />
- The hostname &amp; hostid of the NODE where the licence server should run<br />
- The NODE_LIST string (Network licence server)<br />
- The maximum number of concurrent users of each kind<br />
- The validated database drivers<br />
- The start and end date of validity<br />
- All other commercial configuration data.<br />
<br />
If the hostname of the machine where the LICD program resides is different from the information that is retrieved from the BAAN.LIC file,  the LICD program will delete the BAAN.LIC file and terminate.<br />
If this file is lost for whatever reason or if its modification time is changed, the LICD program will not run.<br />
You cannot restore the BAAN.LIC file from a tape or from disk backup.<br />
The only way to recover the BAAN.LIC file is to regenerate it using the BRANDx.x executable (see Section 3.02).<br />
<br />
<br />
1.05 - Connecting to a Licence Server<br />
=====================================<br />
When a BSHELL program is started, it retrieves the hostname specified in the licencex.x file and tries to resolve this name in an IP address using the local name resolving policy set on the server, and then uses this IP address for all subsequent licence requests.<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
So to use a licence server you need to set the hostname of this server in the licence6.1 file (in $BSE/lib) of the other server <br />
==&gt; this implies that the server name must be different.<br />
<br />
I have already do a  move from one server to another server without big problem.<br />
But there some table that need to be excluded from the move  (ttiex300000 and ttiedx301000 as I remember) and you need to update the $BSE/lib/licence6.1 file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms2002</div><div class="date">21st November 2003, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">lets say for example, <br />
the existing server name is &quot;C3SERVER&quot; with BSE=/c3/..and the licence6.1 wil have an entry as &quot;C3SERVER&quot;<br />
<br />
the new  rented server name is &quot;C4RENTEDSERVER&quot; with BSE=/c4rent/..and the licence6.1 will have the entry as &quot;C4RENTEDSERVER&quot; <br />
<br />
then when I copy i.e. restore all files in BSE of rented server onto the new volume say /c4/..of the existing server of then, create another database instance <br />
then,restore data of company 000 and the live company data of rented c4 server.<br />
<br />
Then the licence6.1 of this new BSE will  also be &quot;C4RENTEDSERVER&quot;...<br />
<br />
but since here the exsting c3 env. is up and running live.. if i change the server name....will it not be a problem? so i might as well name the rented server same as there existing c3 server (e.g. here &quot;C3SERVER&quot;)..<br />
<br />
<br />
What do we need to update in the $BSE/lib/licence6.1 file and of which server?<br />
<br />
What else should i change after the restore is done?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response..</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you export ttiex300 and ttiex301 from your c3 environment and import them into the c4, and then change your licence6.1 file to point to c3server<br />
you won't have to make any changes..<br />
And your c4 server will pull its licenses from the c3 license daemon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">21st November 2003, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest that you do the following.<br />
<br />
Install the baaIVc4 on the production server  in a new BSE and a new database instance. BaanIVc4 and c3  use the same licence.<br />
<br />
On the rented server install BaanIVc4  and use this server to do the migration testing and to prepare all for the migration. This server should use the production server as licence server. <br />
<br />
When you want to migrate<br />
a) copy the the rented server BSE to the BaanIVc4 environment on the production server,  except the licencse6.1 file   and the database runtime data (use these that are on the production server)<br />
<br />
b) export your company 000 (except the ttiex300 and ttiex301 tables and the databse defintion tables ) from the rented server and import in the<br />
 baanIVc4 (via bdbpost6.1)  on the  production server and test that you can restart the c4 environment.  Control that your data in tables and in runtime are the same: so that the day you redo a create runtime you should not loss all<br />
<br />
c) export you banIVc3 companies and import them in the dummy environment in baanIVc4<br />
<br />
d) change companies from VRC ==&gt; this reorganize your tables . Modify the user config :change  BSE from c3BSE to c4 BSE<br />
<br />
e) remove baanIVc3 environment and database tables<br />
<br />
Steps a and b can be done before the migration day<br />
<br />
Steps c and d are to be done on migration days<br />
<br />
Step e should be done later <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">22nd November 2003, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You can avoid  two installations but it is more complicated. Also if something fails you must do a complete system restore  :mad:<br />
<br />
a)  Database : on the two servers use the same database, same name o f instance, same version . Have all parametersr same. Be very carefully for the definition of the database  and database user in baan<br />
b) BSE path: must be the same on the two server. All  parameters must be the same  (printer names, database storage, companies definition, user  etc...)<br />
<br />
Migration:<br />
1)DO A BACKUP of the production system<br />
2) rented server : companies set to dummy VRC = baanIVc3 (don't forgot the runtimes)<br />
3) copy  BSE path  except licence6.1, and $BSE/lib/inf  from rented system to production system<br />
4) export company 000 and remove ttiex300 and ttiex301 on rented system<br />
5)import on production server the  company 000 . Reinitialize the shared memory  because it contains the old dict and  programs.<br />
now you have a baanIVc4 system  with the live companies  linked to  the dummy vrc --&gt; verify that you can  reach the data (by GTM by exemple)<br />
6) migrate company from VRC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms2002</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">i installed baanc4 on the existing server upto sp13.<br />
<br />
Than on the new c4 installation did the following:<br />
Created a c3old pack. comb., than created RDD<br />
Than, overwritten the c3old Datadictionary from the c3 enviornment data dictionary<br />
created company 500 and attached to c3old package combination<br />
did create table for company 500<br />
exported data of company 900 from old c3 server and imported into company 500<br />
did the tfgld9004m000 for company corrections<br />
<br />
This completed my old c3 enviorment in the c4 enviorment<br />
<br />
Now, for the c4 enviornment before running the change package combination by company, the scenario is something like this:<br />
in the old c3 enviornment there are many pack VRCs derived from standard c3 e.g.<br />
c3 loc derived from c3 std<br />
c3 ploc derived from c3loc<br />
c3 live derived fror c3ploc<br />
<br />
and i needed all this to be in the c4 also, so i did the following:<br />
c4loc derived from c4std , export all customised components from c3loc and import into c4loc and then create  RDD<br />
c4ploc derived from c4loc ,export all customised components from c3ploc and import into c4ploc and then create RDD<br />
c4live derived from c4ploc ,export all customised components from c3live and import into c4locand then creae RDD<br />
<br />
<br />
Than did the change package combination with this options:<br />
Old Package combination : c3old<br />
New package combination : c4new <br />
<br />
company from and to : 500<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While the change package combination was going on there was some network problems (I was doing all this from windows client <br />
<br />
and have posted a question in another posting of baanboard).<br />
<br />
<br />
I wanted to share all this . Any inputs ...if I had missed any steps or anything else need to be done??<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the inputs</div></div><hr />

<br />
All seems good for me .<br />
One point : when you migrate the customized development data from c3 to c4 don't forget that if some of these scripts are derived from baan c3 scripts you 'll need to restart the customization from the baan c4  scripts.<br />
<br />
If all your customization are new development then you can import then directly in customized c4 environment.<br />
<br />
Same things for the tables and domain<br />
