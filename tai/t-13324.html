Owing to an error of MPS calculating, our consultant advises us to migrate from SP7 to SP9 to fix this error, does anyone know the minimum requirements that our machine must to have? and, installing SP9 means a great decrease in performance?<br />

Thanks for all,<br />

There was overall no loss in performance and the server we used was exactly the same.  Most sessions probably ran a little better but 1 or 2 were a little slower - e.g. Generate MRP with a type of &quot;net change&quot; is slower than we had in 4c3 as it seems to go through more steps.</div></div><hr />
