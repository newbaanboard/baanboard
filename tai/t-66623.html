<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th July 2014, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Anybody experience any issues using NFS mounted volumes with Audit Logs? 2 or 3 weeks ago we went from a local mounted drive on the UNIX server to an NFS mounted directory for the Baan installation.  Most things are running just fine.  We do have a couple of weekly sessions that run in batch that now are running really slow - I think it has to do with the Audit logs. For example the audit logs are  /apps/baan/baanfour/tables/auditcom.  One session is tpptc1230m000 - generate control data.  Another is tibom1213m10b - update low level codes.  tibom1213m10b aborted because of a stale NFS handle.  Now tpptc1230m000 ran into several issues - it aborted because of log files already existing, unable to flush to file, etc.   <br />
<br />
The big kicker is tpptc1230m000 ran without errors this past weekend - but it ran for 33 hours.  This is normally a 1 to 2 hour job. I can't imagine just mounting a directory as NFS would cause this type of slow down.  The only thing I can think to try is copy of the log files and start over from .000 sequence. We have an application server and database server both running solaris.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really don't have any ideas but just thought to add a quick comment. Tried to Google about system slowness due to NFS mounting and seems like people have faced similar issues. You can cross check and let the admin team know about those related issues and fixes.</div></div><hr />
