<br />
I have just reached the maximum text number in my system. What must I do to reset the text number back to 1?<br />
<br />
After resetting the number back to 1, I plan to delete records with text number 1 to 100000 in tttxt010 table. These records are old text which should be deleted. <br />
<br />
Is there a procedure we need to do once the textnumber reaches maximum after 8 years of using baan?<br />
<br />
Thanks n regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">30th October 2006, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I really do hope that I'm wrong, but ... I think you have a big problem. I strongly recommend to contact baan support (at least in parallel to this board). &quot;Cleaning&quot; tttxt010 will not be enough!<br />
<br />
What I did: I took my test system, set TT_SQL_TRACE to 040 and created a new text to see how baan determines the next text number. That gave:<br />
<br />
select  tttxt030.*<br />
                where  tttxt030.txtg = :txtg<br />
<br />
select  tttxt001.ctxt<br />
                where tttxt001.ctxt inrange :tttxt030.fnum and :tttxt030.lnum<br />
                order by tttxt001.ctxt desc<br />
                as set with 1 rows<br />
<br />
<br />
So, &quot;cleaning&quot; your tttxt001, 002, 010 and some others wil be the one thing to be done (and it might last a very long time). And hopefully you can &quot;reset&quot; the text number ranges via the table tttxt030.<br />

<br />
There must be a way to solve my problem. If your comment is correct, then I just cannot delete the text numbers 1 to 100000 from the tables tttxt001, tttxt002 and tttxt010. If I do this, my last text number is still 99999999. So how will the system know to reset the number back to 1?<br />
<br />
I cannot delete the later numbers because they are the current text that is needed. I only can delete the text in 1 to 100000.<br />
<br />
Somebody must have faced this before. Help!<br />
<br />
Thanks n regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
some thougts:<br />
<br />
In my point of view it is not possible to delete old text numbers, because, what are old text numbers???<br />
<br />
You can specify e.g. a sales order footer text used for every order with textnumber 100, in your scenario this would be deleted.<br />
<br />
Maybe the following session is helpfull.<br />
<br />
tttxt1210m000 Delete unused texts<br />
<br />
It only solves your problem if it reduces your last number, because as far as i know textnumber is the next highest number based on tttxt001.<br />
<br />

<br />
Can someone test whether you have this session tttxt0130m000 in your system. Baan support says to use this session to set range of text numbers for text groups. But when i try to run this session, it says cannot start session. I go and check and there are no objects for this session in my system. So can someone test this on their baan 4 servers and send me the object of this session if it is available in your site.<br />
<br />
Thanks n regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">31st October 2006, 10:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yip, it's there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">31st October 2006, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup the session is available under Text Maintenance. Its the one at the end of this menu. What service pack are you running on? The availability of this session could do with your not having the latest service pack. For reference purposes, i am on Baan 4c4 SP 18..<br />
<br />
sk<br />
<br />
P.S: I did think of this session but in the table txt010, there are just Four fields namely Text Number, Language, Number of Lines, Text Line. I dont see any text group in here. So if you want to put a range, you would have to free up some text numbers like how you said (1 to 100000) and then give that range to the text group. So it would be interesting to see how your problem gets solved...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can someone send me the object for tttxt0130m000. I think this session setups the range of text numbers in a new table and not tttxt010. Can someone check which table that is. Tell me the table number and I will check whether i have it or not.<br />

Gunther, please tell me what service pack are you on. SP18 ??<br />

I am not sure how this table is going to benefit you as it only stores the Text Group, First Text No. and Last Text No. <br />

What service pack are you on as of now?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">31st October 2006, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Kingsto88,<br />
<br />
using session tttxt0130m000 sounds the best solution for your problem. You only have to change the textgroups for the newly created texts having number range in the deleted area. (we have the session, running sp 19). The reason for the session regarding to baan help is exchanging data with audit to different baan instances avoiding conflicts with text numbers (using a preserved range) otherwise the numbering of target company could overrule your textnumers from source company.<br />
<br />
The what command on otxt130 shows a creation date 04/02/04 .<br />
<br />
If it does not work maybe another (but very complex) solution could be:<br />
<br />
Delete unneeded Texts, identify the tables using the still relevant texts, export Data from the tables, delete all texts, import the tables with exchange module and create the text newly while importing (skiping non existings texts).<br />
<br />
OR by programming:<br />
<br />
Write a program per textnumber, stores the text (in all languages) and the referenced tables in a seq file. Deleting all texts -&gt; Importing the text, starting with new numbering and supporting the tables with the newly numbers. (programming not to complex, but testing ...)<br />
