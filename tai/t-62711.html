<br />
Currently I'm working on writing an app for licence management, controlling amount of connections to bshell.<br />
<br />
I've managed to solve the issue with putting my app between BW and bshell in ipc_info, it's beeing executed and from my middleware I'm invoking ntbshell.exe.<br />
It works fine, I'm able to handle upcomming connections and allow/deny them according to my logic.<br />
<br />
The problem I'm working now is how to send a message with notification to user about blocking the connection. <br />
<br />
When I won't invoke ntbshell.exe I get a BW message &quot;Connection to server lost&quot;<br />
<br />
Tracing network packets in situations of other BW messages ex. no ipc_boot file found the message is send as plain text to BW.<br />
<br />
I was trying to write to output of my middleware, which reads from process child output (ntbshell) error messages, but they are not passed. It even looks like the standard input/output of ntbshell is not beeing used, as when I disable message pipes which are handling the communication between parent and child processes, it works as well.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea how can I send a BW message without starting an actuall bshell process, or any other way of handling communication here ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
unfortunately I can´t assist you in solving your question. But in a first place I´m interested how you created your middleware (programming language). If possible would you share your solution?</div></div><hr />
