<br />
We have a user with an HP 940c inkjet printer that is hooked to a parallel printer port on a lap top. For some reason, I cannot for the life of me, get the baanprt function to work. I have populated the local DNS settings, tried each different port setting, and updated the driver, still nothing. Usually baanprt is no big deal, I don't understand why it is not working. Does anyone out there have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Are you printing via BWprint or do a print in reflection while redirecting the data send to the screen to the printer?<br />
<br />
In the latter case, check the TERM setting and the settings in terminf.<br />

With any session that I am trying to print, the local client gets no print out from session. So he runs his session, when prompted for output device he selects baanprt and everything looks normal but there is no printout. Client has Windows 98 SE - other apps print fine to the HP 940c inkjet.</div></div><hr />
