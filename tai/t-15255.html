<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheYaz</div><div class="date">6th May 2004, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi. <br />
I just moved the Baan IVc4 app to another server which was running on NT4.0 and SQL Server 7.0 to a server running Windows 2000 and SQL Server 2000. Along with this, the db was splitted in two data files on the original server, but that is not the problem. I am now stuck when opening any session in tools, I get an error message &quot;Activating subsession not possible.&quot; I suspect some security issue but I can't locate the files in the baan subfolders containing the authorizations.<br />
<br />
For example, if  I try to run the ttaad4100 from the run menu, I get &quot;no permission&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can somebody guide me into where to look?<br />
(Baan support wants me to refer to ESS (Extended Support Services) which we are not willing yet to go to.<br />
<br />
I the install of the application from the CD and then moved over subfolders.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help or clues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The authorizations are mostly in the database and not in files.<br />
Some authorization information is stored per user in $BSE/lib/user/u&lt;USERNAME&gt;.<br />
<br />
You get a menu, that means your database access is ok!<br />
<br />
what did you do about validation?<br />
<br />
This might be the cause of your problem. You can try the following two things:<br />
<br />
a) Point the licence6.1 file to your local server. Run session &quot;patch objects after system crash&quot;. This session can be executed without a licence daemon running, if your tools objects were validated at some point in time.<br />
<br />
b) Start the licence daemon on your old server and point the licence6.1 file to the old server. This way you will run with the old licence.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Just noticed another two things:<br />
<br />
a) It says &quot;subsession&quot;. This might give us a hint. Look into your event viewer, which subsession it can not start.<br />
<br />
b) You said: You installed from CD and then you copied the subfolders<br />
<br />
If you copied tools and application , then you need to also load the company 000 from your old Baan server. Otherwise you have a lot of inconistencies with VRC's, PMC, Customizations etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheYaz</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I just tried pointing the licence and no change.<br />
<br />
I did move over company 000 data. The problem started when I copied the whole {BSE}\lib folder along with the tools folder.<br />
<br />
I cannot start any sessions in tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheYaz</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Forgot to mention that the Event Viewer doesn't show any error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, copying the whole lib, was maybe a bit too much.<br />
<br />
I would take a step back and copy selectively. Bit by Bit, this way you will also know, what is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
In general you will need to copy the following inside lib:<br />
<br />
a) the fd* files<br />
<br />
These file contain the pathes to your SW, here might be also part of the problem, if these pathes changed.<br />
<br />
b) the directory msql, which contains your database users etc.<br />
<br />
This seems to be ok, otherwise you would get no menu.<br />
<br />
c) the user directory<br />
<br />
This contains the user runtime.<br />
<br />
If the problem occurs after copying this one, then compare the u&lt;USER&gt; file.<br />
<br />
<br />
d) the tabledef6.1 for the table assignments<br />
<br />
The rest is more or less not needed urgently!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your help, I will keep you posted!<br />
<br />
FYI - I also managed to  get an error in the event viewer when trying to run a session from the run menu:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheYaz</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The last event viewer error put me on the track. In table ttadv999, I copied the value in the field t_desc over the value on the records of Package Combination OPER_001 with the value of the records of Package Combination B40Sc4.<br />
<br />
The user file has to be changed also with the proper Package Combination.<br />
<br />
We will see from now on what happens!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the hints, helped out fingering what was the problem.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you forgettd to run the session ttiex3225m000.</div></div><hr />
