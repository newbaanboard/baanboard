<br />
I've got this session (BaanERP b)cprrp1210m000 (Simulate orders), and I added it to a task to be executed at night.<br />
I know this session has a progress indicator, but I've been ckecking all the morning, and the progress indicator ain't showing. :mad: How can I know if it is running, or just hanged?<br />
Is there any &quot;bshcmd&quot; option to see its activity?<br />
Please, send me all kind of suggestions.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can, start the ttstpshell process (via Option Dialog - Start Shell) and press ps for the process list. Starting ps again will offer you the possibility to see changes in the process list.<br />
<br />
If you succeed, then the bshell process does respond and you can see what processes do get processor ticks. If it is ttstpshell only that adds up ticks, then the other processes either died or wait for input.<br />
<br />
If you cannot go to the option dialog (because it is a background job process) you can try to do the same with the bshcmd binary, you need to know the pid of that particular bshell though.<br />
<br />
If you do not succeed, then with bshell command you cannot reach the bshell either...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guilmor</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Yet I saw increasing ticks for process cprrp1210m000, but there is another process elated to this one, named rcprrp1210110015 (a report, I suppose) which ins't getting any ticks.<br />
Maybe that process is stopping the whole job.<br />
<br />
I think I should stop it.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

From what you describe the session spends a lot of time gathering information and is not collecting enough to pass it on to the report.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what session you are actually running, but try limiting the parameters somewhat for testing purposes.</div></div><hr />
