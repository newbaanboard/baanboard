<br />
I am using Infor Office Integration with Windows 7 to communicate with an LN FP5 machine.<br />
<br />
I've got no problems with using the OI in Win XP and Office 2007.<br />
<br />
I get the error as attached in Win 7 and Excel 2007 when I try to create a New ERP template... There was an earlier error where the Office Integration will not work to find the URL of my bus.xml. I fixed this by allowing the Central Configuration Console to run as administrator. But now I seem to be having some connectivity issues.<br />
<br />
I have no problem using Worktop to connect to the LN server from this same Win 7 machine. It is just the office 2007 giving me this issue.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any help on this. Win 7 seems to be rather a pain to deal with.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ian</div></div><hr />

To create template we have to start the tmboaserver on the client for US. I am not sure your setup is the same as ours. We dont use central configuration.<br />
<br />
But rest everything being the same if it works in XP, then it could be a win 7 issue. May be you need some upgraded OI components? I have to upgrade BW client when we went on WIn 7, may be there is an upgrade for OI as well??</div></div><hr />
