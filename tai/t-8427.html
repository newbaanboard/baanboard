<br />
We have a test server currently running BaanIVc4 we would like to install Baan5.0C to evaluate.  <br />
<br />
If it is possible what should I watch out for?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">15th January 2003, 00:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your main worry besides capacity - which is not really an issue I assume since it's for evaluation purposes - is the licensing problem. However since BaanIV and BaanV use different brand files, you are safe there. Just make sure you are installing into a separate database instance and that you have your application-database connectivity configured correctly (e.g. Oracle SQL*net)</div></div><hr />

<br />
An odd problem occurred when they were trying to performance boosters on Baan V (&quot;Unable to start application server&quot;).  It seems that the booster setup gets confused if you have both versions installed (really, if you have multiple bshells at all installed I think).  There's a couple of cases on the support site:<br />

<br />
The systems are completely sepatate and have no common files. Their data bases are also separate oracle instances. <br />
<br />
However they can  both access an external test database/company. (TWO_TASK)</div></div><hr />

Do your folks run a 'museum' of Baan? :)</div></div><hr />

We've got a seperate development-server for our external customers. And taking in account the fact that we have several customers with several Baan-versions (and OS's, and databases)...<br />
<br />
Most of the time it's a beautiful thing, though, to be able to work in such a &quot;museum&quot;; it certainly broadens ones experience...<br />

<br />
I am facing one of those Catch22 situations.  My company won't look at BaanERP without a business need and yet they can't know what 5C can do for them without looking at it.<br />
<br />
So...I have the space (1.6 Tb) finally to play with and fully intend on taking advantage of it as time permits.<br />

The museum seems to be missing Triton2.2;)</div></div><hr />
