<br />
I am by no means a Baan V expert, but do you need conversion tools for this?<br />
<br />
I would guess the following would be enough:<br />
<br />
a) Install or copy Baan V Sp12 to windows. If you copy your Baan to windows, you obviously have to replace the portingset and do some tweaking (with pathes, printers, ...) to get it running.<br />
<br />
b) Dump your data from unix and load it into windows<br />
<br />
c) install up to Sp16 on windows.<br />
<br />
Ok, I left some details. But in principal this should do.<br />
<br />
Am I wrong?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

you need the conversion tool from Baan, to convert tables from 50b to 50c.<br />
There are some new tables in 50c, where data from 50b must split over the new tables.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">meirmiller</div><div class="date">16th December 2004, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
Baan has a conversion tool to migrate BaanERP 5b to 5c,<br />
however this is not a straigh forward process:<br />
Due to data definition changes between various service packs,<br />
you will need Baan company changing/accommodating the exisiting<br />
conversion tool to reflect a conversion from 5b sp12 to 5c sp15.<br />
I used this tool (documentaion is on Baan site), to migrate from 5b sp10, to 5c sp13, with the required changes , and this is a different package (the migration programs) from the one to use from 5b sp6 to 5c sp10, for example.<br />
I migrated from 5b sp10 to 5c sp13 a year ago. it was quite smooth, yet very long (depends on the size of your database)<br />
<br />
I assume Baan company has a base line for the migration program, and it updates it according to client's version.<br />
<br />
You may begin with email to migrationsolution@baan.com (I did) in order to<br />
jump start the process.<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

1) From Baan 5b we migrated to Baan 5c SP 9 allmost year back.<br />
2) I installed Baan5c as seperate instance from scratch, that is started from new porting sets, master Baan CDs and on top of it service packs. That process went very smooth.<br />
3) Created pacakge combinations &amp; companies just like our production and loaded our customizations.<br />
4) Identified modified tables in Baan5c compared to Baan5b. Since we have lot of customized tables (by IBM), IBM created migration scripts to export and import the data from Baan5b to Baan5c for modified tables.<br />
5) Overall we didn't find many modified table definitions in Baan5c (that depends on what modules you are using-we are using Finance &amp; Distribution) Non modified tables were exported &amp; imported by exchange schemes.<br />
<br />
Check with Baan &quot;Migration team&quot; to get help on step 4.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />
