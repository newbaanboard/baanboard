<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">2nd May 2012, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious if anyone has been successful with Xerox printers (ex. model 4600) on ERP-LNn printing via Unix device (as opposed to bw print)?   If so, what setup/config do you have set on the physical printer and what ERP-LN printer driver are you using?  A business colleague is having challenges so I thought I'd ask on his behalf.  I was suprised as I thought most laser/multifucntion printers would at least emulate HP PCL -- but I hear it is not working and I have not taken a detailed look at yet.</div></div><hr />
