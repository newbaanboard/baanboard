We have incorporated a session(ttstpchngepw) to all user when they used to login every time. Because they can able to change their own password by themselves. It is working successfully. But due to audit requirement the password has to be change in every 30days. Users often forgot to change their password within 30 days and we have family over 1000 users, so it has become very difficult to make habit of user to change the password in regular interval.<br />
We want to create a display session as a reminder to acknowledge the user how many days left to expire the password. <br />
For example, when windows password expires in next 15th days a message will pop ups at the time of login “14 days left to expire your password, Do you want to change it now?”<br />
Actually I couldn’t find the log file, in which the date has been stored when user had been changed his password. Please help if you have any idea to resolve this issue. <br />
I am attaching the screenshot  to show the change password session.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your suggestion.<br />
<br />
Regards-<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">9th July 2012, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We've activated the password aging when using the Windows-client (for Baan4) some month ago. I think Baan4 is already able to handle your request, by just using the standard. (It seems you included a Baan4 hardcopy in your wordfile.)<br />
<br />
You may need to updates some tool-sessions, to get the latest version of session ttstppwdaging. This session will do the trick, when inserted in the BMS Mask Data.<br />
<br />
The thession ttstppwdaging will use the aging-data of the OS-users used by the Baan4-Server (it takes the information of the used user-accounts, so the server involved may not be the Baan4-Server itself).<br />
<br />
We're using Baan 4 running on a Suse Linux Server. The aging question didn't come up as expected, so I opened an Infor365-case. We received extensive explanations (with testing and debugging information for Unix), which are available in KB 1116764.<br />
The solution will also name other solution for setup and the latest component-updates.<br />
<br />
We had to change the password-aging setup of the users in Suse Linux. Somehow the &quot;countdown&quot; prior to 30 days didn't work. But we activated an option which allowed the users to change their password after the 30 days (i.e. after 30 days the users will see a window on Baan-login telling them, to change their password within 10 days).<br />
<br />
If you're using windows you may need to check Infor-support on specific info.<br />
<br />
