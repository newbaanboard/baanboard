<br />
Is there anybody have experiense on DUE ?<br />
<br />
When I run the data upgrade engineer, I got the error as: <br />
No Actual model about task 'tcsptdll1922'.<br />
It was related to table tcemm030.<br />
<br />
Anybody have ideas on how to solve it?<br />
Thanks.<br />

Did you check the pre-installation instructions in the upgrade document and performed them?<br />
<br />
In the newer versions there are new tables in tcemm, do you use logical tables? Have you shared these new tables?</div></div><hr />

I think I got this error once, too. Had to manually enter the business units in session tcemm0130m000 before running the DUE. You have to do this per company if you are upgrading more than one company.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

Any way, your solution is a nice solution.<br />
