<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MatthewJames</div><div class="date">3rd July 2002, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to setup a wide tractor A3 Dot matrix printer.<br />
<br />
I can set the printer up ok, but I cannot seem to get the printer to print reports that fit on the paper and Baan outputs most standard reports with bold areas and this causes the printer to slow down.<br />
<br />
I just want to be able to output a standard draft quality print.<br />
<br />
Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check if the printer inf file contains a escape sequence for bold font. If it not available than Baan tries to turn bold on by printing the same character more than once by using a backspace between the characters. That slows down the printing a lot!<br />

<br />
I think if you're already using the windows generic driver there's probably not much more you can do.<br />
<br />
We were very quickly forced down a shared HP route after go live.<br />

Sorry not a  great answer I know.<br />

<br />
We tend to use HP 5000's for departments that require a bit of power and the smaller 1200's with a network box where we can get away with it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Is there any way that I can get baan to output to select a specific tray on a printer or would that have to be in the printer defaults for automation purposes?<br />
<br />
We have a A3 laser printer (tray 4) I was just wondering weather we could use that without getting the message that the report won't fit on paper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">3rd July 2002, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't have thought that would be possible through bwprint. Although you can control the orientation easily enough.<br />
<br />
Is the only reason you want to use A3 the message about the report not fitting on the paper ?<br />
<br />
Where does this message appear and what sort of report are you trying to print ?<br />
<br />

Bwprint say's it wont fit on A3 and it actually won't unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">3rd July 2002, 17:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Any chance you could format the report.<br />
<br />
Strip down descriptions, names etc and change the format of the quantity / value fields.<br />

<br />
Defining they standard tray is easy on Unix. On Nt you probably have to define this in the printer driver. However I currently have a problem with defining within the printer driver that the print should be printed twice, but bwprint resets this always to 1. <br />
<br />
So I am not sure if this will work on nt (but it should).<br />
<br />
On Unix you can simple change the init code in the printinf file. <br />
<br />
Message regarding that the report doesn't fit lays in the combination the number of chars defined within your report and the paper size of the paper defined in the printer device.<br />
<br />

could you not set a printer that prints to a file and trigger a batch file to duplicat this print and then sent it to another printer? I know it sounds a bit long winded but it should work? <br />

Locale = ISO-8859-1<br />
4GLProgram = ttstpconv<br />
argument = ASCII:c:\ASCIIPRN.BAT%s<br />
Path = Fileout<br />
<br />
then you have to create a text file as c:\asciiprn.bat with contents as <br />

PAUSE<br />
ECHO %0 %1 %2 %3 %4<br />
PAUSE<br />
COPY %1 LPT1: /B<br />
PAUSE<br />
DEL %1<br />
<br />
I think this will solve solve your problem of printing as draft quality.</div></div><hr />
