<br />
B40c4/SQL2000/Win2000<br />
<br />
we did one restore process and had a funny problem in terms of  time it takes to complete the process.<br />
<br />
First,<br />
====<br />
we ran create sequential dump from tables (10 different coys).<br />
36 table dumps run using 36 individual sessions (ttaad4227m000 parallely).<br />
<br />
It took 23 Hrs <br />
<br />
(SQL 2000 processor settings: Use 1 Processor we actually have 2 processors installed)<br />
<br />
<br />
Later,<br />
=====<br />
we changed the SQL2000 processor settings : to use all available processors; 2 CPUs)<br />
We ran the same create sequential dump<br />
Now we created 36 different Jobs and activated all the 36 jobs parallely with different log-ins.<br />
<br />
It took now 45 Hrs ??????????????;   <br />
<br />
Where as with two processors now, we expected it to take less than initial 23 Hrs.<br />
<br />
Any clues fnds. We are not able to commit time required for  migration to users.<br />
<br />
Highly appreciate your inputs URGENT<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">4th August 2003, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">There are too many unanswered questions for anyone to give you an informed reason why this is taking so long.  <br />
<br />
1. what clockspeed are your servers<br />
2. 36 tables dumps ... does this mean 36 individual tables or companies?<br />
3. how big are these dumps (in Gig) each ... what format are they?  What is the current size of the db, vs what it will be after creation.<br />
4. I guess you're using a level 1 driver since you're using c4 .. slower than level 2, but shouldn't take this long<br />
5. what kind of drives are you writing to?  raid ?? what? what is the capacity?<br />
6. how is your SQLServer db configured?  how about turning off transaction logging when you do your writing?<br />
7. what is the CPU of app server and db servers when you are running this .. are you running this as the only user logged on the servers?  What else is going on?<br />
8. you have to remember that running these things in parellel doesn't matter much since this is an I/O bottleneck, so you have to look at I/O first to see if you are pegged.<br />
<br />
Without knowing what your hardware is, the description of slow is relative ... it makes a difference whether you are running a two tiered system with 2.4GHz quad CPU's vs a one tiered on a Commadore-64.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhatia_rk</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Also in bdbpost there is an option to load data without building indexes simultaneously. The indexes are created after the complete table data is loaded. We found that using this option the time is cut down very substantially (especially for large tables with large number of rows).<br />

<br />
yes it is relative.<br />
<br />
I am keeping no other varaibilities between the FIRST and LATER Scenarios. I was confuse why should it take more time on the LATER scenario.<br />
<br />
Also, we found initially for about 2 Hrs the CPU utilisation % was about 70-85%, but then it dropped to 40-50%. Why 100% CPU time could not be utilised...?<br />
<br />
<br />
=====configuration and data volume========<br />
Our Data is :<br />
<br />
from 12 different coys (dump.100, dump.200, dump.300 etc..)<br />
Sequential dumps, total size of about 13 GB.  <br />
SQL db size of about 70 G B.<br />
<br />
Our configuration is :<br />
<br />
Baan B40c4 SP13 / SQL2000 SP3 MDAC rolled back to 2.6 / Win2000.<br />
<br />
SQL Database and App Logic on the same server<br />
CPU 2.4 GHz Xeon<br />
2 Processors<br />
Ram 2.0 GB<br />
<br />
<br />
SQL 2000 Databse Settings:<br />
Dynamic memory and not FIXED<br />
Use Windows NT fibres and not boost SQL priority on windows<br />
Use all available processors<br />
Default Index Fill factor : not fixed left to default<br />
baandb properties: <br />
Unrestricted file growth<br />
Transaction Log AutoShrink enabled, <br />
Auto update statistics enebled, Auto create statistics enabled<br />
<br />
Win2000 settings<br />
Performance Options: <br />
Application Response Optimize performance for : Background services and not Applications<br />
Paging size : Initial 2GB Max 4GB<br />
<br />
can hint any optimisation or obvious reasons for the slow response and CPU not used 100%  please<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
I think you are hinting about the &quot;Create Rows before Index option&quot; in Create tables from sequential dump (ttaad4227m000) session&quot;.<br />
<br />
We did not enable this option as the help reads &quot;in case of interruption it will result in data inconsistency&quot;<br />
<br />
though i will give it a try<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
Maybe it has to do with: how has your database been configured.<br />
Did you store the data for the financial tables into a separate tablespace? <br />
Also the rest of the data into a separate tablespace?<br />
Do you a bdbpost, at the same time, to several disks instead of writing to one disk?<br />
<br />
