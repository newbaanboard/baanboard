<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">25th June 2013, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Running Baan 5c with SP26 and Porting set is 8.8a.02 as I can see in Version Scan. Windows help files used to work with no problem but since some time, windows help files are not looked at. Always ASCII help opens. I have made sure the template linked to my user data and the template itself has correct path to help files.<br />
<br />
In the past, if the help file path is mistake, pressing F1 on a session will give a message it cannot find help files but it does not now. It is clear windows help is not at all looked at when pressing F1. Is there any way I can get it working. Is it a known problem? Thanks.</div></div><hr />
