<br />
Just want to get your insight. Our client is going to migrate to AIX environment. The existing server is HP-UX 11. Oracle 10g is installed together with LN FP3 on the same server.<br />
<br />
A search on InforXtreme points us to document U9189A US - How to move an Infor ERP environment to another host. Inside, Infor actually suggested that we use Sequential Dump Files to transfer the data to the new server.<br />
<br />
Our concern is that the data size is too big (2TB); it will take a long time to complete the export and import of the sequential dump files. Therefore we look at another way; to use Oracle Migration tool.<br />
<br />
Basically what we want to do is to restore the backup from the old server to the new server. Due to little knowledge on Oracle DB, we're unable to test the exact scenario. For now, we're testing with SQL Server 2008 R2 instead. We believe that if we could make it work in SQL Server, Oracle might have its' own way of doing the same thing. We might be wrong though.<br />
<br />
So, my questions are:<br />
<br />
1) How do you deal with 000 company? Do we need to manually alter the tables so the values confirm with the new server config?<br />
2) Is this way feasible? Or is it going to be about the same as sequential dump import?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
<br />

Since the oracle will be running on a different architecture you can't copy database files (at least to my knowledge). So you have to export/import the data. That will be probably more quickly with oracle tools although you can write scripts to export /import with bdbpre/bdbpost in parallel too. Done that before.<br />
<br />
Main steps to perform:<br />
1. install oracle<br />
2. install portingset, use same setup as on old server<br />
3. copy $BSE to new server<br />
4. restore data<br />
<br />
There are several files that needs to be changed during this procedure, they are placed in $BSE/lib.<br />
<br />
My advice: hire some one who has done this before and let him/her tell you what to do so you can perform it the next time yourself. This will save you a lot of time and frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokmanNW</div><div class="date">6th February 2014, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Sir for your input. I did as you told and the migration exercise went smooth. Gotta try this again with Oracle. <br />
<br />
On the &quot;restore data portion&quot;, this is what I did:<br />
<br />
On the old server:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Stop LN services.<br />
 Bring the LN DB offline<br />
 Copy out the x.mdf and x.ldf files and put them in the new server<br />
<br />
<br />
On the new server:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Put the x.mdf and x.ldf to the DATA folder (in Program Files\MSSQL\...)<br />
 Attach database in Management Studio (and point them to the files in (1)) - I used a different DB name and DB group name for the sake of testing.<br />
 Make amendments to a few files in $BSE\lib and $BSE\bin (to ensure the hostname, instance name are correct) as told in document U9189A.<br />
 Start up LN server<br />
 Try out the sessions. On ttsit0100m000, correct values are displayed (for hostname, portingset version, DB instance name, etc).<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll test out with Oracle and report the result later. Hopefully the steps are similar :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But did you change the values in the application too? Because if not than after a convert to runtime you end up with the old values and a system that doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Copying an oracle database is a totally different process (google 'clone oracle database') and, as far as I know, that doesn't work  if you are going to run it on a different architecture.</div></div><hr />

However for oracle you need to implement this for all tables meaning you have to export/import with the infor tools.</div></div><hr />
