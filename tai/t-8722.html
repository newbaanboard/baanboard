<br />
Is it possible to get a Bwclient (Windows NT) system process ID in some way?<br />
<br />
I have this problem with a function server that never closes the option window after execution from an Ole application. Ottstpoledaemon isn't clean for some reason. <br />
So I'm trying to kill &quot;bw.exe&quot; at the end using API Windows functions. That is easy, but I can have several ole applicattions running in paralell (means several instances of bw) so I need to know exactly the process Id. Unless there is a way to kill ottstpoledaemon without hanging the ole application. :cool:<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of a really ugly solution if the above isn't possible. I can send the calling application process ID through the Ole interface and then create a main window with that ID in the title. This is because I can have access to a process main window title through Windows API. But this would be my last case cenario.<br />
:rolleyes:.<br />
<br />
PS: I have tried several approaches to get ottstpoledaemon clean in a normal fashion to no success. We have other ole/AFS servers closing without problems. I have traced the problem to a tdpur4120m000/tdpur4131s000 interface code section; the code is correct and executes cleanly but for some reason it makes the ottstpoledaemon process hang at the end.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

AFAIR there was something like MKS ToolKit for NT.<br />
This software allows you to use lots of unix-like commands including &quot;ps&quot;, which seems to be exactly what you need.<br />
There is a similar package called cygwin which is free (IIRC MKS Toolkit was veeery expensive), but I don't know whether cygwin will give you control over all processes as well.<br />

I have access to all the processes in the system through code but I need to associate a bw process to an application process. Because I can have multiple application ole processes I have to know exactly which bw process maps to each application.</div></div><hr />

Here you will need the pid of the ntbshell... Running bshells do have a file bshell.[pid] in the %BSE%\tmp directory.</div></div><hr />
