<br />
I have used ttiex1284m000 to install a patch(CESS for in5), i used create RDD for Tables, Sessions, Forms and Menus.<br />
<br />
The Tables are not getting created when I go to Create Tables, it gives 512 error in GTM mode for the table.<br />
<br />
I did all this in the package comb B40Uc4in since all india localisations update should be for this package comb. Right??<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">11th February 2005, 11:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I've made the experience that the ttadv502  for creating runtime DD is not filled correctly using ttiex1284m000... . The result after create Runtime DD is error 512 (no runtime DD). You can fill the table manually or go into the table, insert a new field, save and delete the field. After this the table has a new entry and Convert to runtime DD will work. <br />
Not the easiest/best way, but the only I know. <br />
<br />
If anybody knows a better way, please let me know (I have to do this very often and I really don't like it  :mad: ...)!<br />
<br />

Sorry: ttadv502, not ttaad502</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously, then he might as well perform a &quot;create runtime&quot; compared to a &quot;convert runtime&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chingi</div><div class="date">15th February 2005, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">As u r installing a localization patch .... you will install it in a localization update vrc using session Import Patch...<br />
<br />
Then make sure following things<br />
There is know records available in ttadv501,502,503,504&amp;505 tables<br />
There is no file present with name as 'R.&lt;table name&gt;' in $BSE/tmp. If so then rename it.<br />
<br />
Import the localizatin patch.<br />
Perform Create Runtime for Domains only<br />
Relogin <br />
Perform Create Runtime for Domains, Tables &amp; Sessions with option 'Reconfigure tables' set to YES.<br />
Relogin<br />
Start sesstion Create Tables to create new table introduced in the patch.<br />
<br />
Following above steps would resolve the problem</div></div><hr />

Please fill your appropriate profile, so that, it will be more easy to understand your problem.<br />
<br />
As suggested by chingi, your problem should resolve. Ok, If the problem still exists and you are using M$ system, you may need to restart shared memory or you may restart your app. server (Yes, No worries about it!)<br />
<br />
If problem still exists, post here the event viewer error message.<br />
<br />
I recently performed installation of CESS/Service Tax/VAT on IN3/IN5 perfectly. Still the new patches are coming.<br />
<br />
If you are asking, which is correct VRC for installing localisation patches, sorry, but it depends on your VRC structure/customisations, seems update localisation is ok.<br />
<br />
