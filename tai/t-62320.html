Hello,<br />
<br />
it specifies if the user, linked to the &quot;user data template&quot;, can branch to a session or a shell.<br />
<br />
Values : NO , UNIX, PROGRAM<br />
<br />
For normal user i think, it's recommend to set to &quot;NO&quot;.<br />
If setting to Unix, the user is able to start a shell at the application server by right mouse click on ICON in taskbar.<br />
<br />

<br />
Could you please explain the statement:- <br />
&quot;can branch to a session or a shell.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have observed that even if I attach a user data template with a user, which has shell command type as NO, still the user can start shell by right clicking d infor icon at d bottom-right corner after login.<br />
<br />
One thing to be mentioned here is , I am experimenting with a super user. should test with normal user? does this shell command has no effect on super user?<br />
<br />
Also what would be the settings and consequence for shell command type session?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
Super User always only should be a System-Admin or Developer.<br />
A Super-User has no restrictions !<br />
<br />
All other should be Normal-User, so that you're able to use specific rights for e.g. Sessions, Tables, Tablefields a.s.o.<br />
<br />
