<br />
I am facing a strange problem related to job which is executed by job daemon. What happens is Job Daemon executed the job once and the status of job changes from InQue to Free. I have done following:<br />
<br />
1.created a calendra and spefied time interval as 10:15, 10:30 and 10:45 for specific date<br />
2.created a job and attached the calender and specified the job as periodical<br />
3.added the session to job<br />
4.changed job status to InQue<br />
<br />
then the job daemon executed the job at 10:15 am but then status of job changed to Free and damon did not execute the job at 10:30.<br />
<br />
Anybody faced similar issue. Pl guide.<br />

<br />
I found similar parameter in Job which I was unaware of. It is &quot;Suspend Job untill next execution&quot;.<br />
<br />
After enabling this, now the job remains in Que and does not become free after first execution.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">3rd August 2011, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, you should not be using job daemon.  Job daemon is buggy and hard to implement in a multi-company environment which, I think most environments are multi-company. <br />
<br />
I would suggest that you look at implementing jobs via the OS native jobs scheduling mechanism, e.g., Task Scheduler for windows, CRON for UNIX.  <br />
<br />
Also, do you guys know how annoying it was on windows servers to schedule jobs and see the windows constantly pop up?  In recent porting sets Infor development enabled a way to start jobs using a parameter -server so in the startjob script there will be a line now that is <br />
<br />
ntbshell -server ttaad5203m000 <br />
<br />
Way cooler than starting the .bwc profiles. It makes for a nicer administration of the server without fearing cancelling a crucial job in a live system as all jobs run silently this way.   <br />
<br />
Only disadvantages are, apparently you cannot use multi-bshell jobs with this method. But there are workarounds for that like setting those jobs up in a different server or PC even using the old method. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
