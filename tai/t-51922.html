1) Go to  BSE/lib/defaults folder and create a file named &quot;all&quot; (without extensions) <br />
2) Open the file and enter &quot;session_timeout:n&quot; (without quotes) where n is number of minutes to wait before the user is timed out thus freeing up his/her license. <br />
In addition to the above if you want to give certain users more time before they are timed out then go to BSE/lib/user and in the user file (u&lt;login&gt;) enter the same parameter &quot;session_timeout:n&quot;, where n this time is greater than what you have entered in the &quot;all&quot; file.<br />

I have a question:Must I need to shutdown and restart Baan service,yes or no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">15th May 2008, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">No. When user starts his client, it will read this setting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">20th May 2008, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">The functionality above (explained very well by sukesh75) is only available in more 'recent' versions of Baan4 service pack/portingset.  I should hope most people will be more up-to-date but there's no guarantee!<br />
<br />
CloseIdle was one of the few reliable ways before the above functionality was added and is still available for Baan.  It goes beyond the above functionality by performing a save on the data if a session is left open as well as preventing a user logging in to Baan more than once (common when you are short of licences!).  You can also set certain sessions to not be closed and have different or even no timeouts for certain users.  Details at http://www.closeidle.co.uk</div></div><hr />

Yes, it could happen. So, it is fine to set session_timeout to 0 for user who starts job.</div></div><hr />
