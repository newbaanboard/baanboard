<br />
I have 1 Finance company ( 300)  and 1 Logistic company (310).<br />
now, I need to add new logistic company. I used document code U9503D US as guideline. <br />
<br />
what I do :<br />
a) I followed setup 310 <br />
b) new company 320 shared table from 300 as in 310<br />
c) I created new Enterprise Unit for 320<br />
d) I setup master data in 320 to function as logistic <br />
e) I study transaction for integration to finance  ( 320 -&gt; 300) <br />
<br />
issue I have :<br />
a) I noticed  my new EU do not have any department <br />
b) All department only in 310 <br />
c) I cant add same department code in 320 <br />
d) I need to use same department code because we serve cross company and user is same<br />
e) our business model making us need to separate the logistic operation<br />
f) table shared as attached<br />
<br />
my question <br />
a) why I cant have same department code cross 3 company to ease my user ? my finance user control on department and work center setup to match their chart of account.<br />
b) if I cant have same department, can I set same enterprise unit for new additional company ? <br />
<br />
I need to do in-house as time constraint . <br />
all setup currently in test environment.<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must have different enterprise units that point to the two finance companies and each department belongs to one enterprise unit.  Therefore, you must have different department codes in each of the two enterprise units which in turn point to the two finance companies.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can have multiple enterprise units in one logistics company that point to multiple finance companies.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
