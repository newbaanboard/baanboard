<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KDrysch</div><div class="date">1st April 2005, 20:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone explain the differences between Named User Licenses and Concurrent User Licenses?  We are on Baan 5.0c with SQL Server 2000 database.<br />
Right now we are using concurrent licenses but are considering switching to named user licenses for the cost savings.<br />
Has anyone made such a change and what kind of problems did you run into?<br />
<br />
Can a named user open up 2 Baan sessions at the same time with one license or would that require 2 licenses?<br />
<br />
Are additional named-user licenses needed for a test system?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input you can provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">1st April 2005, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't do &quot;named&quot; users in Baan. maybe in ERP LN (which use SLM) but not in any form of Baan that uses the &quot;licd&quot; process. <br />
<br />
I know, I've seen it in sales's guys documentation as well... but you can't do it.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe me, look at your requested system configuration screen and tell me where to put in the named users ;-)<br />
<br />
Maybe its refering to SQL licenses or something along those lines. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mschreiner</div><div class="date">4th April 2005, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">In the past Baan did support both models, a &quot;named&quot; user and a &quot;concurrent&quot; user model. You are right, the license daemon checks only concurrent users. So if you contracted a &quot;named&quot; model with Baan, it´s up to the administrator to avoid a license violation. It´s similar, when your running Oracle DB<br />

<br />
Micheal is right, in the past baan was supporting named licence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KDrysch</div><div class="date">4th April 2005, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the responses. It has made our decision much easier.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">4th April 2005, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">as in: your concurrent users are 70% of your named users, so you need .7*N licenses.<br />
<br />
I don't recall Baan selling named licenses, but I also can't remember what I had for breakfast,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KDrysch</div><div class="date">4th April 2005, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the information, Francesco.  Actually, we just heard from Baan and they informed us that named-user licensing is not available in Baan 5.0c.  Although they had told us a few days ago that it was an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gigaman</div><div class="date">7th April 2005, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, if you use named users, you can only reserve the same amount of user accounts in session &quot;Maintain users&quot;, while, if you use cocurrent users, you can reserve much more users accounts in session &quot;Maintain users&quot;. BaaN cannot identify what type of user licence you bought technically. In other words, even if you bought named users, you can also reserve user accounts in session &quot;Maintain users&quot; more than your licence amounts technically. No problem, no error message will appear. However, if you really do that, you are out of the original agreement with SSA. SSA would take actions for law because of your activities.<br />
PS: Named user licence price is about 50% of cocurrent user licences.</div></div><hr />
