<br />
I want to display the oldest &amp; latest date in report header which is TDSLS400.ODAT. <br />
<br />
I found that there is 1 function called Aggregate Function in report layout.<br />
Try use this function but it's display nothing.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to display the MAX &amp; MIN date.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">5th December 2016, 06:27</div></div><div class="posttext">You mean you tried putting maximum and minimum in Aggregate Function but you didnt get the result?<br />
<br />
If that is the case then it would make sense because being in Header, the Report writer obviously doesnt have all the values for it to decide which is the maximum and minimum value for it.<br />
<br />
What you could do, in the report script you could write a function in header.1, before.layout which could calculate the min and max value beforehand and assign that value to the report layouts..</div></div><hr />

If you want to print the min and max dates; from the range of order dates, of the orders that the report is printing.... then the easiest way will be to get the values in two different variables - using a simple select statement with min and max aggregate functions in the UI script itself. Send these variables to the report as input fields and print it on header layout of the report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand that you have &quot;from and to date selection fields&quot; in your screen.<br />
You can pass these fields as &quot;Input Fields&quot; to your report (Select the report and click on the specific option &quot;Input Fields&quot;). You can then print the fields on your report header.<br />
<br />
If you want to find the select statement where select between two dates code is written... Please check the UI script of the session. There is remote possibility of the programmer writing the main select statement in report script.</div></div><hr />

1. For &lt;dateformat&gt;, what should I put, as the system prompt error if I put<br />
dd/mm/yyyy. My input from and to as attached.<br />

2. In the report layout for oldest date, form field = min.odat and for latest date<br />
form field = max.odat. Am I right?<br />

<br />
For Point 2, <br />
As per your earlier screen shot that shows &quot;Demand by SO Date (from 25/11/2016 To 05/12/2016)&quot;; date range from and to entered by user are available at report level. What variables are used to show that Date range?<br />
<br />
After that you have to find the min and max order date from tdsls400 table by matching tdsls400.odat between from and to date range.<br />
<br />
Could you please attach few things?<br />
report input fields <br />
report script<br />
layout fields</div></div><hr />
