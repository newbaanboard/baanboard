<br />
We need to use the session ttaad4226m000 (Create Sequential Dump of Table) to export ALL data from our PRODUCTION/LIVE envt and Tables/Indexes for inventory purposes.<br />
<br />
Can we run that session during the day while users are entering/processing data without slowing down the system OR damaging actual previous and current data.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your prompt reply as this is VERY URGENT.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

Furthermore the export will not be consistent since data will be exported table wise, however the transactions that your users perform could affect tables that already have been exported and tables that still have to be exported.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">23rd September 2009, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">right, you won't have a consistent data set.<br />
<br />
a better idea would be to use oracle export, which can make a consistent backup.<br />

<br />
when you want to copy the whole BSE you can clone the database into a new instance...<br />
<br />
but the simplest way is still to have a downtime at the weekend :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's not that tough to rename the tables and re-create the indexes when doing it with oracle exp/imp. but yes, it's certainly much easier with bdbpre/post.<br />
<br />
but if you can't have downtime then exp is the way to go.<br />
