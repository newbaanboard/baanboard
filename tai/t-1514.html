<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walter01</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 11:55</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running two Baan4c3 application servers sharing a single Oracle dbs server (clustered). In the past audit was setup on both appl.servers but now the audit reports are useless because each appl.server has it's own audit log and the reports differ. You have to ,somehow, combine the two reports.<br />
Is it possible to setup audit in a 'shared' directory where the two servers write to the same (shared) directory. If so, will this give any locking type of problems ?<br />
I also want to prevent any extra network load when writing the audit to an extra server. Can anyone give me some advise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">29th March 2002, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to have a combined audit file, you will have to have all the audit servers running on the same server in order to preserve the sequence numbers, etc.<br />
<br />
You can do this by having one of the servers act as the &quot;audit master&quot; server.  This is done by using Baan Net (with remote users) and running the audit server on the remote host (for example one of the app servers or the database server).<br />
<br />
bpmdm000:903:oracle7(ORACLE_SID=grommit, ORACLE_HOME=...) &amp;wallace!audit:N <br />
<br />
The important values here are after the ampersand (&amp;).  <br />
<br />
The host name is the first value (in this case &quot;grommit&quot;).  This host must be configured to use Baan Net.<br />
<br />
The exclamation point (&quot;!&quot;) is a seperator followed by the name of the service to launch on the remote server (&quot;audit&quot;).<br />
<br />
The last value (&quot;N&quot;) indicates that you should NOT audit this table on the local server.  On the remote server the tabledef6.1 file will have the audit flag set to &quot;Y&quot; and no ampersand (&amp;) values.<br />
<br />
Since you are using Baan Net a Baan install will be required on the remote system.<br />
<br />
There will be some network load due to running remote audit which cannot be avoided.  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps...<br />

You seem to be quite knowledgeable about the audit setup in Baan. I have posted a question about auditing myself way back and never managed to get a good answer, not even from BGS:<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7&amp;highlight=audit<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly - and I would have to check my notes to be sure - using the remote audit option (&amp; ! markers) doesn't allow you to run bdbpre/bdbpost commands on the local server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">31st March 2002, 09:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You can most definitely change parameter files with remote audit (on Baan 5.0c).  I have not tried it with Baan IV.  <br />
<br />
I usually run the bdbpre/post from the DB server (so that it will run as fast as possible).  Therefore, since this is where I run audit, it is not an issue.<br />
<br />
For details see the 7.1b Tools Update manual, appendix on audit for more information.<br />
