<br />
So, this job you mentioned, was created as a Baan &quot;job&quot; or is something that is beeing run manually each morning?<br />
<br />
Have a look at the attached file (can also be downloaded from Baan), it's a zipped Word document on how to setup [automated] jobs in Baan (Solution 1518, Advanced Guide 1001). If you then encounter problems, let us know.</div></div><hr />
