   We have a daily job running that creates the sequential dump of our live company in Baan. It runs overnight and it shows as successfully completed and all in the morning. However upon pressing the &quot;Ok&quot; button on the dialog box weirdly named &quot;Job Terminated Successfully&quot;, it gives out this error message that i have attached along with this thread. <br />
<br />
The sequential dump file has been created and the job status shows &quot;Free&quot;. So what is it? What does this error message mean and where is it having a problem? <br />
