<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ciatecmx</div><div class="date">7th July 2006, 05:48</div></div><div class="posttext">This question is basically a sequence of my other problem.  (Three sets of companies on same DB).  From Oracle sake, it is a bad idea (I did not set up this way).  So I want to create another instance on the same DB, and allow the TEST set of company to use it. Because I only have one application BAAN V, can the db_resource file be used for two different oracle 10g r2 instances,  one prod and one test? The box is an IBM AIX 5.3 L (p550 machine).  I read the set up of the db_resource, it only has a parameter for the database, not about the instance or the schema.  <br />

<br />
Running Muiltiple Instances of Oracle when you could have just one is worse than multiple companies in the same instance.<br />
<br />
Each instance of oracle has huge overhead, you waste a lot of resources<br />
that way. <br />
<br />
Also, if you have transactions that would cross companies (via shared tables, etc.) you start forking new drivers (which take up resources) and you do not have a 2 phased commit so your DBs  could become out of sync...<br />
