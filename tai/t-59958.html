First check the domain tcitem is present or not.<br />
<br />
if domain present then run the create Runtime Datadictionary for all .<br />
<br />
Logout and login and check the import process.<br />

<br />
I have Installed FP6 on Win 2003/SP2 and DB as Oracle 11g R1, Installtion was successful on this VM. All functional sessions were getting opened and I have configured shared memory and also PMC solution was installed with Installation wizard. Then when I am opening the functional sessions, It is giving an error &quot; Cannot open package security file&quot;. I tried a lot, also searched for the solution in infor365 but failed at last.<br />
<br />
If you have any Idea on this please suggest me the solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I tried to install on sql server 2005 with sp4, it is throughing an error cannot create database.<br />
<br />
Please if you have any documents related to installtion of ERP LN6.1 products (win 2003/sp2, sql server 2005/sp4) with the specified specs, please send to sriram.bangaaru@gmail.com. <br />
<br />
