<br />
there  could be some NT errors concerning tcpip - some are described in solution 105481.<br />
We got 10058 socket shutdown error (with a reconnect yes/no message screen from Baan) when generating a word document on the server  (baan session)  sending it to client pc to MS office word  for display, storing it in MS office word : b√§ng - here it comes: <br />
bufferAllSocketData: ioctlsocket(FIONREAD) failed  (available=0), error 10058<br />
<br />
has anybody an idea how to prevent this ?<br />
<br />
(pinging all the time on the client-server-line helps!!!!)<br />
<br />

You can get a point where the client times out waiting for a reply from Baan when its trying to open a large file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bherkend</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Sizes used so far are between 10000 and 172593  bytes.<br />
Only sending back to server dies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mean you are creating this from a baan session to start up Word on the client. <br />
<br />
If you are loading Word from the server (or server based local) you could be getting slow network messages. Does the file actually come across, does word open and do you see the file?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bherkend</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi again,<br />
the file is created on the server , send to the client , opens in ms word so the user can modify (if necessary) and click the save button; then document is closed -<br />
and message appears. <br />
the file should be transferred back to the server, but  only  a file with same name and size 0 is found  serverside, while baan message &quot;reconnect y/n&quot; has been answered ( yes or no  does make no change).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like Baan is waiting for a reply back from Word and that creating the time out. Try saving the file as soon as you get it and see if that makes a difference. If it falls over just as soon as you get it then sounds like you should try a different approach. Why are you saving these on the server anyway? Would be easier just to create from clients side.</div></div><hr />
