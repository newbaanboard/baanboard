The file size is hard-coded in the script as MAXBYTE.LOGFILE = 1024 * 512<br />
<br />
Having said that, in our system, this log file was last written to on December 19th, when only three records were added. SO, maybe you may want to see what error message is cloggin up your log file and address that problem. May not really be a need to increase this logfile size.</div></div><hr />
