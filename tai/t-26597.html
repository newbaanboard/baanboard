<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">9th March 2006, 12:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been running Baan IV c4 on a linux server since over half a year now.<br />
Our jobs are starting by crontab (root).<br />
Until yesterday all was ok, but now the jobs are not running anymore. Cron start the jobs (with rc.startjob) in the normal way, as I can see in the log files, which are containing no errors. But the jobs are not starting in baan. <br />
In logfile rc.startjoberr all looks ok:<br />
<br />
Connecting with bshell...<br />
Connection established.<br />
<br />
All log files on the OS are written as normal. I could not found any error in the baan log files. I also tried to start the job by an &quot;normal&quot; superuser, not root - same.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone have a hint for me<br />

Correction: I tried again another superuser for starting a job and there it works! But why not with root?</div></div><hr />

Review the settings of the Baan user that does work against the settings of Baan user root (including unix env. variables).</div></div><hr />

In your case, if things work correctly when run under a superuser account, then the root account settings are definitely suspect.<br />
<br />
Second rule of thumb, don't use the root account ;)</div></div><hr />

Yes I checked all like Package and so on. Bthw. there were no changes before the problem occured.<br />
But youÂ´re right, since running the jobs by another user all has been running well now. But nevertheless I ask myself why this issue appeared over night without any system changes.<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
have a look at $BSE/lib/user ..... <br />
here you find the actual params fur users (for instance uroot) as well as the last version (uroot-) ... <br />
what are the timestamps of these files?<br />
Just an idea .... someone changed the PC of user root, but nevver did a conversion to runtime (some time ago).<br />
Now recently someone changed any setting of probably another user and converted to runtime, thus applying the (old) changes for user root.<br />
But if something like this happened, the timestamps should prove so.<br />
<br />
