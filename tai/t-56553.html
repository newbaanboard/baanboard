I need to do the following:<br />
 A user is capturing one purchase order line, during the process, If no VAT code is specified, the user must be not able to save that line.<br />
<br />
Since VAT code is not a mandatory field, the user can &quot;forgot&quot; to fill it. I have tried with several combinations on Mantain Permissions, but I canÂ´t prevent that the user save that line.<br />
<br />
Anybody have done some similar to this?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

That will bring VAT  code by default on SO/ PO line . If there are reasons for changing the same , u may keep an invalid VAT  code (say without ledger a/c ) so that user can not forget  to change this  (as he/she will not be able to save the so/po line ) .<br />
<br />
There could be other technical ways also . However I think this default mechanism should suffice for u .</div></div><hr />

Thank for your answer. Yes I have already tested that approach and, not satisfy the audit requirement due to, the audit department says that if the user forgot to fill the VAT code in the item master, then when a purchase order is done, there will be easy to avoid the restriction.<br />
So, the restriction have to be done via user permission.<br />
<br />
Any other idea?<br />
<br />
The oter approach of course will be to customize the session to avoid this, but I need to be sure that no solution via tools/administration is possible.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
