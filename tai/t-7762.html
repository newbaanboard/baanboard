<br />
Can anybody help me in following situation:<br />
<br />
We have installed Baan IV C4 on a Windows NT 4.0 Server. Also activ is the portingset 6.1c.06.05. The Job-Daemon is enabled and the service for the Job-Daemon is started by the &quot;System Account&quot;. Now, if a Job is started and the session includes an output to a printer there cames always the Message &quot;There is currently no valid printer in your printer setup&quot;. But there is a valid printer in the printer setup. Now we must klick to &quot;OK&quot; Button and the job ends normaly. &quot;Baan Support&quot; told us, that the Job-Daemon-Service must start by the user &quot;baan&quot;. If we do that and start the service, the start procedure hangs for this service hangs up.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
<br />

In the end I remember exporting the printer subkey from the local user section of the registy HKEY_CURRENT_USER\printer edited the exported file so that it could be imported to HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT by changing HKEY_CURRENT_USER to HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT in the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foster</div><div class="date">21st November 2002, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your opinion! I have exported the Registry-Key and edited it. But after the import the error cames again. Do we need a reboot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">21st November 2002, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry not the correct registry keys from memory, I have found the correct  information.  <br />

where it says to start and stop the schedule service substitute Baan jobdaemon service<br />
<br />
<br />
To ensure successful printing from a scheduled application, complete the following procedure: <br />
<br />
Open Control Panel, click the Services icon, and from the list of available services, select the Schedule service. Then click the Startup button and verify that this service is configured to log on as the System account and that it is allowed to interact with the desktop.<br />
<br />
NOTE: For a scheduled application to print correctly, and for these instructions to produce successful results, you must use the System account for the service (Log On As) account.<br />
<br />
When you have verified the above settings, click the OK button, and from the Services window click the Stop button (with the Schedule service selected), if the Stop button is available. This ensures that the changes take effect the next time you start the Schedule service. <br />
In Print Manager, create a local printer--regardless of whether the printer is actually a local printer or a remote network printer--by choosing Create Printer from the Printer menu, using the printer driver appropriate for the type of printer you are using. Configure the printer to print to LPT1, and set it as the default printer. <br />
Start and maximize Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).<br />
<br />
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Minimize the windows titled &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Local Machine&quot; and &quot;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT on Local Machine&quot; and position the remaining two windows, titled &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER on Local Machine&quot; and &quot;HKEY_USERS on Local Machine,&quot; such that they are tiled vertically on the screen with each filling about one half of the available window space in Registry Editor. This step is provided for convenience in completing the remaining steps, in which you will review and edit certain registry keys. <br />
Select the key<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Devices<br />
<br />
and note the information for the value of the key that represents the default printer created in step 2 above (for example, &quot;LocalPrinter : REG_SZ : winspool,LPT1:&quot;). <br />
Select the key<br />
<br />
HKEY_USERS \.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Devices<br />
<br />
and choose Add Value from the Edit menu to create the same value you noted in step 4 (using the above example, &quot;LocalPrinter&quot; is the value name, &quot;REG_SZ&quot; is the data type, and &quot;winspool,LPT1:&quot; is the string). <br />
Select the key<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\PrinterPorts<br />
<br />
and note the information for the value of the key that represents the default printer created in step 2 above (for example, &quot;LocalPrinter : REG_SZ : winspool,LPT1:,14,45&quot;). <br />
Select the key<br />
<br />
HKEY_USERS \.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version \PrinterPorts<br />
<br />
and choose Add Value from the Edit menu to create the same value you noted in step 6 (in the example from step 6, &quot;LocalPrinter&quot; is the value name, &quot;REG_SZ&quot; is the data type, and &quot;winspool,LPT1:,14,45&quot; is the string). <br />
Select the key<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Windows<br />
<br />
and note the information for the device value of the key (for example, &quot;LocalPrinter,winspool,LPT1:&quot;). <br />
Double-click the device value of the key<br />
<br />
HKEY_USERS \.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Windows<br />
<br />
and edit it to reflect the same information you noted in step 8 (in the example from step 8, you would enter &quot;LocalPrinter,winspool,LPT1:&quot; for the string). <br />
Close Registry Editor. <br />
Open Control Panel, click the Services icon, and from the list of available services, select the Schedule service. Click the Start button to start the Schedule service with the above settings changes in effect.</div></div><hr />
