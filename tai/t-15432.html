Before you run this session, you have to take a sequential file dump of your company data in a folder. All the seq table data files created there are with a &quot;.S&quot; extension.<br />
This session changes the old company number to the new company number with the data present in each of those files.<br />
There will be more than 2000 such files.<br />
That is the reason why it asks you for the folder name only and not each file name.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">23rd May 2004, 07:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You can take dumps by using the tools session.. ttaad4226m000 Create sequential dump of table. <br />
<br />
Choose the below options: <br />
specify field seperator..  &quot;|&quot;  (pipe sign)<br />
directory for table files :  (only the folder path... no file name)<br />
name of error file : c:\err.txt   (to whichever path u prefer.<br />
<br />
The output is a file for every individual table for whichever company you are trying to dump.<br />
<br />
After this you can run the tccom0214m000 session.<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />
