<br />
What is the most widely used option among the followings, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each option:<br />
<br />
1.  For any given BaaN user separate DB user and OS user.<br />
2.  For all BaaN users only one DB user and OS user.<br />
3.  For all BaaN users, same number of OS users and only one DB  user. For example, for 20 BaaN users, there will be 20 OS users and only 01 DB user.<br />
<br />
Please as requested above, would appreciate if you could state the advantages and disadvantages of each, in addition to your opinion as to which of the above three options is best.<br />
<br />
best regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I could think of following Advantages / Disadvantages:<br />
<br />
Advantages : In all these methods if you want to go for single OS user or Single Database user for baan users, you can save on some database lecences / OS licences.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages: You can not track the process of the user at database level / OS level as all the OS calls / database calls are with same user.<br />
<br />
The best practice is <br />
1. At OS level, have mapping based on the individual person (in baan you can have multiple baan users for single unix user - preferably for the same person, so as to take car of different setups)<br />
2. At database level, try to make it as Role / Authorization based.<br />
<br />
If it is difficult or complicated to come up with this matrix, just go for One OS - One Baan - One DB user (hope licences is not an issue).<br />
