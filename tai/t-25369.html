<br />
We recently imported our data into the the test environment using Oracle Export / Import. But after that when we try to insert a sales order it gives error 510, Data dictionary corrupt. I investigated this problem more and found that the problem is with tcmcs036 table. This table has an extra text field when compared with our live system. Probably some solution that was imported into development and not in live. <br />
<br />
I tried doing a convert to RDD and create RDD... did not work! <br />
<br />
What do I do?  :confused: <br />
Do I need to delete and recreate the table? Once I do that can I then import <br />
the data using bdpre and bdpost. <br />
<br />
Or is there any other smart way of doing this?<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jelle Schot</div><div class="date">18th October 2005, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the data definitions are different try th efollowing:<br />
<br />
1. Be sure you are the only one in the system.<br />
2. Start session ttaad1120m000<br />
3. Check path table defintions<br />
4. Move the file dtcmcs36 in this path to dtcmcs036.save<br />
(PATH example: /baan/dict/ddPACKAGECOMBINATION/dtcmcs)<br />
5. Load the table<br />
6. Run 'Create runtime DD' ('reconfigure tables = yes')</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your referred to package combination there... <br />
<br />
Which package combination do I do it in. When I went into the directories I find that the definition exists in all the package combinations including the customised comb on which the company is created. <br />
<br />
So do I change the file in the Customised layer and then create RDD at this VRC. The table is not customised. If I look into Maintain table def then the table exists only in C4 and stnd package combinations. <br />

This is the company # you want to load the data for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newtobaan</div><div class="date">19th October 2005, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Jelle, <br />
This did not work.  :(  From what I can infer is that the table definition in maintain tables is the new one. So baan just creates another file dtcmcs036 with the same size and does not re configure tables! <br />
<br />
Just thinking of other possibilities. Will I blow away my env by doing this:<br />
<br />
1) copy the dtcmcs036 file in the customised (company level) to dtcmcs036.new<br />
2) copy the dtcmcs036 file from live into the development env.<br />
3) Run Create RDD. <br />
<br />
Will baan now look at the new file and say, hey this table needs to be reconfigured as well?!<br />
<br />
Also a doubt on the dict directory:<br />
I see that although the table defn is in the stnd package comb the dtcmcs036 file exists in all the directories including the customised (company level). Is this how it works? <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
