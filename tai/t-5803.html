<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 01:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a table which we created in company 0.  It was working fine until some field and index changes were made.  After that, when I try to insert a row (even in GTM), I get bdb_errno 9152.  I have deleted and then created the table in Maintain Tables.  I have also tried removing all of the table definitions under the 'dict' directory and then re-create the runtime data dictionary for just a couple of package combinations.  Still no luck.  At one point, I deleted the physical table in SQL Server.  This eventually moved me to an error 1000.  The table needs to be in company 0 since its use spans companies.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on how I can make it workable again?</div></div><hr />

Maybe a good starting point would be to find out what both errors actually mean. I don't have a list of error descriptions for SQL-server if anyone else has it, then please post them here.</div></div><hr />
