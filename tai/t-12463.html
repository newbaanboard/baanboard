Old config: Winnt - Mssql 7.0 enterprise server - Baan IV<br />
New Config: Win 2003 - Mssql 2000 Standard - Baan IV<br />
<br />
Question: Can we install Baan IV on the new configuration and can we use the old Baan IV installation cd's?<br />
Or do we need an new BaaN IV installation cd and portingset?<br />
<br />
With kind regards,<br />

Baan now has installation directly for SQL Server 2000.  Previoulsy, you installed on SQL Server 7.0 and then upgraded your database to SQL Server 2000 with normal SQL Server utilities.<br />
<br />
I would get the new installation disks that work directly with SQL Server 2000, assuming you are still paying support.  If you are not, you'll have to do the manual upgrade - but you will still have to relicense your new servers anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is above information appliciable for Oracle 9i also ? Does BaaN new installation CD's support Oracle 9i or we have to first install 8 then upgrade it manually to 9i ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">2nd August 2003, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about Oracle 9 - perhaps someone using that can shed some light on this.<br />
<br />
The SQL Server 2000 installation availability was somewhere around March/April  2003 time frame.  I was on a client site where we would have been the first to try them out, but we didn't want to be guinea pigs, so I haven't tried them out yet.  This was BaanERP 5c by the way.<br />
<br />
I'd contact Baan support to find the exact availability for what they support for an Oracle install, unless someone here definatively knows.</div></div><hr />

The installer for 4c4 on O9i for W2k has been released. You will have to get the latest installation pack from your baan support.<br />
