<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pvcasino</div><div class="date">26th March 2002, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We have two machines with BAANEERP installed in both., both are correctly validated, that is, both have their own validation keys and also, when started Baan in each of them, the licenses server starts them correctly. But the licenses server is located in one of the two machines, called BS, and this one must be started for the other one, called DS,  to work. The file licence6.2 of BS contains &quot; baanserver&quot; (the real name of BS) and the licence6.2 of DS contains &quot;baanserver,development&quot; (development is the real name of DS).<br />
<br />
What we want is that DS can start independently of BS, and that its licenses server be located on DS. If I modifie the licence6.2 of DS to &quot;development&quot; then I do not have acces to Baanerp and I get the following error message: &quot; you do not have anymore license to start the bshell&quot;.<br />
<br />
What must we do to allow both machines to work independently and with its own licenses server ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that is the case, you need to apply for a DS own license validation keys and re-license it (and updating the DS license6.2 to point to its own):<br />
<br />
DS + BS same validation keys =&gt; 1 single license server on the main server (the &quot;properly&quot; licensed DS)<br />
DS own validation + BS own validation =&gt; each needs/has its own license daemon</div></div><hr />

BS and DS are your own validation keys and differents, because we have re-licensed DS In the attached file are the validation keys of BS and DS.<br />
<br />
But, we have re-licensed DS with BS started. Is this the problem?<br />
We must re-licensed DS with BS  stopped ??<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems that my problem is already solutionned. When I start DS only, with BS stopped, the daemon licence is in DS and we can work in Baan of DS, but if I start DS with BS started, the daemon licence is in BS and if i change the licence6.2 to &quot;desarrollo&quot; (DS), because the licence daemon is in BS, i can´t start a session Baan.<br />
<br />
Now, i hope that my problem was solutioned.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all for your support.<br />

Thaks.</div></div><hr />
