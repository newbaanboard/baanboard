<br />
We have a filter in session whinh3512m000 which is based in business partner id. The problem is, this filter is coming as read-only for specific user and due to this, the user is not able to edit the filter.<br />
<br />
The user has DEM and is a normal user. Anybody faced similar problem. Please guide.<br />

Check if that particular filter was published from a super user ID. In such cases other users will not be able to edit the filter.<br />

Hi Soujanya,<br />
<br />
You are right. The filter was created from super user's id and was published. I created a separate filter from that specific user's id and it is working now.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />
