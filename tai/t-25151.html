<br />
We created for one physical printer 2 printer on the Baan server with different paper bins. On windows it is working, but Baan prints on both printers on the same aper bins !!! :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume that you are not printing via bwprint, because in that case you would use the printer as defined in windows.<br />
Although admittedly I am not used to M$ servers, the logic concerning 'direct printer' from baan should be the same .... <br />
That means there should be a file under $BSE/printinf/[FIRST-LETTER-OF-PRINTER-MANUFACTURER]/ containing the apropriate lead-in and lead-out codes for this particular printer. At least on a unix machine I would make sure to have 2 files as 'printer-drivers' ... both very similar, but one containing the command for 'switch to bin 1' ... the other the lead-in for bin2.<br />
<br />
Or is it completely different on Windows???<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sibon1</div><div class="date">21st September 2005, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">i think you are in a windows environment. you have to use bwprint and there you can assign virtually baan-bins to physically printer bins.<br />
<br />
you can do it manually in the preview of bwprint by right click and then assign bin0 or assign device specific bin0. you have to do it for each client separately but you can also distribute registry keys (see: HKEY_LOCALMACHINE\Software\Baan\bwprint\bins<br />
<br />
It is possible to install more windows printer queues for one printer and set the desired paper bin as standard bin. Then assign baan printers to the desired printer and bin.<br />
<br />
But its better to use only one queue and set the blank paper to standard bin. When you have for example on bin 2 a preprinted invoice paper then you have to customize the invoice report: before.program: spool.pr.line = pc$(3) | Bin3 = Invoice paper<br />
<br />
Then you only have to assign the virtually bin3 to the physically bin2 on the printer.<br />
<br />
Please note: baan prints always to the standard bin which is defined in the windows printer queue if you do not assign anything. This is different to MS Word, here you define the bin in templates (normal.dot?).<br />
<br />
It works.<br />

The registry entry is generally / independend for hte printers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sibon1</div><div class="date">21st September 2005, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats not correct:<br />
<br />
you can assign device specific paper bins in bwprint<br />
<br />
for example: <br />
Baan-Printer PRINT_A bin0 is assigned to Paper bin 1 (blank Paper)<br />
and bin1 is assigned to Paper bin 2 (Invoice paper)<br />
<br />
Baan-Printer PRINT_B bin 0 is assigned to bin3 (blank)<br />
and bin1 is assigned to Paper bin 1 (Invoice)<br />
<br />

No preview possible with this configuration.</div></div><hr />
