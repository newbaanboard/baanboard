<br />
We have noticed that the normal jobs (daily/weekly) we run, have slowed down over the last few days. Also, some reports are taking longer time to process. This phenomenon is happenning for the past 4-5 days. We dont remember doing any thing new on the application/database, in the last few days. We are on BaaN 4c4- SP5 (HP-UX, Informix IDS 7.31). We were thinking to run 'Reorganize Tables' to overcome this problem. Do you think this will solve our problem? Any particular things to be taken care while running 'Reorganise Tables' and what options to choose while running this session. Any other remedies anybody can think of?<br />
<br />
Any inputs on the above are welcome. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
- determine with tables are fragmented.<br />
- change the inf_storage for these files<br />
- reorganize these tables.<br />
<br />
In the past (ages ago) I used the script as attached. See if it helps you. As I wrote it that long ago I don't give any support on it ;).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
What is the harm in running the &quot;Reorganise Tables&quot; for all tables of the live company, without taking any of the steps mentioned by you?<br />
Can you give me some details how to <br />
-determine with tables are fragmented.<br />
and how to <br />
- change the inf_storage for these files.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
When you read the script I posted it contains all kind of queries that can be used to see the table fragmentation and how this relates to the inf_storage file. <br />
<br />
As I currently don't have access to an Informix database, please try yourself.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
