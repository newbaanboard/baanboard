<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camste</div><div class="date">13th December 2011, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I was creating a session, pressing the new icon in the list of sessions. I got up the window, started filling something in, but I wanted to see some of the parameters from a different session to make sure I'd set the correct parameters. I then double-clicked a session in the list of sessions. A window popped up asking me if I wanted to save my changes, since it then wanted to open the details of this other session in the same session details window. I pressed yes and went to see the other session, but now when I go back I can't edit the session I was creating. It doesn't have a label or description or anything, and all of the fields in its properties are read only. I can't delete it, the delete icon is grayed out. When I try to edit the form I'm told that it doesn't exist in language 2. When I try to start the session it tells me it can't start the session, and I get the message in the BW messages window &quot;Cannot read session or object (cddev9499m009)&quot;. If I try to compile it tells me &quot;form not found&quot;.<br />
<br />
So is there any way I can create a form and link it to the session? At least just a simple form which will allow me to delete this frozen session and recreate one with the functionality I want. When I go to the forms session (ttadv3500m000) the new and copy buttons are grayed out, so it seems there's nothing I can do there. I see on the server that under the folder for our VRC  in the folder fcddev0 there are files for the forms. Is it possible for me to just copy one of these to the name corresponding to my session and then it will be seen as linked? (And I won't crash everything else.) Or is there somewhere else I can delete this session? I guess I can delete it from the table tttadv200000 by using SQL directly, but will that solve the problem or will it break something else? Any ideas?<br />
<br />
I just wish Baan wouldn't even allow me to leave the session without it being properly created first. :(<br />
<br />
I'd be grateful for any help. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

There is a workaround to be able to get rid of this session. Your idea to copy an existing form dump in fcddev0 will not help. You have to copy a record in table ttadv300 in company 0. You can do that with GTM (ttaad4100). So, if you have a correct form in the same VRC, lookup that form and copy it by entering &quot;C&quot; in the choice field. Then overwrite the form code with the session code followed by &quot;d&quot; and save it. Go back to the session, select the corrupt session again, and you will be able to delete it.</div></div><hr />
