If something were to happen before its expiry date, then you would have to request for a new license as the old one may not work anymore..This is how it works on Baan4 and i dont think Ln would be any different on this aspect.. correct me if i am wrong..<br />

Then restart the license server. Also everytime you push the key back onto the license server, there is a revision number that gets incremented, so the key only works once.  Once you change any information, the revision get incremented and no prior key will work.  You will need to requrest another key.</div></div><hr />
