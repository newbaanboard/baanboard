<br />
I hope this email finds well.. I have a couple of questions:<br />
<br />
Does ERP LN provide or offer OLAP or BI solution components? Meaning data warehousing schema, and reporting tools? There are lots of third-party BI tools out there, but does baan have one that provides out of the box canned reports?<br />
<br />
I looked at baan docs provided in the CDs, and there are dozens of them. Is there a specific document that spells out the method for backing up baan? Is there a disaster recovery document for baan?<br />
<br />
Please let me know as soon as possibleâ€¦ <br />
<br />
Thanks and best regards,<br />

from ERP LN FP5 onwards there is BI Solution available from Infor.<br />
It is called Infor Business Information Services and is a component of Infor Open SOA. It's meant for all Infor Products and now available for LN.<br />
Have a look or ask for Infor MyDay.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">9th October 2009, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Another product is Infor Decisions. It has more capabilities than MyDay. MyDay is for free and will e.g. show you the number of current open Sales Orders. It's meant as a start screen for ERP LN users. With Infor Decisions you will be able to see how many open SO you had the last month and before. For Decisions you have to pay. Decisions is more positioned for key users.<br />
