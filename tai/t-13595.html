<br />
Briefly, after having followed all the steps required for the validation of the new machine, until the patch of the objects via ttiex3225m000, will the old machine be available yet?<br />
<br />
I am asking this because i would like to have some days between the new machine validation and the moment of the real migration, in order to cope and solve any possible validation problem without risking to create problems to the users.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and help.<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

<br />
your old machine stays validated until you throw it away, basically. The new and old validation can coextist without a problem. Actually they will not know of each other.<br />
<br />
If you want to delay the validation of the new server, then you have2 options:<br />
<br />
a) perform &quot;patch objects after system crash&quot; on the new server.<br />
After this you can work on the new server for 30 days without a licence. For this you should have the hostname of the new server written in licence6.1<br />
<br />
b) Just keep the licd running on the old server and kep the hostname of the old server in the licence6.1 file on the new server. In this case the new server will take the licence from the old and everything worls as usual.<br />
As soon as you validate, you need to change the entry in licence6.1, of course.<br />
<br />
