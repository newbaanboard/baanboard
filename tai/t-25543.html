Does any know a solution or procedure to disable the famous &quot;output to console&quot; option?<br />
This is due to some users used to kill a determined session, but the problem is, they are doing this on update sesion! So this is causing a lot of problems due to unifinished transactions!<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slap the users. =)<br />

I agree with you. The problem is that, somewhere in the time, someone teched that vicious to the users. Now, that vicious has been multiplied.<br />
<br />
In order to slap the users, there is a way to know when a user do this?<br />
Is there any way to recognize when a kill session was done by this way or when a session goes out due to a LAN problem?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">4th November 2005, 02:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, Baan should catch that the bshell terminated and roll back the transation. You shouldn't be left with a partial transation (depending on what you're talking about)<br />
<br />
Output to Console is actually an ok way to kill your bshell cleanly. <br />
<br />
it's not a session though, it's part of the BW so there's no way to disable it that I know of.<br />

The problem is that, when I talk with SSA Global, to ask why the balance is not ok, they were tell us, again and again, that is a problem with desconections or &quot;output to console&quot; procedure!<br />
<br />
If output to console, is a clean way to kill a session, why they are arguing this?<br />
<br />
In order to discard all the posibilities to solve this problem, in first term, we aspire to discard this option as a cause to not have our balances ok.<br />
<br />
If you have any idea, I will appreciate that.<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">4th November 2005, 03:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't buy that. Any disconnect will roll back the transaction - unless the session is written in a 2 commit process. (i.e., I commit to table A then table B) at which point you would have to be consistantly dropping the connection RIGHT at that moment. <br />
<br />
Plus I can't think of any session written like that.<br />
<br />
What do you/they do to fix your out of balance problem? is there a session? or do they use GTM?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">4th November 2005, 03:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Dave,<br />
When tha accountants detect an error in the balance, they ask us to run the session tfgld3203m00 (rebuild opening balance/history from transactions).<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hard part is trying to determine which program.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">4th November 2005, 03:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I agree with you. There must be a bug in some program.<br />
So I will keep searching a solution and when I find it I will post it in the board.<br />
<br />
Thank you again.</div></div><hr />

Hi<br />
<br />
These kind of problems are not limited to LAN, these may occurs because of database error or long processing period of session.  So you should tune your database along with network to sort out these problem.</div></div><hr />
