By default it Baan Text editor but you can use Notepad when you define it as external editor. Is there any way to use a different editor than Notepad, like I want to Notespad as editor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple solution:<br />
rename notepad.exe to mynotepad.exe<br />
copy notespad.exe to notepad.exe<br />
<br />
This has the added advantage that all programs that usually call notepad will open with notespad. Use solution with caution.</div></div><hr />

   It worked. You can download a nice editor for free at www.notespad.com<br />
   You can use their dictionary for editing also.<br />
<br />
   Thanks a lot...<br />

<br />
It's possible to define other editors than vi or note(s)pad in BaaN. Recently we discovered a little program called Scite.exe. After installing it, our programmers were very enthousiastic. It works with different colours, completes a word when you half type it and has an automatic spellingcheck (very convenient when you're working in 4GL-scripts).<br />
<br />
I will try to include this file in this post, for anyone who's interested (because I forgot where I found it in the first place...). The file needs to be installed on your local PC; after that, you define its location in BaaN (ttadv0110m000). After a conversion to runtime (ttaad4200m000) it should work.<br />

<br />
If you click on Help...About Scite in Scite, you will see a credit for Baanboard :). Glad that you like it. But it was not appropriate in the context of this thread - because the user wanted to edit text fields and not program files. The only location where one can download the Baan extensions for Scite continues to be Baanboard.<br />

I set up the editor to be local to my system and modified the baan developer defaults to point to my local disk where the editor is located.<br />
<br />
The baan extensions which I provided do auto indenting, matching of  keyword pairs, (while/endwhile) including nesting recognition, and a whole host of other facilities. <br />
<br />
There are also templates to expand small texts to full substitution.<br />
Almost all baan4 and baan5 keywords are recognized.<br />
<br />
I use color to identify comments, strings of text and other grammatical words.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not a free editor, but it is one that I like<br />

No, I don't own the company.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dstegink</div><div class="date">4th October 2002, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">look at the external editor field for the text groups. There is an enum. You will not be able to use notepad, but will be able to use an nicer editor than the Baan editor.<br />
<br />
may be version dependent as to what editors you can use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried the solution proposed by Vamsi, but when I try to rename notepad.exe as oldnotepad.exe the system create a copy, but restores the original one.<br />
I'm using W2K professional. <br />
Looking in the error log of my system, I read that the error is that I try to rename a system protected program :mad: <br />
<br />
I've tried another (more tricky solution):<br />
Using a hex editor I've changed directly in the tttxt1100 object the &quot;notepad.exe&quot; as &quot;etonpad.exe&quot; (this to avoid the checksum conflicts), and copied the wordpad.exe as etonpad.exe in the WINNT directory, the wordpad (renamed) is called :)  but there is an error in which no file is called :( <br />
<br />
Any idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">22nd March 2003, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">The version of Scite that I have colors a line with a string or a comment. I would like to extend Scite to color the strings a darker green, and comments in red.<br />
<br />
Also, I would like to be able to click on an if or endif, and find the matching one.  I know Scite shows lines down the screen so as to be able to put the matching code in that starting column, but what to do when you inherit code that was not written that way.<br />
Ergo, would like scite to act like the multi-edit editor www.multiedit.com <br />
<br />
Multi-edits baan support is superb.<br />

Lets not make this an editor war.  Editors are tools, and not the be alls or the end alls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Mr. Leslie, <br />
this thread is not made to decide which is the best editor. My question was &quot;How to use a different editor from notepad&quot; in editing texts, not programs....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">remcodehaan</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Please note that all external editors do not take language codes of baan into consideration!<br />
With the baan editor, one can change the laguage code, this is not possible with external editors.<br />
i.e. When you add text to a sales order (english client/printed in english) but the system (end-user) works in dutch, the editor creates the text for the SO in dutch and will print the sales order in english.<br />
This results in no text in the sales order, as the text is not available in English.<br />
