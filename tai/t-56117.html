<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">12th June 2009, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering what system maintenance tasks you guys perform on a routine bases.  I guess cleaning up the tmp directory is an obvious task.  But how many files should you leave in there?  What else do you do, which sessions do you run such as the inventory repair one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">12th June 2009, 23:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I delete all $BSE/tmp/tmp* qp* bshell.* files over 1 week old, and that's only<br />
because I don't run pdaemon at all.<br />
<br />
The rest of it baan pretty much takes care of itself. the rest is DB maintenance.<br />
<br />
I don't run the rebuild inventory transactions daily because it's not intended for that purpose. if it catches anything that means you have a bug somewhere in the system that needs to be fixed...<br />

Clear job history over a month old weekly. Inventory repair once a month.</div></div><hr />
