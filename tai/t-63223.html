<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">11th December 2012, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">one of my guys found out that if you check the box &quot;export based on session&quot;, the file dump.l has way too many components listed, even those you don't need &quot;based on session&quot;. it has components that do not belong to the sessions, even the objects in object modelling.<br />
<br />
infor's explanation was:<br />
<br />
&quot;The program script has not been updated in a long time. When based on session is selected, not only components belonging to this sessions are exported, but also library, dal, etc. programs scripts. All of them for that VRC. This is done because we cannot determine which script library possibly could be used by the session. There is no way to stop the export from exporting these extra scripts.There are no plans to change this.So yes, the session works as was planned, though it might seem confusing.&quot;<br />
<br />
has anybody else observed this? i thought this makes the box unusable unless you uncheck it and select the session, reports, scripts, forms you want to export/import. when this session came out in 1998 it's supposed to be a faster way of exporting and importing selectively based on session, so you don't need to select forms, reports, etc individually. it should pick up the components &quot;based on session&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Yes, observed it before. What are you trying to achieve? The new way for code migration is with PMC sessions.<br />
