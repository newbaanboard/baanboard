<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eppesuiG</div><div class="date">24th September 2008, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I am facing this new problem: whenever I print any report to ASCIF I get this error, &quot;No set id for current set name&quot;, and then a few errors from TSS about character that cannot be converted. Anyway, the file is printed but accented letters are missing from it.<br />
This happens only if I use language 5, while if I print the same report using language 2 I get no errors.<br />
<br />
When I print the same report in English, the only different characters are the ones on the standard baan header, where company and page are translated to spanish and include accented letters that may be difficult to convert to ASCII.<br />
<br />
But, when I use and English user and reprint the same report from session ttaad3120m000 &quot;Maintain device queue&quot;, I get no problems in reprinting it to ASCIF: I get the desired file that uses iso-8859-1 letters.<br />
<br />
Any idea on what to check?<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

Were you able to analyze - why it got empty ..!!</div></div><hr />

I blelieve that someone who added(!) a new language with session ttaad1110m000 &quot;Maintain languages&quot; simply forgot to enter data on form 2. That works fine for some time; the error &quot;No set id for current set name&quot; happened after we changed some user's locale to allow them (Spanish) 8-bit characters; the error message itself seems to come from ttsptconv.<br />
