I have sent up a job to run ticpr2210m000 ( calculate cost price session) to run automatically. Now it runs fine but will go into waiting mode instead of going into queue mode for the next day. I have copied all settings from some existing jobs which are running fine .. where am i going wrong !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onceuponatime</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it is happens when you activate the job instead of putting in queue.<br />
I suggest you do the following:<br />
Make sure the job is periodical (The periodical check box is checked).<br />
Cancel the job if it is waiting or running.<br />
In fact cancel all jobs at a suitable time. <br />
Restart your job daemon.<br />
<br />
Rechedule all your jobs.<br />
<br />
Should do the trick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was also facing the same issue, but this can be solved by putting the job in queue. It should work.<br />
<br />
Secondly, do start the job deamon through baan login or bsp login whichever is applicable.<br />
<br />
hope this will help.<br />
