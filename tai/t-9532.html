<br />
I'm looking for some more information about a Japanese installation of Baan. I have following questions:<br />
- What do I have to do to get the Japanese language running on an existing Baan system (if possible)?<br />
- Is there a specific localization available for Japan and if so is there any documentation available on this localization?<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance<br />
<br />
Youp</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you have to enable the Multi-Byte feature for the Environment. You can find that document on the BaaN Support site.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what OS/DB/Baan version you are trying to install but in our case it was UNIX/Oracle/IVc4.  <br />
UNIX needed Japanese fonts installed/ Oracle had to be installed as Multibyte/ Baan had to installed as Multibyte.  <br />
An important note is that Baan has to be originally installed as Multibyte... it was not possible to change Baan after the initial install.  Understand that Japanese will run on an existing system but each character takes up twice the space (i.e a 16 character field only held 4 Japanese characters instead of 8).  This made translation very hard is some cases due to the lack of space.<br />
As far as documentation, we found very little.</div></div><hr />
