<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">25th April 2002, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I've created a new session and I want to copy this session and it's components into the 'live' vrc. So I run ttiex1280m000 and complete the screen as attached.<br />
<br />
When I view my dump.l file I notice that there are a lot more components than what I expected. Ones that seem totally irrelevant to my session. e.g. labels for tiitm001, which have nothing to do with my session. Table defs, again for tables not related to my new session.<br />
<br />
This is something I have noticed before when running exports based on sessions and I've usually exported the specific components.<br />
<br />
My worry is that I'll start overwriting components that I shouldn't be.<br />
<br />
Can somebody please explain why I see non session related components. I would only expect to see items that I have created whilst developing my session.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

is your liv0 VRC directly under your tst0 VRC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">25th April 2002, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">alejandro - I want to avoid using form 3 if I can help it as I've made changes to domains and labels. Whilst I can probably remember which ones they are if they are not in a range I'll have to run the export a number of times.<br />
<br />
Help on 'Export based on session' says that the system will also deliver the data dictionary needed by the session. <br />
<br />
So it's saying my tdsls session needs components from tiitm, tdilc?? The only reference my session has to another table is via the pack slip number in table tdsls045.<br />
<br />
pat - Yes liv0 is directly under the tst0. (My tst0 vrc is derived from my liv0 vrc)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">25th April 2002, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, exporting by session ALWAYS exports more (often much more) than I actually changed and/or need.  So, I always track my changes using the customization administration features.  I used to then individually list the components on form 3.  However, we recently created a tool in house to automatically take the data from the customization tables and use ttiexdeliverp to export exactly what we need.  There is a recent post regarding ttiexdeliverp that might be useful.  I believe gfasbender sells something like that, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">1st May 2002, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Ed: Always use CA to create an explicit list and a customization to create input to tteixdeliverp to export based on the list. Even without a customization you can create a simple vi input file for ttiexdeliverp. We've been doing this successfully for 4 years with Baan 4 &amp; 5.</div></div><hr />

Custom Admin. Follow thread from project to project part to customization part. CA is just a way of organizing lists of components. You (customer) define what each project &amp; part mean to your organization. CA tables can be used by custom sessions to create ANSII file for input to ttiexdeliverp to actually do the Export DD.</div></div><hr />
