I am basically brand new to LN. The company I work for has LN installed on another server, so I copied the BSE file over and replaced all of the necessary files back to when I first installed it on here as the infor documentation says to do. I also transferred over the previous database from the other server. I went to open up the LN application, and I got a ton of error messages from bw. I took a screen shot of it and it seems to be mostly dealing with the DB. Could anyone explain to me how to fix these errors?</div></div><hr />
