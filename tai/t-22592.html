<br />
According to the BaaN error codes it means -<br />
<br />
BaanERP Programmers Guide 7.3_a_sp1<br />
 <br />
5 EIO - I/O error<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Description:  <br />
This error indicates that there has been a physical I/O error. In some cases, this error can point to the call following the one to which it actually applies.  <br />
Solution:  <br />
This error can occur while you are reading a tape or floppy. It indicates that the tape/floppy device is not able to read the tape or floppy. If this error occurs when you start reading the tape/floppy, it might be that the options you are using to read the tape/floppy are wrong, or the block size used by the device is wrong. <br />
<br />
I used passwords greater than 8 characters on HP-UX with Blogin protocol and it worked for me. It would ignore all the characters beyond 8, you can test it out using a password &gt; 8 characters and then changing that password again by changing the characters after 8th position.</div></div><hr />

For password longer than 8 chars, security FTP works, but security telnet(SSH) do not work.<br />
For password with 8 chars or password started with a number, both security ftp and security telnet work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">14th December 2004, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, still sounds like PAM configuration.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">17th December 2004, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can reproduce the error with something else than Baan, like sftp, ssh, telnet, ftp, ..., then HP support will be more than happy to help you.<br />
<br />
I once had a really exotic question in regards to PAM and Samba and SSH, but because all is supported by HP, I opened up a software call and got a real competent answer.<br />
<br />
So not underestimate, what you paid for anyway. <br />

From the release notes of the latest porting set 7.6.a02 -<br />
<br />
MaintMahler: # 25506 (BDUX18049): Long passwords on HP UX trusted security.<br />
Date: Tue, 3 May 2005 11:36:23 +0200 (CEST)<br />
Created on:  MaintBaanIVc<br />
Type:        bugfix<br />
Problem Description (Customer terms)<br />
Using HP-UX OS in &quot;Trusted Security&quot; mode, and using BaanLogin protocol to log in Baan:<br />
When using passwords bigger than 8 characters, you cannot log in Baan.<br />
An Authorization Failure error is reported.<br />
<br />
Workaround<br />
Do not use passwords longer then 8 characters.<br />
<br />
Test Procedure<br />
You need to have a HP-UX system, running in &quot;Trusted Security&quot; mode.<br />
When having such system, running Baan, set the user-password to a password longer then 8 characters.<br />
(not longer then 25 characters).<br />
<br />
You should be able to log in Baan using the Baan Login protocol when using password longer then 8 characters.<br />
