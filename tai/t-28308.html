Also the problem server is a recent copy of our production server. We do this every now and then to get more recent data on the second server for testing.<br />
I have done all this several times before but this is the first time we have this problem. As usual I copied company 000 plus our production companies and several directories and runtime files from $BSE.<br />
I'd appreciate it if someone could tell me what the session does when it is <br />
'repairing the cpac vrc structure' ?</div></div><hr />

The repair cpac vrc structure is taking 15-20 minutes.  We also have a test server that we refreshed with production data prior to this happening.  I think it also started around the time we installed service packs 19 &amp; 20.  Any help on this would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had one of our consultants look at it and he solved this for us. It has to do with a known problem in Oracle 10 where something goes wrong when you have the statistics switched on for the sys.cdef$ sys.con$ and sys.user$ tables.<br />
When inserting records in one of these tables Oracle uses recursive sql which doesn't work well when the statistics are switched on.<br />
It was solved by removing the statistics and locking the job that periodicaly creates/updates the statistics. I'm not an Oracle man but this is more or less the story. The repair session is now back to a few seconds.<br />
I think Han Brinkman also solved this.<br />

I saw Han's response, but I thought it might be specific to PMC.  I'll ask our Oracle admin to look into this.<br />

Thanks again,<br />

<br />
Unfortunately I'm no Oracle expert but my post on the 10th of january should be enough for any Oracle dba. Also read Han's post of the 6th of october 2006.<br />
