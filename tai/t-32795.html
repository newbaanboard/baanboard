<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">16th March 2007, 00:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
We are thinking about creating a new Package under an existing Package Combination. Was wondering if someone can list the steps that need to be taken to accomplish this.<br />
<br />
Another question  regarding the above change is I know we need to do Convert to Runtime DD after the the new package is inserted in the Package Combination. However, my question is whether this would result in any downtime. I mean would we require all users to logoff the system before/after we do CRDD or would it be ok if we just did the CRDD and even if some users were logged on, whenever they re-login to Baan they would see the changes?<br />
<br />
Also are there any risks or anything issues that we should lookout for when making this change.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your responses,<br />
