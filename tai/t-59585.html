<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">24th November 2010, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all. I am sitting at a customer's site trying to improve speed. (Have you heard that before). The problem is general but was asked to make a certain session go quicker. I have tuned it with respect to this customers specific setup of data and this works but I encounter another problem now.<br />
<br />
What I removed was some db calls and a some internal logic like &quot;emptying an array of 9999 char fields, and similar.<br />
Before, we had a bshell - oracle rate of about 2 - 1<br />
After, we have a rate of about 1-1<br />
The total time reduction is 40 %<br />
I was surprised of the success because I did not remove so much. This internal program logic usually is no suspect of bad performance<br />
<br />
Then I made an easy sql just to get some data out (to a file) to look at. <br />
Read and wrote about 5 million lines. Took a couple of hours to read and place a temporary file output. <br />
Then the report writer takes this temp file and produces the readable file. It is rolling now and writes 9000 lines of 60 chars, per minut (not per second). During this process, my bshell uses a lot of cpu. I find the writing speed very very low. (And the bshell cpu consumption high in relation).<br />
<br />
In summary:<br />
* Removing internal logic gave surprisingly good result. Not normal. Indicates that such processing is unusually slow.<br />
* The bshell cpu consumption is unusually high in general.  No real problem but a maybe interesting observation.<br />
* The final writing of a file, from Baan report writer, is unusually slow. For a heavy report, it can be like 50 % of the total time<br />
<br />
So what is the technical problem and what is the cure. Any hint is welcome.<br />
<br />
The env is erpLN fp3, oracle 10.2 and HPUX 11. The size of the bshell executing now is 159 M according to the hpux top command. The file is written to file device with ttstpconv.</div></div><hr />

.<br />
<br />
Normally such large reports are written to get some summary out of it  . If u / ur users are content with just summary results of the large file (without detail), it can be easily done in memory without writing large report files (which is disk intensive slow activity) . Final writing involves re-writing report file and disk intensive sort.exe activity.<br />
<br />
U can check this for in-memory transformation / performance dll  to know more abt array based data transformation in case this is what u look for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">25th November 2010, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this is unicode installation? I know that there were issues with ttstpconv generating ASCII output (so printing to display was fast, printing to file unusually slow)  after the switch to unicode was done. I experienced this on a system having pretty much the same configuration that you have. I know that Infor delivered new ttstpconv versions that gave much better performance. Are you on the newest tools solutions?<br />
