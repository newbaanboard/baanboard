Im sorry i kept the post in wrong place. Any how i will give reply to the query i asked and i found the solution too... <br />
<br />
It was asking for passwrd when i was trying to run ottiexpatch in fp8.. the solution is tools-&gt;database management-&gt;database utilities-&gt; change password for GTM.<br />
<br />
it will ask to give old password then new password, dont give old just add new password -&gt; save &amp; close<br />
<br />
reopen the and again run tht ottiexpatch; it will again ask for the password; now give the new password and it will accept.<br />
<br />
you can run that patch. successfully... &amp; this will even resolve the abruptly closeing the vm.....<br />
<br />
Happy Baaning</div></div><hr />
