<br />
We have planned to upgrade our operating syste, Oracle Database and Vertex Tax package. We are planning to go on following versions of them.<br />
New Hardware: Regetta<br />
Operating System: AIx5.2<br />
Database : Oracle9.2<br />
Vertex Tax: 3.1<br />
<br />
Any suggestions as what kind of problem we may come across?. Like tools problem... database problem...  performance problem?? So that we can be better prepared..<br />
Any other experience with the upgrade, safety net, feedback is really appreciated..<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You will find some postings to this topic here on the board and you also find a few patches on Baan support for this.<br />
<br />
Once of my customers had to put a patch for item EDM data. Without this patch he had performance problems any time a session was handling this kind of data.<br />

<br />
We are thinking of upgrading to latest Porting set (7.1d.05). I did some research on Performance problem after upgrading to oracle9i. Seems like some tuning steps along with couple of baan patches might be required. I came across some posting from baanboard which will be useful for us solving any performance issues.<br />
<br />
The other problem is the compatiblity among SP, poritng sets, O/S and database. Not to mentioned , we are even upgrading the hardware also. <br />
With our current env., we cannot upgrade to latest service pack SP16, because SP16 requires will not work on current porting set( 6.2a.03.03). Hence we may need to upgrade porting set (7.1d), but the upgrade version will not be supported on current O/S(AIX3 4.2.0.0). Upgrading O/S first, will make our baan system non-workable.. To add more, there is some dependancy on Oracle9i,.also we are moving from current 32bit operating system to 64 bit OS. So, its all Catch 22 situations. What sequence should we follow in terms of installation ???<br />
Right now we are in planning phase.. but Its a mess, :-)<br />
Anybody has any suggestion..?? Any suggestion on what upgrades steps to follow  or What we should not do in order to avoid a situation where we cannot proceed and we end up starting from beginning?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
