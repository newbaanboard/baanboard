<br />
thanks for giving me some hopes, since it is urgent would u pls advise me,<br />
<br />
1) how to deinstall the environment (eg: Baan4)<br />
<br />
2) and by doing this will i be able to preserve all my work. (PMC sp14; BSE\application and the entire baan installation will not be affected right...!)<br />
<br />
does this porting set do only replacing of the BSE\bin folder or anything else<br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
can I install on a new environment; how does it work, i need to give a folder which is different from the first environment (eg:  d:\baan); by doing this, if porting set prepares the \bin  in another area,  when the user connects, in the BW configuration the environment should be the new directory as mentioned during new environment ...?<br />
<br />
could pls  tell me how should I resolve this problem (version mismatch) step by step.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
<br />
     Have you installed 'Baan Client' separately on the machine where you have installed Baan Application ?<br />
<br />
     It can cause problems sometime.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">17th June 2004, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I was able to do an de-install via the control panel/Add Remove programs.<br />
<br />
However for one of my three environments I am not able to do it. (Still waiting for a solution of SSA support)<br />
<br />
In the de-install you can specify that you only want to de-install the logic so the application itself will not be removed.<br />
<br />
After the new installation I had to:<br />
remove BSE_REM in the registry<br />
remove rbaan in ${BSE}/lib/user<br />
copy ubaan- to ubaan in ${BSE}/lib/user<br />
restore my tabledef6.2<br />
<br />
