<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joyxer</div><div class="date">31st March 2009, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Since some weeks we are getting strange problems with Display server. Without apparent reason and without possibility to simulate it, we from time to time (really random) are getting an error message in event log &quot;NO RESPONSE OF DISPLAY SERVER&quot;. End users are not able to connect, they are getting error &quot;Windows sockets error 10053, Connection with server broken&quot; and jobs can't be executed as well. Only way to get rid of this problem is to go to console and connect to baan. Because we can't estimate when this problem occurs again we have tried to schedule job which would connect to baan every few minutes, but it didn't help. We have log-in manually. This job started occur several weeks ago, around same time we have installed on the Baan server the agent for our Scheduler program, CONTROL-M. We are executing dozens of jobs in Baan through this tool daily, but only sometimes we get this problems. We tried to contact Baan Helpdesk, but they said, that we have to upgrade portingset, but we don't believe the problem is within portingset. Did anyone experienced such or similar problems? Did you find solution (apart uninstalling agent for CONTROL-M)?</div></div><hr />
