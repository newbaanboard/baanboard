<br />
We have 2 servers (both with informix and baan), both servers have different companies. all baan users are tied to AD in nt4.<br />
<br />
when one user change his password via ttdba0115m000 in one of the servers automatically the password of the user is changed in the AD, but now the user cannot log into the other server because its inf_users file doesn't match with password of AD. we need some users log into the two servers.<br />
<br />
there is a way, different of manually copy and pasting lines from one server's inf_users to the other, of keep these two files synchronized? or maybe having just one inf_users?<br />
<br />
