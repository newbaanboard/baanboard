See attachment for the image.   Its on every form and its always greyed out.<br />
<br />
Its greyed out and I can't seem to see how to activate it.<br />
<br />
Anybody have any ideas here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th February 2022, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Is that really 4c4?  I do not have that button on any of our screens and I looked at the one you have in the screen shot.  Also I looked at maintain forms and buttons to see if a way to add it to a form - nothing on our system.  I have really never seen it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dcCalif</div><div class="date">11th February 2022, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly, I've never seen that in all my years working with Baan.  I looked at 3 other Ivc4 environments and it's not there either.  That's why I'm putting it out in this group to see if anybody else has ever seen this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th February 2022, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you can edit the toolbar from within the User Interface Script, so the first thing would be: check the session object information, where is this object built? Maybe the function create.extra.toolbar() is used?<br />
<br />
The functions under the button may be enabled/disabled form.commands or standard.commands.off. The actually used icon is a additional file which can be altered also (check your $BSE/application/xxVVVVRRCCCC/bxxmmm/ dir for *.gif).<br />
<br />
Ah, only now I see it is the Version Scan Tool from Infor Tools... Probably there is (or has been) a version with this button added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">15th February 2022, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Every session in our baan IV (sp 30) has an icon with a paperclip which is greyed out.<br />
Not sure why OP would have the text &quot;attach&quot; instead, unless as Omeluuk says someone has edited the gif files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th February 2022, 21:16</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL - I am curious how you go the paperclip?  Not on any of our sessions anywhere that I can find - tools or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">15th February 2022, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some old screenshots going back over the years, for us it looks like it showed up around 2011 or 2012 which would have been when we did a fresh install of baan to add our Chinese operations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th February 2022, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that interesting.  We kept up to day on portingset and service packs until around 2015 or so.  I check really old screen shots from 2003 to 2014 and never see the paper click.  If we still really used baan I would log a case to find out what it is about and if I could use it.</div></div><hr />
