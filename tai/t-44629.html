I hope the following answers your query..<br />
1- how can take backup for user authorization and restor it into new server?<br />
A) Use ttcon61export to export your user data as well as authorizations to a single dump file (call it &quot;toolsdata&quot; without the double quotes). If you want to restore it, use ttcon61import where you would have to give the path and filename(created with ttcon61export).<br />
 <br />
2- Our data size 120G what's the best way to restore the data, becuase it will take more than 48 hours if I do it through sequintial dump.<br />
A) Restoring from sequential dump would take ages in your case and so it would be best if you use the SQL Backup and Restore. With an ideal server config, this process should be over in about 30 min to an hours time.. Backup your BSE folder along with your baan database. For backing up your BSE you could use the copy method after you stopped all baan services or use the Windows Backup application... <br />

I thought you wanted to upgrade your server so naturally all companies are shifted over..In any case, there are different routes you could take on this regard. Two of them would be..<br />
 <br />
1) Sequential Dump: Depending on the sequential dump size of this single company, you could make a sequential dump of the company you want to move and restore it on the new server. As i said, size is a factor. If the dump size of one single company is beyond 5-8gigs(Re-organizing with data &amp; indices on is a real killer), i suggest you choose option 2<br />
 <br />
2) SQL Backup &amp; Restore: You could take the backup of baan database and once you restore on to the new server you could delete the companies you dont want through Baan and then with the help of a dbcc command in SQL called shrinkfile, you could reclaim the space used by these companies you deleted..<br />
