<br />
Could you please help me find the syntax for the following baan binaries:<br />
<br />
export.exe<br />
import.exe<br />
<br />
Some friends told me that the syntax can be found in Triton manuals. Unfortunately SSA Baan Support Website do not support Tritons anymore.<br />
<br />
We are developing a disaster recovery procedure and we need to automate the Export/Import Data Dictionary. We want to run this jobs using Windows Scheduled Task.<br />

<br />
you really got me there. I first wanted to answer, that there is nothing like import.exe/export.exe in Baan. But I checked:<br />
<br />
a) does not exist in Baan for Unix<br />
b) is there for Baan on NT<br />
<br />
If you enter &quot;export -u&quot; it will give you some command line parameters, but unfortunately no luck with import.exe<br />
<br />
Here some comments:<br />
<br />
- I get the impression, this is for exporting data not the data dictionary. It has parameters for ExportDB, Schemapath etc.<br />
- I do not think you will find it in Triton manuals. Triton only ran on unix and there it does not exist. But I might be wrong there.<br />
- If you talk about desaster recovery, then you want to backup not only the DD, but also the data and the whole installtion, right?<br />
<br />
So why don't you go for bdbpre/post or better directly a backup of your database with the according tools?<br />
<br />
Why bother with the DD alone?<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for replying. Earlier Triton manuals are really hard to find now. We are using export/import to backup the data dictionaries. The table dumps are already taken care of. We are running it every early morning. We also had copies of the environment. We classify our disaster level based in baan's hard crash and soft crash recovery procedure. We want to run export (or import if the command line syntax is available) outside baan's job if possible and we can see it is. Only if we can run it in DOS (or Scheduled Task) like bdbpre.exe and bdbpost.<br />
