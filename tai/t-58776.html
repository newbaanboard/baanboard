<br />
I am having a problem on a new installed Baan IV server. If I want to change to a different company which has the same package combination like my startup company, I am getting the message &quot;First day of the week is different&quot;.<br />
In &quot;Maintain Companies&quot; I made sure that the first day of the week is the same in every company. What could be the reason ?<br />
<br />
Background: It is a new installation. I copied all companies with bdbpre/bdbpost from the old to the new server. Only company 000 is not completely copied (just users, printers , generic units etc.).<br />
<br />
Any ideas where the first day of the week is stored except &quot;Maintain Companies&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

There's an entry in the user file $BSE/lib/user/u&lt;...&gt; named &quot;fdow&quot;.<br />
After changing the First day of the week in &quot;Maintain companies&quot; and converting the user, that value has been adjusted.<br />
