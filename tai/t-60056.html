<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matteo333</div><div class="date">16th February 2011, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">For the daily server backup, the BaanIV services and Oracle services are stopped via script. After the backup, another script runs and starts the services (i.e. Oracle, SSA Logic, Baan Licencing etc.). The last service in the script is Baan Shared Memory. When proceeding the command line:<br />
net start &quot;BaanSharedMemory baan&quot;, a confirmation box appears ('Do you want to clear the complete shared memory or do you want to restore?). <br />
This is quite annoying, because the service won't start until someone is clicking 'Yes'. Is there any way to automatically confirm this question with 'Yes'? We already tried to set something like <br />
net start &quot;BaanSharedMemory baan&quot; /yes<br />
but it soesn't work.<br />
Please help.<br />

Is there a login anywhere in your script that is starting before shared memory starts?  If so, rearrange your script order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">16th February 2011, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably still some bshell's are running if you stop shared memory. It can't delete it because some processes are still accessing it. So before stopping shared memory be sure no baan processes are running anymore.<br />
<br />
You could consider to change your backup strategy, if you implement online backup's you can keep baan up and running.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matteo333</div><div class="date">22nd February 2011, 09:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I put in 'kill ntbshell*' in both, the baanstart and baanstop script, but it doesn't work at all, the box still appears.<br />
Any idea???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jdboer</div><div class="date">22nd February 2011, 09:18</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact the command we used was:<br />
taskkill /f /im ntbshell*<br />
<br />
I believe it came with the Windows resource kit (but I'm not sure)</div></div><hr />
