<br />
When I run a checks session it says , &quot;No data within selection&quot;.  If we change that user to be a superuser it runs immediately and displays the checks.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Did you check the service pack documentation for any post installation tasks or the list of changes that has been brought forth with the application of the service pack?<br />

The check session did work before the upgrade to SP23 so I'm thinking its something in TOOLS area and/or maybe the checks session.</div></div><hr />

Is this happening for just one user or for all financial users who use the cheque sessions?<br />
