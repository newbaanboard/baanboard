<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kansel</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to be able to relocate our BSE_TMP directory for ALL our users. Currently it is in ${BSE}\tmp and I would like this to be change to another drive due to lack of space. (and I know the simple solution is to clean up, and we are allready doing that!)<br />
I have tried setting BSE_TMP=newlocation in the following files: ${BSE}\lib\bse_vars, ${BSE}\lib\defaults\all, ${BSE}\lib\defaults\db_resource and as a system variable (note it's on a Windows 2003 server Not a Unix) and nothing helps. <br />
The only way I seem to be able to succeed is to use -- -set BSE_TMP=newlocation in the bshell environment login. But this have to be set on every user pc and is not an option.<br />
<br />
Please help</div></div><hr />

In there you would find the name of your environment. Right click on it and go to properties. In the environment box you would find BSE_TMP. Click on it and type in a new value(new drive\folder) and click on set button. I guess you should do this for another entry which comes under your environment name called SSA ERP. Do the same there as well..(Right Click&gt; Properties &gt; BSE_TMP etc)<br />
