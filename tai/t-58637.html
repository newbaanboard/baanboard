<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">17th June 2010, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are the steps to install a solution with PMC:<br />
<br />
1. Download the solution from the Infor site and put it on your server<br />
2. Scan Solution (ttpmc2200s000). <br />
(Those steps can be done in one go with the Multi-level download tool (ttpmc2210s000), but then you have to configure some settings first with ttpmc2211s000.)<br />
3. Start Process Solutions (ttpmc2101m000).<br />
4. Select the solution and choose for &quot;check to install&quot; in the application menu.<br />
5. Read the pre- and post-installation instructions, if any.<br />
6. Perform pre-installation actions, if any.<br />
7. Install the solution.<br />
8. Perform post-installation actions, if any.<br />
<br />
Note that you may not be able to install the solution because you need a number of pre-requisite solutions. Then you have to repeat the steps 1 and 2. This is the case that it is very handy to setup de Multi-level download tool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">18th June 2010, 09:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, in BaanIV it is: ttpmc2200m000.<br />
<br />
You can find the PMC menu in Tools &gt; Software Installation &gt; Miscellaneaous &gt; Product Maintenance and Control (Recipient).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fdeivis</div><div class="date">21st June 2010, 23:52</div></div><div class="posttext">thankyou, i found the menu. i logged in as root user and i saw the menu... my user is set with the spanish lenguage. <br />
<br />
Another question, <br />
<br />
How do I know what VRC of the solution should i install?? a dumb question maybe but im not so experienced in baan adm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">22nd June 2010, 09:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably Infor Support recommended you a solution. On Infor365 you can read the solution descriptions and also the Base VRCs for which the solution is available. You have to select here the Update VRC that is connected to that Base VRC. PMC will help you to prevent solutions being installed in the wrong VRC, so there is no risk in choosing the wrong one.</div></div><hr />
