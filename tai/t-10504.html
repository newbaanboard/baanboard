<br />
We installed the Remote Bshell from BaanIVc Master CD on the Client machine.<br />
We started BW client and it worked fine. Rebooted the client machine and it worked fine.<br />
<br />
Then,<br />
we installed the Porting Set 6.1c.06.03 on this remote bshell machine. <br />
On rebooting the machine it now continuously reboots. <br />
<br />
We have Windows 2000 Service Pack 3<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

Probably it is in the mega bytes. Empty this file totally, do not delete it. That will solve your problem temporarily until it fills up again in a few months depending on the usage of your user.<br />
To permanently solve the problem, download and install bw_068_I386 (the most recent Baan client) that does not utilize the file m_help.log.<br />

Good Luck,<br />

<br />
We searched for this log file but it does not exist on the Baan server as well as the remote bshell machine.<br />
<br />
Now we have managed to get the 6.1c.06.06 porting set and installed that. The problem does not occur anymore!<br />
