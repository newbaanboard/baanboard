<br />
here is some unique situation.<br />
<br />
We have production in LN FP5 (singlebyte) and it should be converted to LN 10.5 which it is multibyte/unicode.<br />
<br />
The standard export/import tools are not working (incompatible versions).<br />
<br />
I think there is hidden variable PREVERSION which it should be set to 3 or 4 and it should resolve problem during import.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if somebody used this and if it is going work in this situation ?<br />
<br />
The second option is direct migration through SQL Server (out of LN) which it should automatically take care of conversion but I am not sure if it is true and how to do it.<br />
<br />
Any input regarding this is welcome ...<br />
<br />
Please let me know ...<br />
<br />

<br />
Could you please let me know what value did you use - 3 or 4 ?<br />
<br />
Also, did you put ASCII_tolerance setup when you export data along with PREVERSION or just PREVERSION?<br />
<br />
Same question for importing process ....<br />
<br />
I think PREVERSION is OK if you export/import between different version (newer vs older Tools set) but when you are dealing with unicode vs non-unicode it is not working or I am not right ... Can I use it for export from non-unicode and import to unicode system.<br />

It can work with single byte. We are testing the upgrade from  FP3 to 10.5, seems to be working well so far.</div></div><hr />

Infor LN Release: 10.4<br />
Publication Date: December 4, 2014<br />

<br />
Database settings<br />
This section provides general guidelines for a correct database configuration for LN. The database instance must be created manually. The database can be created through the Installation Wizard.<br />
The installation wizard does not create directories for database files. Ensure these directories already exist.<br />
Disk space<br />
For performance reasons we recommend to allocate the full size of the database tablespaces according the sizing recommendation during the creation of the tablespace. For example, if the sizing requires 500 GB disk space for the database for the coming two years, allocate that size during the database creation. In order to decrease the disk space, the compress database table on functionality can be considered.<br />
Character set<br />
Before you start the installation you must have decided what Character Set you are using for LN. We recommend that you use Unicode. When using Unicode, integrations with other applications are possible and extra languages can be added to your environment. Changing from Single Byte to Unicode after the installation is a very time consuming conversion. Compared with Single byte, a Unicode character set has impact on performance and requires more disk space. For more specific sizing<br />
information and the impact on your hardware, contact Infor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The document you have referred to was last updated in 2014. The one I looked at was for 10.5 updated in 2016 and it does not mention about the integration problem etc if not Unicode. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">26th January 2017, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Pramod the 10.5 installation pdf does not have that section as most of the newer installations are going with the Unicode, as they are also implementing multi-languages, ION integration and/or XM, FactoryTrack, TimeTrack, Supply Web etc. So one can position themselves better with the Product road-map and recommendations to make it easy for future upgrades.</div></div><hr />

NPR's comment make sense. We would be in your situation pretty soon doing single-byte to multi-byte. So please share your experience when done.</div></div><hr />
