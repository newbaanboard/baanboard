<br />
B40Uc4 got corrupted and in this Update VRC installed SP3-SP6. We need an immediate solution for this and somebody from the Baan support suggested to copy the software components from B40Uc4 to B40Tc4. We are able to resolve the problem but now we are facing another problem:<br />
<br />
We need to install the SP7 and SP8 to the newly created Update VRC B40Tc4 but the registry  or pre-requisite solutions are in  B40Uc4. <br />
<br />
What other  possible solutions applicable without reinstalling the solutions  (service packs) to  B40Tc4 VRC?<br />
<br />
any suggestions is greatly appreciated.<br />

thanks,<br />

<br />
Did you try using the sessions Disconnect Solutions from VRC (ttpmc2202m000) and Connect Solutions to VRC (ttpmc2201m000)? Worst case scenario would be to hack the PMC tables I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julia0726</div><div class="date">7th February 2002, 03:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
thanks for your response...<br />
<br />
yes, I tried using Connect Solutions to VRC  for the newly created VRC (B40Tc4). However, there still need to install the solutions because status is &quot;Available&quot; once I connect the solution from the Old Update VRC to the new one.<br />
<br />
yes worst case is to hack the pmc tables. <br />
<br />
I checked all the pmc tables related and I found three tables (ttpmc201, ttpmc202, and ttpmc260) need to be copied.<br />
<br />
Here are the steps Im planning to do correct me if i missed anything here.<br />
<br />
1. Backup tables ttpmc202 and ttpmc260 using session Create Sequential dump of tables (delimited) . <br />
2. Load the backup file for table ttpmc202 using Wordpad or Notepad. Replace the B40U (first column) to B40T for both tables ttpmc202 and ttpm260.<br />
3. Save and exit the file ttpmc202000. S and ttpmc260000. S respectively.<br />
4. Copy the file to baan server.<br />
5. Check the number of records for tables ttpmc202 and ttpmc260 using session ttaad4100 (GTM) . Please take note of the number of records.<br />
6. Load the dump using session Create Tables from Sequential Dump with the following options set to YES.<br />
<br />
Append if Table does not Exists:<br />
Create Rows before index<br />
Ignore Referential Integrity<br />
Disable Domains Constraints<br />
7. Check the number of records for tables in step number 5. <br />
<br />
hope to hear again from you.<br />
<br />
thanks and best regards,<br />

<br />
That sounds about correct. Just make sure that your table backups are 100% correct. I would also use the option 'drop table before import' for convenience. If for some reason it still doesn't work out, you can always re-import the backed up versions of your PMC tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julia0726</div><div class="date">5th April 2002, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,<br />
<br />
The solution which is hacking the pmc tables is not agreed by Baan support bec. it could resulted future problems.<br />
<br />
However, the customer already did that and it works but since it is not advisable we choose to use the option A in which we will install service pack3-6 in another Update VRC. Then afterwards, we will change the derivation struction of live VRC from the newly created update VRC.<br />
<br />
I would like to clarify if will  there be a problem in Tools or in application if we rescan and reinstall the service packs 3-6 in newly created Update VRC? We all know that in BaanIV4c4 there is only one Tools directory that is being updated. If we <br />
install SP3, Tools version  will be downgraded. In this case, there will be a problem. Is it right if we scan from SP3-SP6 then install SP6? This will automatically  install its pre-requisites which are SP3-SP5.<br />
<br />
Please advise  on this.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">5th April 2002, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I can understand that BGS is saying that table hacking is not supported - unless they do it of course :)<br />
<br />
As to creating a duplicate update VRC: we tried that once as well on a b5 installation and it completely messed up that PMC layer. Possibly it could have been linked to problems in SP7 but in the end we had to rebuild the lot from scratch.<br />
<br />
So you can't give any definite advice on that, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julia0726</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
We advised the customer to install sp3-sp8 to their new update VRC  because there will be total downtime of system and they took advantage of the 3 days vacation.<br />
<br />
They are currently installing SP7. They encountered error 205 (index out of dims)  in installing SP6 but that was resolved by copying the backup of tools object ottiex1288 (backup before they proceed in installing sp3 onwards).<br />
<br />
However, BGS  introduced solution number 122399. This will not install Tools soln when it is installed in another update VRC.<br />
<br />
<br />
thank you.<br />

<br />
It seems like solution #122399 is a pretty important PMC update and fixes a good bit of old PMC problems.<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing the info with us!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone had any experience with the patch to PMC as mentioned ie 122399 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Frank,<br />
<br />
I had problems when loading the 122399 solution on to our pre-production server. There was a couple of pre-reqs loaded (110334 and 110323) that needed to have new reporting tables created. PMC obviously loaded these solutions then a subsequent solution tried to load and I got a screen full of errors.<br />
<br />
Admittedly if we kept more up to date with SP's then we probably wouldn't have encountered this issue.<br />
<br />
Just something to keep an eye out for.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks <br />
<br />
May I ask what SP you are on ?<br />
<br />
We are at SP8. and had problems recently downloading a solution<br />
since some of the subsidiary solutions did not appear to be &quot;available&quot;<br />
<br />
On a separate point , I recently asked Baan if they could/would/should add &quot;estimated&quot; download times as guides<br />
I appreciate we may all have different bandwidths but it may also depend upon their resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">You're much more up to date than us.<br />
<br />
We run at SP5. <br />
<br />
We take the view &quot;Why fix it if it's not broken&quot; We load individual solutions as and when we need to. This stance also avoids having to deploy business resources onto fully testing the SP's in a pre-production environment.<br />
<br />
Download time indicator, could be useful. I must admit being on SP5 I automatically presume that any solution will have a number of pre-req's and just leave the solutions downloading in the background.<br />
<br />
What bandwidth do you have available?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 256K but this &quot;shared&quot; with internet users , although these are strictly limited<br />
<br />
We went to SP8 for 2 main reasons , the PMC tool and ,as we have Crystal , the ability to &quot;hold and customise&quot; Baan standard reports which to date we are still awaiting some feedback from Baan/Seagate in order to realise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">110334 and 110323 are &quot;old&quot; friends of mine.<br />
Hope you followed instead the instructions of 116358, because those ones cause PMC dependency chain problems...<br />
Printing to ASCII also stop functioning after those two ones (and we are on SP6 with a bunch of after SP6 patches).<br />
<br />
There is a new PMC functionality mentioned in the Baan support website regarding faster SP installations, pre-warnings regarding need to convert runtime on the &quot;check to install&quot; of solutions, and a lot more [goodies], I advise to read it well !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th April 2002, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Frank, should point out that I heard that the update to Crystal requires you are on Service Pack 9 (and seeing that 10 is out there somewhere and 11 is due, makes me wonder who does actually keep up to date).<br />
<br />
An estimated time would be nice but then again so would a rough guide to the size of the file and a bit more info on what each bit of the solution does as well. How many times have we all installed a solution and wondered just what the hell that tiny bit there actually does and why they need to upgrade that?<br />
<br />
And, Frank, not forgetting the time when installation of one EDI patch meant the removal of about 1500 defect solutions from a previous service pack. God that day was a nightmare!</div></div><hr />

Thanks information about SP9 requirement to &quot;facilitate&quot; this feature of Crystal<br />
<br />
The same was said at the Tech Sig meeting earlier today<br />
<br />
We are still waiting for this &quot;information&quot; from Baan !!!from whom we get the support for this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">24th April 2002, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Chris<br />
<br />
Still recovering !?  But have heard from two others saying this functionality requires SP9</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">24th April 2002, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't been able to read the boards for a while, so I am doing a quick catch-up here. Somebody might already have brought this up.<br />
<br />
Bad patches are one of the biggest pains in Baan, combined with their patch-upon-patch methodology and the fragile symbiosis of dynamic source code and customized objects.<br />
The only other application that I can think of that gets away with this kind of policy is Oracle and I&quot;M SADDLED UP WITH BOTH!!!:mad: <br />
<br />
...did I skip anger management class last night?<br />
<br />
anyway..<br />
<br />
When you load a lot of patches (service packs) or patches that have hundreds of dependencies, you simply have to take precautions because you can not rely on PMC for recovery.<br />
<br />
The thing to do is this:<br />
- do an export of company 000 to save your meta data<br />
- back-up your $bSE/application directory<br />
- back-up your dict directory<br />
<br />
Should all hell break lose, then these are the three things that need to be restored to their previous state and most likely this will give you a faster recovery than tape back-ups, not to mention the fact that it does not affect any user data (which they will probably appreciate).<br />
<br />
Happy patching.</div></div><hr />

- back-up the $BSE/tools directory</div></div><hr />
