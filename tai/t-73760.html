<br />
SLM supports the following license types:<br />
* concurrent user licenses<br />
* named user licenses<br />
* server licenses<br />
* instance licenses<br />
* desktop licenses<br />
<br />
As the &quot;instance&quot; and &quot;desktop&quot; licenses are rarely used, they are not explained in this KB.<br />
<br />
concurrent user licenses<br />
Defintion: A user-locking license in which a pool of concurrent users can use the adopting application.<br />
<br />
The SLM server counts the number of concurrent users at a particular time.<br />
There is no distinction between usernames, desktop names and servernames.<br />
If the number of users exceeds the licensed amount of concurrent users, the SLM server rejects the license request<br />
<br />
To see the amount of licenses in use:<br />
Run the command &quot;SlmCmd -montts &lt;SLMserver&gt;&quot;.<br />
The output will show for each product a license count like 'count=&quot;4&quot;'. This shows the amount of allocated concurrent user licenses for a product.<br />
In case of a cluster the command needs to be run for each node in the cluster, and the results for all nodes should be added.<br />
<br />
named user licenses<br />
Defintion: A user-locking license in which a pool of specific named users can use the adopting application.<br />
<br />
The SLM server checks for a specific user name in combination with the desktop name where the application is running.<br />
Licenses requested for the same desktop and the same user are shared. Only one license is allocated per user per desktop; even when connecting to different servers.<br />
You can specify that a specific user can run the application concurrently from multiple desktops, by increasing the User Count in the SLM Snapin.<br />
Each desktop on which this user runs the application decreases the number of available licenses by one.<br />
<br />
To see the amount of licenses in use:<br />
In the Slm snapin, look for the column &quot;Licenses in use&quot;. It will show the amount of licenses that are actually allocated for a specific named user for a product.<br />
Note that you need to refresh the license information to get the actual status (&quot;All tasks - Refresh the license-in-use information&quot;)<br />
<br />
server licenses<br />
Defintion: A node-locking license in which a pool of specific named server or desktop computers can use the adopting application.<br />
<br />
The SLM server keeps track of a list of servers that can be used for an application.<br />
One license is needed per server. All licenses requested from one server are shared. Only one license is allocated per server.<br />
<br />
To see the amount of licenses in use:<br />
In the Slm snapin, look for the column &quot;License in use&quot;. It will show if a licenses is actually allocated for a specific server for a product.<br />
Note that you need to refresh the license information to get the actual status (&quot;All tasks - Refresh the license-in-use information&quot;)<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
Additional notes:<br />
<br />
* To get more details on what licenses are actually allocated, the following command can be used on the system where SlmServer is running:<br />
&quot;SlmCmd -mondts &lt;SLMserver&gt;&quot;.<br />
Note that in case of a SLM cluster, this command should be run for each node of the cluster, and the results should be combined to get the full overview.<br />
For each allocated license it will show the following information:<br />
- user               The username that requested a license<br />
                        Only used for Named User licenses<br />
- desktop         The desktop name or ip address for which the license was requested.<br />
                        Only used for Named User licenses<br />
- server_id       The Slm Id of the server for which the license was requested.<br />
                        Only used for Server licenses<br />
- process_id     The process_id of the the process from which the license was reqeusted.<br />
                        Not used for license allocation<br />
<br />
* The &quot;SlmCmd -monttd &lt;SLMserver&gt;&quot; and &quot;SlmCmd -mondts &lt;SLMserver&gt;&quot; commands show all processes that requested a license per product.<br />
But note that only for Concurrent User licenses this is also the amount of consumed licenses (licenses in use) for that product.<br />
For Server licenses, the processes that have the same Server_Id do share the licenses. So only the processes with different Server_ids (SLM IDs) really consume a license.<br />
For Named User licenses, the processes that have the same Desktop_Id and Username do share the licenses. So only the processes with different Desktop IDs or different usernames really consume a license.<br />
(note that the Slm snapin does show the actually consumed licenses)<br />
<br />
* Sometimes it can occur that Named User licenses are used and a desktop comsumes two licenses.<br />
This can occur when one license is requested using the DNS name of the desktop, and another license is requested using the IP address.<br />
The SLM Server sees this as two different desktops and will therefore comsume two licenses in stead of one.<br />
This can for example occur, when a desktop name is not correctly defined within the DNS servers or when there are multiple network cards active at the desktop.<br />
<br />
* Specific for BaanIV, Baan5 and ERPLN:<br />
Licenses are not always requested when a bshell is started.<br />
Only when an object is loaded in the bshell that needs a license, an actual license is consumed.<br />
With the latest portingsets and enterprise server versions, this means that a tools license (enterprise server license) is consumed when the bshell is started. But with older versions of Enterprise Server and portingset, it could happen that a bshell is started without a licensed tools object. In that case the tools-license is requested when the first tools session is started (or when e.g. a device is selected from another session, or a text is opened).<br />
For the application licenses this means that it is only consumed when an application session is actually started.<br />
<br />

How to limit double login with concurrent license in SLM?<br />
<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
I think you can not set double login limit with concurrent license type. It can be doable with named user license type , user count attribute.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kacbar</div><div class="date">9th March 2021, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a sad news because we have quite a few concurrent licenses and it happens that one user logs in twice and the other user cannot use the system. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">9th March 2021, 08:56</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been a real pain, when we started migrating from LN 10.2 to LN 10.7. All licenses have been provieded by one SLM. We did run out of licenses to often. (But we're lucky: Infor will double your licenses when migrating; so now we're using two SLM, te &quot;official&quot; SLM and the &quot;testing&quot; SLM for the new LN 10.7 server).<br />
What we did bevore the second SLM was setting up timeout for the users. It would be better to prevent double login, but timeout was the best we had. It worked, but did only provide some help. So 'out of license' did still come up on login when all licenses had been used up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dunvince</div><div class="date">29th October 2021, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We used to have the exact same issue.  I purchased an addon from Disus in Toronto that allows me to control login limits for each user.  It also automatically logs users out after a set period of inactivity. This period is also configurable per user.  The cost was very reasonable and one of the best additions to our system.<br />
I do not work for Disus but have used them for services many times over the past 20 years.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />
