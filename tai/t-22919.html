<br />
Following problem - contradict to B40:<br />
<br />
in &quot;Maintain User Data&quot; (ttaad2500m000/ttams1100s000) in the field System Login entries of capitals become after &lt;Tab&gt; lower-case letters. So Zadmin becomes then for my account zadmin, but there is not the account zadmin (under unix) and so comes after the next &lt;Tab&gt; the warning TTAAD21001: user need known in passwd would file. Logical. <br />
<br />
Within Support is sol. 75588 available (from Koen), but this more or less explains, that Baan Dev. has for B50 onwards only the Microsoft-view (and forgotten the Unix-world): Look in the attach and then to chapter Conclusion.<br />
<br />
A discussion with Support/PEG/Dev. shows, that itÂ´s a lot of work to change back to get System Login plus all what is behind work case-sensitive. And therefore all fear about that much work.<br />
So the question was raised: Are other enterprises are also interested having this feature (back) ?<br />
<br />
We here have 500 licences and I know that the major manufacturer of machine tools (turning/milling) in germany with more then 1000 licences has the same problem.<br />
<br />
2nd question: Does anybody know a nice solution to come over this problem without change BaaN-Tools ?<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your replies !<br />

We need the b only because unix doesn't accept numbers only. But I think it would be very much work for you to change all logins, homedirectorys ...  :o . The advantage of this login is, it is easy to find the employee from the login code i.e. if you need adress data, email, whatever. <br />
