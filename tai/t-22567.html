<br />
Also, usually people just run ttiex3228 (patch objects after system crash)<br />
to get you running again (that gives you 7 days) but if you've got DEM then that won't work.<br />

And sent the System config report on next working day, got the keys and did applied those keys on weekend. About DEMs we are using our own version of DEMs, we didnÂ’t get any issues with DEMs.</div></div><hr />

It is possible that SSA changed the policy, but as Dave already mentioned it is no big deal because of your grace period (I thought it was 30 days, but I might be wrong). You will usually receive your new key within 24 hours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">8th December 2004, 22:37</div></div><div class="posttext">If you leave the old server running you can set the licence server for the new server to point at the old server and then take your time about getting the new licence keys. This is how I normally do it. The only time this will not work is if the licence type changes like going from sql to oracle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you like to plan ahead, then you approach is most likely anyway the following:<br />
<br />
a) inform Baan of your plans<br />
b) Do a test (!) migration to the new system<br />
c) Promise Baan (in writing) to switch of the old system soon<br />
d) Validate the new system<br />
e) test the new system<br />
f)  Repeat step b and go live witha validated system<br />
g) Switch of the old<br />
<br />
<br />
This way you never have the issue to start with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">11th December 2004, 01:54</div></div><div class="posttext">When we asked for some contact phone-numbers to put in our IT Disaster Recovery Plan recently to permit relincencing in an emergency, Support advised that what we needed was an &quot;extended maintenance&quot; coverage contract that would cover the weekends as well as the dark hours. Our 9to5 business day-only contract did not cover anything else.  <br />
<br />
When I asked this forum I got the good advice that we have incorporated in our DR plan to &quot;patch objects after system crash&quot; to get 7/20 day temporary licence.<br />
<br />
We went back to SSA to query why they didn't suggest this option we didn't get a sensible answer.  My feeling is that this is part of the pronounced SSA strategy of &quot;growing the customer&quot; or as I heard again yesterday at a conference thier &quot;Value Proposition&quot;, I think they both mean new ways of getting additional cutomer money for what the customer has already paid and continues to pay annual fees for. <br />
