I have been working mostly on Win Nt Servers, and there we have the event viewer which captures errors and other information, how about Sun solaris / Unix server , where r these errors captured ? Is there any file which is created in $BSE/log folder in case of Sun Solaris/Unix ?<br />

<br />
in Unix the logs are written in $BSE/log, but in several files. The bshell, ba61, filter6.1, database drivers all have there own files.<br />
<br />
To see the latest written logfiles just type:<br />
<br />
ls -ltr<br />
<br />
To see the end of a logfile, do:<br />
<br />
tail -n 100 $BSE/log/log.bshell6.1<br />
<br />

I hope you are familiar with Baan's own session for displaying logs &quot;ttstperrlog&quot; which can be started using &quot;start program&quot; menu. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

When when I tried deleting Sales Order via Archive session which internally DELETES SO Lines, but Lines Deletion got failed since it has a linked with my customized table.<br />
<br />
In log.bshell I could only figure out the table tdsls401 deletion failed because of a linkage with some other table  ... but which table is linked it din't captured that.<br />
<br />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now which other log i should see which tells the relationship of tdsls401 with this X table ?<br />
<br />
Currently i just saw the dict file of tdsls401, that is how i came to know the cust. table name. , but i beleive there will be definately some other log file which captures the table linked and the record on which it got failed.<br />
<br />
In case of Win NT it use to be event viewer which use to even tell me the table record and the table name. Please tell me the name of the log file in Unix env.<br />

Well unfortunately the log doesn't show anything, infact I checked these files before posting the query on baanboard, these files were modified 7 days back, and i cross checked it by opening it also. <br />
<br />
I have checked following file in log dir<br />
<br />
log.oracle8<br />
log.bshell<br />
log.ora.sql<br />
<br />
and only log.bshell is my latest file. Any hint .... I am struck up, i am herewith attaching the screen shot also of the error message. Is it some sort of stnd. bug, just have a look on the screen shot.<br />

<br />
I am nor familiar with sls401 table but I suggest you check each and every filed that references an external field (shouldn't be many) to find the culprit.<br />

<br />
Well i tried simulating the parent / child relationship by creating 2 tables , and i tried deleting the header data via script of header script , even though childs were present. So as it was expected it got failed with this ref. error but log.bshell din't captured the child table or the record info.<br />
<br />
Is it the problem with Sun solaris env. ? My O/S is Sun Solaris .<br />
<br />
Terry problem is that for one table i can go through all the field , but since i am doing archiving , so i want to ensure that what ever cust. table r linked with stnd. that should also be archived. Now once i run the archive session my stnd. session fails, but log.bshell doesn't tell which cust. table i should go into, so that i should take care of my cust. table also.<br />
<br />
Currently i am just refrring to dict file.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th January 2005, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Slightly off topic, but you can get this information through running a db trace on your bshell when you run the session.  This will create a log with the info on what table caused the fail.  <br />
<br />
Here's a link with some good documentation on tracing.<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1068&amp;highlight=TTSQLTRACE<br />
<br />
Which setting to use can be confusing.  I'm bad at this, but you can try:<br />
-- -set DBSLOG=01366 -dbgobj -keeplog -logfile mylog<br />
<br />
You may need to play with the number, this will give you WAY more info than you need, but should be able to see it somewhere in there.  Or check that post to understand better.   It will create the 'mylog' file in your home directory.</div></div><hr />

Well which other system u r talking off, r u talking off Win NT scene, if yes, then on that i did this sort of testing long back when that environment was available to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yaah may be putting up sql trace would be the last resort, but do you have any idea as to this seems to be more of Tools related problem , so which solution / service pack could solve this problem. Meanwhile I have started searching BaaN Support site.<br />

<br />
I think that may be the problem. 6.2a is way too old. (Thus buggy)<br />
<br />
You'd have to either Trace or do as you did and check the DD.<br />

<br />
Well putting up DBSLOG trace only captured info ... which is not usefull to me. Refer to the attached file<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried putting<br />
<br />
<br />
-- -set TT_SQL_TRACE=020040 -keeplog -logfile /export/home/bsp/Arch/new_item.log<br />
<br />
and also tried with diff. diff. TT_SQL_TRACE No., but nobody captured my child table information or the record information which made my session failed.<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me the exact No. that I will require to put in TT_SQL_TRACE ?<br />
<br />
I have already registered the case with BaaN, lets see what they say.<br />
<br />
But by the mean time if somebody can help me out I will be really thankfull.<br />
