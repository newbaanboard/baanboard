Can anybody give me some pointers on any possible issues that we may encounter plus any other guidelines.<br />
<br />
Our current set-up:<br />
<br />
HPUX 11<br />
Oracle 8.0.5.2<br />
Baan IVc4, SP5, porting set 6.1c.05.02<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">9th November 2001, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Should be no problem. However we got the advise from Baan to go to 8.1 because it solves some problems.</div></div><hr />

I would not expect any problems since this a minor upgrade only. You might want to check with Oracle Support for Oracle specifics. I also agree with Han's remark that you should consider going for Oracle 8i (8.1.7) on a short term basis as the support for releases 8.0.x is limited (no error correction anymore).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">9th November 2001, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your replies.<br />
<br />
Our DBA does want to go to 8.1 but would rather take the 8.0.6 path first.<br />
<br />
Also, we have upgraded our DR site from 805 to 806 but how do you link Baan to the new db environment? We've identfied the ora8_inst6.1 script but this seems a bit long winded for such a simple change.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

Your link between Baan &lt;-&gt; Oracle is configured trough the sessions 'Maintain Database definitions [ttaad4110m000]' and 'Assign tables to Databases' [ttaad4111m000].<br />
<br />
You can either create a new database in ttaad4110m000 with the new ORACLE_HOME setting (if present there) and reassign your tables to this new database <br />
- or -<br />
simply change the current database definition to point to the new ORACLE_HOME.<br />
<br />
Do not forget to convert to runtime so that your $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1 is updated. Make sure you check the file as well before starting the upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the quick response.<br />
<br />
Our problem is that we cannot open Baan.<br />
<br />
Should we have done what you've suggested before performing the actual upgrade?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, you switch your database definitions before you upgrade your Oracle environment. You would have to hack your tabledef6.1 now to reflect the new ORACLE_HOME. I think that would make Baan accessible again, then you log in again and apply the changes in previous mentioned sessions and do a Convert to Runtime again.<br />
<br />
In worst case you have to hack one of the tt tables (can't check which one right now) to update your database definition from SQL*Plus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly what I did, changed the paths in the tabledef6.1 and everything worked fine.<br />
<br />
I'll remember to use the sessions next time!!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition to upgrading Oracle I also want to take the opportunity to install the latest Baan service packs and porting set. Does it matter in which order the upgrades (Oracle, SP's, porting set) are performed?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say that it depends on what you're installing and even if you shouldn't get problems, by experience I would suggest to install things in some sort of chronological order, eg., install first SP7 and then portingset 6.1c.06.02 (latest), not vice-versa, and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Victor,<br />
<br />
What I intended to do was:<br />
<br />
1. Perform Oracle 805 to 806 upgrade and test<br />
2. Install SP 6, 7 &amp; 8 and test<br />
3. Install latest porting set and test<br />
<br />
All to be done on a pre-production server.<br />
<br />
If you had to complete the same task would you do it in this order?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice<br />
<br />
PJ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I would do that.<br />
I would sugest however to run creation of RTDD in between each of the SP's and follow any Baan recommendations regarding them (check the latest info about service pack x on the Baan website).<br />
<br />
Also, as extra info, if you're comming from a portingset under 6.1c.06, you will have new added functionality related to bdbpre/bdbpost you will need to do some updates regarding to report generation - new functionality added related to html headers and you need to create a few tables (solution 110334).<br />
<br />
As general rule, try to check everything before you start the work :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I've already come across solution 110334 in conjuction with 110323 with the three new report template tables. <br />
<br />
We installed it onto our TEST server an couldn't compile any reports after, due to the age of our current porting set.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />
