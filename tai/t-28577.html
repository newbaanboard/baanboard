<br />
How can we start the jobdaemon in 000 company.<br />
<br />
I'am working on LN6.1 SP1, HP Unix environment and i have 1-2 jobs regarding the application locks removal and purge print queues that are generated in 000 company.<br />
<br />
Now the issue is I don't want to use session ttaad5206m000 as it start the job daemon in the foreground and doesn't simply close unless you kil it.<br />
<br />
Jobdaemon is working well for all companies in backgroud ( started through /etc &gt; ./rc.startjobdm), but doesn't start the jobs in 000.<br />
<br />
could anybody suggest any command to make job daemon work for 000 company in the backgroud.<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance and regards,<br />

<br />
To remove application locks as well as print queues by using database level and OS level programming. You have to simply write one PL/SQl in oracle similar like Trigger and fire that PL/SQL at OS level by using OS job management. This will definatly help you.<br />
<br />
This will helpful because your company number always will remain same.<br />

You must be starting it from your worktop. You can use it command line from Unix and use &amp; so that it can run in background.<br />
Jobdaemon is working well for all companies in backgroud ( started through /etc &gt; ./rc.startjobdm), but doesn't start the jobs in 000.<br />
You just have to set the BSE_COMPNR (company number) to 000 and it will run too.<br />
Refer to the thread - Job question(s) (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9287&amp;highlight=DS_SERVER)<br />

Sanjay, I am not sure why rebuild the wheel -<br />
Refer to the $BSE/etc/rc.start script -&gt;<br />
#Optional Remove all Application Locks<br />
#${BSE}/etc/rc.start_remall<br />
ttaad3221m000 - Purge Device Queue - add it to a BaaN job in Company 000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssamuel</div><div class="date">16th November 2006, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">For system jobs (locks, device que, etc) you can execute the job from an OS scheduler (i.e. cron) to run in the background.<br />
The job must be created in co 000 and executed by a user in company 000.  <br />
1.  Create user job000 - company 000<br />
2. copy $BSE/etc/rc.startjob script --&gt; rc.startjob000<br />
and modify user name to the company 000 user.<br />
# If you want to use several companies you can create several users for e.g.<br />
# root who probably is running this script. If so, copy this script and use<br />
# the next line to define the USER variable (&lt;root100&gt; is just an example).<br />
USER=job000        ;export USER<br />
3. Create a job in 000 called LOCKS to remove the appl locks.<br />
4. Create a script LOCKS that contains the system vars and the job name <br />
Linux example:<br />
#!/bin/bash<br />
BSE=/ln/bse<br />
BSE_TMP=${BSE}/tmp<br />
BAMODE=1<br />
export BAMODE<br />
#TERM=vt100<br />
#export TERM<br />
MANPATH=${MANPATH}:${BSE}/doc/man<br />
ORACLE_HOME=/ln/oracle/product/10.2.0/client1<br />
ORACLE_SID=LNDB<br />
SHLIB_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/lbin:$ORACLE_HOME/lib64:$ORACLE_HOME/bin<br />
PATH=${BSE}/bin:${PATH}:$ORACLE_HOME/bin<br />
export BSE BSE_TMP PATH LANGUAGE MANPATH ORACLE_HOME ORACLE_SID SHLIB_PATH<br />
#rc.stopjob100<br />
#cd /ln/bse/etc<br />
/ln/bse/etc/rc.startjob.job000 LOCKS<br />
<br />
4. When the os script LOCKS is executed, the job is activated in the background<br />
          <br />
Remember that the user executing the job must be assigned to the company in which the job will run.  And, that user must be identified in the $BSE/etc/rc.startjob script.<br />

<br />
Thanx a lot for your advise.<br />
<br />
My jobs are running fine now.<br />
<br />
I have created a user with default comp 000 and then logged into server through telnet and that user. Then started the jobdaemon ./rc.startjobdm and it worked well.<br />
<br />
Jobs were put in queue.<br />
<br />
thanks and regards,<br />
