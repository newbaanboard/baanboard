<br />
Some user ask me to automat some process like Process Deliver Purchase Order, Finalize bath, etc. I hear that in Baan we can use Job Management to do that task, but unfortunately I have no experience or knowledge to implement that. Could someone told me how to use Job Management ( Please step by step, and maybe use PDPO for example) ? And can we automat session ttstpdelrlock to close baan session lock for date until yesterday ?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
What title of books that you mention in your last reply. I try to ask to our Baan Representative Office in my country, but they don't know about the book. <br />
<br />

<br />
this books are in digital form (on CD)<br />
<br />
For BaanIV we bought from our Baan support one CD with Folio Views SW on it where is a sea of books with Baan numbers on it.<br />
There are thousands of pages - some of them I printed.<br />
<br />
I think the name of CD an database of digital books is <br />
&quot;Knowledge quest&quot;.<br />
<br />
Only one book in paper form we have is &quot;Implementing Baan IV&quot;<br />
which cover only overview of all Baan packages ....<br />
<br />

<br />
We have &quot;Implementing Baan IV&quot; ( I think all baan user have this book and only this book). So when you mention about the other book, you get my interest. <br />
<br />
About CD that contain many guides, is it the Documentation CD ? I print one topik about install Baan IV on SQL 7. If is true, maybe you can share your knowledge about topics in CD that usefull to me. Thanks for answer.<br />
<br />

take a look at BaaN global Support and make a search for 'advanced guide 1001' at the knowledgebase. This gives you a document which can show you the way.<br />
If using an NT-based installation you should also look for solutions 9629,2378 and 18816.<br />
<br />
May it help you...:)</div></div><hr />
