Anybody out there who has a work around, PLs help.<br />
It installs fine on Win XP SP1 and if we put in SP2 the application works fine. I think it is something to do with the install kit.<br />

You have to open a case with SSA to fix this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed that the software did not make any registry entries on the machine where it was succesfully working. So all I had to do was copy the ibaanPDMcore folder into the WinXP  SP2 machine and then Put in the required environment variables ( BPDM NETNODE, etc etc...) and it worked.<br />
THere was a problem with report generator. To tackle that, I just installed only the report generator from the install kit. THis seemed to work okay.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
