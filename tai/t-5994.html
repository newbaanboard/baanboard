I have been receiving this error &quot;Fatal Error: Can't open input file ptdinv7458ag&quot;  when trying to compile a script I have just created.  I know the script exists because I have checked BSE/app and it's there.  <br />
 I guessed that this must be a permission thing but I have 'full control' of the NT file &amp; dir(s).  Is there something missing from my baan user profile? or?<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noname</div><div class="date">4th August 2002, 05:40</div></div><div class="posttext">You are all right,  it was a very simple thing.  The code was automatically generated and I added just a little to it and I knew the bit I added should have been fine but what I didn't notice was a &quot;/&quot; sign in the very first character of the script. This &quot;/&quot; got in there because I am often switching from vi to wordpad and searching with a &quot;/&quot; instead of a Ctrl-F.  Thanks for your help,</div></div><hr />
