<br />
Has somebody an idea how to solve this problem?<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that depends on what you consider as desktops!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we have created several desktops and linked those desktops in the user management as the <br />
Startup Program (GUI). The normal menu browser and the function &quot;call session by code&quot; are disabled.<br />
<br />
By doing this we could be sure that no user is able to start sessions he should not be able to. This is a very simple security concept and easy to maintain as each user is allowed to work on all data in those sessions he is allowed to start.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have already created those desktops, but as I have to maintain 17 subsidiaries (all with an own installation)I am looking for a solution to copy the desktops from one machine to second machine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I understand now. Am I right in thinking that you want to copy the desktops from one Baan server to another server?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We already dumped the related table, but when <br />
importing this dump we faced some problems because of an index number baan is giving automatically to every desktop you are creating<br />

Its not as easy as moving the table across because of the problems you have mentioned. I always find that moving info from one machine to another is not as easy as it looks.</div></div><hr />
