<br />
Can anybody help me on is3 to is5 migration for Baan IV c4.<br />
<br />
Actually, i want to know in terms of functionalities what changes will come and second technically what will be changed.<br />
<br />
i know in is5 localisation sessions have l prefix e.g tdindl271s000<br />
<br />
Similarly, there will be one new session added &quot;calculate taxes after deliveries&quot; which is mandatory in sales prior to Baan else Data will not move in tdsls901.<br />
<br />
Similarly, the way of calling tdind0271s000 also change. now you also have a session &quot;Generate localised Data&quot; to generate localised data of an order.<br />
<br />
<br />
can anybody help me on more. does anybody have any doc which contains info on what chnages will be happening in is5 specially on functionality front.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
Sandy :o</div></div><hr />
