<br />
I am new to BAAN, and I was wondering if anybody know how to create a role based on a user.  It is a custom role for use in printing Crystal Reports, and all of the authorizations are already set for the user ID.  I just don't know where to start or the procedure for setting up a role based on this.  We are using BAAN iV.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

When you speak about roles, are you using DEM to setup them or you would like to setup some sort of &quot;role&quot; without DEM?</div></div><hr />

All I was told was to create the role based on the authorizations assigned to a specific user.  We use what we call zrols, like zmfgr for manufacturing supervisor, etc.  I was hoping there was a way to copy the user permissions, into a new zrole.  Thanks you for responding.<br />
