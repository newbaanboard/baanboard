same? Are you sure they are exactly up to the same patch level and permissions in the complete directory structure? How did you build this server exactly like the other ones?<br />
This problem seems to be like Java version or Path problem but its not that because this is the server same replica of other those are running tmboaserver successfully.<br />
Did you set up the same environment variables? This error message usually comes up, when the LD_PRELOAD is not set up correctly.<br />
<br />
Also refer to the solution # 154378 on the Baan/Infor Support site -<br />
English	 Cannot start tmboaserver: wrong JDK version after portingset installation<br />
VERSION(S): Baan IV, BaanERP<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: tmboaserver, ttstpbbserver<br />
<br />

Infor/Baan is still the product owner and your vendor if you have any issues with the Support Quality you have to take it up with your vendor instead of venting out at this forum. No one is judging you at this forum based on your knowledge, skill set or communication style. I have found Support team to be quite experienced in USA and have been helpful to resolve issues in our complex environment. Sometimes, you have to give a lot of information about your system configuration for them to reproduce the issue or find a work-around and build a good working relation. <br />
<br />
You have to be more explicit on the Porting Set, OW versions etc.</div></div><hr />
