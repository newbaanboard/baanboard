<br />
I do not know of a way to recover the password, but I do know how to clear it:<br />
<br />
1. bdbpre6.1 -t&quot;|&quot; -N ttadv043 -C 000<br />
2. SAVE THE FILE tttadv043000.S SOMEWHERE VERY SAFE!<br />
3. Recreate the file containing only 0|||| (A zero, followed by four pipe symbols)<br />
4. Place this file in it's own directory<br />
5. bdbpost6.1 -R -t&quot;|&quot; -D.<br />
<br />
Now you won't have a password, and you can use ttadv0146m000 to assign a new one.  Then modify the tools configuration, and afterwards post the saved tttadv043000.S again.  This table contains three encrypted passwords, and I'm not entirely sure of which field is what password, therefore it is better to restore the old contents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 04:09</div></div><div class="posttext">If memory servers correctly, you can also go into change password for system config, enter blank for the old password and then whatever the new password you want.  This is if it had been not initialized before and is empty.  I believe the other session requires a non blank password.  You may want to try that first before reseting the encrypted password.  May or may not work, but worth a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">olabas</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">By printing Current Table Definitions of ttadv043 you can find out that the password for system configuration is stored in ttadv043.cpsc.<br />
If so: Why don't you try this?<br />
<br />
- Make a table-dump of ttadv043<br />
- Save it well!!!<br />
- Run ttaad4100 for ttadv043 and empty ttadv043.cpsc.<br />
- Run ttadv0146m000 to assign a new password.<br />
<br />
I have never tried it out but I think that should work.</div></div><hr />

As soon as you enter the table ttadv043 and try to &quot;Y&quot;es on the command prompt, the following appears (on a Dutch system that is ;) ):</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">olabas</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Try your password for ttaad4100 again. It seems like baan is asking for it after entering a table from ttadv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope.  Just tried it.  As far as I know, it is asking for the Tools password, which is one of the best guarded passwords in Baan world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just logged on as ROOT and a password wasn't asked.<br />

<br />
Referring to my first reply, it just struck me that it poses a problem:  the pipe symbol could be part of the encrypted string! :o So, it would be better to dump the table as fixed length.  Sorry for this mistake! (Nobody's perfect)</div></div><hr />

Access won't ask for a passsword. If you're using TBase, well, hm... that's bad luck then...</div></div><hr />
