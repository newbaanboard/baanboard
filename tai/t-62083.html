<br />
I am trying to upgrade FP2 to FP7 for my client. For this I have set up a testing environment for this case (with FP2 installed). Then, I have created one company and one package combinations (using the one that the client had provided me with). <br />
<br />
So for the next step, I installed the ES PMC Tools update. Followed by ES PMC Tools Addon and finally PMC Application update. Everything went well up to this point.<br />
<br />
Now that the system has been upgraded, it is time to upgrade the company (as it was meant for FP2). However, when I try to initialize data upgrade run, I met this error:<br />
<br />
&quot;dynamic Link Failure function 'tdint.dlltccom.smi.implemented' cannot continue in ottstpregister in DLL : odmsptdll0901 (due.set.batch)&quot;<br />
<br />
Am I doing it wrong? Is there a step that I missed? I would really love to hear what you guys have to say. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If by installing the FP7 solution you mean the ES PMC Application that came along with the CD then yes I have. Other than that, no.<br />
<br />
So immediately after the upgrade do I create runtime dd first before the data upgrade or run the data upgrade straightaway?</div></div><hr />

In any case you need to create runtime first before you can initialize the Data Upgrade Engine.<br />
Check document U9497F for more information.</div></div><hr />
