<br />
Has anyone run this script after upgrading their porting set ?<br />
<br />
It creates a new oracle_home directory structure under $BSE/lib/ora.<br />
<br />
This caused problems initially, not allowing us to connect to the database, which we have managed to get round in two different ways :<br />
<br />
Initially, we simply deleted the $BSE/lib/ora/oracle_home directory structure. This     allowed us to connect to the database but produced error messages in the $BSE/log/Oracle8.log.<br />
<br />
After investigation we found that copying the tnsnames.ora and sqlnet.ora from our existing ORACLE_HOME directory structure into the newly created $BSE/lib/ora/oracle_home directory structure, seemed to resolve the problem.<br />
<br />
We haven't had much joy from Baan on this one and I was wondering if anyone has any more information as to why this new directory structures is needed and what other configuration issues there may be.]<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Be very carefull to not run scripts that are not supposed to be run - the script mentions a $BSE/bin/ora_client_files that do not exit. I think that this may be a reminescent script from very old portingsets...<br />
<br />
Now regarding the files under $BSE/lib/oracle_home, they are used by the sql*net driver (oci).</div></div><hr />

Thanks for that. The reason that we actually ran the script was due to original error message ( which mentions running ora_update ) written to the log. As follows :<br />

For the last 2 upgrades to Oracle8(i) I did myself, I manually created the $BSE/lib/ora/oracle_home files. If you have plenty of diskspace in that file system you might consider installing/copying the full set of Oracle client binaries. That way you can run SQL*Plus etc from your Baan node (if you are running in multi-tier).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin</div><div class="date">7th June 2002, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
the ora_update script create all files and subdirectories under $BSE/lib/ora/<br />
After running the script you have to copy the tnsnames.ora to $BSE/lib/ora/oracle_home/network/admin.<br />
This must be done, because in the db_resource is an entry oracle_client_home, which points to the $BSE/lib/ora/oracle/home<br />
directory. So if you are working witch sql-net connections (setting TWO_TASK variable) BaaN search in this directory for the tnsnames.ora file.<br />
<br />
Please note, if you update the Portingset to Version 6.1c0604 (Baan IV c) or 7.1c03 (BaaN ERP) on some OS this script must run  again (eg. TRU64).<br />

<br />
It is unclear as to why this new directory structure is created/required ( Apart from stopping the error messages ! ). <br />
<br />
We already have the oracle client binaries on the server. My concern is that Baan may want to implement changes to the sql-net configuration via this new directory structure ( maybe someone can let me know if this is a resonable concern because I am not an Oracle DBA ). This would be a significant change to the way we currently manage our infrastructure. Usually the sql-net configuration is purely the responsibility of the Oracle DBAs and not Baan Admin.<br />
<br />
If there is no reason to use the new $BSE/lib/ora/oracle_home then we can simply alter the oracle_client_home in the db_resource to our existing sql-net software. This seems to work OK.<br />
<br />
Any more information on this would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
