<br />
our old Baan IV server is giving some issues and we want to transfer it completely to new server.<br />
<br />
Our service pack is 13 so a single setup is there.<br />
<br />
When we try to install new server, it install properly and a 30 days licence is actievated by Baan. But, when we restore application and old database, it gives error as &quot;there are no more licence&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help how to do this ? once old application and database is restored, we will ask baan for licence keys.<br />

<br />
How did you move it? Did you completely copied $BSE folder to new Server? If yes then it is a problem. You need to have some of the older files on the system. The problem might be that, your SLM is still pointing towards the older Server IP by reading the license6.1 file. So, it might need a change. Please follow the Documentation as it describes and it won't be an issue.<br />
<br />
In case you have moved everything, you will need to re license again. Again, I am not sure about your version, but its always a best deal to follow standard documentation.<br />

<br />
Yes, We completely copied the bse folder. Also, it's licensing is not based on SLM as it is on a service pack 13. There is a licmon service.<br />

<br />
you should use session &quot;patch objects after system crash&quot; (ttiex3228m000).<br />
After that you can log into Baan again and generate the security key for the new license. Put the sessioncode in the command line of your bw.<br />
