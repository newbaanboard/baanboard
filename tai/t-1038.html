<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really have a problem but I'm trying to understand some logic behind logical tables.<br />
<br />
I had an existing Logical table set up as follows:<br />
<br />
Logical Company 502 <br />
Specified Table  tcmcs034 Price Lists -&gt; Physical company 503<br />
<br />
I then introduced another Logical table setting:<br />
<br />
Logical Company 503<br />
Specified Table  tcmcs034 Price Lists -&gt; Physical company 501<br />
<br />
I tested the setting by adding a record to the tcmcs034 table via Maintain Price Lists in company 501. I then went into company 503 expecting to see the change. The new price list record could not be seen. The same happened if I added a record from 503, it did not show in 501. If I did the same operation in 502/503 the logical link was in place and you could see any new records added across both companies.<br />
<br />
To resolve this issue in 501/503 I removed the record:- logical company 502 -&gt;tcmcs034-&gt;Physical Company 503. Why should this make any difference?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Could somebody explain the logic as to why a logical table will not work if you have another logical relation in place with the same table?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We are having 4 Baan companies in production 001, 002, 003 and 004. 001 is treated as physical company and 002,003 and 004 are treated as logical companies for maintaining Baan master data tables. Whenever we maintain data in any logical company we can able to see data across all companies. We never used to enter data from physical company as we are not having access to it. So I am not sure whether we can access data across all logical companies if entered from Physical company. Have you got any logic from the above? I think a company cannot be logical and physical at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think your problem is that you are defining the same table from the one company as both logical and physical at the same time. I don't think Baan can handle this. Regarding inserts, it should not make a difference whether you do it from the logical or physical company as they both will perform the action on the one database table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Patrick.<br />
<br />
Company 502 uses Ttcmcs034503.<br />
<br />
Then you tell company 503 to use Ttcmcs034501.<br />
<br />
503 is already, by default using tcmcs034503.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can tell baan to use a logical table rather than its real physical one - Can you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
the answer to all this is simple:<br />
<br />
Baan does not support double indirection in logigal tables.<br />
<br />
A logical table must always be linked to a physical one. You can not link a logical table to another logical tables, nor is this ever needed.<br />
<br />
Example: <br />
Let's say you have three companies 100, 200 and 300.<br />
<br />
100 is supposed to be logical to 200 and 200 is supposed to be logical to 300. 300 is the physical company. Baan does not support this directly! But you might as well make 100 logical to 300 and 200 logical to 300. The result is exactly the same and works in baan!<br />
<br />

I knew that there must have been a good reason but just couldn't put my finger on it.<br />
