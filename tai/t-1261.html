<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm creating a new Baan company that can be used by Finance as a consolidation company for making adjustments. To keep the company size to a mimimum I only want to create tables that will be required by Finance. All they will be doing is to entering journal adjustments.<br />
<br />
I have created my company with the following table groups:-<br />
<br />
tc  common<br />
tf   finance<br />
tg  organiser<br />
tu  utilities<br />
<br />
When I try to run the Initialise Parameters (tcmcs0295m000) session I get an Error 506 - Table not exist.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
1. What table is tcmcs0295m000 looking for?<br />
<br />
2. Should I create ALL tables, regardless if they will be used or not?<br />
<br />

<br />
- All 000 tables form all modules in BaaN<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
tcapi136, tcmcs039, tcmcs042, tcmcs047, tcmcs095, tdrpl002, tccom999, tdsmi060, timps100,... and maybe others.<br />
<br />
I suggest you create all tt tables too (jobs and texts). But, when you run any other session, which will be those necesary?.<br />
<br />
The work you want to do depends on the sessions you will work with, and is a very complex work.<br />
<br />
I think that you can try a little; at last it will be easier and cheaper (time is money) to create all tables. My opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would go for creating all tables BUT before that, adjust the parameters on &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage so that all the other tables would be created with very small initial extents. Create entries for 'T' and 'I' for the tables of tc, tf, tg, tt and tu and then create the final entries for * (for all the remaining) with a very smaller initial size.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The session Initialize Parameters (unfortunately) requires the ppmmm000 tables to be all present (pp=Package, mmm=Module and 000 is the literal zero-zero-zero). In addition, there is the table tccom999 which is required. (Ah, yes, the tfgld001, tfgld002, tfgld003 and tfgld004 too). There are maybe a couple more that I may have missed, but are easy to determine by browsing the Display Tables session (they will mostly have the word Parameter in them). <br />
<br />
In all there are about 80 such tables. (I have never tried this, but the Unix 'strings' command on the object code of the Initialize Parameters session will probably yield the entire list of tables for your installation.)<br />
<br />
These tables need to be created for Initialize Parameters to succeed.<br />
<br />
This however does not guarantee that further sessions will function successfully. BAAN Finance has its fingers into all the modules, so it will be a 'discovering' venture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">6th March 2002, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
we run BaanIVc3mcr here.  Our set up is a single logistic / multi finance environment.  Basically we have 1 Parent company (200) and about 16 'sub' companies ( 201-2xx).  All sales, inventory, distribution, invoicing/AR is maintained in the Parent company.  The subs exist for finance expense/AP data only. Our solution to table size is to create logical tables in the subs that point to the Parent company.   There are a bare minimum of tables that contain true company specific data.  Namely Finance tables.  This dramaticly cuts down on the space issues when creating a new company.  I have attached a sample print out of the logical table set up as we do it here.  NOTICE that there are a few Specified Financial tables!!!  This is due to the fact that the Chart of Accounts is the same across all companies, and the fiscal, reporting periods are also the same.  If this is not the case with you, you will need to create these tables for your new company as well.  If you create the logical tables in your new company First, log out and back in ( important!):D  then, run the create tables session you should be good to go.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

I gave you a bad file example!  I ran the report in dev. and well.....  dev just isn't quite what one would wish for.  here is a good example with finance tables.  <br />
