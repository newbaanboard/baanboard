The script is being change by one user in february 08. By any chance i can get the original script back before feb08. We are taking weekly backup in tape which is overwritten every week. But we are also taking complerte system backup monthly and fortunately i have a copy of January 08 backup.<br />
In which directory the Programm script would be stored? And how do i can restore the same?<br />

If its either Forms or Reports, then you could find it under <br />
BSE/Application/Cust VRC/r&lt;package&gt; for reports<br />
BSE/Application/Cust VRC/f&lt;package&gt; for forms.<br />
<br />
The scripts could be found inside these folders with the respective name of the object they belong to. <br />
<br />
Is this what you were looking for? <br />

if it's a program script it should be located in the folder starting with a 'p', like <br />
BSE/Application/Cust VRC/p&lt;packagemodule&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">30th June 2008, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">You didnt mention about the object you customized. Was it a form, report or was it a new function?<br />
<br />
Secondly, you said you didnt find the script under the folders i mentioned. Was it missing from the backed-up bse folder or did you mean its missing in the current bse folder? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">30th June 2008, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">As mentioned, program scripts are stored in the $BSE/application directory.<br />
<br />
scripts in the directory p&lt;package&gt;&lt;module&gt;<br />
<br />
everytime a script is modified the previous is stored with the same name followed by a minus sign, f.i. pinv1020 ( current script ), pinv1020- ( previous version ).</div></div><hr />
