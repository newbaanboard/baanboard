I recently setup ODM on fp6 windows 2003 server, did all the steps as mentioned in the document. The Vault and work area is on the server itself.<br />
<br />
 I was able to attach a document to the session from server(saves correctly to the Vault area) but facing an issue when reopening the same via button launch main files. It gives the error &quot;system cannot find the path specified&quot;.<br />
<br />
Did anyone face this error or any clues please. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Jay</div></div><hr />

Did you opened the attached document from the server itself or from client machine?</div></div><hr />
