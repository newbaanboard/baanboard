We have migrated to a new hardware. The porting set is 6.1c.10 and Baan IV c4 SP is 23. We are unable to compile the scripts. Talked to infor, acc to them we have to install the SLM.<br />
<br />
Problem is that our test server(SP 23, porting set 6.1c.07) is sharing the licenses(licensing was done using conventional method of Baan IV c4).<br />
<br />
My question - How can we share the licenses in SLM licensing?<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
the slm server can be used by several slm clients similair with the old mechanism.<br />
<br />

Thanks for the info<br />
Do you mean - i have to devalidate both my servers(Test and Live) and install SLM server and install client on the Test server....<br />
<br />
What are the complete steps?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">23rd September 2010, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, we want to 'migrate' from the old baan license daemon to the new SLM licensing since we want to leverage our licenses from 2 datacenters around the globe. <br />
Therefore we would like to install an SLM cluster with 2 nodes.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have experience with a setup like this?<br />
Is this stable and reliable enough? <br />
Current license daemon is stable, but we want to take advantage of the different time zones so that we can connect with more users in one location when the other location is at night.<br />
<br />
All feedback is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomasm</div><div class="date">24th September 2010, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Some time ago we migrated from daemon to SLM since the old package was not stable enough.<br />
<br />
We have one SLM server in China, one in Europe (Sweden) and one in the US (NC). We have this distribution to be able to give service 'locally/regionally' in case of WAN cuts. If one server loose connection with the server network it will keep on running in 72 hours. After that there are also oportunities to keep it running.<br />
<br />
We find SLM stable and efficient. We had some issues in the beginning related to that the Baan IV packages where not mature enough, but this is now gone. Running on those 3 servers are then 20 different application servers, live as well as test.<br />
<br />
The only thing is that the machine that runs the server cannot be virtual, but on the other hand it does not need to be a Baan server, it can be just any physical machine.<br />
<br />
We had good support from Infor support in Holland (since that is our main support centre) but I'd be happy to support you. Send me pm with the details.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

We want to install BaanIV license on a new physical system and point our baanIV vm system to the physical system for its license.<br />
Do you have a procedure please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">13th February 2014, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">if you download the SLM software, the documentation is included.<br />
Also with the latest releases you can install the SLM software on a virtual server as well, no need for a physical machine anymore.<br />
We are still running this on a physical server, but we will migrate to a virtual environment in the coming months.</div></div><hr />

I assume you have already enabled SLM for your baan 4 server</div></div><hr />
