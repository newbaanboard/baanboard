Baan support recommended upgrading our porting set to a newer version.  This was not appealing to us but, may be a solution for you.  Call Baan support and see what they recommend.  <br />

The solution text mentions the post solutions to be installed, you should check it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">24th January 2003, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">there are 3 new tables: ttaad322, ttaad508 and ttaad331<br />
note that ttaad508 should be created for all companies and the other 2 for comp 000<br />
Once the tables are created you should be fine for the printing issue.<br />
<br />
!! Pay also attention that PMC data could be unreliable if this solution is installed. Point 6 of the detailed description explains what you need to do to fix this. (it worked for me but i also had to install solutions 113728 and 113824 since they were prerequisite for 110334)</div></div><hr />
