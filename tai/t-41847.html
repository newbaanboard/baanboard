<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">18th September 2007, 14:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We're moving some components from one baan-machine to another via the export/import data dictionary function. For some reason it's impossible to import various components and we get the following error message:<br />
<br />
Error -13 during seq.open file &quot;${BSE}/cp/installed.path&quot;<br />
<br />
We found that there was no file called installed.path created durung the export dd procedure. We've tried several parameter combinations but none of this combinations helped. What causes this error exactly (or why no installed.path file has been created)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any comments/recommendations.<br />

(P.S.: I've searched the forum but the messages I've found unfortunately didn't help.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this problem is because of File Permission on the dump that you are importing...as I can see you are on Solaris, so give all required permission on the dump files and folders...then it should work...<br />

<br />
All the best...<br />

I've run into this, and it's been because the user did not have permissions to create the installed.path file in the directory being imported from.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">19th September 2007, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Both of you were right. My fault was that I configured the ftp-access with root-rights so only root was allowed to write/change the exported files (trying to import the files using another login/rights of course failed). Maybe if there would be an error message like &quot;cannot write...&quot; or similar one could understand it easier...</div></div><hr />

I didn't mean to refer to you as Dick.  I had seen a post from Dikkie Dick immediately before I replied to this, and I think that's why I put it.<br />

<br />
Actually when I saw the name Dick there, I got confused and thought to clarify but soon I realized that it might be a mistake...anyways thanks:) <br />
<br />
Have a nice day ahead.<br />
