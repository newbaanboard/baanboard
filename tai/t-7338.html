and After full Create runtime data dictionary (Forms and Menus)<br />
in table ttadv500 I found a lots of things which shouldn't be there:<br />
<br />
Forms like <br />
tdinv8417m0001h<br />
...<br />
Menus like<br />
tffas2012m0011h<br />
...<br />
Something which has indt field (suppose indicator field) DR<br />
(suppose these are reports) like<br />
tihra140811002h<br />
<br />
and most of them I couldn't find in Maintain Reports / Forms / Menues.<br />
<br />
I tried to convert them namely to runtime data dictionary - wont help<br />
I tried to namely create  RDD - wont help<br />
<br />
Some forms I created by listed name, dumped, and deleted and i helped for them,<br />
but it doesn't help with reports (if DR are reports)<br />
<br />
My consultant told me to do backup of table adv500 (seq. dump) and after that to delete all the fields.<br />
<br />
But, what was that records, and is it a bug of CRDD session?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Later on they were deleted leaving the conversion to runtime flags on.<br />
I don't think Baan checks in the conversion tables when a deletion happens of a menu, form, etc.<br />
If you already know that those components do not exist and they still exist after a conversion to runitme has been made full, then you can safely delete them from the conversion table.</div></div><hr />
