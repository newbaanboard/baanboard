<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alick Wilson</div><div class="date">8th June 2004, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a table that has been deleted from BaaN, so there is no corresponding unix file.  Yet when we reconfigure, it fails because there is &quot;No definition in definition file for sopen(...)&quot;.  Where is it getting the information that this none existent table needs reconfiguring?<br />
<br />
The system has been moved from 1 server and the path for the table was changed after BaaN was started.  Would this be something to do with the old path being retained in shared memory?  How do I check?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">8th June 2004, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Check and see which table definition it might be trying to use.<br />
<br />
If you are in a UNIX environment, log into Baan as the user who is getting the error and then from the Menu Browser click File and then Run.  Once Run Program (ttdsk2080m000) opens up, type in ksh as the Program/Session, check the box labeled Run External Program and click OK.<br />
<br />
Once the terminal emulator opens up (do not close this window), type explode6.1 d&lt;package&gt;&lt;module&gt;&lt;table&gt;.  This will show at the operating system level which table definition is being used.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
explode6.1 dtfgld410<br />
/usr2/baan4/dict/ddOPER_001/dtfgld/dtfgld410</div></div><hr />

<br />
$ explode6.1 dtisfc973<br />
explode6.1:<br />
No definition in definition file for explode6.1(F_BRDD:dtisfc973, dtisfc973)<br />
First exploded '/baanivc/softdevc/bse/dict/ddDEVT_008/dtisfc/dtisfc973'<br />
errno 2<br />
Last  exploded 'dtisfc973' errno 2<br />
<br />

Hope I didn't made a stupid remark...<br />

<br />
You may be right, how do I check?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Go on UNIX level to the place where the DD's are stored and grep for the table in the files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Also check with general table maint. some tools tables called &quot;reconfig restart data&quot; and &quot;runtime indicators&quot;.<br />
<br />
you might have in there some indicator, that Baan still needs to reconfigure the ghost table!<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alick Wilson</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We resolved the problem by copying the BaaN table and manually creating the corresponding unix file.  The convert to runtime then completed OK.  Smiles all round until...<br />
<br />
The developer created a new table.  The corresponding unix file is not created.  When I (as bsp) create a different table, the unix file is created!  When I modify and convert to runtime the developers table, the unix file is not created.<br />
<br />
This user worked fine on the old Solaris system, only when we migrated to AIX has this problem occurred. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Sounds to me like a trivial unix authorization issue. Check your directories and sub directories to be owned by bsp, but to be writable also by the group!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alick Wilson</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Having been caught out by this so many times (and still not learning) I checked this when we first hit the problem.<br />
<br />
All the directories bar the top one are set to write enabled for the bsp and bsp group.  So of /baanivc/softdevc/bse/dict/ddDEVT_008/dtisfc, only /baanivc is owned by root, group system.<br />
<br />
But you're probably right, it will be something so simple.<br />

So when he created a test table, the unix permissions caused the job to fail and put some records in ttaad504.<br />
<br />
When the user had been corrected, the records still existed, hence the reconfigure.  New it was simple once you know how.<br />
