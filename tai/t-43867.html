We are running our TMBOAServers (Openworld) via user interface (10+ Users). These servers works restless to bring more than 4000 Sales orders per day. <br />
<br />
But the problem is in busy times (means cpu is 90%+), some of Openworld users are loosing &quot;shared memory thread&quot; in the AS/400 work active jobs (every user has --Bshelltax, api, sh_server6, qpozspwp) --&gt; Once that happend our open world user stop processing orders and ending up with loop due to lack of shared memory.<br />
<br />
Any one has any solution to prevent that? <br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we've found that our bshells (in unix) sometimes just sort of &quot;go away&quot;<br />
(they're still there ,but not functioning) in 6.1, we're told that it is fixed in 6.2<br />
