<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drezzzz</div><div class="date">6th January 2009, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
I have a repetitive error :<br />
Unknown reference from 'ttaad231.user' to 'ttaad200'<br />
when trying to list the sessions authorizations by user (ttaad2131m000) and some place else...<br />
<br />
The problem clears himself when rebooting the server but always comes back a little while after. I didn't identified the source yet, still trying.<br />
<br />
I tried looking for orphan entry in the ttaad231 table with ( select * from ttaad231 where ttaad231.user not in (select user from ttaad200) ) but without success.<br />
<br />
This brings me to two questions :<br />
- Does someone have an idea about how to correct/debug this specific problem ?<br />
- Is there a possibility to see a session's generated query ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help,<br />
I continue learning to some day, be able to help.<br />
Fred</div></div><hr />

There is some tracing, etc for MK but it's very limited. (and it's been about 3  years for me since i've touched the stuff....)<br />

I've seen that MK doesn't have a lot of logging, tracing or I don't understand how to level up the debug mode !?<br />
<br />
If you can point anything that could help it would be greatly appreciate since this bug makes me reboot the server at least once a week now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you might just want to log a case with infor..<br />
