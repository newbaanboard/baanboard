<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">31st May 2006, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I am working on a project involving devices and drivers.  I'm testing stuff and I have no test server, so I have made a copy of an existing device named &quot;LASER&quot; and the new device name is &quot;LASERLOGO&quot;.  Also, I have copied the driver &quot;hp_lj5&quot; to &quot;hp_lj5.lg&quot;.  I have made no changes the the driver, hp_lj5.lg and the parameters on both devices are the same with the exception of the driver.<br />
<br />
In testing this change, I print a report to device &quot;LASER&quot; and output goes to the printer.  When I print same report to device &quot;LASERLOGO&quot;, I get a message &quot;No Data within selection&quot;.<br />
<br />
To narrow this problem down, I modify the driver on device &quot;LASERLOGO&quot; back to &quot;hp_lj5&quot;.  When I print same report to device &quot;LASERLOGO&quot;, output goes to the printer.<br />
<br />
Something must be wrong with the driver.<br />
<br />
I have checked the permissions and ownership.  What else should I check?<br />

Thanks in advance for your assistance.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
have you copied the driver in $BSE/lib/printinf/h/hp_lj5 ?<br />
Copy the driver to hp_lj5_lg, maybe it's the point.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
If, the world is infact insane and the driver is causing the problem - then it's got to be the driver name, or device name. try making the driver file name<br />
smaller (like hp_ll) or something.<br />
