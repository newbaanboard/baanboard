<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">7th February 2007, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I just finished a successful install of 4c4 and Oracle 10g (local install of oracle) on a Windows 2003 server.<br />
<br />
The problem I'm having is that if I try to log onto Baan locally on the server, I get a 514 error referencing ttadv002000.<br />
<br />
However, I can log onto Baan from any other PC on the network with no probelms.<br />
<br />
I only get the error when I try to logon to the server console.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried resetting permissions to the baan Directory Tree but that didn't help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">7th February 2007, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand the issue better now.  In fact I am now able to login to the local server.  The problem I was having was that the local account I created was called &quot;Baan&quot;.  I renamed the user from &quot;Baan&quot; to &quot;baan&quot; and I can now login.<br />
<br />
I still have an issue however, because if I try to logon to our existing Baan machine from the new machine, I get the same 514 error.  On the production machine, the login is being seen as &quot;ROY&quot;.  However, their is no &quot;ROY&quot; in the ora_users file.  It exist as &quot;roy&quot;.<br />
<br />
This may be a new issue related to Windows Server 2003 Release 2?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">8th February 2007, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that out yesterday.  After making the change I could get in on the new machine.  What really bothers me is that I cannot connect from the new machine to my existing production machine.<br />
<br />
As I sad above, I see an error in the event log of my production machine that the user &quot;ROY&quot; does not exist in the ora_users file when I try to log into the production machine from the new server.<br />
<br />
I can log on to Baan from any other PC using either Uppercase &quot;ROY&quot; or lower case &quot;roy&quot;.<br />
<br />
I believe that their was something changed in the way Windows Server 2003 Release 2 interacts with active directory that changes everything.<br />
<br />
As for now, as the user 'baan' is a local account on the server, (Not in our active directory) I can continue with the batch update of service packs today.<br />
<br />
I'm going to log a case with Baan Support.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">23rd February 2007, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We did a webex on this issue yesterday with tools support.<br />
<br />
We could get the logon to work on the system console if we used the command in the bw config as -- -set USER=XXX<br />
<br />
In short they logged a defect for this issue for Windows 2003 R2.<br />
