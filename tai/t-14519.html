We are facing a problem, in the same printer we will have two kind of papers: A4 in one tray &amp; A6 in the other tray (for labels).<br />
<br />
Normally, it is possible to select the default tray in the driver for a &quot;Direct&quot; printer, but someone knows how to perform the same in a &quot;Windows Printer&quot;?.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">You can set up 2 versions of the printer on the windows machine. 1 (named say &quot;LETTERS&quot; )with A4 tray as default, 1 with A6 tray as default (named say &quot;LABELS&quot;). They both point to the same device.<br />
<br />
In Baan, you can set up the 2 printers in Maintain device data and select the one you need at run time.<br />
<br />
It is also possible to do this programatically in the script but you would need to review the bwprint white paper to see the details of how to do that.<br />

<br />
In case, you are printing checks, you can define printer which can be accessed only by certain users (add printer through Windows). <br />
For example, a user can have 2 printers: checks and other. To be able printer direct to user local printer, name should be same (windows = baan device).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have not allowed normal users to access the Baan printer (because you have not added it to their Device Preference List using ttaad3106m000 ), only super users will be able to print to it.</div></div><hr />

I found other way, and it  really easy:<br />
<br />
-Print in the windows printer, with preview, i.e. W6.<br />
-Once the preview is there, right click of mouse<br />
-Choose &quot;Paper bin&quot; and &quot;Assign device specific bin0&quot;<br />
-It will appear all trays that the Local Printer have and just select the desired.<br />
<br />
This is store per Device in Baan in the Regedit of the Local Machine, so it is possible to create several devices in Baan and setup for each a different tray.<br />
<br />
The path of the regedit is:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Baan\BwPrint\Bins\W6<br />

<br />
We are on Baan IVc4 SP12, and this functionality does not seem to work where I can define the baan device name to match my windows printer name.<br />
<br />
I have gotten this functionality to work in Baan Vc, and was able to successfully print to a non-default windows printer by having both the baan printer name and the windows printer name matching.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know if a minimum version of bwprint is required for this functionality to work?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">6th November 2013, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">We are migrating to windows.  We have printers with multiple trays.  For example in shipping, we have designated paper for portrait invoice in one tray and landscape packing list in another tray.<br />
<br />
In unix, these are seperate devices but Windows is different.<br />
<br />
Will someone send me an image of baan device configurations that pulls from seperate trays.<br />
