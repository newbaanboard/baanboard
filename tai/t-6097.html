<br />
The table ttadv002 is the table for the BaaN Tools Parameters, <br />
which has the current BaaN Tools installation's VRC, an encrypted <br />
password and a date (I guess an expiration date). You can view the <br />
contents from the DBA studio etc but you cannot break the codes there.<br />
<br />
This table is created during the installation process. <br />
<br />
If this table is not created/loaded you cannot start BaaN, <br />
as most of the standard sessions as well as the standard program have<br />
the checks built-in from -<br />

<br />
Since the table is no longer there, I wanted to create it through bdbpost and I gave this command<br />
<br />
bdbpost -m -n -IE:\comp000.pre -c000<br />
<br />
But it is not working. What should I do?<br />
How can I create baan tables using comp000.pre and bdbpost in NT.<br />

1) Would you know if this table is used for what purpose (bcos everytime during logging-in this seems the first table that is read in baan. It always reflects as an error in this table on a license error or a permission error etc..)<br />
<br />
2) It has a password field namely &quot;pswd&quot;.<br />
<br />
whenever there is a problem with this table (license not patched or something) baan never logs-in to carry-out possible repair work from with-in baan like Patch objects after system crash etc..<br />
<br />
appreciate your input, tks<br />

 <br />
Task Undertaken: <br />
I copied the BSE from a live server to a standby server(Which had baan and sql installed to the same spec and sps as the live server) that wasnt connected to the network. Changed the name as well as the IP of the standby server to the same as the live one. As a final step, i restored the SQL backup of the live on the standby. All this was done while the baan services were down on the standby. <br />
Problem:<br />
After the sql restore, i fired up the services and pressed the all important [Connect] button to log into baan and i get &quot;Record doesnt exist in ttadv002000..&quot; error.<br />
 <br />
I know this much that i might have got a message that my baan is not licensed and it will work for few days...once i fired up baan but record doesnt exist wasnt in my &quot;to expect&quot; list..<br />
 <br />
So could anyone tell me why would i get this message and the all important function of table ttadv002? <br />
