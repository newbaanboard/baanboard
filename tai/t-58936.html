<br />
I have been trying to install LN6.1 FP5 server onto Windows Machine with DB2DATABASE. I followed all pre-installation task and started installation.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Just after few mins of installation, in the stage of Installing BWC files, Installation aborts with Fatal Error. (please find screen shot in attachment with Event viewer error.)<br />
<br />
I traced down to the Bwc file in c:\windows\temp\~\import_bw\lib\user folder and found that its trying to logging into server with SSPl Login protocol. I changed the protocol to Rexec protocol and clicked OK of that BWC file. all of sudden tools installation started but in seprate window (unuseful, as main installation is still in pending stage).<br />
<br />
I need your help to finish this installation.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
Shiv</div></div><hr />

<br />
is this a W2K8 R2 server ? If yes, please make sure that your portingset is the recent one. <br />
I had this sspilogin error with an portingset that did not yet support R2.<br />

<br />
please suggest is there any way that we can configure/install SSPI protocol seprately.<br />
<br />

If I am correct you can't use db2 on windows. On linux it is supported. (I have it running on opensuse/db2 although this free linux os version is not supported as is express-c either but it's just a test machine for me.)<br />
<br />
On xp it will for sure not work. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shiv_softengg</div><div class="date">4th August 2010, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes . DB2 is supproted on windows platform. <br />
<br />
But its not a bad idea to install this server onto Linux platform since i also need it for testing.<br />
<br />
But still i am waiting for some opinion on the current problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lebowski</div><div class="date">5th August 2010, 09:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I can only tell you the workaround for the R2 problem, maybe that helps in your case , too:<br />
1) Install a GUI (bw) on the machine (thats important)<br />
2) Start the installation until it runs on the error<br />
3) Dont close the error window<br />
4) Find the temporary bw from the installer (in my case it was somewhere under c:\users\...\appdata\...)<br />
5) Configure the temporary bw from sspi to rexec.<br />
6) Choose &quot;Run&quot; <br />
7) Then the installation continues<br />
<br />
The error comes back at later stages (4-5 times), then you have to repeat steps 2-6.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. Good luck.<br />

Hi Han,<br />
<br />
I have tried with Red hat linux with right version of Informix. As soon as the installation starts i receives rexec error. when i check from command line &quot;rexec host -l bsp &lt;command&gt;&quot; , it asks password and then run the command ...<br />
<br />
would you be able to assist me on this?<br />

<br />
now it goes beyond the rexec stage since i choose root user to install. But it throws error while initializing the Database space??? <br />
<br />
i have created a data base name BAAN with all required db spaces?? what went wrong ??<br />
<br />
what data do you provide when installation asks you to tell path and size of database , index etc....<br />
<br />
I give dbspace name and size (little less than actual to avoid any conflict) ??<br />
may you guide me here??<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">6th August 2010, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I have limited knowledge of Informix. What does your log tell you? Normally that gives you enough hints what went wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shiv_softengg</div><div class="date">9th August 2010, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I found what went wrong.. But yes, LN installation logs are not sufficient to tell the exact error.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Error was the BaanDB group user name ,database rights and database name.<br />
<br />
you have to make sure that your database name must match with your db group name.<br />
secondly, your user of db group and installation user must have dba rights to that database server.<br />
