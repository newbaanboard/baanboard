<br />
In our organisation we plan to terminate the support agreement with BaaN but are not sure if BaaN will revalidate our servers in future in case of any changes or crash etc.<br />
<br />
Any comments will be welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhatia_rk</div><div class="date">19th December 2003, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We have the software agreement (i.e. we have paid for the licenses). What we want to discontinue is the annual software support agreement (this provides us with access to BaaN support site, fixes to bugs and new releases).<br />
<br />
It is my understanding that this support is optional. I also understand that there are quite a few BaaN customers who do not have this support agreement with BaaN.<br />

Are you sure evrth. OK with your licence agreement ? If it is so you can be calm in case of revalidation and so on. But i think it's very recommended to examine this documnet thoroughly - it is very important.<br />
Technical support of course is optrional but how you imagine future life without patches, service packs etc.?<br />
By the way - what time of day you have now? <br />
Ours - noon :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for delayed response. Actually Friday and saturdays are weekly offs here (Cairo, Egypt). Egypt is +2.00 Hrs from GMT.<br />
<br />
The reason for stopping support is organisation's decision to change over to a different ERP package.<br />
<br />
I went through the software licensing agreement (as suggested by you). Unfortunately there is no clause about server validation in that.<br />
<br />
Does that mean that all BaaN customers necessarily have Software Support agreement? My thoughts were that there should be quite a few customers who do not have such agreement. (Seems I was wrong).<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure this suggestion will be suitable to you or not, depends on your no. of licences.<br />
I am sure, BaaN support calculates support amount = no. of licences * specific amount per year.<br />
If I am not mistaken, customer can purchase min. 4 licences, so buy 4 seperate licences telling them it is for dev. server / separate plant. After that you can discontinue regular support, if you need some support/patch, there is no need to tell them it is required for regular users because as suggested by Old Vens, you cannot imagine future life without support.<br />
Ask this to your BaaN support whether it is possible or not and update me also as we have 62 + 12 licences and paying big figure. Just curious, How many licences you have?<br />

<br />
BaaN will not provide support for a subset of licenses that the company has. It is always calculated on the total number of licenses that the company has.<br />
<br />
We have 115 licenses.<br />

<br />
I get this information from SSA. Please read it below .<br />
<br />
            When a customer who is not on support and met with this misfortune of system crash and need a validation key to reactivate their system - a 14  day key will be issued to tie them over, however, within 14 days, they will  need to renew support from the date of expiry (when they last stop) and a forward period of at least 12 months from date of renewal.  Example:  If<br />
they last renewed Jan 1, 2000 for 1 year, which expired Dec 31, 2000.  They will need to renew from Jan 1, 2001 to Mar 10, 2005.  This is cover the back support from Jan 1,  2001 to Mar 11, 2004 and the 12 months forward requirement from Mar 11, 2004 to Mar 10, 2005.  Furthermore, they will renew at list price (no discounts).<br />
<br />
           The 14 day key under such circumstances will not be extended at all.  The 14 days is to give them time to get the paperwork organized to renew support. No support agreement, no key.  Once, they sign the renewal, a 30 day key will be issue until we get full payment due to us.  Once payment is received, they will get a perm key accordingly.<br />
<br />

<br />
My suggestion: Read your contracts VERY carefully and try to get all and everything from SSA in writing. <br />
