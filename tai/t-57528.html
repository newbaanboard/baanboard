<br />
We are trying to migrate our LN FP2 from Production server to Test server. For the same, we have installed LN on test server. Now when we try to load Tools company backup (000) on test server from production server, loading stops saying &quot;Error in running bdbpost&quot;. In error file, we get error 522.<br />
After this process, we are unable to run any tools session in test server.<br />
<br />
We had tried this technique in Baan IV, where it worked fine. Can anyone explain what should be done in this case.<br />
<br />

I don't understand why you want to reload all the data. A better way to 'copy' your environment is to clone your database and copy the BSE environment. How to 'clone' your BSE environment is described in the document 'How to move an Infor ERP environment to another host' which is available via infor365.<br />
By using this procedure you can be 100% sure that you have the same environment (think e.g. about your own customisations and the standard Infor solutions).<br />
