Baan support did helped me through webex. You can type &quot;brand6.2 -h&quot; to get the all options. If you type the commad &quot;brand6.2 info&quot; then it ask you to enter Customer info, after that version etc..one after one..<br />

When I ran the brand6.1 command interactively, it did recreate the brand file. I started the license but when I tried to start Baan, I get the 515 error and now I can't start Baan at all. I am dead in the water right now!<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

<br />
unpatched binary is usually refering to your driver.. did you change Database's recently? did you remember to license the driver you're using?<br />
<br />
(make sure it shows up on the RSC that you sent Baan) And make sure it shows up as runnable in the report they sent back to you.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pcraven</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We changed the database but are now back to the same database that we started with. We did not print the RSC for Baan to relicense. This started when we tried to emulate our production box on our test box. The &quot;experiment&quot; was not a success so we tried to put our test box back to it's original state. This included the original db as well (our prod is 9.1 and our test is 8.7).This is when the brand file was corrupted so I tried to recreate it with the brand6.1 command. How can I correct the 515 error if I can't get into Baan?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">As per as I know you definetly need to re-validate your Baan after your experiment. Baan support is best bet to solve your issue..<br />
