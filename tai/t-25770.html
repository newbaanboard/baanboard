<br />
Does anyone ever install 2 Baan environment in 1 server / 1 O.S? Is that possible? <br />
We have some problems in Baan ERP5.0c and trying to install new Baan Environment in the same server/O.S. <br />
<br />
Pls advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />
Handy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nandan</div><div class="date">30th November 2005, 11:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Possible...<br />
Infact it is possible to install more than 2 Baan environment.<br />
<br />
Please provide more details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Handy Bunawan</div><div class="date">30th November 2005, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your quick response. <br />

Actually, we have tried to installed new Baan environment in our live server. FYI, we are using Windows Advance 2000. <br />
The new Baan Environment doesn't work. WHen we tried to login, a message (in blue screen) appeared : &quot;You have no license anymore to start the Bshell&quot;, and then a few seconds, another message (in dialog box) appeared &quot;You can still run Baan in -1846 days&quot;. When I clicked OK button, the session ended. <br />
<br />
Do you have any further advice? <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Handy</div></div><hr />

Either get a license key from Baan, or validate that the license monitor is set and running correctly...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Furthermore you probably have to remove the BSE_REM entry in the registry if you have installed it new.<br />
<br />
Right now I have 4 environments working on a W2003 server. Basicly it works but I sometimes have problems with shared memory (chain-of-instances incorrect messages in eventlog).<br />

We plan to ask for free validation key (to do trial in a couple weeks). If the new environment goes well, we will conduct data migration from live company (old Baan environment) to the  new Baan environment.<br />
<br />
My question is, are there any problems we will faced when we register a new validation key (for new Baan Environment) in the same server/O.S while current validation key exists ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nandan</div><div class="date">30th November 2005, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">No need to validate the second environment. Just copy the tables ttiex300 and ttiex301 (tools company) from the working environment to the test environment.  Run the configure applications. (works if both Baan environments are of same version)<br />
<br />
I have never seen two license daemons of the same baan version working on the same machine. Mostly there will be a problem as the both licenses daemons will compete for the same port number. If the environments are of different version, there is no problem to run multiple license daemons.<br />
<br />
For the license problem you are facing, try to stop the license daemon of the working environment. See if you can login to Baan in demo version. If you are able to login then, copying of ttiex300 and ttiex301 should work. If you are still not able to login in demo period. Try to login to Baan using BW configuration, with command set to &quot;ottiexpatch&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We can now login to test environment in demo period. We plan to use the test environment for more than 30 days. Is that possible (by copying the tables ttiex301 and ttiex302 (tools company) from the working environment to the test environment) ?<br />
<br />
To : Han Brinkman<br />
The 4 environments working on 1 server/O.S., are 3 of them working on demo period?<br />

Thank you very much,<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, we can not copy the tables (ttiex300 and ttiex301) because we can not start any tools (tt) session.  FYI, the validation tools set is inactive.<br />
<br />
Need your advice. Thanks a lot,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nandan</div><div class="date">1st December 2005, 11:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Follow this sequence.<br />
<br />
1. Start License daemon of Validated Baan.<br />
2. Login to validated baan system. Use ttaad4100, navigate to ttiex300 use export functionality to export the table to a directory. do the same for ttiex301<br />
3. logoff, stop License daemon<br />
4. Login to test environment. You are logged on to demo version now. In demo version you will have access to all the sessions without any restrictions<br />
5. Using ttaad4100, import the tables earlier exported.<br />
6. Without logging off from baan, start the license daemon of validated system<br />
7. Run configure application</div></div><hr />

We have to choose a right time to stop the license daemon of validated Baan since it is used by our users for 24 hours.<br />

Thank you very much.<br />

<br />
We have tried step no. 1,3,4,6,7 9 (without step 2 and 5) in our live server. Now users can not login into the validated Baan. The error message is The error messaged shown &quot;Error : bdb_errrno 506 on ttadv999&quot; and Fatal Error : Error 506 (table does not exist) on select<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea? We are in an urgent situation since it is a live environment.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
