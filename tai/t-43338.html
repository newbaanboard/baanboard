In Worktop navigation area some menu items are not opening. i.e It shows the menu item folder but when we open it nothing is there. Hence we cannot open some critical sessions. <br />
<br />
This is frequently happening in Financials -&gt; Account Receivable -&gt; Open Entries folder. Both Maintenance &amp; Reports folders doesn't show any sessions inside. And General Data -&gt; Business Partners folder also doesn't show any sessions. (Please see the attachment)</div></div><hr />

<br />
for some users were are facing currently the same behavior of the webtop.<br />
<br />
It seems that for some reasons the locally on the client pc saved xml-files<br />
(to be found in the path were the webtop is installed like c:\Programm Files\Baan\Webtop\cache\ip...) are empty for those menus which are not available anymore. <br />
<br />
We copied the same file from a user which still had the menu available and everything worked well again.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we do not have an idea where this behavior is coming from. It seems that those information are also stored on the server itself because when I started the worktop with the login of the user having the problem the same damaged xml-files where copied on my client.<br />
<br />
Also solution from thread &quot;Modifying menus&quot; is not working in our case. The refresh is not recreating the menues.<br />
<br />
Any idea where to search on the server for the lost entries?<br />
<br />
cheers,<br />
