<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms2002</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 07:53</div></div><div class="posttext">i was doing &quot;change package combination&quot; from a PC client. There was a network problem while the process was still on. even after the network breakdown, i saw at the log.reconfig and it is still changing. After the current table is done  Will this continue till last or will I have to do the &quot;Change package combination&quot; again? <br />
<br />
if it breaks in between can i use command line bdbreconfig ? what would be the syntax? also, does anybody has any idea if the reconfig is the last step in the &quot;change package combination&quot; or is it something else also?<br />
<br />
it has been running for quite sometime so i dont want to restart the process.<br />
<br />
Also to bypass n/w problems, can i execute the &quot;Change Package Combination&quot; from Ux box after starting baan via ba6.1 (the classical old baan screens!!) instead of GUI interface?<br />
<br />
Can anybody through some light please?  its a baanc4/Unix/Informix scenario.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure you can use ba6.1 from the unix console.<br />
<br />
I'm not sur 100% about this but the session change package combination by company use bdbreconfig6.1.<br />
you can see usage with the command bdbreconfig6.1 -U<br />
<br />
Now what he is doing internally in this session I don't know <br />
but to use bdbdreconfig6.1 you must have a dictionnary that contains the old  and the new definition <br />
Ex : dtccom001 and dtccom001.new<br />
the bdbreconfig use these to find if there are any difference and if yes do the reconfig.<br />
<br />
So I suppose tha the session  do the following<br />
a) copy new definitions in the current dictionnary with the name = d&lt;table&gt;.new<br />
b) run bdbreconfig with a command  like this :<br />
bdbreconfig -p &lt;package&gt; -t &lt;table&gt; -e &lt;errorfile&gt;  -m -n -C &lt;company number&gt; <br />
c) when all files processed remove the .new file and change company package combination<br />
d) repair reference counter is then needed.<br />
<br />
Look in the log files ($BSE/log) for a file  log.bdbreconfig to see how far the reconfiguration has gone. If it is not done to the end you can try  to end it manually via bdbreconfig6.1 but this can need many time. I suggest that you restore the tables and restart the session .<br />
If needed clean the dictionnary for the *.new files    <br />
<br />
