This person is a normal user and doesn't have authorizations for all device.<br />
<br />
I removed the defaults for the users for tfcmg5203m000 and also ttstpsplopen device.  I also checked the 2 tools tables I could think of.  This is not a customized session or report.<br />
<br />
What could cause this weird problem.  With my userid it works just fine.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

These define default devices for various payment documents and cheques.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wmickey</div><div class="date">21st September 2007, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">That did not seem to be the problem.  I checked both of those sessions it's not picking any of the devices mentioned there.<br />
<br />
Another weird thing was I took out all but 3 of his printers in Maintain Device Preference List by User and now it's selecting a different device, happens to be , &quot;D&quot; for display which is the 3rd one on his list.  Before it was stuck on one that was in the middle of the list until I cleaned up his list and made it shorter.</div></div><hr />

Sorry I need to read closer - that is my standard response when some mentions printer problems.  Never hurts to open a case with baan support and sometimes you get quick answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">21st September 2007, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thought. Check Maintain Report Defaults (ttaad3105m000) to see if the report has been entered here. It might be picking some weird paper type that is overriding the device preferences somehow.<br />
 <br />
I don't have a lot of experience with this session, so I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />
