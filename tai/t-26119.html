<br />
The parameter for &quot;Final Invoice&quot; is not correctly set.  I have had my users save their defaults and I have made sure the default at the form level is set to &quot;YES&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am being told that this flag is somehow being switched to &quot;NO&quot; and my users are printing proforma invoices because they are not used to checking the parameters.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else encountered this problem?  What is the fix?</div></div><hr />

<br />
|* Flag 'Final Invoice' not set to 'No' when returning from form 2. (DF<br />
|* 215363)<br />
<br />
So, it seems that if the 'printed' flag is set to 'yes', and you are on form 2, it will jump to form 1 and set both printed and definite to 'no'.<br />
<br />
Not sure what would cause you to be on form 2 with the 'printed' flag set to yes, but it would cause the problem you describe.</div></div><hr />
