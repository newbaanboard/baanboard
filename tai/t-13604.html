<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms2002</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 09:14</div></div><div class="posttext">we plan to migrate from 4c3 to 4c4. Can I install 4c4 in the existing 4c3 server (existing 4c3 is live!!)  such that  both c3 and c4 will reside on the same server. The we do the testing (by migrating the c3 data on to c4 ). After testing is OK, replace the existing c3 with c4..<br />
<br />
is the above possible..? if yes then will i require fresh validation  to be done for c4 enviornment (c3 and c4 on the same server!!)<br />
<br />
if anybody can share the procedure for the above..i would be grateful!!<br />
<br />
any pros / cons on the above?<br />
<br />
Thanks is advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 11:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's the correct procedure. <br />
You can have more than one BSE environment on the same machine, so you can install c4 on a different directory, migrate the customizations on the new environment, test the all and after you can simply switch the users to use the new one, deleting the old one when you are sure all it's ok.<br />
I think also you have to require a new license code for the new environment, but it's better to check it with BaaN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">you have two options<br />
<br />
a) you install baanIVc4 above baanIVc3<br />
and create in this new branch a new prod VRC.  If you have customiation you must redo it in this branch. you can then migrate the company from VRC. ==&gt; this reconbfigure your data automatically for the tables that has different structure in BaanIVc3 and BaanIVc4.<br />
<br />
b) create a new $BSE and install therein baanIVc4. Create the new prod VRC and also a cdummy VRC wgere you copy the datadictionnaries from you porid BaanIVc3<br />
create you companies in this vr'c and import the data from baanIVc3<br />
the migrate company from VRC.<br />
<br />
remark : this is working in unix environment if you are on NT I think that you are limited to case a.  <br />
<br />
case a is more easy but you can only test with test companies not the prod company or you need to copy your production data to new company(ies).<br />
<br />
case b is a little more complex but you can install in baanIVc4 a copy of your prod baanIVc3 (same companies) and do testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I would definitely advise you to go for plan b.<br />
<br />
This should also be possible on Windows NT. If not, then get yourself temporaryly a test server to prepare everything there and copy everything at migration day.<br />
<br />
If you go for plan a, then you will never get rid completely of your c3 installation. On top of that, as long as you have not finilized your migration, you will be working with c3 application objects on top of c4 tools objects. Thisis possible and some baan users do it, but it is kind of not supported, I guess.<br />
