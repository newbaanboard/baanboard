<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">3rd June 2003, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I am super user, my current login is configured for package comb &quot;B40Cb2fu&quot; with company &quot;100&quot;.<br />
<br />
When I over-rule this with the &quot;-- -set PACKAGE_COMB=B40Cb2fj  -set BSE_COMPNR=700 -set TZ=JST-9&quot; command in my BW config, I am logged into company 700 and the right pakage combo and all seems fine.  However I do not see the menu structures that I should see.  I see the menus as they are configured to the package comb &quot;B40Cb2fu&quot;.  I use the explode6.1 utility and see the menus are found in the package comb &quot;B40Cb2fj&quot;, but its the menus that are developed for the package comb &quot;B40Cb2fu&quot;that are displayed.<br />
<br />
When I change my login within Baan (user setup) to  package comb &quot;B40Cb2fj&quot; with company &quot;700&quot; and login then I see the menus as I should.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any clues ?</div></div><hr />

If you are a super user and have &quot;Auth for all Package VRCs&quot; in the User Data, then check you current package VRC, if this VRC is linked/belonging to the Package Combination.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure what do you mean by this -<br />
If I do need to do this, then using the &quot;set &quot; to login to different PVRC's cannot be used. I might as well create multiple logins.<br />
<br />
Even if you are superuser or a normal user you can work/make script/form/session/report changes (check-in/out) in a single package VRC at any instant if only you have &quot;All Package VRCs authoziation&quot; or if you have been granted authorization by the Developers Authorization Template.<br />
<br />
This option is given by BaaN Tools only to support parallel VRC development.<br />
<br />
You can always use the -set PACKAGE_COMB to switch/access components. BUT you might get some runtime errors if there are any differences in the Domains/Tables-DDs between 2 package combinations and switching between companies.<br />
<br />
To avoid all these issues, the easier way to handle it to create another BaaN user with same or different OS user, and a different current package VRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with NvanBeest: What about multiple Baan users, operating under the same O/S username?  Then use -- -set user=...Using the PACKAGE_COMB and BSE_COMPNR setting is potentially hazardous. What you will do: overrule the default (u-file set settings) with other settings. Note that the setting in the user file are different from the settings mentioned above: compnr instead of BSE_COMPNR and pacc instead of PACKAGE_COMB. You may work with the dataset with a (potential) different software (including RDD) set.<br />
<br />
This problem may be overcome with setting both different options and checking if the settings are correctly overruled with the -- -dbgres option from the bshell.<br />
<br />
But a much easier way to achieve the same is using different user settings for the same OS user.</div></div><hr />
