<br />
(UNIX, Baan IVc, Baan GUI, bw)<br />
<br />
Is there any possibility to find out the last login of a Baan GUI user?<br />
The UNIX command &quot;last&quot; doesn't do that for GUI users.<br />

<br />
You can take a look into olg.licd6.1 and log.licd6.1.<br />
(To look for login in the past, depends on how many users are able to login to Baan and how many times they do it, because in this file you can see the 'registered and unregistered login. Both files contains about 100 login or logoffs)<br />

<br />
But this I tried already. But we have about 150 Users and lot of login/logout. So I can't see the history for more than one or two days.<br />

I know this, but this is to much data.<br />
In fact, I need just a similar command like &quot;last&quot;, but for GUI users (which are not listed in &quot;last&quot;).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">17th August 2004, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also use the TIME.HIS for this purpose, but if you find this too much data, then how about writing a small bshell wrapper, which logs all new bshell starts, something like:<br />
<br />
echo $LOGNAME &gt;&gt; /tmp/last.log<br />
exec $BSE/bin/bshell6.1 $*<br />
<br />
Be aware that sometime the LOGNAME is not properly set, so you might have to take the output of the id command. This allways works!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">17th August 2004, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Markus,<br />
<br />
Your idea is excelent! As I write wrappers for all kind of things (tracing, debugging etc) I should have come up with this by myself. But the honour is up to you. Maybe it can also be extended like:<br />
<br />
echo &quot;LOG ON &quot; $LOGNAME &quot; &quot; `date`&gt;&gt; /tmp/last.log<br />
exec $BSE/bin/bshell6.1 $*<br />
echo &quot;LOG ON &quot; $LOGNAME &quot; &quot; `date`&gt;&gt; /tmp/last.log<br />
<br />
As I don't have access to a system now, you have to test it by yourself. Any way, for all Unix versions this will work.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Dick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">18th August 2004, 03:12</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also make a small 3-GL program and add it to BMS Mask Data (ttadv4188m000) which is executed whenever a user is logs in and it can write into a file or update into a small table. We have a similar tool, refer to -<br />
<br />
Client Info (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=10001) <br />
 <br />
Markus's idea is good as long as you use single bshell entry in $BSE/lib/ipc_info. If you have multiple bshell tags like - bshell_admins, bshell_developers, bshell_endusers, bshell_jobs then all the different log.bshell's are then redirected to log.bshell6.2. And if you have many BaaN users on the system, the log files can get big enough and rolls over to olg files and makes it hard to find the errors.</div></div><hr />

I understand a little bit. But have I to put this lines into the .profile? Or how to start as a shell script?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">18th August 2004, 09:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Dikkie,<br />
<br />
<br />
your extension will not work like this exactly. The &quot;exec&quot; will overload the running process, this way a shell process is saved, but the last echo command will not be executed.<br />
<br />
If you want to execute something behind the bshell call, then just remove the &quot;exec&quot;.<br />
<br />
For Markus Wilhelm:<br />
<br />
You will find lots of topics in regards to &quot;bshel wrappers&quot; here on the forum. They are usefull for all sorts of things, like restricting access, setting environment variables, password aging etc.<br />
<br />
The idea is to change the ipc_info file in $BSE/lib to execute a self written script instead of the origional bshell. This script performs some extra work (like logging users) and then calls the bshell.<br />
<br />
Putting it in the profile will not work, as it is not executed by gui users.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">9th December 2004, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - just thought I would let you guys know about the free client tool we have available that will tell you the following for each login:<br />
<br />
Last time users logged in<br />
Their User Name<br />
Their OS Version<br />
Their BW Client Version<br />
Their PC Name<br />
Their IP Address<br />
<br />
Basically info needed for troubleshooting the client's.  A script is running that captures this info, then there is a display session to view.  We have versions for IV or V.  These tools were passed out at the last BWU conference, and quite a few people are using them with success.  You can download and try them out at:<br />

I didn't realize at first that I was reading a thread  that started 4 years ago. Some of us have come a long way since then. lol :)</div></div><hr />
