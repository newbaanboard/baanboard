Hello,<br />
an idea,<br />
maybe the UX printerqueues on new server are not identical to the old ones ?<br />
Are you able to print from unix with lp command ?<br />
<br />
What kind of UX printers (remote, network based) ?<br />
Update your profile please.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

There are no current entries in any log files.  The print queues are identical on both servers.  We are using HP laserjet printers and they are set up as 'printer' in Baan.  The print daemon is running and there are no errors in that log either.  I had this exact same 'bad printer' problem once when I was learning to create a new driver. :D  But, the driver files appear to be identical.  Oh, the lp command works from unix. <br />
Here is something.  When I set up the printer as 'Direct' and give the lp options, I am able to print from Baan.  This confused me and I thought maybe the print daemon is not working properly.</div></div><hr />

i believe..<br />
<br />
As far as the bad printer error goes, i would actually do a &quot;diff&quot; between<br />
the two files. there could be an extra space somewhere causing the problem.<br />
<br />
otherwise it may be a bug in the pdaemon (since you're the only one using it anymore... =) ) it may not have been noticed.<br />

I had to restart the pdaemon several times and reset device status to get it to work.<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
