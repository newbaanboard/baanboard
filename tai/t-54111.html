No idea about #1<br />
#2 is when you do an operation that cannot be handled by &quot;alter table&quot;<br />
such as dropping a field.<br />
<br />
#3 means the system will issue an &quot;alter table&quot; instead of export/import.<br />

<br />
--C1 An error occurred while checking. The Error field will contain<br />
the actual error.<br />
<br />
--C2 Reconfiguration is required for this table and the database can<br />
handle the entire reconfiguration. The reconfiguration will be<br />
carried out using reconfiguration method 1.<br />
<br />
--C3 Reconfiguration is required for this table. The database can<br />
handle the entire reconfiguration. However, if this table is<br />
reconfigured, bdbreconfig must create an export of the table<br />
data before reconfiguring the table. The reconfiguration will be<br />
performed using reconfiguration method 2.<br />
<br />
--C4 Reconfiguration is required for this table. The database cannot<br />
handle the reconfiguration. The reconfiguration will be<br />
performed using reconfiguration method 3.<br />
<br />
the method refers as the comment posted, to an alter, or export/delete/create/import and also to the refint, indexes and basicly the options in bdbreconfig<br />
<br />
this is for 8.x portingsets, before it was always export/delete/create/import<br />

But I am curious about the variation where the database can handle it but an export has to be done. What typical table/domain change will lead to this? And what is the export good for?</div></div><hr />
