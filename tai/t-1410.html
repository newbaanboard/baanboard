I am working with a third party vendor to solve a problem with a login error.  The short story:<br />
We use Empirical Advantage Investigator+ to translate Baan tables into a gateway to use to load Oracle Discoverer.  In order to run this add-on, an ora user must be created.  I think that the ora user password has been corrupted.  The vendor suggested that I use a baan utility called encrypt6.1 to validate the encrypted password in the ora_groups file.  The problem: the utility does not return the same value consistently for a given password.  For example:  if I type in<br />
&gt;encrypt6.1 password  Three different times,<br />
This is the result.<br />
/u01/baan/bse/lib/ora&gt;encrypt6.1 password<br />
<br />
HV)YX(WUqE&quot;^T]-vg2w5M&amp;PgZ&lt;^pr~;~<br />
/u01/baan/bse/lib/ora&gt;encrypt6.1 password<br />
<br />
@,!U/t*;:^;,5&gt;vx|*,WzTqt`5yA:Y!Y<br />
/u01/baan/bse/lib/ora&gt;encrypt6.1 password<br />
<br />

I am looking into the exact functionality for this utility but, I was hoping someone here could explain why I don't get the same encryption for 'password' each time I run the utility.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Maybe one of the oracle guru's knows the answer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 00:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The whole idea of the encryption method used is that you should indeed  get different password strings even for the same input strings. Otherwise your passwords would be not be safe at all. However that does not mean that all these passwords are different!<br />
<br />
If you have problems accessing your Oracle database from within Baan then reset the password for the Oracle user and use either the ora(x)_admin/maint6.x utilities to reset the password in the $BSE/lib/ora_users file. Or if you really want to do it manually: use encrypt6.1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">encrypt6.1 uses two variables to create the encrypted string.  One is the supplied string (&quot;password&quot;).  The second variable is time sensitive.  You will notice when you run the command that occasionally the same encrypted string is repeated depending on the congruence of the time and string.  <br />
<br />
Since the encrypted value includes the time key value to perform the decryption, you can use the value from encrypt to paste into the table, but it will not be a repeatable process.<br />

I've never used encrypt6.1 and was unfamiliar with exactly what it was doing.<br />
<br />
Based on your answers, the consultant that recommended I use it to VERIFY a password was wrong indeed.  This is what I expected.  sigh.<br />
I did work out the issue on my own and it was not the password itself but, related to the way in which a baan user is linked to an oracle user.   <br />
<br />
Thanks again,  <br />
