You need to perform &quot;hard crash&quot; recovery. Here are the steps :<br />
<br />
	1	Restore back-up<br />
Since the original system cannot be rebooted, a back-up must be restored on a different system.<br />
	2	Remove the /.brand/.brand6.1 file<br />
Since the identity of the system on which the software is installed has changed, the previous security code is no longer valid. Therefore, the license daemon must not be started up. The /.brand/.brand6.1 file is removed to prevent the license daemon from starting up.<br />
	3	Run the rc.start shell script<br />
Next, the rc.start shell script must be run to initialize both the printer daemon and the shared memory.<br />
	4	Patch Objects after System Crash (ttiex3228m000)<br />
The next step is to patch the objects in the Patch Objects after System Crash (ttiex3228m000) session.<br />
	5	Print Requested System Configuration (ttiex3400m000)<br />
Since the software can only be used for one week, a new security code must be generated in the Print Requested System Configuration (ttiex3400m000) session. The printed request is sent to Baan.<br />
	6	Validate the software<br />
Once the request is received, Baan will send new validation keys after which the software can be validated again.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
