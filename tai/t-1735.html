<br />
We always get the message &quot;max users is reached&quot;. <br />
To avoid see it, we added 5 licenses. It's enough absolutely. But recently we got the message fruquently once more.  And we found some users always open the baan, but actually he only use it for a while. Now we have no any idea to solve it.<br />
<br />
Are there some solutions can kick off the users automatically when the user didn't do anything in baan within a specific time?<br />
<br />
Has anybody met the same problem?<br />
<br />
Any suggest will be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is an issue everywhere. there is alreday a thread posted regarding this under <br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1579<br />
<br />
Also have a try with Closeidle program. you have a 30 days trial.<br />
Download it from http://www.dsigb.com<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">18th April 2002, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, see in the support website the solution 19868 for more details. In resume, you use two variables to control the idle detection from the server by defining (in the server side):<br />
<br />
DS_MAX_WAIT [default=30 seconds], you specify the timout duration BW has to respond to the sync message<br />
DS_TIMEOUT_DETECT [default=30 minutes], you specify the timeout duration before the bshell starts sending a sync message to the BW.<br />
<br />
So, what happens is the following (assuming the defaults): after 30 minutes the bshell sends a sync message to the BW, if this one does not respond within 30 seconds, the connection is terminated. A message is then logged in the log.bshell (or NT event viewer) with a &quot;Connection to Display Server timed out after &lt;DS_TIMEOUT_DETECT&gt; minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
But this not always works as expected, and hung bshells is a common thing...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">msanlon</div><div class="date">20th April 2002, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a free one that does the same as CLOSE IDLE<br />
<br />
DS_TIMEOUT_DETECT only works when there is no client at the other end of the connection. It's handy for freeing up some licenses when a client has been killed<br />
<br />
From porting set 6.1c.06.01 and above, Baan implemented the SESSION_TIMEOUT variable which will disconnect idle Baan Clients. This is much more useful!<br />
<br />
See Baan Solution 110907 for more details</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have found session time_out very useful but it leave applications locks fir users who are idle in maintain sessions of sales orders.<br />
<br />
We have informed baan about it and they are looking into it.<br />
Again users should not lock sales orders if not using!!<br />
<br />
We have developed a new session to remove those locks and it is under testing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">25th April 2002, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been using closeidle for sometime ( 6/9 months)<br />
<br />
It is effective for almost eliminating ghosts and reducing the number of licences used which can be dramatic <br />
<br />
Tip - the policy was agreed by MDs in order to &quot;reduce&quot; cost <br />
Users not overly happy but it is their management's decision<br />
<br />
There are percieved problems by users but none substantiated to date<br />
<br />
Can be tuned for &quot;groups&quot; of users which is also useful</div></div><hr />
