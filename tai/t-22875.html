<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdbailey</div><div class="date">18th January 2005, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">It should be mentioned that using the method pointed out utilizes a Baan license for each job launched.  If a job is periodic, it will continually hold that license until the job is stopped.  With multiple jobs running, this can use up licenses fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
If licenses are an issue, another alternative is to launch the job from any computer which will remain running (i.e. a server or dedicated job workstation etc...).  In this way, multiple jobs can be run from a single license.  The trick with this approach is to schedule the jobs so they don't run into each other.  As an example, let's say you have 1 job that must run every 15 minutes, another job that runs once every 7 minutes and yet another job that must run once per day.  You could set up all 3 jobs with status &quot;free&quot; just as Clarisse states, then use the &quot;Activate Job&quot; session for each job.  The job running every 15 minutes could start at the top of the hour (i.e. 06:00) with the 15 minute interval; the 7 minute job could start at 06:03; the once-per-day job could start at 01:00.<br />
<br />
 - The result would be the 15 minute job would &quot;bump into&quot; the once-per-day job at 1 A.M. (which isn't usually a problem for most companies).  The 7-minute job would &quot;bump into&quot; the 15 minute job about every 3.5 hours (approximately 7 times per day).  When jobs &quot;bump into&quot; each other, the sessions will slow down a bit until they complete, but the jobs won't stop each other (in most situations).  So, this may be a solution to your problem if multiple jobs and licensing are a factor.<br />
<br />
It is another approach....  I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
