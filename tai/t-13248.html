As this is defined by language, and thus only one format per language (all 3 comps use english language 2), is there a way to get around this ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">9th October 2003, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 solutions for you, but both tricky - and maybe not so goods.....<br />
<br />
FIRST ONE (maybe the most complicated and with a lot of other problems):<br />
Copy all the sw components to a language you don't use, let's say &quot;3&quot;. Pay attention to the tt components, you have also to copy the RTDD of the language 2 on the language 3.<br />
Configure in this langage the other date format you want to use.<br />
Connect the users of this company to this language.<br />
<br />
SECOND ONE (the most simple but I'm not sure...):<br />
create a second copy of $BSE/lib/datecurr (in this place are stored the data related to the date format); Call this datecurr2 and the original datecurr1.<br />
Create 2 differents unix scripts, let's say bshell1 and bshell2: both must have:<br />
rm $BSE/lib/datecurr<br />
<br />
mv $BSE/lib/datecurr1 $BSE/lib/datecurr #for bshell1<br />
# or<br />
mv $BSE/lib/datecurr2 $BSE/lib/datecurr #for bshell2<br />
bshell<br />
<br />
I'm not sure, but I think any instance of bshell loads datecurr ...<br />
<br />
My personal advice - don't mess with it without do many tests....</div></div><hr />
