<br />
I've got a question here.<br />
<br />
I want to set up a few printers connected to my network and want to be able to allow the user to select which printer to print from. The way LN is set up it will always choose the default printer if I allow printing from a Windows Printer. <br />
Is there anyway to set the Device Data to a different printer instead of just using the Windows Default Printer or anything that I can do to force the user to pick a printer prior printing to the document.<br />
<br />
It's incovenient for the user to have to go into windows and to change their default printer each time they want to print something out.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
After selecting the windows printer in the Select Device session, go to the Printer tab and tick the Preview option and then click continue. The system will show you the preview of the report. In this preview, you can now select other printers to print the report.<br />

<br />
You can always select the printer in printer setup as specified by reeyah .<br />
<br />
In case of Baan 4c4 , you can build Device type specifying the share name of the print server to spool directly.<br />
<br />
<br />
example <br />
\\10.10.10.1\Accounts  - where 10.10.10.1 is IP of print server and Accounts is the share name of the printer.<br />
<br />
Given that the client and print server were both in Domain or mutual hand shake is done<br />
<br />
Steps .<br />
<br />
1.Create a New print Device - (with appropriate name)<br />
2.Specify 4GL as ttstpconv (similar 4gl program in LN)<br />
3.specify the share name in path ( eg: \\10.10.10.1\Accounts)<br />
<br />
uncheck change allowed<br />
<br />
Note: It is always recommended to route through print server not directly to Printer IP.<br />
<br />

I'll give it a go. I'm fairly new to ERP and LN in general so still learning the ropes with all these.<br />
