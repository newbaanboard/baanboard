Hello,<br />
Flat Files on Unix are character based (No WYSIWYG), so you can't print Barcodes to a &quot;Flat&quot; Unix File.<br />
<br />
Barcode printing from BaaN -&gt; Email only with 3rd party software.<br />
Search this forum for barcode, you'll find a lot of hints.<br />
<br />
<br />

You are absolutley right when you point out that UNIX only support WYSIWYG and so a flatfile to Unix will not achieve what I want. What I meant to actually imply was creating a postscript file that could be emailed to our customers. <br />
<br />
We use Streamserve software as our 3rd party &quot;presentation&quot; tool and I'm checking to see if we could email using that.<br />
<br />

Do you know if StreamServe can convert a numeric value from a Baan output into a Barcode before it prints/emails that report to a specified user?<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

We use Baan IV and Streamserve. Streamserve can easily turn any number in (as far as I know) any type of barcode. Height and width can be choosen aswell. <br />
<br />
You have to remember that Streamserve doesn't come with PDFout and EMAILout standard. Those are extra's you have to buy, this works with licencecodes.<br />

<br />
We use Baan IVc4 with Streamserve to print out our normal reports as well as barcodes on our laser + zebra printers. As I was not very experienced in Streamserve I editied some files directly like platform, &amp; the project dux files for barcode printing. I guess the same config can be done thru SS controls also.<br />
<br />
All these documents can be either printed, emailed or faxed depending on user selection. Our current output is pdf.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you want some script samples on how its configured.<br />
<br />

Yes, it would be nice if you could attach some sample configuration scripts. <br />
<br />
Thanks a ton, <br />
