I was told by my seniors that bdbpre and bdbpost option could be used.how do i use it ? Can you help me on this?<br />
<br />
<br />
I also get the error <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 00:19</div></div><div class="posttext">since you're oracle you could do something like<br />
<br />
select 'alter table '||table_name||' drop column '||column_name||';'<br />
from user_tab_columns where column_name like '%hash%';<br />
<br />
select 'drop index '||index_name||';' from user_indexes;<br />
<br />
Then create a gcommand script to re-create all of the indexes via<br />
Baan.<br />
<br />
as a matter of fact, that's pretty much exactly what I'd do...<br />

&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
Could you point me to docs on gcommand?  Or basic syntax.  I am looking at doing this conversion for Informix and L2.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">7th October 2004, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">There isn't any documentation... its a support/developer tool so they have all the info.. its unsupported and all that..<br />
<br />
as for the syntax for creating indexes:<br />
<br />
&lt;file1&gt;<br />
#1 tccom000 TCRI 9999 -p 0<br />
<br />
gcommand6.1 file1 &lt;company&gt;<br />
<br />
that will create all of the indexes for tccom000<br />
<br />
you could do a whole file of #1's with different tables, but<br />
gcommand has a limited input buffer, so its better to do it in a<br />
loop and send one line at a time.<br />

<br />
I ran this on development and worked great.  Could explain the last parameters, I hate to run this on production without knowing what I am doing.<br />
<br />
TCRI = create index command ?<br />
9999 = ??<br />
-p 0 = ??<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 02:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Andy - here's what I know off the top of my head...<br />
<br />
#1 &lt;table&gt; TCRI 9999 -p 0<br />
#1 = the db connection... so you could do #2 to open a new one.<br />
TCRI = Create Index<br />
9999 = Which index? (9999 = All)<br />
-p = Print what I did to commlog<br />
0 = I think this says &quot;don't lock the table&quot;.. but I'm not sure.<br />

<br />
Dave approach shows, how much insider knowhow he has. Not bad.<br />
<br />
But actually, his approach should only be neccessary, if you use oracle exp/imp for the job.<br />
<br />
If you use bdbpre/post (or the according baan sessions), then just dump the data with the old portingset and load them with the new. Baan will do the conversion automatically. Actually there is nothing to convert, because the dump does not contain the hashes etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">My way might be a little quicker in a level 1 -&gt; level 2 conversion, since really you  don't need to do the export/import.. but I think the easiest waywould be the pre/post method that Markus described.. <br />
I think actually, that I read the original post wrong<br />
&quot;bdbpre/bdbpost could be used&quot; I read as &quot;couldn't&quot;. Otherwise I wouldn't<br />
have brought t up..<br />
<br />
and I need to start looking at the wiki before I wrack my brains on <br />
syntax!<br />
<br />

We are looking at moving from L1 to L2 on Informix.  While I agree that Baan tools are easier, I am looking for speed.<br />
