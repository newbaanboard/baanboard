<br />
I have a question on programming principles. I heard some where that, while coding we are not supposed to used tables related to tt for doing queries. For example, if I want company data, instead of using ttaadxxx we have to use tccom000 like that. Is it a valid principle I heard? If yes, why it was proposed and violating this rule can impact in what kind of set up?</div></div><hr />

At one time I even had a script to go thru and update some domains.  I see no problem with reading the tools table as long as you are aware of the information and how it is formatted.  I would not recommend updating any of the tools tables, without being extra careful and really understanding the impact.  Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RieseUSA</div><div class="date">14th December 2011, 01:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The rule is that you are not supposed to access the tt tables directly.  The data structure or meaning could be changed with any update.  Even though (major) changes are unlikely.<br />
<br />
For a lot of needs, there is some function, including the 'tt.*' functions, that will provide you with the information that you are looking for.<br />
<br />
I agree with Mark that updates to tools tables should be avoided.  If you create data corruption that way, then support will not assist you.<br />
<br />
If you are just reading the tables for some information, then the risk of some impact is small.<br />
<br />
As a conclusion, if there is a function to get the data, then use it.</div></div><hr />

Technically there is no bar using tt tables in script  . But that should be a last resort  even for just read-only query . Practically there is function for everything . <br />
<br />
Beyond that an expert hands  can definitely make use of tools data in readonly  manner and write some query on tools table or say develop zoom display session on tools table.</div></div><hr />
