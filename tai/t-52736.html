In ODM after the releasing the file ,the file name gets saved in the vault area with a different name .<br />
For eg. the word file which i attached was named as &quot;warehouse.doc&quot; but after releasing the document to which this file was attached,it got saved with the name&quot;227186dd-f5cb-4205-89a4-f1397eb251ad_1&quot; in the valut area.<br />
This is happening with all the files .it is very difficult to trace the file in the vault area with this.<br />
Is there any settings missing...because with LN6.1 Sp0 ,this problem was not there.</div></div><hr />
