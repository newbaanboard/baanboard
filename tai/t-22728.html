<br />
I am running session Archieve Warehouse History ( whinh2255m000 ) which archives/deletes the data , first it copies the general/common data , then it archives/deletes the transactions, now problem is after running it for nearly 2 hours it was on the stage of Archive Common Data , i am using BaaN V b with Oracle 8 as db on Sun Solaris, how can i check whether something is  being done by the session or not ??<br />
<br />
I am finding myself helpless .... i don't have the source code to debug ... i checked at db level , my data size in tablespace is not getting changed .... since this common data which it is trying to copy must already be present in the archive co. <br />
<br />
i also checked using bshell, agsinst my session the ticks are getting incremented....but i feel that session is doing nothing... can i do something at db level i.e. at oracle level to check ?<br />
<br />
Waiting for your replies gurus.<br />

<br />
You could log your bshell during you run bshell, with command options in your bshell enviroment. Then a log file will be generated and in this file (depends on the settings) you could check the performance of the session and why it takes so long for archiving. I will attache an excel sheet with that you can create the logging strings.<br />
i hope it will help.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the info. AS u said i set the following information in my bshell.<br />
<br />
	<br />
-- -set TT_SQL_TRACE=0240 -keeplog -logfile /export/home/bsp/captured.log<br />
<br />
i.e. 040 Show queries with their QID<br />
and  200 Show query execution times<br />
<br />
<br />
ofcourse painfull part was that log became too big.<br />
<br />
Now i took the last 100 lines of the log which i am attaching herewith, if u see it's only hitting item master i.e. tcibd001.  I feel like its gone is some infinite loop ??<br />
<br />
Since i am having view on the log for the first time, may be u can guide me, do u feel that it's in infinte loop ?? <br />
<br />
Basically any archive session is suppose to copy the common data from your operational co. to archive co., then it actually starts doing archiving/deleting.<br />
<br />
Attached is the last 100 lines of log.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />
<br />

<br />
but that's not particularly likely, archiving sessions take a long time.. often days depending on how much data you have.<br />

<br />
yaah after some more time i again check it started hitting other tables also, now although the below doubt i have already posted in other group.<br />
<br />
may be u can help in that also.<br />
<br />
see my log file is becoming too big, i am new to unix, i enetered via vi editor and then issued command &quot;30000dd&quot; which deleted 30000 lines but i don't want to do this everytime via vi editor<br />
<br />
how should i delete the lines without entering into vi, and secondly will that reduce my file size also, because right now what i can see is my log file size din't got reduced even though i deleted 90 % of lines via vi<br />
<br />
sorry i am a bit new to unix.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
instead just do<br />
<br />
&gt;logfile<br />
or <br />
cp /dev/null logfile<br />
<br />
that will truncate it back to 0.<br />
<br />
Also, look up on the board for info on bshcmd6.1, you can turn TT_SQL_TRACE on and off to keep control of that logfile.<br />
<br />
since, we've decided that its not looping - One thing that you might want to try is ORAPROF=0 that will create an oraprof file.<br />
<br />
do you have the supporteye toolkit?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">31st December 2004, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I did vi via searching on net through google.. .... anyways problem is that if process is writing some data in file , then at that time , the beloe mentioned cammand does not empty the file<br />
<br />
&gt; logfile<br />
<br />
and infact ls -l shows me file size as original ... don'tnow may be once the process gets completed it shows me the trucated file size ... may be ...<br />
<br />
No, i don't have the support eye, with regard to Oraprof could u please more details on to it ... i tried searching baanboard, but couldnt find real help on that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">31st December 2004, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">vi usually dies if the file is too large, that's all.. <br />
<br />
Yeah, some OSs don't seem to like to release the file, although i thought<br />
solaris did. <br />
<br />
you set ORAPROF like you do TT_SQL_TRACE, however oraprof will give you<br />
the oracle queries and their times. (as opposed to the Baan query and its times). The value you assign to it is the time threshold for queries (i.e.,<br />
if you do ORAPROF=1 it will only show queries that took longer than 1 second). <br />
<br />
On a long running query you really need bbofm/SupportEye you still might be able to download SupportEye from the Baan support site. It will parse the oraprof (or tt_sql_trace) files for you and give you back an easier to read file. (in HTML).<br />
<br />
You also might want to try the Call Graph Profiler, search dikkidick's posts for info on that.<br />
