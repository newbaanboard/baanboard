I have checked the host name in licence6.1 file, it is matching with the host name of server. I have also tried with IP address in licence6.1 file but no luck. The server is available on network.

details are as <br />
H/w is IBM net server 250 with windows 2000, baan4c4 with DB2 v5 as database.<br />

Looks like a permission problem.<br />
Check the ownership of the brand file and see if your current user is able to write into it.</div></div><hr />

What else can be problem ?<br />

This error occurs, if your path is not correct. Don't call $BSE/bin/ba6.1 but change your path, so that you can call ba6.1 from whereever you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Gerhjard, this is an NT system... I'm more used to UNIX than NT now, anybody with more experience with NT to help this one out?<br />
<br />
Atulk, you mentioned that you can login into Baan, do you get any message at all when you login?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We could not understand your problem. You said you have Windows 2000, and then you are talking about &quot;brand6.1&quot; which is only for UNIX !!! Then you are talking about &quot;C:\winnt\baan6.1.lic&quot; which is related to Windows instalation. (this is OK). <br />
<br />
 Please make yourself clear. Otherwise you will receive answers regarding Baan Ascii - ba6.1..... (Take care of / and \...)<br />
<br />
 You are right with baan6.1.lic, since you haven't reached the step &quot;Validate Tools Set&quot; which creates this file. The file licence6.1 seems to be OK. <br />
<br />
 Make sure you have set properly the system environment variables BSE and BSE_TMP. It is also good to have<br />
f:\baan\bin (as an example) in your path, although this is not mandatory.<br />
<br />
 In $BSE\bin there are some executables (like hostid.exe, I remember) which are &quot;responsible&quot; of generating the security key. Maybe you do not have this file.... A good idea would be to reinstall the porting set, to be sure you have all files. Save $BSE\bin as $BSE\bin.old - do a &quot;copy&quot;, not a &quot;rename&quot;.<br />
<br />
 There should be no other &quot;secrets&quot;.</div></div><hr />
