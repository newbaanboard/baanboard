My question is in 2 parts.<br />
<br />
1. Need help with the steps to upgrade from baan4C2 to Baan4C4( I am sure there are many out there who have done it).<br />
<br />
2. Also need to know the steps to install spanish language. I know the language is tied to the user, that means 2 different people can look at the same data in their associated langauge.?<br />
<br />
need lots of clarifications.<br />
<br />
Also Any modification to be done at the Database level, we have Oracle 8i.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acapulco</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 06:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We had Baan IVc2 installed in Mexico (in spanish)  we tha migrated to Baan IVc4, which is by far a better Baan release by all means (my advice is Migrate to Baan IVc4) ans this year we migrated to Baan 5c.<br />
<br />
I only have Baan in spanish since all my users are in Mexico.  I will ask my Account rep at Baan Mexico how you can get a lenguage pack.<br />
<br />
By the way, why do you need Baan in spanish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 07:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what happened. We installed the spanish language on our system,(we are on BaaN lVc4 supply chain with controling(scc1). Alot of the objects were updated in our scc1 VRC, but they were very old. We had many problems with this, Not sure if it is related to the supply chain extension.<br />
<br />
In the user management(tools), you can set up which language the user can use (eg. 5 for spanish, 2 english, 3 german...)</div></div><hr />
