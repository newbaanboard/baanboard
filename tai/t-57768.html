<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpchheda</div><div class="date">5th February 2010, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I Have a problem in Print Purchase Order Report. We are printing Purchase orders on Dot matrix printer. W used to take the baan output in text file and then converting it into DOS to get 20 CPI, so that it fits in 80 column preprinted stationery. But in this Buyer used to make changes in text with incorporating the same in Baan, which was creating problem And i has been ordered to stop this text po ASAP.<br />
 <br />
Now some how I could manage with the layout so that I can print it directly on dot matrix printer.<br />
<br />
Now my problem is after every  first PO print, i need to offline the printer and give unload paper / upload paper option to start the new Purchase order from the first line (below our logo). <br />
Earlier with DOS it was automately getting set before printing the second <br />
Purchase order.<br />
I have gone through various post and found out that there is option of Form field in Maintain Device Data, which can resolve (hopefully) this issue. But I am unable to check that option to yes.<br />
What could be the issue .. or any other solution to set the paper before printing every order to first line?<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />

Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately I dont have that option (Direct) in Device type. I tried in all the option available in my baan screen for form field, but it is not getting enabled in any of those. Please see the attachment and suggest.<br />

<br />
I'm guessing that the difference between our systems is due to the fact that we are on Unix and yours is a Windows Server. So the option Windows Server Printer is equivalent to Direct on UNIX.<br />
<br />
Does the Windows Server option allow you to set Form Feed ? Do any of the options allow you to set Form Feed.<br />
<br />

In any of the available Device type, the Form Feed option is not getting enabled. Also created new device and checked. But not enabling.<br />

<br />
I can only presume that the From Feed option is deliberately not available on a Windows server. <br />
<br />
In respect of your options I'm not sure whether putting the form feed printer codes directly into the report layout would work in this circumstance.<br />
<br />
Have you considered using a Baan forms package ? This could be justified cost wise by replacing your pre printed stationery and also printing on a laser printer as opposed to dot matrix.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
How to add form feed in report layout. Can you provide me the script?<br />
<br />
What is Baan forms package? I am not aware of. Kindly send me the details.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<br />
The form feed codes would be specific to each printer and just added into the report layout. In respect of preprinted forms software your best bet would to be search for board for the best solution / vendor.<br />
