     I am having trouble converting the domains to runtime dd. So i checked out the threads on the prb and a lot of them gave the solution of clearing the shared memory. I wanted to knw as to hw to access the shared memory.<br />
I had even restarted the server but it still does not create a new dd when i convert it to runtime. I'm using windows 2003 server edition as the os.<br />
<br />
So can anyone help me out here.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the most likely culprit is that you're table requires a domain from a different package to be converted and you didn't convert the domain first. which puts you in a bit of a deadlock.<br />

<br />
If you only used the convert to rdd yet I suggest that you run the create runtime dd and check if that gives you a correct runtime dd. With the latest portingset it's not necesarry anymore but it would harm to restart shared memory afterwards. <br />
<br />
Still no luck? Call support, that's why they are there. <br />
