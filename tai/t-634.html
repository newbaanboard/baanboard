<br />
Do you have something else than the BaaN Support documentation ? (installation, env. configuration and user guide)<br />
<br />
We tried to use it in 4B2 two years ago but do not have any success. It was containing a lot of bug in that version.<br />
<br />
It is working fine in 4C4 ? <br />
<br />
Do you know someone how using it in 4C4 and having success ?<br />

You basically need to decide on a viewer for your drawings and where your drawings are going to be stored.  Some people view native CAD files, while others convert them to PCL or HPGL.  Setup is via EDM parameters (tiedm0100m000) and Item Revisions (tiedm1101m000).<br />
<br />
Implementing viewing is conceptually pretty simple.  Of course, the way your network is set up could complicate things.<br />
<br />
We've actually tied the viewing piece in with printing the drawings as part of the Print Order Documents session for some of our customers.  <br />
<br />
I hope that gives you some direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have more details about attaching the DRAWING to the Print Order Documents session ? We will need to do this at the end.<br />

It doesn't really go into too many specifics because a number of variables play into how things are implemented.  Essentially, the printing process involved getting a viewer to print in the background.  We've done this different ways with different viewers for different clients.  If you want for information, please contact me by phone or email.<br />

<br />
I will take a look and see if we need more details ...<br />
<br />
For the moment, we are in the migration from 4B2 to 4C4. We are ready to go live after a lot of tests. We will do the move during Chrismast holiday.<br />
<br />
After the move. we will take care of the drawing button.<br />
