<br />
My users are using WEBUI 10.5 to access LN ERP. They have got his session currently blocked error quite often. Whenever this error occurs, they have to close the browser and relogin again. All their PCs have JAVA 1.6 installed.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Homer-J-</div><div class="date">21st March 2013, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Make a update to WebUI 10.6 Bulid 106 - or wait 2 weeks for Bulit 107.<br />
And Use Java 1.7 Local.<br />
This should solve the problem...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried this updated version, we are planning to do that, as we also have the same issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Homer-J-</div><div class="date">28th July 2015, 09:07</div></div><div class="posttext">The actualy Version is Infor Web UI 10.16 - build MA0029<br />
i think if you plane a update you should use this Version.<br />
but also the tomcat Version and JRE Bundle are changing...<br />
<br />
you install this Version on another port. sho you can test it, prarallel to the live webui.<br />
<br />
for example: http://infor01:8312/webui live webui and http://infor01:9312/webui test ui<br />
<br />
if the Errors are solved you can Switch all users to port 9312 or update the live Version.<br />
<br />
if you have any questions - feel free to contact me.</div></div><hr />
