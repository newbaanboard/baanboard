Be aware that the validation machines use the same DBMS (or that both different DBMSses are validated).<br />
<br />
We have had problems with sharing licences, due to the fact that in /etc/services the port is determined where licmon runs:<br />
licence6.1      6096/tcp        # Baan licence daemon<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">13th April 2003, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">One note.  Whatever server you put your &quot;license server&quot; on,  if it is down for maintenance, then you will not be able to run Baan on the other servers.  e.g. if you put your license server on production, if production is down, then you won't be able to run Baan on your test servers. <br />
<br />
This may impact you if you use your test servers for development, or for other situations when production is down.<br />
<br />
You can put a license server on pretty much any size CPU as it does not take much processing at all, so you may want to use a &quot;spare&quot; server as the license server for all 3 or your servers.<br />
<br />
If you feel going down on production does not matter for your test servers, then you don't need to worry about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After reading this thread, I find myself confused. I am new in this sharing licenses. Can someone clarify this steps.<br />
<br />
1) lets say prod server name is King, license6.1 contain 'king'<br />
2) lets say dev server name is Queen, license6.1 in dev server also enter 'king'?<br />
3) Is that all?<br />
4) then I should run ttiex3225m000?<br />
<br />
How do i have a third server to keep the license for king and queen?<br />
Let's say third server is Jack. <br />
Do I just copy license6.1 over to Jack and then enter 'Jack' into the license6.1 in King and Queen?<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
thanks and rgds</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have activated licence daemon on KING then you have to use this hostname for each BSE setup may be Queen or Jack into licence6.1, if you would to share licences from KING, otherwise you can use that software for 30 days only.<br />

<br />
You can have your license running on multiple servers with one licd6.1 on each box sharing the same pool of licenses (for high availability architectures)<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
you can have it running in only one box and have the other servers point to it<br />
<br />
The option of having Baan's license running in multiple servers used to cause all sorts of problems so it more or less became common practice to have licd6.1 running in just one box with the others pointing to it.<br />
<br />
I have never tried the option of the third server but it may work. You need to install Baan on that third box as well, only that you don't need your application there. You do need tools because you need to be able to validate tools set, and you need at least your company 000's license tables. Then you need to have &quot;Jack&quot; in all 3 servers' licence6.1 file. The idea here is that having a license only servers allows you to stop prod and dev without affecting each other. <br />
<br />
I think the license only server is too much trouble. In practice if you use your production server to run the license you'll be fine over 99% of the times. Think it this way: how often do you stop production? probably not to often. And when you stop it, what day of the week do you stop it? I bet that doesn't happen on Mondays :) So what are the chances of having developers and testers needing to access Baan during Production downtime? Not null that is for sure but in my experience they are low enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you please elaborate more on first option? Is it a different mechanism rather than BaaN's HA licence?<br />
<br />
<br />
Baan's license running in multiple servers used to cause all sorts of problems <br />
<br />
What kind of problem you are talking about? I think it will be advantage.<br />
<br />
We have licence daemon running on Production Server and other dev, qa and test pointing to that.<br />

<br />
This is Baan's HA license I am talking about.<br />
<br />
The problems I talk about used to happen a long, long time ago. Around 1997. If you have 3 servers sharing say 300 licenses and one of them goes down after some time (72hrs?) your licenses are chopped down to 200 (one third less). The problem was that some times (like once a month) the license daemons lost connectivity with each other for no apparent reason. When that happened the licenses were reduced by a third or two leaving a bunch of people out of the system. Even the fact that the servers were bounced weekly (for other reasons, not just license) did not prevent that from happening. Things got so bad politically that Baan agreed to give them three separate full sets of permanent licenses, one per server. Needless to say that was not a very smart thing to do. Until the time I lost contact with that customer Baan was still trying to convince them to change to a two servers HA license architecture under which the problem had been solved. <br />
Anyways, that's ancient history. The reason why I brought this up is because these events moved some Baan consultants (me included) to recommend running licenses in only one server. It made sense back then and in the end it works fine even today. For HA architectures in the event of the server with the license going down it is a matter of patching objects after system crash on the fail-over box and live with the warning messages until you get a new license (one day at the most?). <br />
I personally don't like having production licenses on development servers but it is just a matter of taste (I am getting old and grumpy! ;) ). However as long as your downtimes on dev are less than the license threshold for # of lics reduction no one will notice a thing.<br />
<br />
By the way I think 2 is still the magic number of servers for HA licenses, anybody knows?<br />

license6.1 on our new test server points to the server running the license daemon but tools sessions crash with &quot;illegal object&quot; errors.<br />

Can't run the patch object sessions as suggested as I get the error &quot;Validation key software unknown&quot;.<br />
