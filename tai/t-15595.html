<br />
After importing a sequential dump into Baan IV c4, converting to RDD, logout and back to Baan, I try to create the tables but the process fails with the error: Table definition cannot be found.<br />
<br />
I have checked the table definitions with ttadv4120m000 (Maintain Table Definitions) and everything is there. I have also taken a look to the files in dict/dd&lt;pacc&gt; and again everything is fine.<br />
<br />
Anyone can help?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
bad news for you: You are running Baan on windows and in this case shared memory will not always get invalidated, when it should.<br />
<br />
Stop and start Shared memory and it should be fine!<br />
If this does not help, reboot your system.<br />
<br />
I know this sounds like a bad joke of a unix guru, but I once spent half a day on such a problem after installing a patch wich contained a new table.<br />
<br />
Reboot solved the problem. Sad but true!<br />

P.S.: I assume your user is in the right package combination :-)</div></div><hr />

when you go to shutdown / restart shared memory. otherwise it will not clear..(including your job daemon...)<br />
<br />
or, go into shared memory manager and do 'show loaded' you can then remove the specific tables from shared memory. (also, if there was a domain change, remove the domain file as well!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">8th June 2004, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously the table definition contains a new domain. Are all the domains used present and did you convert also the domains to runtime?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are in the riught direction. Yes, these tables have several new domains, and they have converted to RDD but this process fails with this error:<br />
<br />
Cannot reconfigure tables/domains, there are still some tables and domains which needs to be to converted to runtime.<br />
<br />
regarding a domain called tttxt001 which BTW it is not used anywhere (at least directly).<br />

After that it'll allow u to reconfig the table.</div></div><hr />
