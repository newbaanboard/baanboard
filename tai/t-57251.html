<br />
The oracle database is remote.<br />
<br />
When I had to do this a couple weeks ago, I ended up calling Infor to assist.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was trying to confirm the steps, and also trying to see where I went wrong on this.<br />
<br />
Basically, these are the steps.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  Create DB user<br />
2.  Create OS user<br />
3.  link OS user to DB user, using ora8_admin6.1<br />
4.  link OS user to baan user, using maintain user data session<br />
5.  tack on any session authorizations<br />
<br />
Well, the issue is that, according to support, that tool &quot;ora8_admin6.1&quot; is designed to only work with local databases.  I guess that is possible.<br />
<br />
In this case, I recall that the support technician did the following:<br />
<br />
(a) /baan/bse/bin/encrypt6.1 &lt;oracle_password&gt;<br />
this above command generated an encrypted password, i'll call it<br />
&lt;oracle_encrypted_password&gt;<br />
(b) Then, appended to /baan/bse/lib/ora/ora_users the following<br />
&lt;osusername&gt;:&lt;dbusername&gt;:&lt;oracle_encrypted_password&gt;:baan<br />
<br />
These (1) and (2) above took the place of the (3) above.<br />
<br />
Is this correct?<br />
<br />
I'm asking as I just tried this, and it didn't work, and am about to submit a support case.<br />
<br />
Is there any other way?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than that the steps look correct.<br />
<br />
To create the DB user though you need to:<br />
create user &lt;username&gt; identified by 'password';<br />
grant connect, resource to &lt;username&gt;;<br />
grant r_baan to &lt;username&gt;;<br />
<br />
Did you do those steps?<br />
<br />
Also, I'm pretty sure ora8_admin6.1 will work if you have oracle_service_name: in your db_resource file and or ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME in your environment. <br />

Dave, thanks for your clarification.  It now makes more sense.<br />
<br />
So, it's more like this? (according to my steps above)<br />
1.  create db user<br />
2.  create os user<br />
3.  Link baan user to db user<br />
4.  link baan user to os user<br />
<br />
OK, now I'm looking for this db_resource file.  Thanks.  I would have thought that it'd be in the same folder as the ora_users file, or in baan/bse/bin or baan/bse/lib somewhere but alas, grep to the rescue, it is in /baan/bse/lib/defaults</div></div><hr />

You can find the file in $BSE/lib/defaults/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">17th November 2009, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really confused now.<br />
<br />
There are no examples!<br />
<br />
Also, when I search for the knowledge base U7155CUS, I get an SQL error on the site.<br />
<br />
I am referencing this solution ID:  152685 ... It is so far the best documentation that I can find, but it still doesn't tell me what to do .... I would really like an example ... why is the example blank?<br />
<br />
In porting sets 6.1c.05.02 there is a new concept of oracle_client_home(ref. Appendix C of U7155CUS) . Typically if $BSE/bin/ora_update (ref. to solution 15219) is run then this parameter get set to $BSE/lib/ora/oracle_home in the db_resource file and a directory $BSE/lib/ora/oracle_home gets created with oracle client libraries (compatible with oracle driver) .<br />
Now, if sqlnet is being used to connect to oracle database (i.e. in $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1 file has TWO_TASK set) then TNS_ADMIN=&lt;location of tnsnames.ora file&gt;must be set in the $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1 file(or in session ttaad4110m000 and Convert to RTDD).<br />
However ora8_maint6.1 does not read the tabledef6.1 file. It reads the oracle env parameters from unix env and db_resource file. So you have to set TNS_ADMIN and TWO_TASK in the unix env while running ora8_maint6.1.<br />
You can also set two_task or oracle_service_name and oracle_local_template in the db_resource file to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE(S):<br />

WORK-AROUND:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">17th November 2009, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a standard template that baan support uses (solution description, example, etc.), they're not required to create an example, and sometimes it doesn't make sense (to the solution writer) to do so.<br />
<br />
All of the actual docs for baan are available via the document search which is a different area on the site than knowledge base.<br />
<br />
Look for the oracle driver manual for baan 4, that will explain all of the OS level files.<br />
<br />
the db_resource setting is just oracle_service_name:&lt;servicename&gt;<br />
that's all lower case, and with a colon.<br />
<br />
Oracle has 2 ways of handling SQL*Net connections, TWO_TASK (old oracle8 style) and SERVICE_NAME ( new oracle 9 style)<br />
<br />
if your system is setup for two_task then service_name may not work.<br />
<br />
if that's the case you can try two_task: in your db_resource as well.<br />
<br />
When you try this know that once you set this, if it's not correct, you may not be able to connect to Baan until you undo it. so better to try on a test box or off hours.<br />
