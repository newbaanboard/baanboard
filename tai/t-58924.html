<br />
We have a setup of BaaN IV and we need to migrate to LN 6.<br />
OS Win2k3, SQL server 2003 DB.<br />
<br />
I want to transfer master tables only let's say Item master data and as I have seen Item master data structure is modified now in LN from BaaN IV, ie structures, number of tables etc.<br />
<br />
My query is how this activity can be done?<br />
<br />
As far as I have studied on this, we have 2 options, Exchange or Migration tools.<br />
<br />
Which approach will be better to use in this case?<br />
<br />
Also, in case of Exchange, how would we handle tables of LN as compared to BaaN IV.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanman_2</div><div class="date">11th August 2010, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Thepal, in the instance of the Item Master (IV) -&gt; General Item Data and sub entities in Ln, you will have to go through the field mapping exercise and default settings, then extract the data into the format required.<br />
<br />
Exchange or scripts (dal, FS)  can be used for the import - which ever you prefer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">searocket</div><div class="date">16th August 2010, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor have a migration tool A2LN that handles all the master data.<br />
We have used that from our legacy system (MK - similar to Baan III/IV). I would recommend using this over Exchange. <br />
A2LN handles the multiple tables pretty well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm Senior Migration Consultant at the Infor Migration Department.<br />
You can use either our BaanIV4-LN conversion tool or the already mentioned A2LN tool.<br />
The advance of the B4-Ln tool is that you can directly migrate the B4-data to ERPLN in one flow. The advance of the A2LN tool is that you will be more flexible which data you want to migrate to LN even though the B4-LN tool have also possibilities to skip data, or recode data!<br />
Infor has experienced migration consultants to advice you the best and smoothest way to bring the BaanIV data over to ERP LN.<br />
When you want to contact me for more info please don't hesitate to contact me or one of my colleagues at kees.hasselman@infor.com or mobile: +31 6 542 26 267.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaotto</div><div class="date">10th September 2010, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">This is actually a seperate tool that is only available for Infor Consultants and occasionally available to 3rd party contractors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khasselm</div><div class="date">11th September 2010, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Arnulfo, when you need more information please do not hesitate to contact me on kees.hasselman@infor.com.<br />
The sources are only available for Infor Consultants and indeed occasionally 3rd parties. <br />
But the A2LN database is available to customers as well! They can popultate them. With the SCA Engine they can dump the dtaa from the A2LN database and load them in LN. However for instance to customizing the rules and logic an Infor Consutlant is needed.</div></div><hr />
