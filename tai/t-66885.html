<br />
I installed ERPLN in Windows cluster, now I have to finish my installation and I am not sure how to do it. What I need to do is:<br />
- installation of ODM vault server<br />
- setup Office integration<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any experience about setting ODM and OI in cluster environment.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I guess ODM Installation will not be an issue as it works on the concept of IP address &amp; Machine Name. You can always follow ODM Installation Guide and get it done.<br />
<br />
Not sure about Office integration.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion I have to install ODM vault server on both servers in cluster, Vault area has to be located on cluster disk.<br />
For OI I will do something similar: will install Infor Integration on both servers, file with components has to be located on cluster disk.<br />

I remember I had some issues in Document Review process due to the Vault Server placed on my DR. For time being I decided to go for automated Backups but I guess there were some solutions required for that to work correctly. You can go ahead and create 2 separate VS and make sure if everything is good.</div></div><hr />
