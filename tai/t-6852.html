<br />
We have a new server with a new OS HP Unix ver 11.00 <br />
The Oracle instance and data is already on the new server<br />
<br />
My two options are:<br />
<br />
1) copy over the BaanIVb2 application and dict / re-liscense and install new porting set.  Then upgrade to BaanIVc4 and use the supplied data conversion tools for the new table structures in c4.<br />
<br />
2) Install the BaanIVc4 new install, migrate the custom comps from the old server to the new server. How do you resolve the data issue ? the data that is present via Oracle would not map to the data definitions in c4 ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is the prefered option 1 or 2 ? And how would you resolve the data definition issue in option 2 ?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

You said you are on a new server, there is no need to bring all you old garbage over.<br />
<br />
There are many different ways to bring the data over.  We have done this numerous time for customers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">25th September 2002, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">There are correction programs that have to be run when converting from IVb to IVc. (The data dictionary of the integration tables changed in a matter that makes this necessary.) There is a more or less defined standard procedure on how to do such a migration. I think letting this do a consulting company which has done it before i(nstead of trying to do it yourself for the fiorst time) would be the safer way here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use a fresh install of Baan IV c4 and migrate the data is the best option<br />
We have do this for a migration BaanIV c2 ==&gt; BaanIV c4 but the principle should be the same<br />
<br />
a) create a temporary package combination in c4 (TEMPB2)<br />
b) this create a data dictionnary (in $BSE/dict/ddTEMPB2)<br />
c) copy in this library the b2 dictionnary<br />
d) create the company defintion and attach it to this temporary package combination<br />
e) install a copy of your b2 data<br />
f) you should also have your package combination in c4 (LIVE,OPER what you want)<br />
g) change company VRC from temporary package to this c4 package ==&gt; this should reorganize your tables<br />
h) don't forget to read the migration stuff done by baan. AFAIK ther are some finance tables that need to be empty.<br />
i) test and when all is ok redo the same with your live data<br />
<br />
