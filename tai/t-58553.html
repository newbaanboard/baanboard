Currently we are on Baan 5c and are on Oracle 10.  However we are planning to go to BAAN ERP LN and SQL Server 2008.  so wanted to find if anyone has any experience with it and also wanted to know if anyone can cite some advantages and disadvantages of Oracle V/S SQL Server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">3rd June 2010, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I just finished a new install, data migration, and implementation for a customer on Windows 2008/SQL 2008 in January.  No problems whatsoever with SQL 2008; I think there's still some work to do to get everything to work correctly with Windows 2008 as far as permissions go.<br />
<br />
Oracle is typically considered more appropriate for larger installs.  It typically performs better in high transaction/high use environments.  However, SQL is coming into its own as an enterprise class RDBMS with 2008.  At this point, I typically recommend that customers go with the DB that fits their internal staff and strategic direction more than for particular strengths/weaknesses of the particular product.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps...<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
We have recently gone live with ERPLn (FP2) and using SQL 2008 standard edition and dont find any issues. The advance of SQL Server 2008 over Oracle is you can create very good reports in SQL Server 2008 reporting services and deploy the reports centrally. You can not only create reports but completely build BI solution on top of ERPLn database.<br />
<br />
Also it is easy to adminitrate as compared to Oracle.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
for the same amount of money you need to spend on the unix box, oracle license and consultancy charges, you can basically get an even more powerful machine for your sql and out perform oracle.<br />
<br />
sorry to say but unix platform are slowly fading. I started with baan/unix and can tell you in recent years most new sites that i encounter uses win/sql, only a handful still choose hp/orc or ibm/orc.<br />
<br />
go for unix only if your company have the budget to spend or existingly you have technical guys with unix/oracle knowledge.</div></div><hr />
