    We have a problem in providing different data format for our european users without creating/linking new language.  There was one possibility to avoid creating new language(in unix), but that one is not useful for us as we are on Windows Server.  Therefore we have decided to take the pain of creating/maintaining a new language and copy all existing components to new language.  <br />
<br />
     Before I proceed for that I thought I could get help from baan support to do that.  But when I contacted baan, interesting response I got from them is they never created new language and they dont know the steps for creating new language!<br />
<br />
    Now I am really confused and I am looking for help if anyone has ever done this kind of process of creating a new language and copying components to new language. All this pain is just to provide different data format, and if you have any other alternate solution I appreciate it most!<br />
<br />
thanks &amp; regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmbarr</div><div class="date">18th September 2002, 00:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We have created a new language because our European facilities needed the date format to be DD-MM-YYYY rather than YYYY-MM-DD.  We created a new language for only a date format change and copied all components to it.<br />
<br />
To do this, we set up a new language code using session ttaad1110m000 Maintain Languages with the required date format.<br />
<br />
Next using session ttadv6200m000 we copied all components, standard VRC, update VRC and customized VRC, to the new language.  To copy standard components and tools you must have set the ability to modify standard descriptions using session ttadv0106m000 'Change Authorization to Translate'.  Baan support provided the necessary password.<br />
<br />
Once complete, we created runtime and assigned users the newly created language.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to copy text to the new language, also.<br />
<br />
Hope this is helpful.</div></div><hr />

In sessions ttadv4171m000, ttadv4172m000, ttadv4175m000, ttadv4176m000, ttadv0151m000 and ttadv0160m000 press button »Special« or CTRL Z in ba6.1 for copying and button Special or Y for creating DD. After that check files $BSE/lib/dtopt2 and $BSE/lib/dtoptx (x is language code for new language in Baan).</div></div><hr />

<br />
      I followed all your instructions for creating a new Language - Chinese as per the above posts. However when I logged in to BaaN you can't see anything, no Menu, nothing!. I did enable simplified chinese on my PC but still nothing!<br />
<br />
Any help?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because you created a new language does not mean that Baan will &quot;install&quot; the language or do the translation of the existing languages to what you have created.<br />
You need to do the translation yourself, minimum is to copy the software components linked to an existinmg language to see them at least on that language.<br />
And if you are on english, or similar, and decide to create chinese and simply change your language to that it will not work on either case... this is too specific (multibyte).</div></div><hr />
