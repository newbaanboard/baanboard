<br />
We have a customer who has an issue with her ibm 2380 printer, the problem is with the gear train. As a replacement we tested a 2391 using the same report, print driver, and paper type. We now get a premature carriage return, and three of the lines are wrapping. We tried an Epson FX 980, and LX-1050, same thing, we used the default epson_fx driver that ships with the porting set. We have been playing with the escape codes trying to increase the margins etc, on all three of the printers with no luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated! <br />

Disable the queue, print the report and check in the spooler directory the file that is going to print. In that way you can determine if the problem is in Baan or that the printer itself is giving problems. <br />
<br />
Make sure that you have defined the printer in Unix as a simple text printer, it shouldn't do any formatting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kimmda1</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for quick reply, our UNIX printer/queue is passive and the printer is set to direct print. I printed the checks to a laser and the format came out correctly so I had already assumed that the problem was with the driver. It also prints fine on the IBM 2380 dot matrix, but not the Epson's or the later model IBM (Lexmark), it also formats correctly to an ascif file.  The initialize string in our driver is pretty simple, reset printer, set to 12 cpi, use US character set. Perhaps I need to set the page, font size etc first like you normally do on the laser printers.</div></div><hr />
