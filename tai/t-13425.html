See the following thread, as example: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1773&amp;highlight=error+514<br />
That error is because your user is not properly linked to the DB user, review the steps that were used to create the user, something was missed.<br />
<br />
Also, your version of Baan is the Baan Client (BW GUI), not the Baan server version - check with your Baan sys. admin. (?)</div></div><hr />
