Don't be bother about the backp of individual items in different VRCs, take the backup of your $BSE directory and backup of all your data from SQL. if you have all these, you can establish your environment again. I have done this but with little problem, trying to resolve this. <br />

You are creating a dump of company 000 to D:\dumps, this is not the $BSE directory. Just make sure that your backup software backs up both the $BSE and D:\dumps<br />
I would preffer to go for the non Baan export but thru a database export/backup way (but all depends on what backup options you have).</div></div><hr />

- Don't put seprator in 000 company backup.<br />
- $BSE folder contains all software components of BaaN as well as object of sessions, reports etc. Please also take care about dict infomation, if dict folder under the $BSE then take simple backup of $BSE folder (included subfolders) by any utility.<br />
<br />
Hope above information help you.<br />

<br />
If you need the entire baan application then it is better to store the $BSE except for the temp folder on the DAT monthly.<br />
<br />
In case you do a sequential dump of 000 company you amy not get all the objects (compiled versions) of the components. So you can store the entire $BSE for full backup. And if you need backup of customised sessions you can backup all the developing sessions and its respective components through the session ttiex1280m000<br />
<br />
Hope this help you.</div></div><hr />
