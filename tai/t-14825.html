<br />
We are running BaaN IV c4 with sp13 on win nt 4.<br />
<br />
Some of the clients have win 98, and the rest of the system has Win XP .<br />
<br />
Now whenever the user is looging into the windows network using a win admin login , he is able to right click on the be bw print file generated through device type 'WP' and change the fonts, or increase the font size , but if the user logins into win xp as a normal Windows network user , at that time on bw these options are disabled.<br />
<br />
I am using BW68, and also tried BW 72.<br />
<br />
does anyone else faced the same sort of problem ???<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
If you want to give users access, you must make changes to the security permissions* using regedt32.exe when logged on as adminstrator. Locate HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Baan and give full privileges to Users. This should solve the issue.<br />
<br />
To figure out what privileges are being used download and use Regmon from http://www.sysinternals.com website.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">18th February 2005, 03:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I have this same situation on my W2K and XP machines now.  User set as resticted cannot apply user defined fonts.  I made the reghacks, and now have the ability to change the font definition, but it doesn't stick.  When I run the session for PO or such again, all of my font changes are back to the default.<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
