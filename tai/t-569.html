<br />
Please enlighten me as to what an &quot;object&quot; is<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Commandeur</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">An object is a &quot;compiled&quot; baan program. It works on the virtual baan machine. It is the same concept than for Java. You can compare a baan object to a java class.<br />
<br />
A baan object is no dependant of the server OS. So you can take an object from an NT serveur and put it on an Unix server and it works very well (according you use the same version of baan).<br />
<br />
Once again, exactly like java.</div></div><hr />

It's all in a name. Some people would call each file under $BSE/application an 'object'. However I believe to be more correct you can talk of 2 types of objects: report objects and session objects (both start with the letter 'o'). The 'objects' are the runtime versions of the source scripts and reports. Likewise you have form sources + forum dumps etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">A session on itself does not exist. A session is composed by several Baan components.<br />
<br />
An object in Baan is what you get when you compile a Baan component (or by other words, all that is compiled - not dumped!):<br />
- scripts (program / libraries) + includes<br />
- reports<br />
<br />
From this ones you have (what I call the &quot;real&quot; ones) objects (p-code), the compiled scripts, and the &quot;other&quot; objects, the compiled report.</div></div><hr />

You are right. I should not have used the term 'session' as such :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me see if I've got this right. <br />
<br />
If I have written a program script and then compile I get an object, if I write a report and compile I get an object. Do both of theses go into the same object? i.e. osls4102 could hold a compiled report and a compiles program script.</div></div><hr />

No they are 2 different objects. Consider your $BSE/application/tdB40_c4 directory for instance:<br />
<br />
Checking on tdsls4404 objects:<br />
<br />
./otdsls/osls4404 ----------&gt; program object<br />
./otdsls1/osls4404010001 ---&gt; report objects for language 1<br />
./otdsls1/osls4404020001<br />
./otdsls1/osls4404030001<br />
./otdsls2/osls4404010002 ---&gt; report objects for language 2<br />
./otdsls2/osls4404020002<br />
./otdsls2/osls4404030002<br />
./otdsls3/osls4404010003 ---&gt; report objects for language 3<br />
./otdsls3/osls4404020003<br />
./otdsls3/osls4404030003<br />
./otdsls4/osls4404010004 ---&gt; report objects for language 4<br />
./otdsls4/osls4404020004<br />
./otdsls4/osls4404030004</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 11:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's safe to say that I now understand what an object is.<br />
<br />
So would the logic be that a Baan session will call an object which in turn will call the program script\report contained within its compiled form?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">To finalise this &quot;object&quot;, I'll just add the following:<br />
<br />
- Compiled scripts are not language dependent.<br />
- Compiled reports are language dependent. <br />
<br />
You notice what is what by looking at the directory (using Patrick's example):<br />
<br />
./otdsls/    - no number, contains language independent, compiled scripts!<br />
./otdsls1/  - with language number, contains compiled reports for language 1<br />
./otdsls2/  - compiled reports for lang. 2<br />
./otdsls3/  - compiled reports for lang. 3<br />
./otdsls4/  - compiled reports for lang. 4<br />
<br />
A session must have an object (compiled script), but only has a report object if it is a print session type. So the answer to your last question is yes :)</div></div><hr />
