<br />
we try to distribute the BaaN-GUI version B40c.63 on our Citrix MetaFrame XP servers running Windows 2000 Server SP4.<br />
<br />
The users now can use BaaN on their Citrix sessions but they complain about some issues on this constellation:<br />
<br />
 * BW's performance on Citrix is not so good as on Windows Workstations<br />
 * Graphical scopes appear wired (border-lines are missing or disturbed)<br />
 * Close-Button not responding or very lazy<br />
<br />
The users also told me that sometimes an inactive BaaN-window in the background scrolls if the user scrolls with the mouse on an active window which lays over the inactive window but I'm not sure if this is Citrix related.<br />
<br />
Has anybody heard of such issues with BW on Citrix or is there something special I have to consider running BW on Citrix MF?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
  Frank</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankn</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We've also tried a 7.x version but had the same issues with that new version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Try running the Baan application with default 256 color resolution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankn</div><div class="date">13th July 2004, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Steve, thanks for your hint but running BW with 256 colors is not possible on our environment because the lotus notes client needs more than 256 colors and we're publishing the whole desktop to thin clients.<br />
<br />
are there many advantages for BW with 256 colors instead of more?<br />
<br />

<br />
also tried this options and also tried some of the ica-client options (bitmap cache for example) but the performance is always the same.<br />
<br />
did you get improvements with speed screen?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">13th July 2004, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">We had problems with our colors until we made this specific application start with 256 color scheme. Other appls use higher colors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankn</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">do your users access a whole windows desktop over ica or the applications directly?<br />
I don't know how to change color-settings for just one app if the desktop is published (don't think that it is possible) and that is what we're doing ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">it is not generally recommended but yoy can from a published desktop publish a seamless app you could set this to 256 colours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankn</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Darren, thanks for that hint I also thought about that option but I really don't think that the performance will improve with that - but no matter what I think we'll try it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">what is the overall performance using citrix like, I work for an asp we publish syteline 7 erp and outlook over citrix and for our larger customers 30+ users we placed expand units in our datacentre and customer site. they provide quality of service and compression http://www.expand.com/solutions/sbc.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankn</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">all users we now have on our farm are connected over LAN with 100 MBit, expand units seem to be usefull on WAN connections (btw: isn't ica optimized itself for slow connections?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I just noticed that you say you use lotus notes, there are some problems with running notes on citrix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankn</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Darren, we installed Lotus Notes 6.03 with Citrix IMS and an MSI file, but in general the installation and configuration seems to be the same as you described in your document.<br />
<br />
do you have performance issues with Notes on Citrix? I thought of background-images in Notes which takes a lot of the ICA-bandwith but I'm not sure if the Notes &quot;Theme&quot; can be changed (IBM-support wouldn't like it) ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">We publish specific apps, not the whole desktop. One of the apps is the whole desktop. One is Baan. One is Sys*Admiral. Etc. Separate colrs scheme for each if desired. This may not help your situation.</div></div><hr />
