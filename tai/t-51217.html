APAC Baan is only in English, let me check how they handle local languages.</div></div><hr />

Chapter 15 Language Support<br />
Language support introduction<br />
This section describes the language support capabilities of Infor Enterprise Server and the corresponding administrator tasks.<br />
This section includes the following:<br />
▪ Character sets ▪ Conversions ▪ Language Translation Support (LTS) Character sets<br />
A character set is a set of alphabetic or other characters used to construct the words and other elementary units of (a) native language(s).<br />
During the installation of the Infor ERP LN application you must choose a character set. So only one character set applies for the whole ERP LN environment. Therefore only those languages can be stored which are supported by the character set that was chosen. You can choose the following character set types:<br />
▪ single byte character sets ▪ multi-byte character sets ▪ Unicode character set<br />
<br />
Chapter 16 Multilanguage Application Data<br />
Multilanguage Application Data<br />
Overview<br />
When your ERP LN system uses the Unicode character set, you can run multiple languages of the ERP LN software, such as Chinese, English, and French in one ERP LN environment. Also, you can enable ERP LN to store shared application data in multiple languages. This is useful if users from all over the globe are using the same environment. Depending on the user’s software language, the application data can also be displayed in the same language. If a report for a business partner is printed, the layout and data of the report are in the business partner’s language. To do this, you must configure Multilanguage Fields Support. For details, refer<br />
to the following section.<br />
Note<br />
You can only configure Multilanguage Fields Support for fields of the Multibyte String data type.<br />
To support all languages available for ERP LN in one environment, you must install ERP LN in Unicode mode. Unicode is the standard for multilanguage support and provides a unique code for each character regardless of the language.</div></div><hr />
