The ideal situation would be that your client system is also a UNIX system. Since it's not you will not special software to emulate an X-server on your windows PC's, e.g. Reflection X.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check with your Sys. Admin. for help on how to setup the server side, but teh actions to do will be:<br />
- the Xwindows server needs to be started on PC<br />
- a telnet still needs to be done to the server<br />
- an export of the display has to be done to the IP address of the PC from the telnet session - tricky if the PC uses DHCP (IP keeps changing) or the user can work on another PCs<br />
- then the bx6.1 is started<br />
<br />
(this can be fully automated thru a batch file on the PC and the .profile of the user that does the display export and runs the bx6.1)</div></div><hr />
