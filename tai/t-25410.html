<br />
Does anyone have installed SP17 in Baan ERP 5.0c ?<br />
We have some problems in Baan ERP 5.0c (we have insatlled SP10 and many solutions for FAM, GRNI, etc)<br />
<br />
Currently we faced several problems such as corrupted inventory, wrong standard cost used integration transaction lines (it made our inventory amount in GL different from session 'Perform inventory valuation'), and some other problems.<br />
We are considering to installed SP17. Really need your suggestions.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

 Best scenario would have been that you guys did stabilise the system before going live some time ago and only afterwards install SP10 (which destabilised the system). Then my suggestion would be to uninstall all the additional solution/patch installations in order to get back to the last stable system<br />
 You guys went live on SP10 which you found out now to be unstable. This scenario stinks. You'd have no other option than trying to stabilise the system by installing solutions/patches until BaanERP stabilises<br />
 You're still in implementation. Then just install the latest service pack and simulate to find out how stable the system is. For every bug found during simulation (should be sim 2), download the solution for it from BS, or contact BS if there isn't any solution available yet<br />
