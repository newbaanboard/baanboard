<br />
We wanted to stop all users, except the system admin in Baan, from logging into Baan while we are doing some maintenance activities in the Server. I would like to know if there is a way to stop all users from logging in to Baan system and when the maintenance activity is complete, to let all users to login. <br />
<br />
We used to do this by changing the parameter in one of the Baan related files in the server, but I have forgotten the same. Can someone please help on this. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Then you just need to change the client you are using to access the system to use the same bshell value you changed to in the ipc_info file.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply and now I remember how we were doing it in Windows OS. At present we have Unix and we use the Putty to login where we have the console (ascii mode) to login to Baan. In this scenario, changing the ipc_info is fine and we could do it, but how can we change the client bshell in this ascii mode. Please let me know. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Hello John,<br />
<br />
modify the ipc_info file in $BSE/lib like :<br />
<br />
bshell.LOCK     s    0    0  p  ${BSE}/bin/bshell6.1<br />
<br />
on UX shell type :<br />
<br />
DS_AS = bshell.LOCK<br />
export DS_AS<br />
<br />
ba6.1<br />
<br />
All ASCII interface user are blocked, but with DS_AS the application will work for the user who knows.<br />
<br />
<br />
To block the Windows client from loggin i use :<br />
(I use bshell.bw on client configuration to separate ASCII and BW interface to the application)<br />
<br />
bshell.bw.LOCK  s    0    0  p  ${BSE}/bin/bshell.new<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
