<br />
:mad: <br />
<br />
Has anyone installed SSA ERP LN 6.1 on <br />
Windows Server 2003(Sp1)  and  SQL Server 2000(SP4)?<br />
<br />
I get the CDs as follows: <br />
<br />
SSA Enterprise Server 8.2 CDs;<br />
SSA ERP 6.1 Including FP2;<br />
Language Packs for SSA ERP LN 6.1 Including SP1<br />
<br />
According to the SSA Installation guide, I installed SSA License Manage 2.4 first successfully. <br />
<br />
A problem occured when I installed the Porting Set 7.6b, it says:&quot;An error occured during the database configuration.&quot; And Porting Set couldn't be instaaled.<br />
<br />
I can verify:<br />
1. my database is already on<br />
2. I can connect using any SQL client using user sa with the correct  password e.g. query analyzer, etc.<br />
3. the locale that I select in the installation wizard is already correct, e.g. you select multi byte instead of single byte, etc (English - single byte, Chinese - multi byte).<br />
<br />
Thanks a million and could you please to give me some advice?</div></div><hr />

A typical one will set the wrong collation and sort order.  Look at the installation document for more detail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did choose custom instead of typical.<br />
<br />
This problem has puzzled me for 3 days. <br />
<br />
By the way both my os and SQL are in simplified Chinese. Is this the reason??<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onceuponatime</div><div class="date">8th November 2006, 11:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Choose custom installation for database (sql). Choose binary sort order. When selecting the porting set and other drivers during installation, make sure you choose the driver that suits your OS. If you follow this and the guidelines in the installation docs, you should not have a problem.</div></div><hr />
