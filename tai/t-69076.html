<br />
I believe this is due to High Ascii data present in the source version. You need to avoid using High-ASCII data with 10.4 as LNUI is XML based and won't be handling it. Another way is to try using high_ascii_tolerence=1<br />
<br />
The reason is moving data from non-unicode to unicode environment.<br />
<br />
Also refer this link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=59527)<br />
<br />
But again, it will be problematic if you use HIGH ASCII characters with 10.4 unless Infor releases their latest version of LNUI where I guess it will be fixed. (LN UI 11.3.1)<br />
<br />
Also, have a look at this standard document for Infor Enterprise Server Unicode Migration Guide(U8887)</div></div><hr />

This looks like a functional issue and not technical. You need to define a default number group in Sales Order Parameters(tdsls0500m400).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats the bdbpost and bdbpre command which you gave?<br />
<br />
<br />
From what i can gather, you have created the dumps on a system with High ASCII Character Tolerance enabled and you are trying to import it in a system which does not tolerate it..<br />
<br />
So try creating the dump with High ASCII Character Tolerance = 0 and then try to import it.</div></div><hr />

High Ascii Tolerance<br />
Important!<br />
The following only applies to LN environments that do not run in Unicode mode. You must set the high_ascii_tolerance resource to 0 in the following situations:<br />
▪ If your LN environment is a production environment and you plan to convert the environment to Unicode.<br />
▪ If your LN environment is a development environment and you plan to deliver software components or translations. If high_ascii_tolerance is not set to 0, problems will occur when the delivered components are imported in Unicode environments. To set high_ascii_tolerance to 0, add the following line in the $BSE/lib/defaults/all file:<br />
high_ascii_tolerance:0</div></div><hr />
