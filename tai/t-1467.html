<br />
Now we want to create another company B ( Existing Production company is A ), link it to the same package combo as production, and this new company is for spanish users.<br />
<br />
Does the bw display server handle this spanish conversion, How would I see the application and data in spanish when the spanish users login to company B.<br />
<br />
I am sure there are users using spanish language, any help is appreciated.<br />

<br />
I think you have to install first the spanish language. Ask the Baan Support for installation CDs. <br />
<br />
Then you switch the user to the spanish language, and will see everything in the browser in spanish. <br />
<br />
Be careful sometimes you might see only ???? or nothing, then the form do not exist in the spanish language, and you have to copy it to spanish. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps, but I am not a tools specialist. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">22nd March 2002, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you must first install the components for the Spanish language which I believe is language 5 in BaanIV. Only then your users will be able to see forms and menus in the Spanish language. Juli is also right about missing forms for Spanish as it is a B-language and software updates are always done for A-languages first.</div></div><hr />
