Error number 1604 (EREFUPDATE) indicates that a reference could not be updated. Probably you have customised table(s) whose referencing needs checking.<br />

We are loading BaaN afresh and do not have any customised tables. We are running &quot;create tables&quot; after loading SP3.<br />

   Oh, OK, then probably you'd want to check whether the reconfiguration of tables went on successfully (ttadv5215m000 on B5c. I don't actually know your Baan version). If it did, then restart your Baan client by exiting your Baan client and logging back in to test. However, if you're loading SP on live server (which I assume you're not), you might have to restart the Baan services (in the server), not just the client<br />

We are working on BaaN IV c4 on a test server. We installed SP3 and then ran reconfigure session . While running this session we got Error 506 (table does not exist). So we created a company and tried to create the tables when we got error 1604. This problem comes after creating some tables.<br />
<br />
We have tried re starting the server and trying to create again but face the same problem.<br />
<br />
Is it a problem of server space ??. We have enough space on the server but are not sure whether enough space is allocated for oracle database particularly the system tablespace which is showing usage of 99%.<br />
<br />
Pls suggest.<br />

<br />
Did you write down what table is missing as indicated by the error 506? Could it be a Tools table (ttzzz999 pattern)? Sometimes, as service pack is installed some new Tools table need to be created manually, and such need would be written in the SP manual. If such Tools tables hasn't been created yet then some of basic Baan functionalities can't work well. Just remember that if you have to create Tools tables manually, you'd have to do it on company 000.<br />

Unfortunately I'm unfamiliar with Oracle. But I think if you allocate space in Oracle for Baan at the size recommended by the installation manual, then it shouldn't be a problem. Especially since you just started loading the B4 system up.<br />

<br />
The problem was solved by increasing the server space for systemfiles. Thanks for the help.<br />
