<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">3rd July 2007, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question about defining the BSE on the client in the BWC file.  We currently have ours setup as d:\baan and are wondering how or if we can use no drive letter.  I've tried several iterations with no luck.  I've consulted with others who have UNIX systems and they have used just slashes like \servername\baandirectory or /servername/baandirectory.  Again, I've tried this with no luck.  Is this a limitation with running in Windows?<br />

Thanks - NikkiZ</div></div><hr />

baan is the directory on the server.  So \\servername\baan\baan with baan being the local directory?  doesn't work  D:\baan is pointing to the baan directory on the server correct?  every time I change the d:\  I get <br />
<br />
1: recv() failed: error 0<br />
2: rexec failed host 'servername' port 512, username 'myusername'. <br />
Failure  executing ipc_boot binary in &quot;whatever i've put in as the path&quot; <br />
3: Error: bw failed  to connect  to servername!bshell<br />

in my BW messages window</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd July 2007, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually what I was thinking was about mapped drives.  So for example - we have a common directory on our server on the comm volume.  So to map to this I would use \\myserver\comm\common.  So I would look at how D is mapped and use that in the bse. So if D: is mapped to \\servername\baan then d:\baan would actually be like you mentioned \\servername\baan\baan.  In all honesty I do not know if this would work in the windows environment it just seems to make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you want to do this? What is the benefit?<br />
<br />
The BSE is the path of the installation on the Baan server. On Unix servers there are no drive letters, so naturally the path is something like /baan/bse/..., on Windows servers you use drive letters.<br />
<br />
If you now use a UNC convention like \\baanserver\baanshare\bse, then this might even work, but you will create most likely some additional network traffic, make the whole baan installation slower and gain .... nothing!<br />
<br />
If you think, this will allow you in the future to easily move the baan instalation from one drive to the other, then you are wrong. The bse path is hard coded in several config file in $BSE/lib, so you will need to change all these also.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">3rd July 2007, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for your informative reply.  That was exactly my thinking because we are going to be upgrading Baan and there is a possiblity it will be on a different drive letter.  Either way we'd have to make the drive letter change or the change to the UNC path.<br />
<br />
I will stop spending time on this and move on.  Thanks again for your thoughts.<br />
