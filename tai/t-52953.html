<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">8th July 2008, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Here goes my setup<br />
<br />
Co. 000 Package Comb - STANDARD<br />
Co. 800 Package Comb - DEVELOPMENT<br />
<br />
I have created 2 customized tables in Development Package Combination which is attached to co. 800 , which is fine. I am able to store data in these 2 tables as well.<br />
<br />
TABLES<br />
tccom910<br />
tccom911<br />
<br />
Now i would like to create these tables in Co. 000, so i went into GTM and was able to create tccom910, but when i try to create table tccom911 via GTM in Co. 000 it gives me Error 512 and closes.<br />
<br />
I know error 512 would come when the definition does not match with the table structure, but i checked the definition in DEVELOPMENT Package Combination its perfect, and moreover if definition wouuld have been a issue how did it allow me to create both the tables in 800 Co. ??<br />
<br />
Any hints/ suggestions what i should be doing to create the second table in co. 000 by getting rid of error 512 ? <br />
<br />
Waiting for your replies.<br />

Also why would you want to create these custom tables in company 000.  In general only tools tables (tt) are created for company 000.</div></div><hr />

Well I changed my user package comb. to STANDARD , n then i tried creating table via GTM but then it says &quot;Definition not found&quot; infact for both the tables.... i am wondering how this would have worked, because table def. lies in cust vrc which is attached to DEVELOP Package Comb. , so in any case STANDARD package combo. cannot access the table def present in cust vrc. or in other words the VRC structure for STANDARD Package Comb. will not contain my dev vrc where table def. resides. May be i am wrong in my explanation since it allows me to create standard table like tccom100 etc all the standard tables in 000 co.<br />
<br />
2. Does the Package Combination (thus the package VRC) contain the new table definition?<br />
Yaah my DEVELOPMENT package Combination contains dev vrc which contains the table def. that's how i was able to create table in 800 Co.<br />
<br />
*Also why would you want to create these custom tables in company 000. In general only tools tables (tt) are created for company 000.<br />
We normally refresh this 800 co. every 2 months or so, and the data which we have maintained in these 2 tables, we don't want to losse while refreshing data from Production, so to avoid doing mistake i though of creating these 2 tables in 000 co. and share it with my 800 Co., so that during data refresh i don't loose data present in these 2 tables.<br />

<br />
You are correct here.  So it should not work.  <br />
<br />
What you have to remember with companies, users, and package combinations is a triangle:  Each point of a triangle is one of the following:  Company, users, Package Combination (sesion, table def, objects, etc).  And they all have to equal each other(99% of the time).  If they don't you will get different types of errors/messages from Baan.  <br />
<br />
You have company 000 in &quot;Standard&quot;, User in &quot;Develop&quot;, and the Package Combination in &quot;Develop&quot;.  So with this structure in the triangle analogy, won't work.<br />
<br />
There are probably a couple of different ways you can go about to get this to work.<br />
1.  Create the 2 tables in a different Oracle SID. (I think I saw that you are Oracle)<br />
2.  Create the 2 tables in a different company # in the same Package Combination.<br />
3.  Just remember to restore these tables.  If static, just have a backup copy of them.  If dynamic, then create a script or job to bdbpre the tables on a frequent basis.</div></div><hr />
