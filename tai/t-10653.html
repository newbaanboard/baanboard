<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Everyone,<br />
We are getting following error in NT event log- <br />
<br />
203 (The system could not find the environment<br />
<br />
option that was entered.)<br />
Errno	 0<br />
bdberrno	 0<br />
Message	 No free slot for process with pid 7339, Handle 0 found<br />
<br />
I obeved that number of processes attached to Shared memory were 8192. The error goes away if we reboot the server or restarts the shared memory. I did a small test on the system during weekend. Following was my test<br />
1. Re Started shared memory<br />
2. No Baan user or session running<br />
3. I observed there were 6 processes attached to shared memory. This I saw in Shared memory manager.<br />
4. Logged into Baan<br />
5. The shared memory process increased to 7<br />
6. Open a Baan session- &quot;Maintain Purchase Order&quot;. The number of attached <br />
process in shared memory became 9.<br />
7. CLose the session. It reduces by 1 (and not by 2). So the process became 8<br />
8. Logged out of Baan. The prcocess became 7. So there was one process still atached to shared memory. <br />
<br />
Is system supposed to behave in this way? What is happening is that after the number of attached processes exceeds 8192 we started getting the Shared memory error. The rebooting does resolve the issue, but I am curious to know if there <br />
is any reason for such behavior.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

When you closed the session not all of these processes disappeared from the list of NT processes.  That is why the link to SHM still exists.<br />
<br />
 I think this is OK, but not perfect since a lot of memory is wasted. <br />
<br />
 Anyway, when the user disconnects, do you come back to 6 ? This is really important !</div></div><hr />

The number of processes didn't return back to 6. That was my concern. Since, there are always hanging processes left, it builds up over a period of time.<br />

<br />
 You may consider a Porting Set Upgrade in order to solve the problem.</div></div><hr />
