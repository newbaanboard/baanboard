<br />
Can someone please let me know what these two tools are?<br />
<br />
bdb_pre and bdb_post<br />
<br />
Is there any documentation anyone has on them? I want to know about them in detail. <br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
good choice to learn about these programs :-:<br />
bdbpre dumps tables to ascifiles, bdbpost does the exact opposit, reading files into tables.<br />
Just enter bdbpre6.1 -U or bdbpost6.1 -U to see the parameters. (Make sure that your environment parameters $BSE and $BSE_TMP are set correctly)<br />
BTW, the sessions &quot;Create sequential dump of table&quot; and &quot;Create table from seq. dump&quot; do use these programs.<br />
<br />

I was wondering did someone ever document it at all..something like pdf/doc. I guess these are pretty sensitive tools to handle and you can easily screw up if you are not careful. <br />
<br />
I was wondering if a bdb_pre on a table truncates (removes all records from) a table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just relax - bdbpre doesn't alter the table, it just dumps it. <br />
With bdbpost you have to be carefull indeed, make your first steps in demo companies with this tool.<br />
AFAIK bdbpre locks a table while dumping it, so try small tables first if you want to dump tables currently in use. Most often made mistake with bdbpre is ommiting the package combination or specifying a wrong one. There are 3 ways to create outputfiles: the first is what I call &quot;bigdump&quot;, meaning that a dump of several tables will be stored in one ascii file (including the data description, which is pretty handy). Second is creating seperate seq. files for each table with a field delimiter.<br />
bdbpre6.1 -t&quot;|&quot; -o/home/mydir -Ntiitm001 -pB40C4cxxx -C222 will create /home/mydir/ttiitm001222.S if the PC for company 222 is B40Cc4xxx.<br />
The third way is quite like the 2nd, but fixed field length is used .... never used that one :-)  <br />
Generally: bdbpre can't really do harm, bdbpost was built to populate tables and should only be used after a decent backup (which bdbpre provides :-)<br />

Rajesh, <br />
You have to be careful with the options for bdbpre and bdbpost.<br />
$ bdbpre6.2 -U<br />
 -E file: Redirects informations to file<br />
 -I : File with table names<br />
 -K/-k : Backup/Drop table after creating dump<br />
$ bdbpost6.2 -U<br />
 -A : Append rows (skip duplicates) or Create new table<br />
 -a : Show total of duplicates. This option is only effective in combination with the -A option.<br />
      Note that when using this option performance will be decreased.<br />
 -K/-k : Backup/Drop existing table<br />
 -R : Append rows (replace and show total duplicates) or Create new table<br />
<br />

The bdbpre can drop the table after the dump.<br />
The backup option is not supported for all Baan Versions. Here is more info from Baan Support.<br />
MR Reference:  8.5a  MR Priority:   <br />
Resolution:  Comments from development:<br />
The backup function is not supported in Baan 5 and newer. In Baan IV it is supported but for Bisam databases only. It does a simple copy of Bisam files.<br />
For backups you need to use bdbpre binary.<br />
We will remove the backup option from bdbpost usage list in next portingset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">11th May 2008, 02:24</div></div><div class="posttext">nprao is right -<br />
because I never used the -k option while dumping I didn't realize that bdbpre could ever be dangerous.<br />
Hoping that no damage has been done, I promise to post more carefully in the future.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless for me bdbpre and bdbpost are the most important tools in Baan.<br />
Sorry<br />

I'm dont really have the need for it. But I just simply want to know the unknown or little known. So if all you guys out there want to write and write and write about this topic please keep writing in this post. More so as there is no documentation available for this. <br />
