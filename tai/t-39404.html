<br />
We are looking to migrate our Baan IVc4 system from HPUX to Red Hat Linux and I'm after suggestions as to the best way forward. I was thinking that I could take a full system backup (Baan/Oracle) of the HPUX server and restore to the Linux server. However, there is a complication in that we are running Oracle 9i on HPUX and we will be running Oracle 10G on Linux. I also want to make sure we don't copy years worth of rubbish across. I then thought of doing a new install of Baan IVc4 and migrate the data across. I could take table dumps and import into new system. Not sure how I would take tools data across?? But then I've tried doing a fresh install on a test Linux server and the Baan install scripts just don't work. Also what would be the best way to move our customisations across? <br />
<br />
So my question is - If you were doing this how would you do it?<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to lots of great suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
the steps required are actually pretty straight forward and I have done myself this a couple of times.<br />
<br />
First of all, forget a new installation, since this is actually too much work and it is unlikely you will end up with exactly the same patch level etc.<br />
<br />
Second forget about restoring your oracle data files from HPux to Linux, since they are not binary compatible, even if you stick to the same oracle version.<br />
<br />
So what you need to do is the following:<br />
<br />
a) Copy your baan installation from your HPux box to your Linux box. Keep if possible the BSE path the same, otherwiese you will need to do adjust several config files and baan tables later.<br />
<br />
b) Replace the portingset of HP-Ux with the one of Linux<br />
<br />
c) Install Orlacle 10 on Linux new<br />
<br />
d) Create a suitable Oracle instance, again at best keeping the ORACLE_SID the same<br />
<br />
e) Create user baan and role r_baan within this instance manually<br />
<br />
f) Export all data of schema baan with oracle exp and import it with oracle imp on linux.<br />
<br />
Now you are more or less done, apart from some manual topics, like revalidation etc.<br />
<br />
But that's roughly the way to go.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Markus</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must admit I was expecting a hard time with this but you make it sound easy. I'll give that a try.<br />
<br />
When you say 'copy your Baan installation' is that literally copying /baan to /baan on Linux and as you say make the $BSE path the same?<br />
<br />
I'll let you know how I get on.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
actually Baan is very well suitable for this, as really only the porting set is platform dependent. I did similar things for customers to move them from Sinix to HP, from HP to Linux, from HP to Windows and back. The trick is to keep as many things as possible the same.<br />
<br />
You might face some licensing and other minor configuration issues, which are difficult to predict and depending on your current setup.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">20th July 2007, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Han is right here. This is due to some inconsistency in the Baan (including BaanIVc4) validation, where Linux must be explicitely validated as a platform, but no othe rplatform must be.<br />
<br />
So as Han said, add the entry in the iex table on your old system before migrating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although Oracle's IMP/EXP is fast, I would recommend to use BaaN seq. dump and then rebuild.<br />

<br />
exp/imp of oracle is platform neutral and to a certain degree version neutral. Exporting a 9i database on HP-ux and importing into a 10g database on Linux will work.<br />
<br />
Baan sequential dump will naturally always work and the choice is in the end a matter of preference as long as the database is not too large.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess if you use Baan seq. dumps you wouldn't need to manually create the Oracle tablespaces so this could be a benefit. You would obviously need to make sure your ora_storage is configured exactly how you want it.<br />
<br />
With regards to the Linux validation issue we already have the appropiate solution on our HPUX box so hopefully we won't have any problems on this point.<br />

<br />
No...Seq. Dump can not make Tablespaces / Datafiles. You have to create it manually.<br />
<br />
Benefits of Seq. Dump. are: <br />
1. You can decide which tables you would like to import at the time of import.<br />
2. Speed can be increased using ARRAY<br />
3. Its BaaN's baby, so Append/Overwrite/Delete and contraints can be possible.<br />

<br />
When you refer to ARRAY are you talking about  'ORA_MAX_ARRAY_INSERT' ?<br />
<br />

Yes, you are right. It is ORA_MAX_ARRAY_INSERT.<br />

<br />
I've copied my /baan over, installed the latest porting set and duplicated the Oracle instance.<br />
<br />
The Linux server I've tried this on did have version of Baan running with a temporary licence. The licence expired a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
When I start Baan I get an error saying the licence has expired. Is there are way for me to take the system back as if it were a fresh install . This way I can then run Baan in demo licence mode which will give me enough time to test my migration.<br />

   Isnt Configure application run when you put new validation keys? If all that is needed is to get a license to start baan working, shouldnt changing the Licence6.1 to point to your Live Server suffice?<br />

<br />
Right I've renamed the .brand6.1 file and Baan appears to start however, I do get these errors which I think is down to the system not being validated and running in demo mode.<br />

When I try to login via BW I get bdb_errno 7413 (ORA-6413) which I'm presuming is down to the fact that I haven't copied over any tools data yet. If I'm getting this error on login will bdbpost6.1 still work from the command line?</div></div><hr />

6413 googles some hardware issue. Can you check there for info?<br />

Hi SK,<br />

No...whenever I changed licence6.1 and tried accessing tools sessions, I experienced it will be fixed doing 3225m000.<br />

My new problem is now getting Oracle invalid logins during Baan start-up. I've tried resetting the password for the Baan user in Oracle to be the same as that on the server we have copied from. I have also tried to change the passwords using the ora8_admin6.1 but I get 'sys' should be logged in as SYSDBA<br />
