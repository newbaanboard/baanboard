Just to be clear, are you saying that the Item Text that you entered for the first Item in the Purchase Order is being repeated for the rest of the lines in the Purchase order? <br />
If so then..<br />
1) Is this happening for all purchased items or only for the newly created items?<br />
2) Have you done any customization on the Purchase Order report recently? <br />
3) When you created the text for the second and third line of the purchase order, did you by any chance click on &quot;Select&quot; button (from the choice of &quot;Create&quot;, &quot;Duplicate&quot;, Select&quot;) before the editor opened? <br />
3) Did you enter Purchase Text in the Maintain Item Data session while creating these items?<br />
4) Last but not least, Whats the value of the field &quot;Stand. Desc&quot; in Form2 of Purchase Order Lines for all the three items? <br />
 <br />

1) no, this is happening for the newly created items.<br />
2) no, we have not done customization on the Purchase Order report recently<br />
3) no, open text editor insert text and save &amp; Exit. in purchase order line we clice on item the zoom then click on text then select purchase text.<br />
4) no, we have not enter purchase text in maintain items data session. only item description add.<br />
5) &quot;yes&quot; is there Stand. Desc&quot; in Form2 of Purchase Order Lines for all the three items? <br />
<br />

   3) no, open text editor insert text and save &amp; Exit. in purchase order line we clice on item the zoom then click on text then select purchase text.Could you ellaborate on the above. There are three items in your purchase order. Do you add the text in each of the items manually by typing or by selecting? If you are selecting, then where are you selecting the text from and how are you doing it?<br />
