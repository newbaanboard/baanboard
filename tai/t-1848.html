<br />
I am looking out for a product which would close BAAN for all idle sessions.  <br />
<br />
I know a product named &quot;idlewhile&quot; existed at one of my earlier client sites, but it was on an NT platform.  In this, I was able to specify the time parameter.  I was also able to disable all users from logging into BAAN.  The functionality was quite extensive and the product cost was not that expensive too.<br />
<br />
Could you please share your wisdom and your thoughts in identifying a viable product for this problem.<br />
<br />
I appreciate all your input in this regard.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you like to disable the users to log into the system when you doing the maintenance, you just need to modify the <br />
<br />
$BSE/lib/ipcinfo file and rename the bshell to something like new.bshell and add a new entry for only the IS guys like you, as<br />
bshell.is so that you can log into the system and others cannot.</div></div><hr />

I too am looking for a tool that closes idle Baan sessions. <br />
<br />
Somebody pointed me to the following Baan solutions, I haven't had a chance to look at these yet but they may be of interest to you.<br />

<br />
It gives flexibility to differentiate between groups of users and  different timeouts , if you do not mind the admin<br />
<br />
Also saves having to kill users for maintenance jobs when they forget to log out</div></div><hr />

It's also possible to block BaaN for all users exept bsp bij filling the file ${BSE}/blok with the word &quot;baan&quot;.<br />

Sounds like a little scripting was done on your box ;)<br />
<br />
Neat idea though, to have a file with users that are allowed and users or usergroups that are disallowed.<br />
<br />
I'll get on that one.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if it IS standard BaaN-functionality, but anyway, it's not that hard to realize. First you've got to create the directory ${BSE}/blok. In this directory, you create a numer of files: for instance &quot;COMPblok&quot;, &quot;USERblok&quot; and &quot;PCblok&quot;.<br />
Then you have to edit the &quot;bshell6.1&quot;-file:<br />

Then on the configure screen of BW, enter bshell3 to connect.  <br />
Just tells who knews to know.<br />

AS far as the idle process thing, we had our Unix Admins write some scripts to remove all processes over 24 old (unless own by<br />
a particular group of users).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not difficult to kill correctly idle BAAN sessions especially if you use Oracle. You shall use sys view $v_session, write a small script which looks the values of fields username, os_user and min(last_call_et). The timeout depends on your wish.<br />
When min(last_call_et) is 0 it means the os_user does absolutely NOTHING. You can correctly close his pid (calculating his pid you can via awk) with the help of bshcmd. <br />
<br />
Closing Baan you can thru chmod 000 $BSE/bin/bshell6.1 but in this case you must have another bshell just for you in $BSE/lib/ipc_info.<br />

Also be aware you need a recent portingset and tools software to have it run correctly...<br />

Issues with external processes (like import/export on databases) started from sessions have been addressed recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
sometimes some versions of BWclients show that the CPU activity grows although the user doesn't do any active steps. Maybe Windows itself has its own bugs  in this case. So session_timeout may not be the solution in some situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The product we used at BFG was called OST Frontline - that was pretty good actually. Currently I am using a product called CloseIdle. This product however should be installed on each client, I am using a batch script for that. Look me up at Yahoo if you got the chance.</div></div><hr />

Because all the processing is done in Backend, I don't think there will be any problem if we kill the sessions on the Client side.<br />
<br />
I am using this variable (with 10 minutes) from last one year &amp; i never faced a problem. But one thing is you need to have the last porting set.<br />

Process like Rebuild inventory, MRP Run (or) sequential dump for the ful company are successfully completed. <br />
