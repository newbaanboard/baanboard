<br />
I would like to know how the baan shell imports the environment variables from UNIX.<br />
<br />
Where can we change the environment variables which are listed by the env command?<br />
<br />
I am facing a problem on our system now.<br />
<br />
the echo $HOME  returns empty, the $USER name is correct, the $LOGNAME is set to ROOT ( thats security risk, scary) while the $BSE shows  up sometimes and sometimes its NULL too.<br />
<br />
Any information will be helpful...!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">21st November 2001, 13:26</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all I am assuming that you are using BW.<br />
<br />
The environment variables for a Baan user on UNIX can be set in a number of ways:<br />
<br />
1.  As a command line option in the BW client with the <br />
-- -set VARIABLE=VALUE syntax.  For example, you can set the INFPROF environment variable with -- -set INFPROF=0.01.<br />
<br />
2.  In a bshell wrapper.<br />
In this method you either call a different program from the BW client (like bshell.sh) or you change $BSE/lib/ipc_info to call a wrapper script before invoking the bshell6.x executable.  You can then set the environment variables within the wrapper script.<br />
<br />
3.  In tabledef6.x<br />
The environment variables related to the connection string for the database can be set in $BSE/lib/tabledef6.x.  For example the ORACLE_HOME, TWOTASK or INFORMIXDIR are commonly set in the parenthesis that list the driver environment variables.<br />
<br />
4.  And of course, the normal UNIX default  sources.<br />
<br />
Well I could go on but I need to get going to work, so I will check in later...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">21st November 2001, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also put ENV variables in your $BSE/lib/defaults/db_resource file. Just be careful that the usual expression operator must be changed from = to :<br />
<br />
e.g:<br />
<br />
TNS_ADMIN:/etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">25th December 2002, 07:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to share the info, I think this might be valid in our BaaN Version-5.2 I am not sure on other versions.<br />
<br />
It appears there is a way to set environment variables within Baan.<br />
<br />
Create a file $BSE/lib/bse_vars<br />
<br />
Place assignments within the file<br />
<br />
ie.<br />
<br />
BSE_OUT=/app/lms/lms/opt/sy16/bse/edi_out<br />
VAR=/app/lms/lms/var<br />
EDI_IN=/app/lms/lms/edi_in<br />
EDI_OUT=/app/lms/lms/edi_out<br />
etc....<br />
<br />
After the changes are made to the bse_vars file then the bshell has to be bounced/restarted to get the new environment variables to be active/picked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">26th December 2002, 07:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets not forget the $BSE/lib/defaults/bshell and /all files (for BaanERP users only). Also usernames are accepted in the defaults directory. For instance, the file $BSE/lib/defaults/bastard could have environment settings that are specific to me ;)<br />
<br />
It certainly isn't very transparant anymore in the later Baan versions. Does anybody happen to know the exact load order in which all these files are read?<br />
<br />
That would be helpful for future trouble shooting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">27th December 2002, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">There you can use this,... never guessed ... setting:<br />
-- -keeplog -logfile show_file_and_settings -dbgres -dbgfile<br />
<br />
With dbgfile you can see what files are read in what sequence and the set resources will be shown. The last set are the active ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 20:34</div></div><div class="posttext">PRIORITIES<br />
<br />
The following priorities are valid (from highest priority to lowest):<br />
<br />
1) Set as Environment Variable<br />
<br />
2) Set in User file<br />
<br />
3) Set in file $BSE/lib/defaults/bshell (or other name, depending on bshell name)<br />
<br />
4) Set in file $BSE/lib/defaults/all or db_resource<br />
<br />
So, when you set a resource variable in the file $BSE/lib/defaults/all, you can overrule this resource variable by setting the same resource variable as environment variable.<br />
<br />
See Baan Solution 110908 for more details<br />

<br />
I dont think the option-2 is right. I have a note from a BaaN support guy for one of my cases about entries in the $BSE/lib/user/u&lt;user-id&gt; file.<br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge I tried to map the parameters in the<br />
Session to uuser file and please see my comments for the same in the below mail from you with your questions. <br />
As I have been repeatedly impressing upon a User is not supposed to handle or manipulate any part of these system generated files like uuser. <br />
If some one has caused any wiered entries against the standard<br />
procedure I am helpless. <br />
Better drop those users and recreate through standard procedure<br />
only. <br />
I don't advise any corrections in these files. <br />
Please note that the information that I have provided is to the best of my knowledge and belief and I cant authenticate as I do not find anydocumentation to this effect.</div></div><hr />

By the way...NPRao:I don't advise any corrections in these files. I agree on this one, but in the first solutions (implementation phase) regarding session_timeout it was adviced to enter it manually in the ufiles...</div></div><hr />
