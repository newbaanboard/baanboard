<br />
I am getting the error 509 for one perticular user only.<br />
<br />
Recently I have upgraded the porting set to 6.1c.07.01 also upgraded the BW client, tools standard program.<br />
<br />
The error is comming for a user from perticular machine. many times it will come for long time once the machine is restarted.<br />
<br />
I have tried lot of workaround but not able to resolve this.<br />
<br />
The Os is Unix and database is bisam.<br />
<br />
Let me know if anyone can give some clue.<br />
<br />
<br />

If those were updated properly in the servre/clients for all users but that particular user is the only one that still gets the problem, check what he's doing that the others are not, the problem may come from particular sessions or wrong versions of software on his local PC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are also getting this error and have a case pending with Baan support. Our porting set is 6.1c.07.<br />
<br />
We changed our users from Normal to Super. And after that incidence of error 509 has reduced but not eliminated completely.</div></div><hr />
