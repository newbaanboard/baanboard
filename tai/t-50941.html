i have a problem to use bshcmd6.1; i have created a program in BaaN, following the instruction that i find in this forum; now i want to kill a bshell PID, using <br />
<br />
ret = shell(&quot;/appl/B4c4/bse/bin/bshcmd6.1 -e -u1 -w1 &quot; &amp; str$(tccom995.pid), 0)<br />
<br />
But even if I use bsp to run the program, ret = 1 and the Pid is still existing in Unix!<br />
<br />
Have I to use root to execute the program? Or where I did a mistake? Please help me!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

A root user can stop any process with the kill command. If you are not a root<br />
user, you must have initiated the process you want to stop.</div></div><hr />

I know that if you use &quot;kill&quot; from a unix shell you need to be logged in as root, but if bsp use the command: bshcmd6.1?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Refer to the man chmod <br />
           permission  One or more of the following letters:<br />
<br />
                            r    Add or delete the read permission for who.<br />
                            w    Add or delete the write permission for who.<br />
                            x    Add or delete the execute file (search<br />
                                 directory) permission for who.<br />
                            s    Add or delete the set-owner-ID-on-file-<br />
                                 execution or set-group-ID-on-file-execution<br />
                                 permission for who.  Useful only if u or g<br />
                                 is expressed or implied in who.<br />
<br />
You can set the superuser bit id to root and also maintain the sudo list of user who can use it.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
$ ls -l | grep root<br />
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root       bsp         405504 Dec 27 16:27 badmin6.2<br />
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root       bsp         651264 Dec 27 16:27 blogind6.2<br />
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root       bsp          23638 Dec 27 16:27 lp6.2<br />
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root       bsp        4505600 Dec 27 16:27 pdaemon6.2</div></div><hr />
