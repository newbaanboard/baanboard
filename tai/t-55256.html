<br />
When i am trying to change the description of a package vrc, i am getting the message saying &quot;For the following package combination you need to prepare the Data Upgrade engine(ttspt1200m000) for a data upgrade to execute&quot;. The Package combination attached to this vrc is B61apdev. <br />
     When I am running the ttspt1200m000 as simulation on then getting  message&quot;For Companies within selection no upgrade data present or data upgrade already completed successfully&quot;  <br />
     And if simulation check is off then the data upgrade process completed successfully.<br />
<br />
My question is that why we need to do all this thing, initially when i was in different server i was not getting any message like this after changing the vrc description.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Ravi</div></div><hr />
