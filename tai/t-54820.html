<br />
a weird situation has happened to me.<br />
Even we are using DEM for Role authorizations, sometimes we need to define field authorizations to the users according to the management rules.<br />
<br />
We are using PCS Module, so changing the project status from &quot;closed&quot; to &quot;active&quot; is a strict forbidden management rule.<br />
<br />
Therefore we are defining for each user who has the access to the tipcs020 table via session tipcs2101m000, a field authorization.<br />
<br />
But for two users I can not understand why this authorization is not working. I tried to enter it again and again run CRunTime but he is  still able to change the project status from &quot;closed&quot; to &quot;active&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please find the attachment where I put the screenshot. Does anyone has a clue ?<br />
Please help.<br />
Thnx</div></div><hr />

The users are connecting to the system at least every day once.<br />
<br />
Do you have another idea?<br />
<br />
Thank you..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">22nd January 2009, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">When getting down to field and row authorizations, a new file is created in the $BSE/lib/user directory.  I an not sure, but I think it starts with a &quot;p&quot;.  In this file is the authorizations for table and fields. Can you post or send me this file for one of your users.  You could also compare this to one of the other users that does work to see what may be different.  If possible, send or post this file from a user that does work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aysinerten</div><div class="date">22nd January 2009, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I found no file starting with p -  as you mentioned. But some files starting with u.<br />
The user id mi3559 has changed successfully where with the user id sy340 I failed.<br />
I figured out in user data that the only difference is &quot;Password required&quot; field.<br />
I put all of them in attached file..<br />
Thnx..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">22nd January 2009, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The document is empty when opened.<br />
<br />
Other than the &quot;u&quot; file, there should be another file prefixed with another letter for the m3559 user.<br />
Have you checked the permissions on the directory? files?  Are you able to update them.</div></div><hr />
