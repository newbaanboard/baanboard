<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpolnz</div><div class="date">18th July 2012, 23:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - I've recently been given an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus) which I'm trying to get to connect to the LN webtop. However, the browser page on the device just stays blank. It appears to find the LN server login page OK but nothing more. Does anyone have experience of running the Webtop in such an environment? Thanks</div></div><hr />

, and I hope Android and/or iOS is supported then with the newest version of the web server.</div></div><hr />
