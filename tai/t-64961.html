If someone on this forum has some experience with the migration of Production Orders from Baan4 to ERP LN by using Exchange, can share experiences with me. I'll know on what to watch out for. I managed to migrate production orders and restored their statuses in ERP LN up to date . I'm checking the correctness of the data. I migrated tables: tisfc001, tisfc010, ticst001, ticst002, ticpr300, tipcs340. It was hard :)</div></div><hr />
