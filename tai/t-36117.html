<br />
Earlier today I found a document &quot;Quick Guide 1310 for Barcode Printing &amp; BWPrint&quot; in this forum and used it to create barcodes on reports in Baan IVc4NAS0.  <br />
<br />
My issue is that I can see the character codes chr$(27) and chr$(22) are to start the barcode.  The question I have is what are the escape or character codes to stop the barcode?<br />
<br />
I want to have a label print out with several barcodes, however, it seems when I add my second field (barcode) it messes up (overlaps and doesn't appear to really be doing either barcode correctly).  <br />
<br />
Also, I'm looking to see if anyone knows of a type that doesn't have the human readable code under the barcode.  It seems I should be able to toggle that off or on, but it always appears for me.  I'm assuming it's because of the type I selected. (code 39 - type 9)<br />
<br />
Any help or documents that anyone may know of would be greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
