<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">19th May 2005, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
We're having a problem with user defaults by session.<br />
The user is entering values in the fields that she wants to save. The problem is when she clicks on 'Save Defaults' on the session menu, one of the fields goes blank and it does not let her save the defaults for the field.<br />
In the same session, when she tries to save defaults for any other field, there is no problem. The defaults are saved.<br />
I've deleted the user defaults for this session and tried to save defaults again and we get the same behavior.  <br />
There are two users that have this problem. All other users can save defaults.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas about what might be going on here?<br />
Can anyone point me in the right direction as to what to check with the user account or session defaults?<br />
<br />
Thanks for help.</div></div><hr />

The field she was trying to enter and save was a date field. She was entering it in the wrong format and Baan didn't like it and blanked it out. <br />
Mystery solved.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
