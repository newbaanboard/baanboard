I want to export just user and rights from one LN- Server (FP5) to another (FP8). In BaanIV there were ttconf6.1export and ttconf6.1import. But this doesn't exist in ERPLN anymore. How to accomplish this task now? Should I export and import table dumps and then run create RDD for users and rights? And what tables are this exactly? I dont want to miss any ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What kind of Authorization do you use? DEM or Role Auth?<br />
<br />
Also, if you are looking forward to take table dumps, you will need a lot of tables which depends on the number of tables you have used i.e. Table Auth by Table, Session auth by session, table data auth.. etc. So, that can be a tedious task which can also lead to inconsistencies. <br />
<br />
You will need to study all the tables before taking dumps. <br />
<br />
There is a similar KB # 1177956 for an enhancement, but I guess it has not been implemented yer. The KB will give you list of role data tables. But again, it can vary on requirements. So, take care of that. In case if there is any standard way, I would like to know it as well. AFAIK, you will need to do a customization.<br />
<br />
And, in the KB 1004158, they have mentioned, ttcon61import/export is not available in LN. Also, they have given the list of tables to import. I hope that serves your task. <br />

<br />
thank you for the quick and exact answer.<br />
I did search the KB but couldn't find that entry.<br />
<br />
So for Infor I would think it is time to react (any Infor tech reading this post ?  ;)  ).<br />
<br />
Our authorizations are role based. I found the same tables as in the KB- Entry. So I will do it manually.<br />
