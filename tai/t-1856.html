<br />
We have just gone live with the BaaN-5.2 and going to get the PMC tool. <br />
<br />
I think many of you have already been using the PMC tool. I would like to know more details/issues/limitations etc about the PMC.<br />
<br />
I also have a question if the PMC tool can handle domains/tables migrations from environment/server to another ? and do we need to do that runtime for them or does the pmc tool handles it.<br />
<br />
Right now we are doing the export/import process for the software components to be migrated from one environment to another. Is there any method by which we can do it much faster and in our process when we import components, we loose the older version, is there any way we can keep the older version  or copy the revisions of the software components.<br />
<br />
your comments and information is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I am sure alot of people see PMC solely as a means to do patch management but it should have or could be expanded to, to do what you asked for. I don't know if PMC in BaanERP 5.2 is substantially different from PMC in BaanIV/BaanERP. My guess is that at the moment your best remains the comination of export/import DD and VRC layers to control software versions.</div></div><hr />

I am reviewing the PMC and trying to come up with a procedure that I can use effectively with time and effort.<br />
<br />
I am planing to build some tools if possible which might help us out.<br />
<br />
I have one specific question -<br />
<br />
Can the PMC tool can handle domains/tables migrations from environment/server to another ? and do we need to do that runtime for them or does the pmc tool handles it. <br />
<br />
The PMC documents shows some examples related to mostly scripts stuff but nothing related to table/domain changes.</div></div><hr />

I am not expert enough on PMC to answer your specific questions. Though PMC can carry all types of objects across to other systems, I see the dependancy chain and pre-requisites as a major problem, especially because PMC does not know the concept of 'superseding obejcts'. However the most recent PMC improvement seems to be addressing that problem somewhat and also answers the question when and where a CRDD is necessary. The CRDD in itself is still not automatic as far as I know.<br />
<br />
See this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=961) for more information on the latest PMC stuff.</div></div><hr />

Simple answer: No.<br />
No even the new PMC tool (see the Baan website) does that automatically, the creations of RTDD for domains/tables will always be left as a manual operation (many may require users to be logged off of a PC, so it will be always like that, don't expect changes).</div></div><hr />
