<br />
I have 2 co. let's say 100 and 200<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Master of 100 co. - 5000 Records<br />
Item Master of 200 co. - 2000 Records<br />
<br />
Above scene without Table sharing .....<br />
<br />
******************<br />
<br />
Now i do the table sharing of Item Master<br />
<br />
and tcibd001.item of 200 points to 100 co., so my logical co. is 200 and physical co. is 100, after i do convert to runtime &amp; re-login i can see my item master of 200 co. showing me 5000 records becaude of table sharing<br />
<br />
************<br />
<br />
Now i remove the table sharing and do convert to Runtime and relogin.<br />
<br />
so how item master of 200 co. shows me back 2000 records, ideally there should be a data loss of initial table sharing. Am i wrong ? If yes, then when the data loss can occur in case of table sharing ?<br />

<br />
I think the problem you have, is that you must migrate the two item masters to one table before you share it. eg.: you migrate item master from co.200 to co.100 now you have a table in co.100 with all records and you could share this table with co.200. But if you only share the table without migrating you get the problem that you use in your logical co.200 the item master of co.100 and the physically item master of co.200 is only not in use. The table still exist but without a link to a physically or logical company.<br />

oops it seems that u misunderstood my question a little bit .... basically i don't want to merge the data of both the comapnies ... I was just doing R&amp;D with table sharing, and this idea came to me as to what will happen on de-sharing the table.<br />

<br />
Why would you ever want to lose data?<br />
<br />
keep in mind what table sharing is - when you setup a logical<br />
table - it updates the $BSE/lib/compnr6.x file to point table A company<br />
X to table A company Y. That's all...<br />
<br />
it doesn't affect the database at all. in the database there is still<br />
tableAcompanyX and tableAcompanyY<br />

Well i did this just to test out the implications of table sharing / de-sharing , in case if it is done in wrong manner as the first post suggests.<br />

You keep refering to your first post.. but it doesn't make sense to me..<br />
<br />
<br />
******************<br />
<br />
Now i do the table sharing of Item Master<br />
<br />
and tcibd001.item of 200 points to 100 co., so my logical co. is 200 and<br />
<br />
Here is the first part that doesn't make sense. you can't point a field in a table to another company. That's impossible. It's either the whole table or nothing..<br />
<br />
<br />
physical co. is 100, after i do convert to runtime &amp; re-login i can see my item master of 200 co. showing me 5000 records becaude of table sharing<br />
<br />
Exactly. (baan now always substitutes 100 when it sees 200 for this table) <br />
<br />
<br />
so how item master of 200 co. shows me back 2000 records, ideally there<br />
should be a data loss of initial table sharing. <br />
<br />
I think this is the key point of your question, but the typos make it difficult to comprehend.. Are you asking why, when you turn off table sharing, you get 2000 records back in your 200 company? If so - then I believe I've answered your question in my previous post... If not, please clarify!<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Fine, Thanks for the same. Well that table.field was a typing mistake, i meant to say table only.<br />
<br />
Thanks, anyways.<br />
