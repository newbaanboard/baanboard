<br />
I would think that this is not an ongoing, repetitive task.  Also, since it is the development environment, and (hopefully) you trust your external partner, why not give them superuser rights?  I would refuse to work for a customer if they don't allow me to use the &quot;bsp&quot; account to import customizations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you have many Unix boxes running various systems and where Baan is just one of the softwares and Unix Dept would not let you have shell out rights, Dev environment is running on service guard and would switch to live boxes when resources not available. and found many violation from developers in certain cases.I have tried many time trusting and letting the developers as super users and removed the shell out option from them. Also given Samba access to Unix folders.<br />
<br />
When developers cannot justify unix access when file system access to Unix is available,the systems dept would not let you jump in their to trust etc.. <br />
<br />
It is the policy and not a matter of trust. Where down time is expensive to business. I may lose my job if I cannot repair the damage.<br />
<br />
Please if you know anything about these authorisation let me know.<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they are developping in the machine, then there's no need to import software. If they develop in another box and dumps must be imported, then or a super user does the task or then scripts can be prepared to ease the imports, and these can be controled/run under a super user account.</div></div><hr />
