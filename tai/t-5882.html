<br />
(1) When I click on &quot;continue&quot; in session &quot;Activate Job&quot;, the status changes to &quot;Waiting&quot; and this session hangs indefinitely on my screen. I leave it overnight and discover the ffg morning that my job did not execute as scheduled.<br />
<br />
(2) In session &quot;Maintain Job Data&quot;, the status is &quot;Free&quot;, I go to unix prompt and enter the command rc.startjob &quot;myJob&quot;. The status remains &quot;Free&quot; and my job would not execute still.<br />
<br />
what could be wrong?  - thanks in advance:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">19th July 2002, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">What version of Baan are you on, moroni? I have never seen a session activate job, I only know it as a command in job data, so I suspect you are on one of the newer releases.<br />
<br />
Never the less, let me try to shed some light on this.<br />
<br />
(1) The job status switches to waiting _after_ execution of the job when the 'Job waiting after execution' flag is checked in job data. I have never found the purpose of this option, maybe somebody else can explain that one.<br />
What do you use to kick-off your job? When using the job daemon, the status of the job needs to be set to queued. When using cron or another scheduler, the job status need to be 'free'.<br />
<br />
(2) Check the file rc.startjoberr in your tmp directory. That might give you some indication of what's wrong. if the file has not been (re)created, check the ownership of the file. If your account cannot overwrite that file, it will prevent rc.startjob from successful execution.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Your remarks regarding rc.startjob really helped.<br />
<br />
I just have one clarification. Will my job execute: (1) if there is no more available user license (&quot;maximum users reached&quot;)?, (2) I am not logged in to baan?</div></div><hr />

Another tip for you if the, scripts attached to your sessions might be compiled in debuggers so it expects someone to click continue to proceed further.<br />
<br />
you can use the bshell or the ba options like nodebug...<br />
<br />
<br />
bshell6.2 -nodebug -server -set BSE_COMPNR=910 -set PACKAGE_COMB=b52astg ozmadmtest<br />
<br />
<br />
and if you are in the older baan releases you might try this -<br />
<br />
ba6.2 -- -nodebug ozmadmtest 2&gt;${BSE_LOG}/test.log.$$ <br />
|* invoking a 3-GL script as a background process<br />
<br />
ba6.2 -- -nodebug ttaad5203m000<br />
|* activate the job session</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">20th July 2002, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me think here...<br />
<br />
On 5b (and earlier versions), the job daemon uses ba6.x, rc.startjob uses a bshell (or is it the other way around? I always forget). ba6.2 does not consume a 'heavy' license, although during my latest licensing round with Baan, they told me that Baan no longer distinguishes between light and heavy users. (ba vs bshell).<br />
<br />
If you are out of licenses, and your execution method requires one, the job will not execute.<br />
<br />
You do not have to be logged in while executing a job (come to think of it, if you have restricted multiple logins and your job execution method uses an account that is logged in already then this might be another reason for faillure).<br />
rc.startjob will go through the regular channels (ipc_info -&gt; startscript -&gt; bshell) to establish a connection.</div></div><hr />
