<br />
I'm doing a migration from an Informix DB to an Oracle DB in a new server.<br />
<br />
Asked Baan for a new key with Oracle8 active (besides Informix). Validated the old server.<br />
(Had to run ocorora8 in order to activate the business function).<br />
Validation went OK.<br />
<br />
After copying the baan directory to the new server and migrating company 000 to Oracle in the new server, I'm getting:<br />
<br />
error 515: license error; probably unpatched binary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: licence6.1 file in the new server is pointing to the old server<br />
<br />
<br />
I've done this kind of work before. The only new thing is activating the oracle8 driver...Is there something I missed after running ocorora8?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot <br />
Fred</div></div><hr />

Perhaps the key Baan sent me is wrong? But in that case I would not have been able to run Validate and Configure application with the Oracle8 checkbox active...Or would I?<br />

<br />
Just got confirmation that Validation key from Baan is OK...As I suspected.<br />
<br />
Looking at the event viewer, discovered that the binary that has the licence error is ora8_srv.exe:<br />
<br />
Env	 xxx_env (e:\baan)<br />
Prog	 ora8_srv file \db\lib\dbs\dbs_server.c # 744<br />
Keyword	 licence<br />
Username	 baan	type S	language P<br />
Process	 0xa24<br />
Lasterror	 0<br />
Errno	 0<br />
bdberrno	 0<br />
Message	 Object not licenced<br />
<br />
Is there any way to patch the object manually (at leat until the problem is solved?)<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Fred</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmorais</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 01:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi again,<br />
<br />
I seem to be talking alone but, here is the latest info about this problem.<br />
<br />
I discovered the strangest thing:<br />
<br />
Asked Baan for a new key with Oracle8 active (besides Informix). Validated the old server.<br />
(Had to run ocorora8 in order to activate the business function).<br />
Validation went OK.<br />
----------<br />
I tried removing the checkbox from t062-Oracle8 and runninge validate and configure application. Validation also went OK ?!?!?!<br />
-----------<br />
It seems that although I ran ocorora8 program, the sessions above are still not validating (and patching) ora8_srv.exe. Has anybody seen this? Do I need to do something else in order to activate Oracle8 ? <br />
<br />
Somebody please Help....<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Fred</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmorais</div><div class="date">24th July 2006, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't seem to remember what I did then to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
If you activate Oracle8 in the old server, get a new key and validate it, and export company 000 to the new server, it should work, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Please keep me posted.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
