<br />
We do have a live - BaaN IV System with 2 Servers, 1 for all the Users and 1 for the Database, for the international offices, the web shop and edi... <br />
All the development takes place at the Database server. Normally I can do all the programming at the database server including the testing in &quot;real live&quot;. But for the latest project it is not possible to test in the live environment because some of the users (international and edi) are affected. Everything would be live without testing. I can remember having both, development and live system on one server (8 years ago) with 2 different sources, in 2 different companies.  Does anyone know how to have 2 different source releases on one system, one for testing and one for the live system?<br />
<br />
Thank you  for  your  help, Thomas</div></div><hr />

<br />
You create a higher-level VRC with your custom components and attach a test company to that VRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">17th January 2005, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">When the components are tested, how can you go down the components to the lower VRC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">17th January 2005, 19:29</div></div><div class="posttext">When testing is completed, you promote your custom components to VRC that has your production company attached to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">17th January 2005, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you explain me what it meens &quot;promote&quot;? <br />
<br />
I have this structure:<br />
    B50b --&gt; B50_prod ---&gt; B50_dev<br />
<br />
All my users are in B50_prod and me in B50_dev. If I have my components in B50_dev, I have to &quot;copy to current VRC&quot; or there is something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">17th January 2005, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">You will need to expand your VRC structure, at least to include a customization layer.<br />
<br />
Then moving the onjects can be done by creating patches (preferred) or copying them to the customization layer.<br />
<br />
Do some searching on the board and you'll surely find some good pointers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I can remember having 2 different VRC structures, I am not quite sure if it is necessary to work in 2 different companies, one for development and one for the live system? <br />
