I'm having a problem with job daemon taking a lot of memory (HP/UX 11):<br />

<br />
Total memory consumption of daemon is around 270MB. Server side oracle process is missing from this list.<br />
Baan is IVc4 SP8. 3-tier setup. Is there any other way than down/up  to &quot;clean&quot; it? Seems like it will get mixed up every night.<br />
<br />
Porting set:Portingset  : 6.1c.06.02<br />
I can't make &quot;bshcmd6.1 -m pid&quot; to work. It gives nothing as result.</div></div><hr />

I have found that if you shut them down and start them back up everyday it seems to help a great deal.  But you still run the risk of them hanging.  Personally I like cron it runs when it supposed to and I have never had a problem with it.</div></div><hr />

About the memory, you have to know that a bshell or session can free it's memory however that will never be given back to the OS. So the actual use can be less.<br />
This means that one single session that needs much memory can cause this problem. Probably you can sort that out.<br />
<br />
The other thing that can happen is that a session needs a lot of small memory blocks, later on it frees them however because they are small the free blocks can't be used by other sessions.<br />
<br />
The 270Mb doesn't need to be in main memory. If it ain't used anymore it's probably paged out. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: as long as the system is running fine it doesn't have to be a problem. It will be a problem if it eats all you swap memory.<br />
