However, it's pretty slow... what can be done to improve performance of launching sessions/etc ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">12th June 2003, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">To run a sort of daemon server on the remote win2k box, to launch sessions on the hpux box. Works now, but running the menu browser, launching sessions, etc is pretty slow. Would like to know if this is normal, or if things can be done to improve performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">12th June 2003, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Running remote needs to copy a lot to the remote system. As you use an HP box. Is it possible to copy (a part of) the application to the HP server? Loading the DD and most frequently used objects in shared memory will also help.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">12th June 2003, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently, all the applications and data dictionary are only on the HPUX/Baan box... you mean to copy the frequently used objects to the Win2k/remote bshell system?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">12th June 2003, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh..  Yes. I was confused. Thought you are working the other way around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">12th June 2003, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... I'll have to think about it and give it a try. I'm not exactly sure where to put them, since the remote bshell doesn't even have an 'application' directory right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">13th June 2003, 00:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. I've enabled Shared Memory using the Baan NT Manager. Had to change the default size from 16mb to something high to make room for 30mb of objects. It took a while for it to load them all.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my remote bshell is starting much faster now, and it seems a bit more stable. Now time will be the real test.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />
