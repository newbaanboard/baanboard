<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamdnb</div><div class="date">14th September 2005, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I am running the session Archive Projects in one of my baan company.  We have to archive total 3 companies.  In two companies I have successfully ran archive projects session.  While in the one company left, when ever I run this session it gives a fatal error stating &quot;can't delete record as references exist on tisfc001, fatal error on db.next(delayed)&quot;.  I have analyzed the data and the reference exists on only two tables i.e. ticst001 and ticst002 which are being handled by the &quot;Archive Projects&quot; session.  The data from these table w.r.t. production order is deleted prior to tisfc001.<br />
<br />
Can someone throw some light on the error being encountered as this is really delaying my project?  :confused: <br />

From there, you can decide on how to fix the data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamdnb</div><div class="date">15th September 2005, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Shah for your valuable comments.  I had already checked log.bshell6.1 &amp; log.oracle.  log.oracle contains no entry for the said error.  I could find the production order by placing the object in debug mode.  There are many such production order that are causing the error 606 and references for those production orders exist only in ticst001 &amp; ticst002 which are being taken care by the session &quot;Archive Projects&quot; only.</div></div><hr />
