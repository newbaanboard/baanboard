<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">25th August 2003, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
We r running BaaN IV c4 on Win NT 4.0 with Oracle 9i (9.2.0.1.0) as database, porting set version is 6.1c.07., service pack till 13.<br />
<br />
I have one test package combination, and i created a new table in that , it successfully got created.<br />
<br />
Now i droped that table using baan , after that i logged out &amp; logged in. Then i went to same test package combination and used session ttadv4120m000 and inserted the same table no. and inserted some fields in that , after that i did convert to runtime and loged out.<br />
<br />
Then i loged in and selected that table tccob002, ad clicked on create table, it said &quot; 0 tables created&quot;.<br />
<br />
I went at O/S level , saw that there are 2 dict file present dtccob002 and dtccob002.expi.<br />
<br />
<br />
When i executed session ttaad4232m000 ( Check table ) and ran this reoprt it said error 512, and then i read description for this error using baan help which says currupt data dictionary.<br />
<br />
Please tell me what should i do ? I don't know why it said that 0 tables created, what is the problem ??<br />
<br />
how can is solve it ??<br />
<br />
I also did convert &amp; create to run time data dictinary.<br />
<br />
Now when i create any new table it allows me to create the table, but if i drop the table and then again re-create the table using same no., it says that &quot;0 table created&quot;<br />
<br />
Kindly let me know what all log files do u require to solve my problem, and what would be the path for these log files ?<br />
<br />
Table defination is shared memory for this package combination is kept as uncheked, so tables for this package combination are not loaded in shared memory.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Did you run the 'Create Runtime DD' also?<br />
After changing a table you have to run:<br />
<br />
'Convert to RDD'<br />
'Create RDD' with check on reconfigure tables.<br />
Get out of baan.<br />
Stop and start the shared memory.<br />
<br />

<br />
If nothing else works, once the the tables are still empty, drop the tables manually using the DB tools and then run 'create RDD' for that table again.<br />

The final solution is to reboot the server. Even stopping and starting the shared memory leaves some parts of the old tabledefinition in memory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you check up the domains of the new fields you have added are present in your test Package VRC or domains  are in the proper hirarchical VRCs . If they are of the different packages other than tc   then check whether Proper Integration with Package VRCs in Pack. Combination for  package 'tc' is made in ttadv1111m000.<br />
<br />
Can you run create RDD for that table by clicking print errors 'yes'.<br />
It may highlight the error.<br />
<br />

<br />
I agree with gerhard. Most likely rebooting your system will clear the problem.<br />
<br />
By the way, this only happens to my knowledge on Baan for Windows. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vaishali_sftdev</div><div class="date">25th August 2008, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone explain in some detail that what exacty causes this error? I saw many posts but still not very clear. The error message in my case was &quot;Probably already reconfigured&quot;. I got it solved by deleting table, changing one or two domains and then recreating table. But what happens at the backstage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">satish_pabathi</div><div class="date">25th August 2008, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I think u have only deleted the table but if u want to create new table with same name you should also delete table definition then only u can create. so try this it will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vaishali_sftdev</div><div class="date">26th August 2008, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it was solved as i wrote in my earlier post. I want to know that why this error occurs. Why CRRD encounter error sometimes? I saw many posts. The error is same and solutions are different. So, at backend what causes this error?</div></div><hr />
