I'm a new member from this site(very pratical), and it's the first time, I'm register on a forum. So first, thanks a lot to all members.<br />
My issue is on BaaN V (I'm new on this version), when I create a baan user, and after I want to create the link for the database (oracle), from the maintain user, I click on specific, to choose menu convert baan user to database user.<br />
Then, I click on convert, and put in the new windows, account and password for database administrator. After validation, I received a baan error message &quot;ttdba01108&quot; : &quot;Database user bsp is not converted to the database. (Baan user bsp is linked to database user bsp)&quot;<br />
For precision, I'm trying to create another user than bsp, there are at the present time several users on this server.<br />
The result is that the new user is only known in table all_users in oracle, but not for baan in $BSE/lib/ora_users !<br />
Curiously, if I do the same action under unix by use &quot;ora8_maint6.2&quot; command to add user, it's working fine.<br />
It will be great if someone could help me. <br />
Sorry for my english, I'm French.  :)</div></div><hr />

I can't understand why you had to create user baan and then to link this user to database. User baan with link to database is created when installation runs. <br />
Anyway try to check authorizations of that user under whom you tried to run those sessions (bshell runs under user, who connects to BaaN, so the permissions it has the same as user of the OS). Probably this user doesnÂ’t have permissions to write to file ora_users.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You've linked Baan user &quot;A&quot; to Database user &quot;bsp&quot; and when you convert<br />
to runtime you get that error message?<br />
<br />
That is becasue the convert to runtime does 2 things <br />
1 it creates the user in the DB<br />
2 it updates the ora_users file<br />
<br />
since &quot;bsp&quot; already exists in Oracle you need to tell that to Baan<br />
you can do this via session ttdba0515m000 select the user and <br />
check the status. I think in your case it is set to &quot;Not Created in RDBMS&quot; <br />
you can then edit the table (maybe ttdba015?) and switch this to created<br />
in rdbms. That would fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Hope this is close to your problem!<br />

I used GTM to modify status in table ttdba015 for this user (bsp).<br />
It was the same case for 2 other users, which have status &quot;not created in RDBMS&quot;. Why, I do not know.<br />
Now, it's working fine, the problem is solved.<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />
