<br />
We have reached almost to the end of our first free nos. for sales orders.<br />
Our finance deptt. prefers increasing the length of sales order series from 6 to 7 instead of archiving.<br />
<br />
Has anyone gone through this before in the Live company. I was told from Baan support that after installing SP15 we can do this.<br />
Would like to hear some experiences.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

<br />
I have previously seen documenation on the support site on which programs need changing.  I think you may also find references on this site if you search.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">26th September 2005, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish you good luck with that new &quot;feature&quot; of Baan. We looked at it, because it would have been very convinient. But we decided to drop the idea. <br />
<br />
My understanding from the documentation is, that Baan did not enlarge the sequences fields of all involved tables. So if you use certain features in Baan, then some tables have references to order numbers, but their fields use different domains and are therefore not increased. <br />
<br />
Additionally the domains/tables to be changed are not delivered as patch and are not installed via PMC. Instead Baan expects you to load them into some customization layer.<br />
<br />
Additionally it has some funny side effects to existing number sequences, so actually you do not get larger number &quot;circles&quot; but more of them. <br />
<br />
Read the documentation carefully and the decide for you specific situation. In my opinion archiving is the correct way to go in most cases. It also has the nice side effect of reducing your life tables and therefore bothz your performance and your backup window benefits.<br />
<br />

<br />
The procedure is simple and works fine, excepts the bugs associated with SP15 . (sales order blocking and purchase back orders)<br />
<br />
If u r using 2 digits series and if the current last no. is in 4 digits then by changing the parameter to 3 digits, your current series will work as it is, rest of the series gets changed to 7 digits.</div></div><hr />
