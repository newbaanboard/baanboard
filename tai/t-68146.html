<br />
Can table sharing between FP7 and 10.4 be done using Database Management and Table Sharing module of Tools? <br />
<br />
Any idea/solution on how this can be done is much appreciated.<br />

<br />
If table structure is same in both package combinations then you can create database script, which will periodically copy data for selected tables from first to second company. I am not sure how it will work and what is risk.<br />
Anyway, you have to organize work in such way that people change selected tables (insert, modify, delete) in one company only, database script will &quot;synchronize&quot; data for second company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe there are table structure changes in FP7 and 10.4 version of LN. Also these 2 versions (FP7 and 10.4) are running on different servers. In this case, can we share table of FP7 with 10.4 or other way round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">16th September 2015, 20:57</div></div><div class="posttext">no. when you go to table sharing session you'll find out immediately that it can't be done. you can probably build a temporary table in your destination machine that will hold the data from your source. then build a LN script that would DAL update your destination table. what i would suggest is by using integration services that runs at regular intervals. your data will not be real-time but workable.</div></div><hr />
