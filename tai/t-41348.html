<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">5th September 2007, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm configuring a new baan server.  I've configured the new instance and have it licensed and running.  I now need to get all of the custom changes I've made to the current server since I've started this task, to the new server.  I've copied all of the components (ex: tdsls folder containing updated version of tdsls4401 report (object)).<br />
How do I get my new installation to see these updated versions?  I've tried a &quot;Create Runtime DD&quot;, but that wasn't it.<br />
<br />
I can't remember how I did this before.<br />
Help!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

It sound like you copied the customizations at the OS level. Did you copy all of Baan, or just the customizations? Did you set up the VRCs in the new install of Baan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">6th September 2007, 04:41</div></div><div class="posttext">i did simply copy the files in the \application folders for sessions that have been modified.  I logged a call with Baan support and they suggested that I export the needed sessions from the production server DD and then import them into the new server.  I'll try this in the morning.  I think that's what I did the last time, it sounds familiar.  Wish me luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">6th September 2007, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Use export DD (ttiex1280m000) to create a dump from the VRC that contains your customisations on the current production server. Dumps need to made per package (tc/td/ti/etc).<br />
<br />
Use import DD (ttiex1285m000) to import the dump on the new server. Import the dumps into a new create &quot;own&quot; VRC on your new server. <br />
<br />
After the import run Create Runtime DataDictionary (ttadv5210m000) for the current package combination.<br />
<br />
Actions preferable exectuted by user bsp ( due prevent permission problems).<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">6th September 2007, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Look on Infor's web site or in the Baan documents for one of their upgrade guides (e.g. the Triton to Baan conversion guide U7025C00.PDF). I know you are not upgrading, but the document has a pretty good description of how to export and import DDs.</div></div><hr />
