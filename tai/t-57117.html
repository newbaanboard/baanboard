<br />
I have a session I need to start each time the server reboots.  I have a .bwc setup and ready to go for this in BECS 8.4b.7 but right now I have to manually go click on this to get it started.  Does anyone know a way to get this .bwc file to start at reboot and include the credentials for LN instead of prompting?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

You can set it up as a job or you can search the forum with keyword &quot;bms_mask&quot; to get the session automatically started for every user? <br />
You have to clarify what does that session do, why does it have to run during startup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erplnjp</div><div class="date">29th October 2009, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for the reply.  Will have to look at upgrading for sure.  On the session part, I will do as you suggest and search the forum. Thought I should include, this is not a session for all users.  It is only a singel session that needs to start any time the server is started.  It is used for our barcoding system (tmboaserver).  I don't like having to have someone remember to start it because inevitibly, they will forget.  <br />
<br />
The session is a type of &quot;bridge&quot; conneciton to the barcoding server.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

You should consider it adding to your custom start baan scripts or as service.</div></div><hr />
