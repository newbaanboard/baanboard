We have installed LN6.1 in our office.  When ever we open any session, by default it opens in the background (minimized) i.e. we need to maximize the session by clicking on the windows start menu bar.  Can anyone suggest where can we set up to make the session to open in the normal window instead of minimized?<br />

It is noted somewhere in the Webtop release notes, if I recall correctly, please have a look at them, I don't know exactly what Windows add on it was.<br />

<br />
A common Windows 2000/XP problem is that when sessions are launched from within Worktop, they appear in back of the Worktop application. This problem is not restricted to Worktop but many applications will show this behavior. The reason is that Windows 2000/XP by default does not allow applications to &quot;steal the focus&quot;. <br />
<br />
To solve this, you may do one of the following:<br />
<br />
1. you can edit the systems registry manually: Open regedit (win2k\xp) or regedt32 (win98), locate the &quot;ForegroundLockTimeout&quot; key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop and set its value to 0.<br />
<br />
2. download the TweakUI application from the Microsoft site. Extract the executable. After extraction, go to that folder and find the &quot;tweakui.inf&quot; file. Right click on this file and select the &quot;Install&quot; option from the context menu. After installation, double click the &quot;Tweak UI&quot; icon located in the Control Panel and go to the tab called &quot;General&quot;. There is a checkbox with the label &quot;Prevent applications from stealing focus&quot;. Uncheck this box.</div></div><hr />
