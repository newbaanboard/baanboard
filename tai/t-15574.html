<br />
IÂ’m facing a big problem, I have started reorganizing the table tfgld106 using the session ttaad4225m000 and it read all the data from the table and created R.tfgld106 file. The problem is records are still not started inserting in to the table back, its just hanging since last 5 hours  :confused: . There are no any errors has recorded in the logs and table has enough extents to be left. Please advice. <br />
<br />
Last line of the log.aad4225 is given below<br />
<br />
<br />
Table          D      Old            New     Messages<br />

Sounds like that table was maybe extremely fragmented, and the database is having a hard time dropping all of the segments.. <br />
<br />
You should see that your smon proces is taking up a lot of CPU..<br />
<br />
if that R file is complete you could kill the bdbreconfig and then run<br />
bdbreconfig6.1 -Ntfgld106099+ <br />
<br />
to get it back in... but that would only be after the DB cleans itself up...<br />
which could take hours or days..<br />

<br />
Killed the bdbreconfig. is it ok if I run bdbreconfig6.1 -Ntfgld106099+ while db cleanup (SMON) is running?<br />

<br />
Yes, it should be ok.. But if its really bad, smon won't stop working long<br />
enough to allow you to do much.. In my case, I ran into an issue<br />
where I could get my data in, but not create indexes.. I had to<br />
create a new index tablespace in order to get them back in..<br />
