We had created some companies earlier for testing purposes. Now we donot want the companies to appear before the user as it makes confusion to them when a big drop down list appears and they are to choose from them. Can we make the un used companies be made hidden?<br />

<br />
There are 2 ways -<br />
<br />
A. Create a role which will have No Authorization to the companies you want and attach that role to the users. Then, you can use table data authorization for ttaad100 table. <br />
<br />
B. Remove the companies.<br />
<br />
1. Delete the tables for the specific company in session 'Delete tables' (ttaad4231m000)<br />
2. If you use Database Bisam, delete the directories for the specific company in session 'Maintain table directories' (ttaad4115m000)<br />
3. Delete the tables for the specific company in session ttaad4111m000.<br />
4. When the specific company uses a specific database definition, delete the database definition for the specific company in session ttaad4110m000  for Baan IV and ttaad4510m000 for ERP LN. Warning: You will have to make sure that no other company uses this database definition.<br />
5. Remove all the references to the old company in User Data in session ttaad2100m000 for Baan IV and session ttaad2500m000 for ERP LN<br />
6. Delete the specific company in session 'Maintain companies' (ttaad1100m000)<br />
7. In the session mentioned previously, select Specific and then Convert to runtime.<br />
