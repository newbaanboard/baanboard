<br />
NT4.0, MS-sql7, BaanIV (no sp)<br />
<br />
My job sequence is below<br />
1. Make the system login user on NT.<br />
2. Make the Baan user thru the session<br />
3. Make the DB user thru the session<br />
4. Use the session, Link between baan users and database users session (ttdba0110m000)<br />
When I make the new one. suddenly the system had been log outed. <br />
So I tried to log in again , but it makes the message below.<br />
&quot;Fatal error : Error 514 (Security error ; probably no permission) on SELECT blabla~~~<br />
<br />
There is no user except 'baan' , but It makes the error 514<br />
<br />
if you have any idea of it , please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously you have all the required permissions, or you wouldn't be able to create the user accounts.<br />
<br />
Now, I seem to remember that a looooooong time ago, I had this brand new Baan IV installation, that had a similar problem, and we actually had to go into the ../lib/user/u* files and fix the DB - Baan connection manually.<br />
<br />
So, my question would be: When you say 'no sp', do you mean that you actually have NO Service Pack installed, or are you just in the blind about what SP is installed?<br />
In the first case, I would suggest updating the configuration first and foremost, then get rid of existing u* files, and try again.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, there is no service pack. <br />
I have to use the some customzed module that was developed on no service pack. So I can't install any sp.<br />
<br />
And I have ask for someting.<br />
- Can I get the detail explain about &quot;updating the configuration first &quot; on your reply?<br />
- Is the trouble occured on NT? <br />
<br />
I will waiting your reply :) <br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
ps : If I can't make the another db-users except &quot;baan&quot;, I will try to link the &quot;baan&quot;user(DB user) for another end user(baan user).</div></div><hr />

We are using another database.<br />
My error was:<br />
&quot;$BSE/lib/&lt;databasename&gt;/&lt;dbname&gt;_users&quot; had no entry for the user.<br />
I Inserted a row for the user(copying an existing row), and he was able to log in.<br />
I hope this is of use for You (replacing the &lt;.*&gt;'s and the /'s where appropriate.<br />
regards :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In case you are, then just try and link the newly created Baan user, with an existing DB user. (i.e. which is already linked to a working Baan user).<br />
If the problem gets solved, then your DB user is not getting the proper permission of the Database.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for reply.<br />
The cause is the different name of DBs.<br />
All the name of DBs have to same.<br />
<br />
In my case, DB name was generated &quot;baandb&quot; automatically.<br />
But the other names, DB Group names and the name of $BSE/lib/db/db_groups file was different with &quot;baandb&quot;<br />
So I changed groups name.<br />
And then, It's working good.:)<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />
