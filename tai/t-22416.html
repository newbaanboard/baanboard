<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patblou</div><div class="date">23rd November 2004, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Folks,<br />
<br />
BaaN ERP5 c<br />
db2 v8.0 fp4<br />
AIX5.2<br />
<br />
BaaN does provide a tool for the user password management - ttstppwdaging. This tool might do it but I really don't like it. First, it prompts the user to enter the new password 4 times.<br />
1) RDBMS new password<br />
2) RDBMS confirmation<br />
3) OS passwd tool new password<br />
4) OS passwd tool confirmation<br />
<br />
This is one issue among many other ones and I believe this is not acceptable as the RDBMS module of BaaN should be totally transparent for the users.<br />
<br />
There are a few options that I was looking at:<br />
1) User linked to a common RDBMS user who's psw never expires.<br />
2) User linked to its own RDBMS user who's psw never expires.<br />
3) ...<br />
<br />
However, any option like those get hit, at some point, by the auditors<br />
1) Users who's password never expires<br />
2) Common DB user password<br />
3) Useless OS user management<br />
4) and more...<br />
<br />
The best scenario is, I beleive, to have the OS/BaaN user be the same than the RDBMS one. However, for this scenario, there is no question I'm gonna use the BaaN password aging tool of BaaN because of the reasons mentionned earlier.<br />
<br />
So I'm trying to build my own psw management tool but facing a few issues. At this point, I was wondering if anyone as developped its own tool and could share his/her experience.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Are you implementing these changes for SOX ? We have implemented the password aging (ttstppwdaging) and it doesnt ask me for any RDBMS change password, it checks only the OS/Unix Password aging. We have atleast 20-25 database per environment and the passwords are all set with no expiration date and the end users do not know it. Our DBAs logins do not have the password expiration too, but the Prod-Control/Deployment team have passwords expiration set to 60-90 days and the DBAs have provided them a Perl/SQL script to globally changed their passwords for all databases. Unless you have any users/developers directly working in the SQL plus you can get away from password expiring in the database.<br />
<br />
You can look up the options for the binary - $BSE/bin/badmin6.2. Make sure you have the latest version, I reported a bug and it was fixed in the latest porting sets. If you are on Unix, also refer to the Standard include &lt;pwd.h&gt; to see the password structures and methods.</div></div><hr />

I Don't know what SOX is?<br />
We're simply moving from BaaN IV to BaaN ERP 5 and I'm trying to best fit the users password management.<br />
<br />
Don't you get prompted with those screens (see attachment)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">23rd November 2004, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I get the 1st session but not the 2nd terminal emulator maybe due to the fact that we dont have database password aging.<br />
<br />
I didnt see any info on the knowledge base on the BaaN Support site about database password changing with the ttstppwaging.<br />
<br />
SOX - you can search on the google for the topic - Sarbanes-Oxley Information Security.</div></div><hr />

In our AS/400 users profile some of our users like Baan, Bspgroup, baancondb etc did set to never expire. So far we dont have any issues. At the time of password changing, we used to get only first screen not terminal emulator.</div></div><hr />
