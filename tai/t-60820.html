<br />
Nothing changes in company data nor in the Package Combination associated with the company.  You can re-run this over and over and its the same each time<br />
<br />
No errors in event viewer - any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">8th December 2012, 09:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Andy, did you solve this problem? I tried to change package combination for one company from FP7 to FP8 and faced the same problem. But in my case is company now in FP8 package combination, tables are not reconfigured, so I have error 512 for almost all tables.<br />
<br />
Can someone help? <br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">17th January 2013, 00:28</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) Say you have existing company 100 at FP7 and you then install FP8 in a new package combination and VRC tree:<br />
<br />
Company 100 attached            |       No companies attached<br />
Package Combination A            |       Package Combination B<br />
FP7                                      |       FP8<br />
dict                                      |      dict<br />
<br />
2) When you switch company company 100 from PkgCmbA to PkgCmbB<br />
<br />
Company 100 attached            |       No companies attached<br />
Package Combination A            |       Package Combination B<br />
FP7                                      |       FP8<br />
dict                                      |      <br />
dict.new  &lt;-- Chg Pkg Cmb for Comp -- dict<br />
(reconfiguration takes place)<br />
<br />
3) After the switch of package combination is done the Companies ttaad100 table will show company 100 field pacc &quot;pkgcmbB&quot; and opac &quot;pkgcmbA&quot;.  If you re-run at this point, nothing will happen because if the company has already been switched according to ttaad100.  If for some reason the switch takes place but the reconfigurations failed, that would result in 512 errors.  You have to determine why they didn't reconfigure.  You could copy all the existing pkgcmbB dict entries to dict.SAVE and copy all the pkgcmbA dict entries into pkgcmbB as dict then run Check Tables to confirm no more 512 errors and then run a CRTDD on pkgcmbB which will use company 000 table definitions and create dict.new entries which should be different now and reconfigure.  Before doing any of this, do backups, do a small test case, make sure you understand, etc.<br />
<br />
No companies attached            |       Company 100 attached<br />
Package Combination A            |       Package Combination B<br />
FP7                                      |       FP8<br />
dict                                      |      dict<br />
(notice dict.new files are gone<br />
as session cleans these up)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To create Package Combination, you will need to understand the Directory Structure first. Also, most important is to understand the naming conventions.<br />
<br />
There is a session in FP7 ttaad1222m000 which can be used to create package combination in easy way.<br />
<br />
For naming convention, you can refer to prog guide else you can refer to this thread:-<br />
