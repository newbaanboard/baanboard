Please post the questions in related forums. Moved the thread to Tools Administration Forum.<br />
<br />
For this, you can use Session Authorization by Session in the Roles and add Sales Orders session with Read only access. Make sure, you select the company. For 100 give No Authorization and for 101 give Display Authorization. Then attach the role to the user.</div></div><hr />

Define the authorizations company wise and seperately</div></div><hr />
