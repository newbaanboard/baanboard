<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">23rd July 2004, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We are getting black window while opening a DEM browser at the beginning of User login through dial up connection. Screen shot enclosed. We are using password aging. Baan said that the message is coming from password aging file few more symptoms of this issue.<br />
1)	We are getting this error only for DEM browser not through Menu browser<br />
2)	We are getting this error only through 56K modem not through broadband connection or LAN or WAN.<br />
After this message our DEM browser opens, this black window is not causing any problem but very inconvenience to users if they are working from home.<br />
<br />
Any one has any idea about this issue?? We are able to narrow down the issue but not able to find the real source of problem. Is it timing issue?? I am not sure. Thanks for your feedback.</div></div><hr />

Thus it gives me a problem while connecting to Baan itself, but I get around this by using a NAT.<br />
<br />
I will try to simulate the problem with DEM on Monday. If you do get a solution by then, do post it.<br />
