<br />
We have a Web Service that starts Baan Sessions. However, the .bwc file that is has to be used has been created with other account from the account that executes the Web Service (ASPNET).<br />
This bwc has been created to remember the password.<br />
<br />
The problem is that in the moment of creating the COM object, it is created the bw.exe process, but we cannot see the window in which log in and set the password. (The passwords it has to been set because the ASPNET user is not the user who created the .bwc file). So, 2 minutes later the bw.exe process dies and the Web Service crahes.<br />
<br />
We have attempt to change the user that executes the Web Service, but no results are obteined. Do you have some idea?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />
