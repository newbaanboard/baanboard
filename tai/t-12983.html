but the problem explained was for Unix machine...<br />
<br />
Now, what I'm facing is in NT 4.0 server...<br />
<br />
could somebody through some light...<br />
<br />
I checked up everything, BSE path, ipc_info path etc...all seem to be correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
please check your ipc_boot on bin directory. it might be missing or was renamed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume your database should also be mentioned in the ipc_info file... but is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the suggestion.<br />
<br />
But, the ipc_info file on $BSE/lib folder appears to have the correct entries...(in my case it shows right database and right path).<br />
<br />
But could not crack this problem out...<br />
<br />
I looked at the event viewer on NT 4.0, it says:<br />
<br />
Env	 Bse ()<br />
Prog	 ipc_boot file \general\nw\ipc_boot.c # 283<br />
Keyword	 user<br />

Lasterror	 203 (The system could not find the environment<br />
<br />
option that was entered.)<br />
Errno	 2 (No such file or directory)<br />
bdberrno	 0<br />

<br />
<br />
Env	 Bse ()<br />
Prog	 ipc_boot file \general\lib\nw_1\IPC_GLOB.C # 717<br />

Lasterror	 3 (The system cannot find the path specified.)<br />
Errno	 2 (No such file or directory)<br />
bdberrno	 0<br />
Message	 Error 2: cannot open ipc_info<br />
<br />
But the point is, everything is defined correctly. BSE &amp; BSE_TMP, I meant the environment variables...<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ?!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Warans</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Actually, the problem was resolved. The installation was attempted on the same machine, where already another baan env. was existing...The current installation was referring the existing 'bse' &amp; 'bse_tmp' environments.<br />
