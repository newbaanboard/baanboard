<br />
Reason is that we have about 400 pc's in the company and not all have the latest version of the bw-client.<br />
I want to find out which ones without going to them all.<br />

thanks for your suggestions.</div></div><hr />

Also refer to the posting - Client Info (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=10001&amp;highlight=client)<br />
<br />
We do have those internal tools and have them setup to run after 15/30 days to collect statistics. But if the user does not log in from a particular desktop for few days/weeks/months, you cannot track the version info. We came up with a new solution with our Desktop Infrastructure Team, who use the Microsoft SMS tools to query every desktop to check for the BaaN Windows, Worktop and DEM versions and generate a report. This report has more real time information, more accurate and get information from the Windows Registry.</div></div><hr />
