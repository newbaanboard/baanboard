Hello,<br />
<br />
In maintain user data (ttaad2100m000) change from SuperUser to NormalUser and assign default company to that user.<br />
<br />
Maintain company authorisation (ttaad2121m000) for that user.<br />
<br />
------<br />
If there's an user with authorisation like the above user (as Normal) you can copy the authorisations between them in &quot;ttaad2100m000&quot;.<br />
<br />
Don't forget CRDD !<br />
<br />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
if you can't copy the authorisation from an existing user, you have to maintain the Modul or Session authorisation for the user with:<br />
<br />
ttaad2130m000, ttaad2131m000 , ttaad2132m000<br />
<br />
Don't forget CRDD<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
seems it is the first time you set up a user in your system ?<br />
<br />
e.g. if the new user &quot;A&quot; is in purchase department and uses the process (Sessions) for purchase, you can copy the authorisation from an existing user in purchase department to user &quot;A&quot;.<br />
So all authorisations for purchase prozess is assigned to user A.<br />
<br />
There is no way to revert it back exept to copy the authorisation from an other user to user &quot;A&quot;.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
strange behavior.<br />
<br />
Is this a installation from scratch ?<br />
<br />
Are you sure, only tt is available for the user?<br />
Are the authorisations for source user working?<br />
<br />
If using &quot;maintain user data&quot; and option copy authorisation between user (from source user to target user) all authorisations would be copied).<br />
Afterwards do a CRDD.<br />
<br />
Or add the missing package (by using the &quot;BUTTERFLY&quot; button).<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
