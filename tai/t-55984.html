The status of the Job is &quot;Running&quot;. Apart from this, all activity of the Job is hidden and nothing is known about the actual activity of the Job. In Windows env., I want to know if there is any log data that displays the current activity. I also need to know if there is any command that can be run from $BSE\bin at any given time during the Job run. If there is any other way, let me know your ideas - Asap.<br />
