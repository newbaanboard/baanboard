What are the various authentication mode you got while installing? Was Mixed Mode part of the choice? If it was, then try using that while installing. Last but no least, Could you connect to the Query Analyzer using your baan user login and create database or do admin tasks such as that...<br />
 <br />
sk<br />
Note: Although i havent installed Ln on a 2000 machine, the instructions shouldnt be any different than that of 2003. It would be a good idea if you read through the Pre-Installation Tasks document of Ln to see if there is any special mention on 2000..</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.I am having service pack 4 of SQL 2000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">23rd October 2007, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems like you have all the pre-requisite settings needed for installing Ln. However as a last attempt, i would look in to the Local Security Policy of the server(you can find this in Administrative Tools). In there, go to Local Policies and inside that expand User Rights Assignment. In the expanded right hand side, check the following policies.<br />
1) Act as Part of the Operating System<br />
2) Log on as a service<br />
3) Log on locally<br />
In the above three policies, add the user &quot;baan&quot;. Apart from that, in Computer Management&gt;&gt;Local Users and Groups, remove the user &quot;baan&quot; from the &quot;User&quot; group and let the username share the exact privilige the user &quot;Administrator&quot; shares in the section &quot;Member of&quot;..<br />

   There is nothing wrong with your combination. I myself for one of my Test Ln installations used the combination you used and it worked fine. Now i am not sure if there is anything wrong in having Baan4 installed on the same server Ln is to be installed, so i suggest you search the board on that. B.t.w did you set the security policy i mentioned in my previous post? Was there any difference once you restarted and re-initialized the Ln installation after that?<br />

I dont have any documentation of how to install on 2000. There is but only one document on how to install Ln on a Microsoft Platform(Windows/SQL Server). The errors that you have (510) has got to do with your Database. Please make sure appropriate Sort Order is choosen while installing SQL Server. In my installation i had chosen &quot;Binary&quot; as the sort order and while installing Ln, i had chosen Single Byte Locale &quot;ISO_BIN1&quot;. Make sure the &quot;sa&quot; password is typed in correctly as well as the db group and baan password. <br />

Note: I check baanboard more often than i check my mail accounts.</div></div><hr />

   When you installed Ln, did you select all the options meant for your environment from the staging area? If possible, attach a snapshot of your StagingArea\InstallableUnits folder..<br />

I see what the problem is now. You have completely missed one CD. Ln comes in two Cds(three actually with the third being the documentation CD). The first CD is titled Enterprise Server 8.3 while the second is titled Infor ERP LN 6.1 FP3(feature pack could vary). You have not copied the contents of second CD to the staging Area.<br />
 <br />

       i have got only 2 cds.One is Enterprise Server 8.3 and Documentation CD<br />

You should contact Infor on this and tell them about the missing CD. There should have been three CD. Without the Application CD you wont be able to use the other modules...<br />
