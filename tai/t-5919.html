<br />
Can anyone tell me how to correlate the info in shm_param back to kernel parameters? <br />
<br />
We are about to upgrade to p/s 6.1c.06.04 and will need to re-create the shm_param file.  If the values would change, I would like to understand why.<br />
<br />
What are these values based on?<br />
<br />
preallocated memory<br />
address space<br />
# of segments<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />

address space: where in your memory space the segments are allocated<br />
# of segments: is important for your kernel configuration. Baan can create more than one segment depending on how much is needed. Your kernel should allow the number of segments Baan needs. Also the size of the segment is important and should be allowed by your kernel configuration.<br />
<br />
I have never been able to see a difference in performance if you config more smaller segments or use less bigger segments.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Pre-allocated memory is a term from the old C-programmer's handbook (the boring part that I and everybody else must have skipped).<br />
It refers to a technique where you load certain objects at a fixed memory address, therewith speeding up your application because you will have a pointer array telling you exactly where to look for an object as opposed to having to dig it up somewhere in memory.<br />
<br />
Now I was always under the assumption that pre-allocated memory and shared memory where the same thing (fits the description), but maybe it is just the pointer array or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimbob</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the pre-allocated memory is the amount of shared memory to reserve for Baan.<br />
<br />
This amount is divided by the # of segments, to get the segment size.  <br />
<br />
The &quot;address space&quot; specifies the start of the Baan shared memory.  From this address, the coresponding number of segments (of &quot;segment size&quot;) are sequentially allocated.<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
PS - In answer to the orginal question, I don't think shm_parm corellates at all to Kernel Parameters.  Although it needs to be ensured that the pre-allocated memory is below the server shared memory limit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think your right, sorry but english is not my native language and probably I did mis understand the verb correlate.<br />
Your last statement is basicly what I did try to explain.<br />
<br />
