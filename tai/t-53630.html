There are 3 files that must be consistent within their versions:<br />
<br />
$BSE/lib/install/tab.reg<br />
$BSE/tools/tl7.6_a/itlbic/ibic___slm___0<br />
$BSE/tools/tt7.6_a/ittbic/ibic___slm___0<br />
<br />
If you made some change on your environment or copied from another one, you must recover the original file..<br />
<br />
This is what &quot;security file&quot; means.<br />
<br />
As it says &quot;Cannot open&quot;, also check the permissions for these files.</div></div><hr />

When i try to install it, i get that error in tools section.<br />

So the only chance i have, it is downgrade to porting set 7.1d.12a, install security files and then upgrade to porting set 8.4c. <br />
What do you think?<br />

This is close to Any G's suggestion but the solution ids are different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nicholas</div><div class="date">1st October 2008, 08:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you will need to downgrade the porting set, and then apply the SLM license as well as patches associated with the implementation of SLM.<br />
<br />
There should be a detailed instructions on how to implement SLM and what patches are required.  <br />
<br />
Go back to Infor and request the steps needed to implement SLM.<br />
<br />
Also Porting sets 8.x for Baan Vc doesn't support Multi-byte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luísa Rodrigues</div><div class="date">1st October 2008, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to every one, i have already one solution to this issue.<br />
Implemented some instruction to my system and now it is ok<br />

Kind Regards:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here it is a gold solution for this Issue:<br />
I you have installed batch install SP1-22 and now you can not execute any baan session, getting this error, so you can implement this solution:<br />
<br />
1. Navigate to $BSE/lib/install and check if the tab.reg file is present. If it does not exist, put the attached tab.reg file in this folder. If it exists, then make a backup/copy of the current file and put one tab.reg file .<br />
<br />
2. Navigate to $BSE/tools/tt7.1_a. Check if the ittbic folder is present. If not, create it manually and take care it gets the same permissions as the other folders 3. Put a ibic___slm___0 file in the folder created in step 2.<br />
4. Navigate to $BSE/lib. Open and edit the fd file for the package combination in which you are working. E.g. the fd6.2.b50c file in case your current package combination was b50c. Check if a line is present for itt. If not, then add the following line:<br />
<br />
itt:${BSE}/tools/tt7.1_a<br />
<br />
Also for this step please first make a backup/copy of the file before you start changing it.<br />
<br />
Then finally go do step 5:<br />
<br />
5. In the &quot;Directories of Software Components&quot; (ttadv1115m000) session, check if the marked line is present of the second screenshot of the secfile2.doc document. If not, add this line.<br />
<br />
This is the best solution we could have.<br />
<br />
Thanks and good luck to your work</div></div><hr />

nicely documented. We also landed up in similar issue with baan 5, after downgrading the porting set. I had the backup of the folders /files. I did not change any value in ttadv1115m000 since in my case it was specified as ${BSE}/application for Functions. I just picked up tab.reg which was missing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the detailed info though.</div></div><hr />

I documented the problem with security files and what options you have as an admin and gave a little explanation as to what happens or why this could happen.  Prao, Andy's explanation is good and it still applies. Check out the solution and you will see why. <br />
