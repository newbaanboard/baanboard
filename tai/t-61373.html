I am stuck on a small problem and so am hoping you may be able to offer some advise. Attached is two scripts I have got, the first is a simple SQL Query script (the main program script), the second is a report script. I received a request from our Sales department to please create a label printing program. In my limited knowledge, I have been able to create this one and so thought it would suffice. However my despatch personell have come to me complaining that the staff are continually loosing the excessive labels and so this system is not working for them. What happens is that they do some partial deliveries and so label some items, then loose the rest of the labels. What they would like me to do is to be able to select a certain range of labels and have these labels printed. when the rest of the items become available, they want to be able to print the labels for those items. The problems I experienced is that when I use these two scripts, firstly the report script autogenerates the numbers, lets say, 1 of 100, all the way to 100 of 100. This does not seem to work if they do part deliveries of lets say, the first 10 items. The label report will print 1 of 100 to 10 of 100, once the next available set of part delivered items comes along, then it prints 1 of 10, instead of starting from 11 of 100.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to make this possible? Does any of the above make sense? I am hoping that someone might be able to describe how they managed to get their BaaN IV system to perform this sort of task.<br />
<br />
Any useful advise is greatly appreciated. Thanking you in advance.:(</div></div><hr />

<br />
as I understand you right your shipping department wants to print some labels at the time of shipping (after printing the delivery note).<br />
<br />
If so you could use the delivered quantity (field &quot;dqua&quot;) within the tdsls045 table. Therefore you recieve for any shipped item (e.g. partial delivery 10 of 100) the labels with number 1 to 10. Next Time they shipp the rest (11 to 100) you will get the labels from 11 to 100.<br />
<br />
For any (partial-)shipment there will be an entry in the tdsls045 table.<br />
