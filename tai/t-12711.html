<br />
We are using baan IVc3. We ran ttadv5215m000 (Convert to runtime DD) due to table modification. However, it ran not only for that particular table but also for rest of other tables as well.<br />
<br />
The problem is now we cannot see some transactions in anticipated payments, which are already reconciled and not reconciled. <br />
<br />
How can we solve this problem?<br />
<br />
regards<br />
Srilal</div></div><hr />

If there's no other solution you need to roll back your changes (restore) or change the DD of the affected tables back.<br />
Also check this within the finance threads, I don't expect a change in DD to change the data itself...<br />
<br />
And a convert does not run for all tables, it uses flags of changed tables to know what needs to be converted, that would mean that you a several tables with convert flags on. In the future, make sure that you select specific tables only.</div></div><hr />
