<br />
After installation of a solution, I have followed all the instruction. Now, users are facing errors in many things saying table tccom949 not found.<br />
<br />
I have checked, the definition of the table exist. I have also checked the $BSE/dict for the pacc combination and it is present there too.<br />
<br />
When I open it using GTM, it says definition not found. Please Help!!</div></div><hr />

Check the $BSE/dict/&lt;pacc&gt;/dtc.pd/dtc.pd file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First check if there are any *.New files in the dict. If there are any, that means the Convert to RDD was not done properly. Also check table ttadv501 - 505.<br />
<br />
A tip:- Take a backup of the folder named with your Package Combination with DB and BSE Backup. Now, rename that folder.<br />
<br />
Now, run ttadv5210m000 (Create Runtime) for your package combination with full range and all selection. Restart baan. It will create the folder again. Now, check if there are any .New files. If there are, do a convert to run time for the package combination. Restart Baan.<br />
<br />
Thats it. But, please take the necessary backup's. And, as jclju1 said, you can try restarting the Shared Memory as well. Again, this problem has a lot of reasons and every reason has different solutions. So, All the Best :)</div></div><hr />
