We are on Baan IV c. Our normal users have DEMs. They don't have Menu Browsers. I want to create a session which automatically starts at the Baan login and checks for password aging flag. I don't know where to start. In our environment Maintain startup sessions is not working. I logged a case with Baan support. Baan support is looking into it. I created a session group. Did convert to run time and created a session under the session group and did convert to run time and linked the session group to the user and converted to run time. But later, when i log off and log back in the session is not starting up automatically. I think we have some old objects in our system which needs to be upgraded. I want to know what is the best way to do password aging ? Any ideas will be helpful.<br />
Thanks to all.<br />

Does the session group file in $BSE/lib contain the session which you want to start?<br />
<br />
I had to change the tag under which the session group is stored in order to get the session started. However that was in a 50c environment. <br />

       Thank you very much. When I created a session group and start up session, the system created a file in the $BSE/lib/user directory and my session group name is test. So it created as test.sessions. My start up session is tcmcs0103m000. This session is present in the file. I attached session group to my user in Maintain user settings. Then after converting to run time two lines are added in my user file which is present in $BSE/lib/user.<br />
#<br />
# bshell default settings<br />
#<br />
bshell.sessions:  startup.sessions<br />
bshell.dbg_disp:  yes<br />
<br />
I did all what I could do. But it is not working. Thanks for your help.<br />

I am not sure which one it is but somewhere in the trace file you should see the resource variable that's should be set to your session group.<br />
