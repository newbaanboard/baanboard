I have a custom table, today i decide to add a field, then i convert to runtime, exit and re login and when i run the maintain session i receive error 512 ( corrupted dd), so i verify the dict(no *.new is present), i verify the oracle table structure and it has the new field.<br />
I try to enter with ttaad4100, and with this i can see the table and the new filed.<br />
The table is not in shared memory.<br />
The table has no relations with other table.<br />
<br />
Can someone have any idea?<br />
Thanks<br />
Barbara</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bstecche</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">i have nothing loaded in shared memory <br />
I try now the CRDD of my session but is the same<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The only other thing I can think of is something our admin has done before -I think he has forced a rebuild on the table - I am not sure what he used but I think is was bdbreconfig.<br />
<br />
What I have done before is - make a change to something like a label and do then re-create RDD.  No promise this will work - just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thought, it seems like, if you can edit in ttaad4100, that the table IS converted in the database, and Baan DOES see it.  It may be a  problem with viewing / VRCs.<br />
<br />
If you make a change in VRC A, while logged into a company attached to VRC A, and can view this in GTM and change it, then the table change worked.  Please be sure at this step, though, that the company you are running (the company shown on your main Baan Menu) in is the SAME as the company you are checking in ttaad4100.  If it is NOT, this may explain your problem.   <br />
<br />
Because, how are you running the session then.  If you exit and run the session under a different company attached to a different VRC, you would get this error. <br />
<br />
Just a guess.  Maybe provide more info on what VRC's the table has been changed in, Companies you are checking, and User Login Companies are in play here.</div></div><hr />
