During SP8 installation on Baan5.c,Win2000,SQLServer7 I received this message:<br />
'Error decompressing file d:\baan\tmp\dumpo01'<br />
In session 'Process Patches' for<br />
Update VRC:  B50U c bgl0<br />
Patch code:   spb50c_8      I have the status 'Installing' instead of 'Installed'.  Every time I choose Specific\Install I receive the same error.<br />
<br />
I do have free space on my disk and the CD with SP8 seems also to be OK because I processed three installations using it before.<br />
<br />
Any interesting sugestions?<br />

There is a problem reading that particular file, so check your CD, try to copy the file itself to the disk to see if it's ok.</div></div><hr />

The CD surface is perfectly clean.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">2nd June 2003, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I have received a similar error in the past when the BSE\tmp directory was not cleared before installing a service pack.  It seems that some times (and this is conjecture), that a temporary file with the same name was used.  Clearing out the temporary directory and rescanning worked for me.  You may have to go into GTM and modify one of the PMC tables - I remember having to do that to change the status.  Sorry I can't be more specific, but check your temp directory as a first try.</div></div><hr />

You need to re-scan the SP again with overwrite option, then redo the installation. However, prior to do this you need to change the solution ID in the PMC table that has the status 'installing' to 'available' first using GTM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I wrote before, I had enough free space on the disk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Following your hints I cleared Bse\tmp dictionary but it didnt help<br />
<br />
I noticed that Baan is decompressing files in a wrong way, the files after decompression had wrong CRC (check sum) so I installed porting set 7.1d to be sure that my current 7.1c03 is not responsible for errors, but it didnt help as well.<br />
<br />
Finally I used GTM to change status from installing to available for the SP8 and run Scan Solution\Patch File, Process Patches ones again.  And I won. It seems to be OK now.<br />
