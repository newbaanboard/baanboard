Monitored with TT_SQL_TRACE=200.<br />
<br />
Only one select takes longer than 0.1 sec. But because of this huge amount of selects whole session takes 5-6 hours to run!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MatthewJames</div><div class="date">19th June 2002, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">This is probably due to the fact that you might have a large quantity of manufactured Items and the session is selecting each of them individally also you probably have a few thousand items.<br />
<br />
Also the session probably has to go and collect all the current stock levels from your warehouses so you would have a large quantity of selects for this report to run.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps this should be run as a batch job over night or the weekend.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">20th June 2002, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan's legacy is one of level one database drivers.  In the level one drivers, all selects are single table, single row.  This results in many parts of the Baan code (even some parts of ERP) acting as if this is the preferred method, even if running level 2 with Oracle.  <br />
<br />
What version of Baan and database are you running?<br />

When monitoring by using Oracle methods there seems to be much less selects. I don't know why...<br />
Another company in SP6 level and less data had around 82000 selects in same session. Maybe i could attach a piece of a log file.<br />
<br />
This is was the biggest and only select which takes time. Maybe i should look for explain plan and full table scans of this:<br />
