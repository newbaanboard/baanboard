If someone allready encountered such situation and/or have an idea, let me know. Thanks<br />
<br />
&quot;<br />
I've just performed two fresh installation of BaanERP5.0c SP3 with Loc2.0 on two different systems:<br />
 - the first one is a Dell Laptop Piii 650 Mhz 256Mo Ram running Win2000server sp2 and MS-Sql7 sp2,<br />
 - the second is a Dell Server (2 Piii Xeon 700Mhz, 1Mo L2, 1Go RAM) running NT4server SP6 with Oracle 8.1.7<br />
<br />
I performed the same installation excepted that I installed only two of the demo companies for Localization (920 and 925) on my laptop and all the demo companies on the server (920 to 947).<br />
For both installation I used the database created by the Setup.exe. with defaults values.<br />
<br />
On my laptop the database (MS-Sql7) is only 3.2 Go with 360 Mo free.<br />
On the server the DB (Oracle8i) is huge : <br />
     - 4 Go allocated for data (1Go free in the TBS) : 3 Go of data<br />
     - 5 Go allocated for index (750 Mo free )       : 4.25 Go index<br />
     - ROLLBACK_DATA : 170 Mo used<br />
     - SYSTEM : 670 Mo used<br />
The whole database is more than 10 Go.<br />
<br />
Is this normal ?<br />
What can I do to reduce the size of the database ?<br />
&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess the installer program uses larger values for Oracle installations? My preference is always to create any database manually, not really into all those wizard thingies for db creatioms :)<br />
<br />
I would export the full database with Oracle8i EXP utility (compress on) and recreate the database manually with smaller default storage values. Then import your database dump with the IMP utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">etienne</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">What about &quot;Reorganize Tables&quot; with Tables and index = Yes after having change the storage parameters ?<br />
I put initial = next = 16K instead of 40, and PCT_INCREASE=0 instead of 50. BD_BLOCK_SIZE is 8K.<br />
BTW I'm not a DBA neither sysadmin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">26th October 2001, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">PCT_INCREASE of 50? Wow, no wonder your database 'seems' to be big :) The Reorganize tables will reshuffle the tables inside the database but will not actually decrease the file system usage of your data files. For that you really need to scratch and recreate these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at your segment sizes.  I have had similar problems in the past where our segment sizses were huge.  We were reserving about .5 Mb with the first record of a file.  For the hundreds of very small tables (such as Company and Type codes) you are reserving many MB of empty space.<br />
