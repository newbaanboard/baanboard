<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">11th March 2008, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I have created a new table from scratch.<br />
<br />
I have set it up in maintain Table Defs, Created Runtime DD, converted to Runtime DD ( a number of times actually ), no error messages, every thing seems good. Exit baan and back in and trying to create the table.<br />
<br />
... Cannot find table def ...   Grrr ....   Any ideas why not ?<br />
<br />
I have done this so many times in the past and sometimes it is hit and miss with the error popping up.  Why would this be happening on a freshly created table ?<br />
<br />
In the past, we have needed to restart the server in some instances probably because of shared memory, but this is a first time new table ....<br />
<br />
I read in a post about the shared memory service may need to be started and stopped. Is this true?  If so, this I assume cannot be done while users are active and I'll need to do this on the windows 2003 services somewhere ... ? I'm not too familiar with services under W2003 Server....</div></div><hr />

Now, with respect to Windows 2003 and BaanSharedMemory Service. I read people can disable, then enable this service again instead of a reset ?<br />
<br />
What effects does this have on users logged into the system ?<br />
<br />
I would prefer not to restart the server if I don't have to ...  affects too many production activities ...  thanks ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you can restart shared memory for this. No need to reboot OS.<br />
<br />
What effects does this have on users logged into the system ?<br />
<br />
If users are logged into the system, they will be thrown off the system. This is not recommended..</div></div><hr />

This happened on our Live environment. We had to customize a domain and update all the tables using that domain and after doing all the converting business, I stopped and restarted the Shared Memory (as i had no choice and only few users were on) and it flashed a message suggesting some users were connected and that memory may not have been flushed or something like that. <br />
Had to finally restart the server to get the customized domain to work...<br />

<br />
Sukesh75, yes, I got the same message when i tried to stop and restart the service, so I also ended up resetting the server too.  Oh well   :) ...  Only interrupted 3 users this time ...<br />
<br />
Thanks .....</div></div><hr />

UNLESS you also added/modified a domain as well.<br />
<br />
For changes to existing tables / domains you can manually remove the offending table/domain from shared memory by using the shared memory manager. no effect* on users and no reboot required.<br />
<br />
Dave<br />
<br />
<br />
* if you change a table users may be effected anyway regardless of the DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 08:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Dave,<br />
    Mind telling us how its done (step-by-step) in the Shared Memory Manager? I am sure this issue would pop up again sooner..<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just gonna ask that question too ( Shared memory Manager ) :) ..<br />
<br />
Yes, actually, I did add a domain this time around ....  so now I know why sometimes I have to reset server and others I don;t ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually don't have access to a baan windows environment anymore so I'll have to give you the &quot;step-by-step&quot; from memory.<br />
<br />
Open the &quot;Baan NT Manager&quot; or &quot;bentman.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
Find the Baan Shared Memory section. Right click and choose &quot;show loaded&quot;<br />
(or something like that.)<br />
<br />
It will pop up a window that lists all of the DD contents of your shared memory.<br />
It's sorted oddly (not necessarily alphabetical). Find the object you'd like to remove from shm in the list, select it and click &quot;remove from memory&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's actually listing filenames not tables or domains. so if you want to remove a domain from shared memory you'd need to remove the entire domain file (dtc.pd for example.)<br />
<br />
The next time one of those objects is accessed Baan will load the new copy of the file into shm.<br />
<br />
Existing users in the system will still use the old version of the object until they logout/log back in. (because baan caches it in the driver and the bshell as well) So you could get 512s or index out of dims, etc if you've done table changes with people on the system.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting stuff.<br />
<br />
I tried this in both my NT4 environment and windows 2003 envt. I ran bentman and get the manager, rt click on shared memory service only gets me &quot;Configure&quot; or &quot;Shared memory manager&quot; Stop or restart. <br />
<br />
Selecting Shared mem mgr gives me an error &quot;Link to Shared Memory Failed: error errno 22 shm_errno 0<br />
<br />
I will show this to our Server guru when he returns next week and see if we has seen this before.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can also view the shared memory mgr under 'Services&quot; on the 2003 server as well, but no option to 'see' what is in there. Too bad ......<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips Dave_23 ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">are you connecting to the server via Terminal Services / RDP?<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, yes I am. I'll go over to the server now and check from there ...  From RDP, I logged into command prompt with the baan user id.<br />
<br />
OK, from command prompt as baan admin, I ran bentman. Runs fine.<br />
Then click on Shared memory Service, Shared memory manager. This time from the server, the box pops up !<br />
<br />
There is a Show loaded box in there. And, sure enough, it shows all. <br />
<br />
So, from here, I select my object and rt click, select unload.<br />
<br />
Then, once done, I guess I hit load again to reload it all ?<br />
<br />
I remember seeing this a long time ago when I first worked with Baan but it was way over my head back then as to it's usefullness  :) .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">glad it's working!<br />
<br />
you don't need to &quot;reload all&quot; because baan will load it automatically the next time it accesses the file.<br />
