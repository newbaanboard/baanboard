<br />
I have a client that currently has a UNIX server running BaanIV. We are hosting a server for them that has 10.2.1 currently installed on Server 2008R2. They said they would like an application server installed on the Server 2008R2 server that links with their BaanIV environment. I have never just set up an application server before and have no idea how that works. Does anybody know how to install just an application server for baanIV? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">welks10</div><div class="date">20th February 2013, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I just tried to do the install of the application server on the Server 2008R2. I created a new environment on that server installed the porting set and let the installation go through for the application server after entering in the hostname, login/password for the unix system, and the bse location. After installing, there was an error saying something about init user   'baan'. Shared memory could not be started. What does that mean? <br />
<br />
I will post a picture of error if needed. Thanks again in advance.</div></div><hr />

On both servers you basicly need to use the same portingset. I don't have experience with using mixed operating systems.<br />
<br />
Basicly you need to use the BSE_REM variable on the application server which points to your remote master application server. You need to configure a r&lt;user file&gt; as well so your application server knows how to login to the remote master application server. Some files from $BSE/lib you need to have setup on the application server as well.<br />
<br />
Long way back we needed these things as cpu's where not that fast as they are now. Nowadays it's not needed for performance anymore. The setup above was due to security reasons.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be more wisely to migrate the unix baaniv environment to your windows machine? Or are they using BISAM, in that case they need to migrate their data to a RDBMS. <br />
