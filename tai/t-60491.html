<br />
We are on baan 5 c4 with sp19 on HP-Unix ... since we plan to move to sp28 for tools / application , just wondering is it mandatory to do SLM or can we still stay with license daemon even after upgrading to sp28 ?<br />
<br />
Is SLM update a pre-requisite.<br />

<br />
if porting set upgrade is not mandatory, then i can just update sp and avoid even SLM upgrade... just a thought.<br />

I dont know for sure, but you can find that information in the &quot;Installation and deployment guide&quot; that comes with every SP documentation. There is a section called &quot;Pre-installation requirements&quot; and there you can see what minimum portingset can be used.<br />
And yes, you could just update SP and leave the portingset on 7.1x (if supported, see above).<br />

<br />
Sooner or later you are going to have to go with SLM, a lot of the standard solutions in SP point to it.  You can not install some but then you risk your config management.<br />
<br />
SLM seems daunting at first but its actually fairly straight forward. PM for pointers if you need them.<br />

<br />
why would you not want to upgrade porting set?  You are missing out on tons of fixes. Besides, platforms are going out of support and new ones are now being supported with the newer porting set. Let alone, when you ask for help when something goes wrong you will be out of luck if you are on unsupported platforms. Well, not out of luck but maybe out of a lot of money after paying grand fees for supporting old platforms. I am sorry I feel so strong about it :)  I just do not understand the reason why. <br />
Often times we think, &quot;if it is working, leave it alone&quot; but my take is that it is best to keep a proactive approach and you will always be better prepared when something goes wrong and in better shape to receive support as well. <br />
<br />
That being said, your ERP has several pieces that copy the way regular software runs on an OS. Your tools is kind of like the OS where your sessions run. Service packs are only one part of the upgrades and even that part has two pieces, tools Service pack (equivalent to an OS) and Applications service packs. Then you have your porting set that sits on the OS of your preference and that helps the ERP communicate with your database and then of course you have your ERP client: BW, Worktop, WebUI.  <br />
<br />
Think about it this way, <br />
you can always upgrade the client(s) first, Porting set next and before Service packs in this order. <br />
<br />
Your best friend will always be your technical notes on the porting set, a lot of the requirements as far as patches at the OS level will be described there. Where coming from 7.1d.11 up, from 7.1d.12 to 7.1d.16 you have the option to go to SLM already or keep license daemon. However, once you jump to the 8.x porting sets SLM is definitely a must and again in later porting sets later versions of SLM might be required. All of this is always spelled out in the technical notes of the porting sets. <br />
Please, check them at ftp://ftp.support.baan.com/updates/port/##/<br />
(*replace ## with the porting set version you are looking for, e.g., 7.1d.16*)<br />
<br />
As Lebowski pointed also, when you are upgrading service packs always check the &quot;Installation and deployment guide&quot; that comes in the ISO for the SP and check. <br />
<br />
Best of luck!<br />

I agree with you 100% what you quoted. On our Test/Prod. Physical server we are going to do upgrade to latest porting set , sp &amp; move to SLM.<br />
<br />
Only issue is we have a baan server which is installed on Virtual Server running suse linux and this is hosted at one of the isp server &amp; if i am not mistaken then SLM is not supported yet on Virtual Servers .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">6th June 2011, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">License daemon is not supported on virtual systems either so that's imho not an excuse. Older portingsets where not able to detect it but newer do.<br />
