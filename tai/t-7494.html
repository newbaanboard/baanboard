 I have created a new Package Combination PC and assciated VRC with it. I used the Create New Package Combination (One Step) Session.<br />
But now what is happening is, if I try to change the Company of the user across PC it allows me to do so. <br />
<br />
For eg:<br />
If PC abc has company 111 222<br />
and PC def has company 333 444<br />
And a user is currently in PC abc and company 111<br />
If the user goes to options change company and puts 333 it happens and the user can work normally.<br />
<br />
But if the user tries to use delete table option that doesn't go thru, gives error company should be of associated PC.<br />
<br />
Any Clue? This is on Baan5.0b.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

 The User has the correct access.<br />
Let me once again clarify the problem.<br />
A user is able to navigate to company's across Package Combination though attached to once Package Combination.<br />
<br />
Even bsp has the same problem.<br />
<br />
Has some reconfig or a reorganize or something been missed? :confused:</div></div><hr />

Are the any errors in the $BSE/log files that could help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nancy Mathew</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 00:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pat,<br />
 There is  no log. As there is no error given out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmm strange, I would expect to see some sort of error when the table deletion fails. Did you do a CRDD after you created the new companies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nancy Mathew</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 01:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pat,<br />
 We have done that too. But again, in the first place, BaaN should not allow changing company to a company of a different PC altogether.<br />
<br />
How is this happening?<br />

<br />
Nancy,<br />
<br />
You can change a company belonging to a different package combination as long as there are no Tables/Domains/Runtime DD differences. [Atleast, this is valid in BaaN-5.2 version, I am not sure on the other BaaN Versions, please validate]<br />
<br />
Can you please post the screenshot of the error message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nancy Mathew</div><div class="date">11th November 2002, 09:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi NPR,<br />
 I created a new domain in the lower VRC did a CRDD and it started working as it shud.<br />
But tell me technically how does it work? How does it verify there is a difference in the dd at runtime?<br />

<br />
I cannot explain the internals of the BaaN Standard Program. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
But on an overview, the basic check starts with the packages by Package Combinations and then somewhere down the process... the DDs are compared.</div></div><hr />
