My question is:-<br />
In my previous BaanIV, i have a group of users of with almost similar functions but with little differences in one/two sessions.<br />
I can solved it in BaanIV because I use the Authorisation by Module/User.<br />
I just put/group all the similar sessions to the users. Then insert those &quot;differences&quot; of one or two sessions to those users accordingly.<br />
<br />
But how to setup in LN in order to achieve that kind of authorisation to those user? Based on testing below, more than one role will produce a outcome of authorise.  So i have to create a &quot;Similar&quot; role which MUST consists of only the authorised sessions which is very tedious and not efficient.<br />
<br />
sample of testing:-<br />
Case 1:<br />
&quot;centralinvoice&quot; Role<br />
ci:* Full Auth.<br />
cisli1500m000:* No Auth.<br />
Result of user using this one role only: the &quot;without&quot; authorize session work according i.e did not authorize <br />
 <br />
Case 2:<br />
&quot;centralFULL&quot; Role<br />
ci:* Full Auth.<br />
 <br />
&quot;TestN&quot; Role<br />
cisli1500m000:* No Auth.<br />
Result of user using the TWO roles: the &quot;without&quot; authorize session DIDN'T work according i.e authorize<br />
 <br />
Case 3:<br />
&quot;centralinvoice&quot; Role<br />
ci:* Full Auth.<br />
cisli1500m000:* No Auth<br />
 <br />
&quot;centralFULL&quot; Role<br />
ci:* Full Auth.<br />
 <br />
&quot;TestN&quot; Role<br />
cisli1500m000:* No Auth.<br />
Result of user using the THREE roles: the &quot;without&quot; authorize session DIDN'T work according i.e authorize<br />
 <br />
In the LN HELP-To define session authorizations<br />
<br />
&quot;The authorization that is stated at the most specific level has the highest priority. This is the session authorization per session for a specific company. The lowest priority is the authorization that is stated at the most global level. This is the session authorization per company for all companies.<br />
<br />
Besides the already mentioned levels, session authorizations for a user can also be specified in several roles. For example, a user has two roles. If one role states that the user has permission for a session, and the other role states that the user has no permission, the user ultimately has permission for that session.&quot;</div></div><hr />

True. Refer to the thread -  Tools Question (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=14299&amp;highlight=roles)</div></div><hr />
