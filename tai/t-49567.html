<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ultegra</div><div class="date">19th March 2008, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi experts! I have a problem in job data(ttaad5500m000). I created a job to dump the sequential file every night. However, after a job is done, the status will not release. It just stays as Running. When this happen, I have to manually cancel the job and release it.<br />
<br />
Is there a way or script to free the status everytime the job is finished? Many thanks!</div></div><hr />

Have similar experiences with a number of jobs, some quite long, while others are very quick ones. My problems are intermittent, but seem to only occur on the same jobs.<br />
<br />
Only similarity I have with ultegra is SQL2005 and Windows 2003</div></div><hr />

   Do all the jobs share the same settings? I am referring to the jobs that work and close properly and the ones that keep showing status as &quot;Running&quot; even after executing. <br />
<br />
sk</div></div><hr />

How do you mean &quot;same settings&quot;? The same job can run successfully many times &amp; then go into limbo every so often.</div></div><hr />

Thought you had some jobs working well and others just stalling after execution. Have you tried monitoring it by running a harmless session inside a job over and over to see if it fails to close properly in any of the runs?<br />

This problem only started occuring with SQL2005 / Windows 2003 mix</div></div><hr />
