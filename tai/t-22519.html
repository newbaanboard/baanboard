<br />
We are trying to implement password change policy as part of the SOX(Sarbaes Oxley)that requires users to change their BaaN(UNIX) password every x number of days. Since BaaN IVc2 does not have any password againg/management, we are using HP-UNIX features to do that.<br />
<br />
Can you tell where the last password change date is stored in HP-UNIX(version 10.2)? Is it something that can be accessed using a command/script? Or it can be calculated using /etc/password file fields?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DSonifer</div><div class="date">6th December 2004, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We too are subject to SOX Auditing and have just implemented password aging where users modify their own passwords.  We are running HP-UNIX 11.0 as an UNTRUSTED system, so our solution may not be needed or may not work as described if yours is a TRUSTED system.<br />
<br />
The problem we had is most of our users use bw.exe (GUI) to interface to Baan.  If their password has expired or you force them to change their password as the next logon, the UNIX script ($BSE/bin/bshellxxx whatever they're using) does not intercept for password change.  All they get is an error that they cannot connect to Baan.<br />
<br />
We established our own password aging system to supplement UNIX.  We set UNIX password aging on, set the maximum to about once a quarter (14 weeks or 98 days).  Then we have an actual .age file in their /home directory.  We added code to the bshell script so that if the .age file contains a value &lt; 6, we start a Baan session that opens a shell script form with the &quot;passwd&quot; command already executing.  They enter their old and new passwords, and if the password change is successful, the value in their $HOME/.age file is changed to 90.  The session ends and they are logged out of Baan, and then they log back in with their new password. <br />
<br />
And there's some other components, like a cron script that decrements the value in the .age file nightly.  And we've updated the $HOME/.profile of several users that do NOT use the GUI interface, or do so intermittenly, so that their password aging file is checked before starting Baan.<br />
<br />
If you are still interested, now knowing some of our system's intricacies, I could give you details and the code for the session allowing password changes.<br />
<br />
PS  I heard rumors that Baan sells a product for this purpose, but we developed this rather than spend the money ($5,000??).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">6th December 2004, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer the original question:<br />
<br />
[ From man 4 passwd ]<br />
<br />
      Password aging is put in effect for a particular user if his encrypted<br />
      password in the password file is followed by a comma and a nonnull<br />
      string of characters from the above alphabet.  (Such a string must be<br />
      introduced in the first instance by a superuser.) This string defines<br />
      the &quot;age&quot; needed to implement password aging.<br />
<br />
      The first character of the age, M, denotes the maximum number of weeks<br />
      for which a password is valid.  A user who attempts to login after his<br />
      password has expired is forced to supply a new one.  The next<br />
      character, m, denotes the minimum period in weeks that must expire<br />
      before the password can be changed.  The remaining characters define<br />
      the week (counted from the beginning of 1970) when the password was<br />
      last changed (a null string is equivalent to zero).   M and m have<br />
      numerical values in the range 0 through 63 that correspond to the 64-<br />
      character set of &quot;digits&quot; shown above.  If m = M = 0 (derived from the<br />
      string . or ..), the user is forced to change his password next time<br />
      he logs in (and the &quot;age&quot; disappears from his entry in the password<br />
      file).  If m &gt; M (signified, for example, by the string ./), then only<br />
      a superuser (not the user) can change the password.  Not allowing the<br />
      user to ever change the password is discouraged, especially on a<br />
      trusted system.<br />
<br />
      Trusted systems support password aging and password generation.  For<br />
      more information on converting to trusted system and on password, see<br />
      Managing Systems and Workgroups and sam(1M).<br />
<br />
As far as I know, Baan does not have a password aging solution for Baan 4.<br />
There is one for Baan 5 and up, and it is standard (i.e., free).<br />
