<br />
	I am trying to connect two application servers with one database server with two separate databases. I have moved existing BSE to new server and did necessory steps related to 3 tier structure. In fact, installation almost completed without problems. And I am able to run reports on new server.<br />
<br />
	During installation, I have choosen &quot;User Interface and application logic&quot; option and entered database node name after confirming BaaN Support. Now I am not able to open my scripts because it  is pointing to database server instead of BaaN application server, also I am not able to copy menu, etc. screen-shot attached herewith. I think, I should enter application node name instead of database node name.<br />
	<br />
	My queries are - How to change node name without reinstalling BaaN? or What node name should be there? or Is this different kind of problem rather than node name?<br />
<br />

<br />
Probably it is problem of old master media. You have to open registery by regedit and remove that entry by finiding.<br />
<br />
I think the second problem related to your DB MSSQL.<br />

BSE_REM gets created in the Environment variables when you install &quot;User Interface and application logic&quot; from Baan Cd. It could be what Suhas as mentioned, old media CDs..<br />
 <br />
I used the same steps in that document you mentioned and i got through with the user creation and all. Just stuck with login issues with the users created. Did you carry out any extra steps than whats mentioned in the document? Is the user you are trying to create, exists in the OS level of ServerA? <br />

BSE_REM : according to doc. i removed this varibale from baan nt and  i don't know what is the register (by regedit) i can't find <br />
<br />
MSSQL: I dont have any problem with save-delete-etc. on DB, the system is looking in the right place (server 2 bd), but what is the difference with a creation of user??  the user is created in server 1 and server 2 (OS).<br />
<br />
is necesary to modify anything in the session ttaad4100m000? maybe the name system (now is blank) <br />
<br />
how can i know if the baan media is the same? server 1 and server 2(new app)<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks!!!!<br />

First of all, its highly unlikely to find the BSE_REM variable in the System Registry(App Server) once you deleted it from the environment variable. <br />
You can find the variable in the registry in the following path<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE=&gt;Software=&gt;Baan=&gt;&lt;BSE&gt;<br />
or<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE=&gt;Software=&gt;Baan=&gt;&lt;BSE&gt;=&gt;Environment<br />
...where &lt;BSE&gt; is your baan environment name given at installation time.<br />
 <br />
As a further step, you can install SQL Client tools and try to connect to the database server from your APP server using the Query analyzer. If you are able to connect then the connection seems to be ok. <br />
Did you by any chance create an entry in the session &quot;Maintain Systems&quot;?<br />
Last but not least it would be better if you could post here the tabledef6.1 file of the APP server and how your Maintain Database Definition session looks like...<br />
 <br />

Hi,<br />
1- The Sql Client is OK! i can connect with DB remote<br />
2- Maintain Systems , i've tested with and without system name.<br />
   a) with system name , a message that is not possible to open the file. (when im creating a user).<br />
         message: (i cant open file '&lt;REMOTE_SERVER!d:\baan/tmp', error 0 )<br />
   b) without system name,  other message when i input the password for SA.<br />
        message :Connect Error 0 from 'Microsoft SQL-DMO(ODBC SQLstate:08001) as 'sa' to server '(local)' .....<br />
<br />
here my tafledef6.1, that i had to change according other posts.. looks like:<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
tuxch001:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_DSN:&lt;ODBC_NAME&gt;):Y<br />
tuxch009:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_DSN:&lt;ODBC_NAME&gt;:Y<br />
.....<br />
......<br />
*:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_DSN:&lt;ODBC_NAME&gt;):N   (last Line)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
if i convert DD, the system modify this file, like original (without  MSQL_Level1, msql:...etc.) and i can not access. Then i have to restore this file from a copy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">7th August 2007, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Vec,<br />
Reading through part of your post made me feel like reading my case on Infor support. The only exception is that you are a step behind me. I am able to create users without any problem. Logging them to baan is my problem. The Maintain System related error, even i am getting the same and so i did without the System defined. Convert to DD should be run only from the DB server as if you run from the APP you will mess tabledef6.1 as you have found out. After running the CRDD you should copy the tabledef6.1 from DB to App server. This is better than manually rectifying the tabledef6.1 on APP. <br />
 <br />
Another exception is your tabledef6.1. Mine goes like this<br />
cpcpm000:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST:&lt;DbServerName&gt;):Y ---First Line<br />
...<br />
*:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST:.):N --- Last Line<br />
 <br />
Although i am using ODBC connection i have entered the DB servername in both my Database Definition and subsequently in my tabledef6.1<br />
 <br />
try it out and let me know if it changes your situation...<br />

The same problem! can you send me a screenshot of your maintain system session ttaad0150m000 ?, i imagine that is a permission problem (i dont know). I 've tested with Baan user only  and is working. with other users doesn't work. :-(<br />
i need to solve this situation during this week.....and tell to my boss if its possible or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tks!!!!!</div></div><hr />

Although i havent maintained any system, it somehow works for the user Baan and not for the other users. You can find the screenshot of the Maintain Database Defintion with this post where the name &quot;dtbserver&quot; is the name of the database server. I might have got a fix from Baan support, just have to test it out and see if it really fixes this problem, as they say it would. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">13th August 2007, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the link. Unfortunately for me, even adding the user to the Administrator Group doesnt resolve the &quot;Database Not On&quot; error. The only difference between the user Baan and the test user is their name. All the permissions are identical. Both on and off Baan. <br />
The link is based on a two-tier installation and so i doubt the effectiveness of the solution on a three-tier setup. <br />
 <br />
Wot say?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">25th August 2007, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">It was down to a simple re-adjustment of a setting described in the TFH-006 document about the ODBC Driver setup that made it work. In the document, it shows that the ODBC driver to be created under the User DSN tab, but it should have been System DSN. Once this was done, other users were able to log in without problems. No more &quot;Database Not On&quot; errors. <br />
