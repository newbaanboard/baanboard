<br />
This is a brief description of our environment:<br />
<br />
Server: Windows Server 2003<br />
Database: ORACLE v. 10G<br />
<br />
In addition, we are in the process of setting-up the virtualization (a VM WARE Installation image) of a part of our servers among them the Server supporting ERP ln FP5.<br />
<br />
We would like to confirm if ERP ln (Worktop/Webtop... also E.S. and SLM... and other components) is able to run correctly also against a virtual environment with heavy workload/processes without impacting performance and user satisfaction.<br />
<br />
If you have any documentation or reference item on the subject, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help and prompt reply.<br />

Kind regards,<br />

I have running a complete FP5 installation in VMware with webtop. But SLM is not running in VMware, but only on real Hardware or in VirtualBox of Sun.<br />
But I cannot give information about performance, sorry.<br />

<br />
We do not run our Baan system on a VM (except a test environment with full standard), but one can say that it highly depends on the host system - especially the used hardware. In comparison to running the Baan system on a real hardware usually the host system is used by other virtual machines. This could be a problem in case the hosts ressources are running &quot;low&quot;. You have to check the usage of the host system with monitoring tools and test the behaviour of the Baan virtual machine. A virtual environment allows you to assign ressources of the host to particular virtual machines - so make sure the virtual Baan server can at least use as many ressources of the host as it would do on real hardware.<br />
<br />
My five cents...<br />

Contact Infor for more information.<br />
<br />
Only recommendation I can give you is to test it so see what effect it has in your case. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">28th October 2009, 03:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to the latest Porting Set release notes:<br />
<br />
Virtual Server support<br />
VMware<br />
The following statements apply to the Infor ERP LN 6.1 and ERP 5 Microsoft Windows x86 distribution and Linux x86 distribution: <br />
With Enterprise Server 8.3 and later, it is supported to run ERP LN 6.1 on VMware for demo and test purposes. However, benchmarks show that ERP LN in OS environments directly on the hardware performs better than ERP LN in a VMware Server environment. Therefore, Infor will not handle<br />
performance support calls when ERP LN runs on a VMware Server environment.<br />
Distributions on VMware ESX 3.5 and ESXi 3.5 are supported for all purposes, including production. When you size the system, take the overhead of VMware ESX/ ESXi into account. For guidelines, see the ERP LN sizing guide. 32 and 64 bits Windows and 32 and 64 bits Linux are both supported in<br />
combination with VMware.<br />
Note: Since the Infor SLM Server (Solution License Manager) is not supported in a virtual server environment it must be setup on a separate nonvirtual server. SLM Client is supported in a VMware environment.<br />
Disclaimer: The previous support statement of VMware ESX/ESXi 3.5 does not extend to any third-party product. For example, if the DBMS vendor does not support VMware ESX, the porting set is still supported on VMware ESX, but the DBMS is not. In this case, a solution is to run in 3-tier mode and configure the DBMS on another, non-virtual, system.<br />
<br />
HP Integrity VM<br />
With Enterprise Server 8.3 and porting set 8.3a.01 or later, it is supported to run ERP LN 6.1 with HP-UX on HP Integrity VM for demo and test purposes.<br />
Infor Global Support will not handle performance related inquiries about running ERP LN with HP-UX in a HP Integrity VM environment; support<br />
is limited to test and demo environments. HP Integrity Virtual Machines with the ERP LN 6.1 HP-UX IA64 distribution<br />
are supported. <br />
Note that the Infor SLM Server (Solution License Manager) is not supported in a virtual server environment. SLM Client can run on a virtual server environment.</div></div><hr />
