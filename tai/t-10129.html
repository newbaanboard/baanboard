<br />
I have a scenario &amp; I want help from you:<br />
I have a separate demo server, where database not designed properly. I want to redesign it using baan utilities. I have taken sequential backup of 000 without pipe and 100,200,300 with pipe separator.<br />
On a new machine, I have installed baan, oracle with new database design, set environment variables and ran fillenv.bat. Using bdbpost, I am thinking to import the data,but when I execute bdbpost nothing happens, please find attached file. Later I will take cold backup of this and paste it on demo server.<br />
My queries are : <br />
Why bdbpost not working?<br />
Is this related to dd not matching?<br />
Is there any improved scenario?<br />
<br />
Waiting for reply.<br />

<br />
Are you trying to import dump of 000 company or 100,200 &amp; 300?<br />
<br />
As you have taken these dumps using different method (with and without seperator), I think you must have thaught of<br />
1. Dump which is taken without seperator, in bdbpost we need to specify the i/p file name.<br />
2. When we take the dump using field seperator, &quot;bdbpost&quot; command needs to be executed from the directory where &quot;.S&quot; files are present. Another point we need to take care is specifying the field seperator (as in your case it is different than default TAB delimiter)<br />
<br />
I think by specifying the field seperator it will be resolved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">25th May 2003, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">That result is because it is not finding any tables to import: re-check your parameters, mainly the correct location of the dumps, does not look like they are on D:\baan\bin ...<br />
To avoid confusion with Baan, make sure that the dumps of 000 are on a specific directory and the others on another, so that by specifing the separator Baan does not import 000 wrongly or vice-versa.</div></div><hr />

Hi Victor,<br />

I have compied dump000.000 file in d:\baan\bin and execute attached command. I am importing 000 company first and later I will import 100, 200, 300. It will be better, if you give me example of bdbpost.<br />

<br />
Refer to - bdbpost synopsis (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=388&amp;highlight=parentheses) for more info on the bdbpost.<br />
<br />
And you can try this from the command line option after you have the environment configuration/variables set.<br />
<br />
$ bdbpost&lt;version&gt; -c000 -t&quot;|&quot; &amp; &quot; -A -D &lt;path&gt; -e error.file<br />
<br />
You can use -A for append mode and -R for replace/overwrite mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The command line given will not work for company 000, since the dump was not created with a separator.  You will have to use the -I option to specify the dump file:<br />
<br />
bdbpost6.1 -I dump000.000 -n -m -i -f -c 000<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">26th May 2003, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, the second command isn't necessary.  And don't worry about the &quot;Sir&quot; stuff, that's far too formal... ;) <br />
<br />
To fix the problem, try the following:  open the dump file in a text editor (probably quite a large file, thus notepad will not work, try wordpad).  If the first two lines are like the ones shown below, remove those lines, save the file and try running the command again.<br />

<br />
Are there any errors in the application eventlog of NT?<br />
<br />
For some reason it is not finding the message texts, giving me the impression that something went wrong during the import of table ttadv140.  Could you check in Oracle whether this table has the same number of rows as on the production machine?<br />
<br />
Another fault could be the default language of the user, as set in the %BSE%\lib\user\u... file.  Check this as well.  It should correspond to one of the languages in ttadv140.clan.<br />
<br />

<br />
Have you solve the problem? <br />
<br />
You have to install latest locale package in both tables and run time dd.  you can find this sulution from baan support web site.</div></div><hr />

I searched eventlog, found following error :<br />

Message	 gethostbyname( baanerp ) failed: error 11001<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Nico, I am giving all the steps which I applied for more clarification.<br />
<br />
1. installed baan<br />
2. installed oracle with new design<br />
3. stoped the baan services<br />
4. ren baan folder and pasted here live baan folder<br />
5. overwrite tabledef file from old baan folder.<br />
6. data imported using your command.<br />
7. checked the data ttadv140, found same.<br />
8. cheched u file and ttadv140.clan, found correspond language code 2.<br />
<br />
  I think, because I have copied live baan folder, it is searching that host even I chaged tabledef. I have removed that machine from network, found above attached error. When I clicked on that button, it is closing. baanerp is my server name. I think some entry is still there except tabledef. Please help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">6th June 2003, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the message that it is trying to display (ttstpslib2, in the table ttadv450).  It should say: &quot;Your bshell licence has expired&quot;<br />
<br />
Try to circumvent this problem by putting the machine back in the network, and in the %BSE%/lib/licence6.1 file, enter the IP address of your normal Baan server.  It should now pick up the licence from the normal server.  Then, see whether you can start the BW.<br />
<br />
Probably easiest for further error messages is to clear the Windows event logs before trying this.  Then it is easier to trace any other problems.<br />

As per your suggestion, I have entered IP address in the <br />
%BSE%/lib/licence6.1 file of baan normal server. Now I am able start BW as demo version for 240- days (I have changed system date) and that message code problem also solved. Now new error message, I am getting, whenever I am running any session attached message occurring. I have checked event log found following messages. What to do now? <br />

<br />
What happens if you set the correct system date?<br />
<br />
And can you see that the licence daemon on the normal server is accessed?  This one you can check with the licmon.exe -w command from a DOS box on the normal machine.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Nico<br />
<br />
PS<br />
I just read your last reply again, and have to add the following: the errors in the eventlog are generated because Baan is trying to start the licence daemon on the new machine.  Thus, these errors can be ignored, and are not relevant for this problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I set the current date, I am getting &quot;You have no license anymore to start the bshell&quot;. I think it is because, when I started BW first time that time my system date was old. <br />
<br />
Nico, I am considering Normal server means my demo server and normal machine means new, where I am doing R&amp;D.<br />
<br />
I tried by entering IP of demo and it is taking BW with all functionalaties. Now what to do for illegal object?<br />

That's the easy part!  Just run the session ttiex3225m000 (Configure application), which will insert the correct license code in the tools objects.  After that, everything should be running fine.<br />

When I run ttiex3225m000,  am getting error &quot;Licence daemon is not active&quot; &quot;First run Validate Tool Set&quot;, What to do? and What about other companies?<br />

(Problem solved with regular e-mail, nothing interesting enough to post here!) Suhas has it all working now, by pointing both licence6.1 files to the old machine, and thus sharing the licence daemon.  Posting of the companies besides 000 are now due, and I don't expect any trouble there.  Just be aware that if a dump file refuses to load, to remove the two offending lines, as stated earlier!<br />

<br />
It is better, I declare, the thread is finished. Really, there is nothing interesting to explain something. The reason for intensifying the thread is - my confusion. What I thought, Nico is giving me steps for making standalone BaaN server with new structure but fortunately I read following &quot;Upgrade Strategy&quot; thread, where Nico suggested some points related to &quot;Sharing Licence&quot;, and suddenly I got.<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10090<br />
Actually the problem was solved earlier, but I thought my server is pointing to live server and I again and again removed it from network results so many errors. <br />
Anyway, I made this thread for redesign the database and importing the data using BaaN utilities, lastly I learned redesign the database as well as making QA server. I am happy. This is because Nico's efforts, Thanks a lot. <br />
 <br />
 [Note : Redesigning database also available in Oracle, but you have to implement OFA (Oracle Flexible Architecture)]<br />
