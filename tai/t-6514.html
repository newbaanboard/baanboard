<br />
I am trying to get information about the various flags which can be set in BECS Option Dialog, to do run time level debugging, without actually having to Compile the script in Debug Mode.<br />
<br />
This option dialog can be opened by selecting the button &quot;Debug Bshell&quot;. My BECS Vesion is 6.2b.113<br />
<br />
Any info would be of great help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Remember that it is your bshell (on the server side) that does all the work.<br />
<br />
Never the less, you post an interesting question that I don't have the answer to. I know somebody who does though, so let me get back on this (if somebody doesn't beat me to it).</div></div><hr />

I agree with  you on that.Maybe i was not very clear in my question. I have a few sessions which seem to crash out every now and then. This is mainly due to Bad Data.<br />
<br />
The logs do not give me much info about what records have caused the error, hence the need to try and get  the info using the BDB/SQL Flags. I had read somewhere that using these flags one could trace the various Database actions as well as the SQL statements, locks etc .<br />
