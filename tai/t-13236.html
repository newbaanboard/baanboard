I have installation of baan4 (Unix) in directory /baan2<br />
I would like to remove this installation and install it again in directory : '/baan'.<br />
<br />
Is it enough and safely to delete only 'baan2' directory? or do I have to change some settings in other unix file?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Your installation is UNIX, right? I don't think that you need to re-install anything!<br />
<br />
I would do the following:<br />
1. mv /baan2 /baan (i.e. rename it)<br />
2. ln -s /baan /baan2 (create a symbolic link, that might help to keep the system alive, and that might be removed later if you are sure that all other things work fine).<br />
<br />
Normally, the only key to baan is the environment variable $BSE. <br />
(For EURO-triangulation we had trhee different baan environments on one machine!)<br />
<br />
But (shell-) scripts from outside baan, cron entries and all that stuff might have hard-coded paths, so that has to be checked as well.<br />

- $BSE/lib/fd*<br />
- $BSE/lib/a*<br />
- $BSE/etc/*<br />
- %BSE/lib/sr*<br />
<br />
If you only want to remove the Baan envrionment it is sufficient to remove the /baan2 tree. But check if everything was installed on this disk. It is possible to install parts on other disks. And of course tables should be revomed before or after manually.<br />
