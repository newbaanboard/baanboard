(mainly tfgld106) All these years I thought reorganizing the files was doing this. I don't think it is. Can anyone give me guidance on this problem, I a now out of space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
normally I would think that a reorganize table should do the trick, but you have a lot of switches there - don't know what each and every one does.<br />
<br />
To decrease a bisam file, you have to recreate it - that means bdbpre and bdbpost with the -k option.<br />

Then import to recreate the table.<br />
Usually we had space to rename/move the table files until after the import was done and everything checked out. Then we could safely delete them.</div></div><hr />
