<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 13:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just tried to create three new tables (Disus) in company 000, using the ttaad4230m000 - Create Tables session. But each time Baan comes back with a dialog box saying 0 Tables Created. There is no error message and nothing in the logs.<br />
<br />
If I use ttaad4100 I can create the tables no problem.<br />
<br />
Is ttaad4100 the only way to create tables in the tools company?<br />
<br />
I'm logged in as 'bsp' creating the tables in the patch VRC level.<br />
<br />
I should also say that this is a new install of Baan IVc4, UNIX, Oracle 806.<br />

Thanks<br />

If I look at the user record for 'bsp' the Package combination is set to B40Sc4 which is the B40U_c4_stnd VRC. <br />
<br />
So yes I'm connecting to the standard package combination and yes company 000 is attached to the B40Sc4 pkg com.<br />

Thanks<br />

I am not quite sure if your package combination setup is correct. Normally, your VRC's should be like B40_c4 connected to the package combination B40Sc4. The 'U' VRC's should be derived from the B40_c4 ones and should thus be one layer above the standard.</div></div><hr />

I've attached a document that shows some info with regards to the package set-up. I have compared with the same sessions on our production system and everything appears to be the same. The only difference is the staus of the package. On the production system the staus is Developed and on the test system it's set to Released.<br />

If you look at the first screenshot you made, you will see the field 'Derived from'. tcB40U_c4_stnd is derived from B40_c4. The latter one is the real 'standard' PVRC even though you have connected the first one to the 'standard' package combination. Basically you have 'shifted' the standard package combination one level up by connecting it to the standard update layer PVRC's. I am not sure if that's a wise thing to do and what would be the benefits of that.</div></div><hr />

When I created the B40U_c4_stnd VRC I was following the Baan PMC quick guide that comes with SP3. I pretty sure that I followed it to the letter when generating the update VRC. I've attached the quick guide just to show what process I went through. maybe I missed a step??<br />

<br />
Do you have a  B40Uc4 package combination? I think that should have been created and if not I would recommended doing so and attach all the update PVRC's to this, rather than to B40Sc4.<br />
<br />
layer 1: tcB40U_c4_stnd -&gt; B40Uc4<br />
<br />
layer 0: tcB40_c4 -&gt; B40Sc4<br />
<br />
You can then reassign the standard PVRC's back to the default package combination of B40Sc4 and attach co. 000 to it. (just like it as after a new install)</div></div><hr />

I don't have a B40Uc4 package combination (nor do I on my production server)<br />
<br />
I understand what you are saying and I will set the test system up as per your recommendations.<br />
<br />
On our production system we have the standard PVRC's attached to a 'TEMP' package combination and the 'stnd' PVRC's attached to the B40Sc4 PC?? Obviously the company that implemeted our Baan had their own idea in mind.........<br />
<br />
What's the impact of having Baan PVRC's set-up as I have now?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

From an operational point I can only see maybe one troublesome issue which is the fact that your co. 000 is now connected to your updated VRC rather than the standard. I can imagine this giving trouble with the installation of Tools patches. Additionally, you would have a much better 'logical' structure of your VRC tree.<br />
<br />
'TEMP' heh? That's a standard I have not heard of :)</div></div><hr />
