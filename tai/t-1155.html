Is it a &quot;easy&quot; solution for printing Barcodes without any hardware/cartridge/simms. <br />
<br />
I have read the Quick guides and the earlier postings related to Barcodes, but I did not &quot;pick up&quot; any clear answers to my question.<br />
<br />
Best regards <br />

<br />
actually it's quite simple.<br />
Find the printer driver ($BSE/lib/printinf/h/xxxxx)<br />
[h should be the directory name as it is a HP printer, xxxxx the name of the driver]<br />
if it is not already there, add the line<br />
barcode_dir=nnnn at the end of the file, before the line<br />
# User Defined<br />
nnnn is the name of a directory located under $BSE/lib/barcode<br />
Let's say you want this directory be called &quot;hp&quot;<br />
so you create a directory $BSE/lib/barcode/hp<br />
make sure that the owner is bsp and that bsp can access this dir<br />
Now you place a file called &quot;type01&quot; in this directory. (I will attach a sample file)<br />
Now you edit this file and place the correct leadin and leadout in the line &quot;echo &quot;hdhdhdhdhd&quot;$code at the bottom of the file.<br />
Now you can use &quot;User defined type/barcode type01&quot; in your report.<br />

Thanks for answering.<br />
I had done this, but used the type01 from Baan which was made for HP4. I tried your example and called it type02 and refered to it in the Report field.<br />
For both type01 and type02 no Barcode is printed. If I send it to &quot;D&quot; (Display) I can see &quot;#&amp; in front of the &quot;Prod order number&quot; that is defined with barcode in the report.<br />
<br />
There are no errrors in the log.filter6.1 file.<br />
<br />
You wrote:<br />

<br />
I have not changed this lines in your sample or in the file from Baan. Maybe this line is wrong according to the HP 5 laserjet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
this might indeed be the case.<br />
What I usually do to find out the right init-sequence is<br />
1) get a manual for the printer in question<br />
2) choose one of the example sequences usually provided there<br />
3) edit a plain unix file and enter the sequence plus a number to be printed in barcode<br />
4) directly send this file to the printer <br />
loop through 2 to 4 until barcode is printed<br />
Then put this sequence into the typexx file<br />
<br />
Keep on truckin' !<br />
<br />
