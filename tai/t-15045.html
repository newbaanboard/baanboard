We want to change am exisitng item code from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and there are all sorts of transactions in the company.<br />
<br />
Can it be done in the following way:<br />
1) Logout all used from BaaN.<br />
2) Take backup of the data.<br />
3) In the backup, search for the item code &quot;A&quot; and replace with &quot;B&quot; using any editor.<br />
4) Reload the modified backup by specifying &quot;Drop Existing Tables&quot;, &quot;Disable Domain &amp; Integrity Contraints&quot;.<br />
5) Reorganize Tables<br />
<br />
Should we able be able to get all the data related to item code &quot;A&quot; changed to &quot;B&quot;. It can be noted here that the codes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are used symbolically and I am sure that actual code is so peculiar that it would not be used anywhere else for some other meaning.<br />
<br />
Just want to know if the above procedure is possible. Has someone tried the stunt?<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">16th April 2004, 09:39</div></div><div class="posttext">There may be following problems<br />
<br />
1. Table delete may not succeed due to error like error 600.<br />
2. In case of table delete success, rebuild of large transaction table takes good <br />
amount of time.<br />
<br />
Though theoretically it seems perfect idea , I have never tried this and would <br />
not recommend this. Instead users need to be convinced about any functional solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we had the similar requirement.<br />
<br />
changing of item code and deleting bulk items.<br />
<br />
- we just generated the list of tables where item is used<br />
- exported them out using exchange<br />
- deleted the tables concerned<br />
- imported the data back using exchange. while importing we <br />
  used conditions for changing the item code.<br />
<br />
<br />
tks<br />

I tried it in the following manner and was successful in it.<br />
<br />
1) Created a test company and copied the data of live company in test company.<br />
2) Did company corrections in test company.<br />
3) Verified correct data in test company.<br />
4) Took backup of selected tables (which have item code) in the test company.<br />
5) Opened all the backup files in editor and &quot;Find-Replaced&quot; the item code.<br />
6) Restored the backup with &quot;Drop existing tables&quot; and &quot;Ignore referential integrity&quot;.<br />
7) Reorganized tables.<br />
<br />
And all the data was changed perfectly as intended.<br />
<br />
