<br />
Please be aware that the 6.1 porting set release has been discontinued and has been without support by Infor for a while.  If you continue to use BaanVI, you should update to the 9.x porting set release (latest 9.3c), which replaces the old one.  Unfortunately, the upgrade requires a few steps and also testing of the business processes, especially, if you are on an older version without the latest Service Pack and additional solutions.<br />
<br />
Also heads up, BaanIV is slowly being retired with first Infor changing the support and eventually retiring it, e.g., there will be no solutions provided anymore at some time.<br />
<br />
Itâ€™s time to move up to LN.<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />

PB<br />
Generally, you dont get any benefit moving from 6.1c.07.06 to 6.1c.19.<br />
What is the reason to move from old porting set to another old porting set?<br />

thanks for all the info.<br />
the thing is that we already have a plan to change the ERP but it's not going to be LN :(<br />
the reason why i need to upgrade the porting set is, since the new ERP will be at the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021, i want to put our Baan in a VM.  my HP servers have been running for 10 year now and i just want to secure the hardware until we switch to ne new ERP.<br />
<br />
is there any official end date for BaanIV ?<br />
<br />
