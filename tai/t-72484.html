<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvanta</div><div class="date">9th December 2019, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all.<br />
We by mistake deleted a tx table from ttadv4520m000 and did not run convert to runtime so data is present in all available copanies.<br />
We then re-created the table definition (using as a template the LIVE tx table that is the same)  but when trying to convert we are getting an error (see attached file).<br />
Please advice!<br />
Thank you for your help!<br />
<br />
( We have created the same thread in tools development as well. Not sure where is the best place so as to get a reply that could assist us at this point!!)<br />

Ensure the value provided is in agreement with the domain definition. <br />
Basically, you have bad data, the UTC number cannot be negative, correct/delete the record.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your answer!<br />
We found the error.  When re-creating the table we had a field that was double initially, re-created as date.<br />
We fixed the domain problem but we cannot convert to runtime getting the same error.  We did an sql on the table data and we saw that the field contains a date now.<br />
How we proceed from here?<br />

using SQL?The point is that convert has changed the domain of the field and data is wrong.<br />

If the data is correct but the data dictionary is incorrect, try to modify data dictionary (edit file or copy this file from live environment).</div></div><hr />

<br />
So now holds a value of &quot;1970-1-1..&quot; so now when running convert we get a 1000 error<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th December 2019, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this a production table or a table in a test environment?  If test you can wipe the data out and then export and re-import from production.  I used to this quite a bit towards the end baan 4c4.  I would actually put the old data dictionary file back in by hand - clean out the tables, then reconfigure it again. <br />
<br />
 It seemed every time we cloned certain test companies for our conversion we would have varying tables (1 or 2) that would have a problem kind of like this.  I never had to do anything in production and would not recommend this for a production company.  But in test - I would play with the data dictionary file until I could get to the table.  Then figure out the cleanup I needed. Which usually resulted in another export of 1 table and import of a table.</div></div><hr />

We finally did a backup restore.  Problem solved.<br />
