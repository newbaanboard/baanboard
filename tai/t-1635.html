Second, what is the definition of 'Properly configure'.<br />
<br />
From your point of view ?<br />
or <br />
Baan Company point of view ?<br />
or<br />
from a baan consultant point view ?<br />
<br />
The answer, I'm sure, will be different<br />
<br />
Would you share with us the method of<br />
'Properly Configure Auditing in Baan' ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a million !</div></div><hr />

In the installation guide (PDF) is described how to setup basic auditing requirements. These are for the parameter tables in each of the Baan companies. You can also get a list of mandatory tables from within the session 'Assign tables to database'.<br />
<br />
Tell your Baan guy to fix it :)</div></div><hr />

You will not know you need the audit information until it is too late.  You may never need it.  It is a type of insurance.  So..no one can tell you right or wrong for sure.<br />
<br />
However, Baan recommends that you audit at least the Parameters tables, as Pat suggest.  That is what I would consider &quot;properly configured&quot;.  This takes very little i/o.   Auditing the parameters table helps to no end when trying to find out why something is suddenly going wrong that was fine before.  The parameters have far reaching and sometimes unexpected results.  A quick check to the audit file for changed parameters often solves the problem in minutes.<br />
<br />
They do NOT recommend, and I don't think anyone would (user, Baan or consultant) that you audit transaction tables unless you have a specific problem and lenght of time to check for.  You may want a transaction table or 2 if you are performing Exchange via audit, but you would need to look at that requirement closely.</div></div><hr />

You just have to remember to print/review them before they &quot;roll over&quot;.</div></div><hr />
