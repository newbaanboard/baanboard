<br />
I'm currently attempting to upgrade porting set 6.1c.13 to 8.8a.03.<br />
<br />
I have read the Infor document &quot;Upgarde guide for porting set 8.7b.01 or Later&quot; and have confirmed that I have met the conditions for upgrading from 6.1c.xx to 8.x.<br />
<br />
I get an error during the final stages of the upgrade which says -<br />
<br />
&quot;ttbsi.000905: An error occurred while initializing the environment&quot;<br />
<br />
I've logged a call with Infor support but has anybody else come across this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw this error sometimes. The reason was a false entry in srdd_tab6.1, e.g. a missing table definition, package combination etc.<br />
So it was not a real error, but the installer was sensitive for any messages so &quot;he&quot; said that the installation was unsuccesful. <br />
<br />
You could check if ntbshell -v/bshell -v shows the new portingset version.<br />

<br />
When I cancelled the upgrade wizard I got a bit more information in the logs which says -<br />
<br />
&quot;INFO - Environment name contains invalid characters. Only characters in the range of [a..z0..9_] are allowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the upgrade wizard I have called my environment &quot;teeis10baan03&quot;. I'm not sure if the log is referring to this name or something else?<br />
<br />
bshell6.2 -v shows new porting set but how can I be sure everything has been upgraded correctly?<br />
<br />
Got some additional log entries -<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lebowski</div><div class="date">3rd May 2013, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmmh, the length of the environment name is unusual, but if this is the reason for the error I dont know.<br />
<br />
Could there any additional information be found in $BSE/log ?<br />
Is the installation and staging wizard up to date ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">3rd May 2013, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I changed the enviroment name to 6 characters which makes no difference.<br />
<br />
The install wizard is the latest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">7th May 2013, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to let you know the outcome.<br />
<br />
The new porting set creates new rc.x files in $BSE/etc with .nw at the end of the filename. However, it does not copy these over the existing rc.x files so when the installer wizard tries to start Baan after the porting set upgrade it is trying to use old x6.1 binaries and not the new x6.2 versions.</div></div><hr />
