<br />
We have planned &amp; tested the migration of our production company.<br />
<br />
What is the usual practice for migrating company 000. Considering the fact that we have hundreds of jobs, over a thousand users with differing authorisations etc.<br />
<br />
There is no migration s/w for company 000.<br />
<br />
Do we add all the users authorisations, jobs &amp; devices etc manually<br />
or <br />
do we export selected tables (users ,devices ..) from our existing production c3 company and build a 'production standard' c4 company 000<br />
in a separate environment. This could then be tested and copied back into production over the 'go live' weekend.<br />
<br />
Has anybody done this before &amp; if so which company 000 did you copy.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks - Mick</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can't copy company 000.<br />
It contains all the DD infos and SW-infos so that with the next convert to runtime you'll be lost.<br />
But what you can do of course is check whether the relevant tables in companny 000 have changed and if they didn't load your old stuff into them.<br />
These would be:<br />
ttaad2xx (User stuff)<br />
ttaad3xx printer stuff<br />
ttaad43x authorization stuff (never liked that concept anyway and can only discourage people from using it)<br />
--edited :<br />
You will have to pay special attention concerning authorizations ..... sessions/tables/fields may have changed .... careful here!!<br />
--end of edit<br />
The Job stuff (ttaad5xx) doesn't live in company 000, so that should be allright anyway when you did the migration.<br />
<br />
Simply check what is in your c3 system now in these tables and whether the table in question remains unchanged - so that you can simply load your records with bdbpost.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Just completed a c3 &gt; c4 and we did all our users and devices manually. The fact that we could do this on our new server straight away without any of the data in 000 being overwritten was a definite advantage.<br />
<br />
We were lucky that we only had about 50 users so it didn't take too long anyway. We use DEM for our menus so this was simply a case of exporting and importing the DEM model for the user authorisations.<br />
<br />
There is a definite difference between the user table in c3 and c4 although the device data table does look unchanged. The authorisation table at first glalnce also appears to be the same but please bear in mind that there is more than one table for authorisations.<br />
<br />
The fact that for us this was a manual exercise meant that we were also able to tidy up some of the data when we were doing it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<br />
actually there are 2 sessions, which might help you. There were written by Baan, when converting from Triton 3 to BaanIV, but they also work nicely between two Baan IV versions.<br />
<br />
ttcon61export can be used to export User data, Authorizations, Currencies , Device Data and Logical Tables. The import session obviously imports it.<br />
<br />
This might remove some of your headache, if you plan to make a clean c4 installation. <br />
<br />
Otherwise you might also install the c4 just on top of your old c3 and this way keep all of the mentioned data anyway. The only disadvantage to me seems to be, that in this case the old c1 tools objects are still lying around, even if they are not used anymore.<br />
<br />

Do you know whether the import option gives you the option to append or overwrite?<br />
I dont have an environment to test in at the moment.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for the info'<br />

What I did to make life much easier is that I did Tools first.  After that, I installed all the services packs for the applications thru PMC.</div></div><hr />
