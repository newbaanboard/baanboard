The background of the shortcutbar, navigation area, properties area or information area? In fact, you can only modify the startup page of Worktop, opened in the information area (on the right). Worktop automatically opens the resources\welcome.html file located in the Worktop directory, so you could modify this file.<br />
However, the background of all areas except the shortcutbar adapt to the &quot;windows theme&quot; used. So when you change your windows theme (from the control panel-&gt;display-&gt;appearences), Worktop will adapt to the change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The splash screen of Worktop is stored under the name &quot;WTsplash.bmp&quot; in the \resources directory of the Worktop installation. If you rename or remove this file, Worktop will not be able to find it and thus not show it (Wortktop won't crash on it).<br />
<br />
If you use BW only, there is no way to remove the splash screen. It is part of the language specific resource dll located in the \res directory of the BW client installation. <br />
There might be a workaround however, depending on your situation. Why do you exactly want to remove this splash screen?<br />

It seems to be the onbly way to see properly it's version!<br />
<br />
Anyway it is very simple to change:<br />
<br />
Just exchange the bwlogo.bmp in the lib directory on the client.<br />
You coult put your company logo and other information if you want.<br />
<br />
You can also change the small baan window, which pop's up everytime a session is started. This one is located on your server in the gif directory. There you willalso find the grafics, which are used for the buttons of your bw gui.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ivo Ladage</div><div class="date">10th October 2002, 10:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Soem different splash screens are described here. You will get a splash screen when you start BW or Worktop but also when you start  a session from BW or Worktop. <br />
For Worktop and BW client on Baan 5, it is as i described before. For the BW client on Baan 4 there is indeed a bwlogo.bmp file in the \lib directroy, however the splash screen will still appear if you remove this file, it only won't show this icon in the splash screen.<br />
For the splash screen appearing when you run a session, the icon is stored on the Baan server and called by the 4GL engine. You can customize the icon but don't know what happens if you remove it. I guess that BW will not be too &quot;happy&quot; if you do this...<br />
