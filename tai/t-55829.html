<br />
we try to move an installation of baanIV from HP-UX to Linux. The porting set shoud be the same portingset as on the old machine (6.1c.07.10).<br />
I copied all files from the old machine to the linux server, install the linux portingset and try to create shm_param with shmvalues6.1.<br />
Every time when i start shmvalues6.1 i get a different result. And when i try to start the baan environment with rc.start i get an error when starting the shared memory:<br />
<br />
Failed to attach any segment. Invalid argument.<br />
<br />
Can you help me???</div></div><hr />

Each operating system has the binary programs compiled and distributed for it.  On the porting set CD, you should find a directory for HP-UX and on for Linux.  The last version I installed looked for a specific version of Red-Hat.  There was a version file that I put in the Red-Hat version, although I was installing on Ubuntu, Baan and Oracle have been running fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
try removing the shm_param or making a blank one. at one point they did away with that and made it dynamic, the shm_param might be hurting you.<br />
<br />
if not, get the install guide for linux and go through it, there are kernel parameters that you need to adjust before starting baan up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">19th May 2009, 02:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave's correct, and also refer to the Release/Technical notes for the Porting Set:<br />
<br />
[UNIX/Linux] Shared memory allocation changed<br />
With porting set 8.3a.01, the allocation of a shared memory segment changed; the memory segments are allocated dynamically instead of based on the predefined addresses in $BSE/lib/shm_param with a default fixed size.<br />
Use previous shared memory manager behavior (not recommended)<br />
It is also possible to fall back to the previous shared memory behavior by using the parameter file $BSE/lib/shm_param.<br />
The binary shm_values6.2 is removed, so you can no longer generate a new shm_param file. To fall back to the previous shared memory behavior you can change $BSE/lib/defaults/all by adding the following line: shm_compat_mode:1</div></div><hr />

I installed an newer Porting Set Version (6.1c.07.13) and use the shm_config file. It works very fine.</div></div><hr />
