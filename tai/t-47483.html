<br />
I have a problem with printing of Audit files, maybe you can give me a hint.<br />
<br />
When I print the audit files with my own user account, I get more results than printing in a job process (with user root000). The User and Audit permissions are the same for both users. So I can't find any reason why 2 users get different results.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea?<br />

<br />
from the name &quot;root000&quot; I would assume that this user lives in company 000.<br />
Maybe that is the reason?<br />
Besides, are you sure that the values selected on the screen are indeed the same? Once a job is defined, I find it difficult to see which parameters have been choosen at starttime without having a look at the dumped ttaad503 table.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

When you added session to job what was your answer on question:<br />
&quot;Consider the diference between entered date and system date&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but this is not true.<br />
Have a look at ttaad500 / 501 / 502 / 503 in your &quot;working&quot; company. Jobs defined for compay 123 will be found in ttaad5xx of company 123.<br />

That is true, but I am talking about audit data. And I made mistake in my previous answer - audit data are stored in files on disk, but I am quite sure that job for printing audit data must be in company 000.<br />

you are absolutely right - <br />
the job to evaluate the audit data runs in company 000<br />

<br />
thanks for your answers. I have found the significant difference. When I run the printing I do it in company 720. When I put the session in the job, the job runs in Company 000. However I let the job start with the following entries: <br />
<br />
tpac.f:=&quot;aa&quot;<br />
table.f:=&quot;aaa000&quot;<br />
tpac.t:=&quot;zz&quot;<br />
table.t:=&quot;zzz999&quot;<br />
comp.f:=&quot;720&quot;<br />
comp.t:=&quot;720&quot;<br />
seqn.f:=&quot;0&quot;<br />
seqn.t:=&quot;999&quot;<br />
tran.f:=&quot;&quot;<br />
tran.t:=&quot;999999999999999999999&quot;<br />
session.f:=&quot;&quot;<br />
session.t:=&quot;zzzzzzzzzzzzz&quot;<br />
date.f:=date()+-400<br />
date.t:=date()+0<br />
time.f:=&quot;0&quot;<br />
time.t:=&quot;2400&quot;<br />
user.f:=&quot;&quot;<br />
user.t:=&quot;zzzzzzzzzzzz&quot;<br />
comd:=&quot;1&quot;<br />
abrd:=&quot;2&quot;<br />
prpd:=&quot;2&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I also consider the date in the job - this can't be the reason. So my problem is the following.<br />
<br />
In company 720 I get the desired results with my user. <br />
<br />
In company 000 I get much less audit data though I let the job run for company 720. How do I have to configure the job that I get correct audit data?<br />
<br />

Could you compare data in both cases? What is missing or different?<br />
One idea - if companies 000 and 720 are in different package combinations is it maybe problem if table has different data dictionary in these package combinations?<br />
Try to print audit for one table only and compare results in both cases.</div></div><hr />
