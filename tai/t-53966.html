    When you put restrictive conditions for a user per session, the user will subsequently face slowing down of that particular session. However this would only happen when the user starts the session for the first time. Thereafter they shouldnt face any major slow down untill they log off. <br />
<br />
The way you define the restrictive conditions also plays a major role in slowing up of sessions.<br />
