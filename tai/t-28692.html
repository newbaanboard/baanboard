<br />
Currently we are working on migration from c3 to c4.<br />
We would like to keep the existing Oracle 7.3.4 version but new Porting Sets do not support it as far as I have seen.<br />
Can we use 'ora8_srv' to connect to Oracle 7.3.4 for example?<br />
We have installed c4 over c3 without the porting sets and no problem occurred. But when we installed the Service Packs for Tools, the system was corrupted, I guess because of old Porting Set version.<br />
<br />
Any experience and advice would be very helpful.<br />
Thank you.<br />
