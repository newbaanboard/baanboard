<br />
While installing BaaN IV c4 with Oracle 8i on Windows NT, during the final step, i.e, when the installer starts importing tools tables' we are encountering the error:<br />
<br />
Can't lock table (error 1000) <br />
<br />
and the loading of all the tables have been failed.<br />
<br />
the user through which installation was done : baan which was created in Oracle database.<br />
<br />
Can somebody through some light on this. How to avoid this error. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i) Is the logged in user authorised to use the database not only the baan user<br />
<br />
ii) Does event manager give you any more information or even the log files.</div></div><hr />

Flushed at ora_driver.c $ $Revision: /main/bugfix6.1c/10 $ : #422.<br />
<br />
To your first point:<br />
The logged in user in NT is also baan who has full (dba) access to the underlying database.<br />
<br />
As you observe in the event viewer message, this part:<br />
Error BDB-1000 returned.<br />
Logon 'baan' as 'baan' failed; errno 0 <br />
<br />
I dont clear get...whats wrong with it.<br />
<br />
I've checked up the tabledef6.1 for tables assigning to the database.<br />
All seem to be okay.. <br />
<br />
user 'baan' has DBA privilege with Admin option in the Oracle database.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ?!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and have a good one!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">19th April 2002, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that the error message is comming from<br />
Prog ora7_srv file ora_native.c $ $Revision: /main/bugfix6.1c/12 $ # 2084 <br />
<br />
What Oracle version was selected during the installation of Baan? Seems like Baan is using the ora7_srv instead of the ora8_srv [?] to connect and this may explain your problems.<br />
<br />
See the thread http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9 for Oracle8 installations on NT/w2k</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you using the normal install wizard from the master cd?<br />
Everything I read about supported Oracle versions (including on BaanBoard) is saying you cannot install 8i directly: <br />
<br />
You first have to install Oracle8 and then upgrade to 8i. <br />
<br />
Or am I wrong?<br />
(Are there any (really) fresh new on this subject?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Thanks all of you for your help...I've almost tried maximum my best to solve this problem...could not really crack it out.<br />
<br />
  Actually thinking of changing the database itself...<br />
<br />
 If anyone, meanwhile come across any solution...please do let  me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Warans<br />

Have a good one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">24th April 2002, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the error message it seems that the baan user has problems accessing the oracle db. Normally that means that the crypted password in ora_users is wrong.<br />
<br />
A way to check that is by using qptool and try to retrieve some data that's already in the baan database (so in oracle)<br />
I would suggest that you set the env. variable BDB_DEBUG also in order to have a trace file which gives you some more detailed info.<br />
<br />
If the password is wrong than you have a problem because on NT you don't have the encrypt executable.<br />
<br />
If it's related to Oracle8(i) you should check which driver is used an maybe the driver for the other version will work.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if it only an installation you can probably start fresh as well.<br />

I think you need to check the version of the master cd. You might need the latest version.</div></div><hr />
