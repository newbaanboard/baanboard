<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I am working on modifying some of the drawing display functionality.  In 4c, you specified the viewer package in EDM parameters.  In 5c, this is gone.  The DLL (tiedmdll0020) code has a function call: image.display(filename) .  I cannot figure out what program this actually calls to display the drawing.  I would hope that this is configurable somewhere within Baan.  Does anyone have any clue?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The functionality in Baan V has changed for EDM and drawing attachments.  In Baan V the only type of drawings that can be opened or viewed are of file type *.gif, which are opened with a browser (usually Internet Explorer or Netscape).  <br />
<br />
This is a limitation of Baan-V that was not present in Baan-IV.<br />
<br />
I guess viewing drawings was an unnecessary &quot;feature&quot; in Baan IV. :mad: <br />
<br />
So, I ended up customizing a few components myself.  I have placed a viewer program field on the EDM parameters table/form and have altered the library that displays drawings so that it calls this program.  It now works for me like it did in IVc4. :)</div></div><hr />
