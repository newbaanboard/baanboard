<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JustaPackfan</div><div class="date">3rd December 2010, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">While running on some sessions, an error keeps showing up in the $BSE/log/log.bshell6.2 file as follows:<br />
   Log_mesg: You are running without reference checks<br />
<br />
I believe this is a result of some parameter setup setting, not specific to any particular session.  It appears to show up for all users.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on how I can deactivate this logging message?  It fills up the log file with the repeated message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you post your $BSE/lib/tabledef6.2 and anything in your $BSE/lib/defaults directory?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marnix</div><div class="date">6th December 2010, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you in a migration-like scenario?  This bshell is apparently running with the -norefs command line flag, which is dangerous in production and necessary during some migrations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JustaPackfan</div><div class="date">7th December 2010, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running this environment in support of Archive/Purge testing (using standard Baan/Infor archiving).  Not using this in any migration efforts.<br />
The $GSE/lib/tabledef6.2 contains entries for each of our companies (we have 53) such as<br />
*:100:oracle8(ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME=edm1pe0,TNS_ADMIN=/opt/oracle/local/config)<br />
All entries are similar except for the company number (in this example, company is 100).<br />
<br />
the $BSE/lib/defaults contains the following files<br />
   all<br />
   bspilerh.ksh<br />
   db_resource<br />
   opt.server<br />
I did not see any type of reference to any object or setting that would resemble &quot;norefs&quot; or &quot;refs&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
However I believe you are onto something, I do see a &quot;norefs&quot; value showing up in these files called log.baanlogin in the $BSE/lib/ora directories such as:<br />
080210_09:49:57 rgs5618 dcacd241 client: OTHER /opt/edm1/baan0/bse/bin/bshell6.2 -norefs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JustaPackfan</div><div class="date">7th December 2010, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I had just received confirmation that the &quot;norefs&quot; setting is substantiated via standard Baan/Infor processing during the Archive process of general data.  So this is an intended setting, though I wish it would have been more documented as such.</div></div><hr />
