<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gphares</div><div class="date">25th August 2003, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I have several jobs set up in the Baan Job Management section that will not run reliably.  They may run for hours or days successfully but stop suddenly for no reason leaving a defunct process which takes up a lot of CPU time.  We have over 100 runs running successfully so I feel confident that we have the jobs set up correctly.  It's just a few renegade jobs that sporadically fail.  <br />
<br />
What happening is that the program finishes the last line of code (we've proven that) but never terminates.  It leaves the status of the job as &quot;running&quot; and starts accumulating tons of CPU time.  <br />
<br />
We are running the rc.startjob command from a Unix crontab command.  Also, we are running Baan IVc3, Oracle, and Unix/AIX if it matters.<br />
<br />
All help appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
A defect was submitted to PEG Tools based on your reproduction scenario and they have recently responded with a comment that with the current architecture of the bshell (application server) they cannot provide a fix to the problem that occurs here.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
PEG Tools explains the problem in the following text:<br />
*** May 26 2003 2:11PM *** gvdwal ***<br />
The session prints to a report. That report is a seperate process in the bshell.<br />
When the session aborts then the report will not receive a close message and will stay waiting for new data.<br />
Therefor the bshell will not end while there is still a process running to receive data.<br />
*** May 27 2003 3:14PM *** gvdwal ***<br />
I tried serveral option to send a signal to the report object to stop as soon the session stops.<br />
But it was not posible.<br />
The report is waiting for a bucket message and the bucket message is not send when the session died.<br />
It is posible to receive a bms message when a process died but these message are send as bms message.<br />
And bms messages are seperated from the bucket messages.<br />
And the receive.bucket function has only one variant and it will wait till it receive the bucket.<br />
Just before the receive bucket it is posible to check if the parent is running.<br />
However during the receive and that is the maintime it is not posible to detect that the parent has died.<br />
So there is no solution for this problem.<br />
In the bshell there is however the functionality for session_timeout.<br />
This will stop the bshell if there are only inactive sessions for over 30 minutes or more (As defined)<br />
If that option is used then the bshell will stop after 30 min. If the job hangs on the report.<br />
WORK-AROUND:<br />
See solutions 110907 and 110908 for details on the SESSION_TIMEOUT variable.</div></div><hr />
