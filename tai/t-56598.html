<br />
Not sure if this is related to Tools Admin or functional .....<br />
<br />
<br />
We are planning to do Archiving for our baan production co. I already went half way through the standard baan document ( Document Code: U7843B US ) , within the document baan has mentioned an important note regaridng the sharing of data betwen Prod co. and archive co., refer to below quote <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Linking several other tables, such as the General Item Data (tcibd001) table or the Business Partners (tccom100) table might seem beneficial. However, linking these tables can lead to severe loss of data and is therefore not permitted.If these tables are also to be linked, the content of one or more reference fields becomes empty in the operational company and the archive company.<br />
<br />
When you start an archive session, in general, one of the first steps is to copy the general data. In some archive sessions, this step is optional. In several other archive sessions, however, this step is mandatory. During this copying process, some of these general data tables are copied twice from the operational company to the archive company. In the first copy, specific reference fields are emptied in the archive company. When you copy the table the second time, all data is copied from the operational company to the archive company. This special copying process is required to prevent reference errors during the coping process. <br />
<br />
This process can technically be read in the script tcmcsdll0008 where, for some<br />
tables, the following two functions are listed to perform the copy process:<br />
* tccom.dll0026.archive.table<br />
* tccom.dll0025.archive.table<br />
<br />
The function tccom.dll0026.archive.table also calls a function empty.ref.fields, which empties one or more reference fields for the specified table.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For migration the stratergy which we were planning was that we shall share almost all the master data between Baan production company &amp; archive co. and then run archiving sessions, but baan is suggesting that we should copy master data such as General Data ( item master, business partner etc etc) from production co. to archive co. otherwise it would lead to loss of data. I am still unable to understand how it would lead to loss of data , if we share the master data between prod. &amp; archive co. :eek:<br />
<br />
Can somebody explain this with a help of a small example ?? :confused:<br />
<br />

<br />
When you copy your data into your Archive company, all data in your archive company should be static. Meaning it should not change at all.<br />
<br />
If you are just sharing your data, and for example you delete an Item, it will be at the same time deleted from your archiving company and probably it will delete some more data accoding to your database definitions.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, probably coping all data as indicated in the procedure will be better; you will use more disk space in your archiving company but your data is safe.<br />
<br />

<br />
I fully agree that the master data has to copied over the archive company and not shared.<br />
<br />
The purpose of having an archive company is to have static old data and not dynamic changing data. Though Infor gives the option to have the tables shared, it is highly recommended to copy the master data to the archive company.<br />

<br />
So do you mean to say that probably once the archiving is finished, we can/should drop master data tables from archive co. and then share the master tables between archiving &amp; production ... :(<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as static data is concerned, if you probably let baan copy master data, at the end of archiving process , you would end up having 2 copies of item master i.e. 1 in prod. company and 1 in archive co. :rolleyes:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">26th August 2009, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">No, there should be no master data table sharing between a prod company and an archive company.  If memory serves, tccom000 and tfgld004 are the only tables that should be shared (although I would have to double check).<br />
<br />
Yes, you will end up with duplicate copies of your master data.  However, they will not be exact duplicates because the archiving session will only copy referenced master data.  So if a particular item is not used in the data set you are archiving, it will not exist in the archive company.<br />
<br />
Unless you are going to create your own archiving scheme completely separate from the Baan sessions, I recommend following the document provided by Baan.  We also have consultants on staff who are very good with archiving if you would like assistance.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
