<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anandpr1989</div><div class="date">16th February 2018, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. Thanks for the information.<br />
<br />
So, for development purpose what client we can use? Except BECS (BW).</div></div><hr />

With new releases, its important for everyone to adopt the new technologies and platform for Supportability. Change is constant in the IT world.<br />

KB 1626966 <br />
Information about the Installation and Configuration of LN Studio for working in ERP LN and information for (the set-up of) debugging of ERP LN in LN Studio for Infor (Support) Staff. <br />
Resolution: <br />
LN Studio is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which replaces the LN classic tools for developing and maintaining LN related software components, as such it is primarily a development tool.<br />
<br />
LN Studio can help support analysts in their day to day work as well. You might have noticed that the LN UI interface does not allow to use certain classic tools session, for example Program Scripts / Libraries (ttadv2530m000). For those kind of programs you can use LN Studio. Within this article detailed information is given about several topics of LN Studio interesting for support analysts.<br />
<br />
In the attachments of this article you will find several word documents and briefings (movies) which will help you with the installation, the configuration and the usage of LN Studio.  <br />
<br />
We advise you to go through the documents and movies in sequential order. It's up to you if you read the document, watch the briefing, or combine them both. We have named them as 1A and 1B and 2A and 2B etc. as indicator how they relate to each other. An exception is topic 4. The word document describes the set-up for debugging using the LN UI, whereas the briefing gives instructions about the debug process itself.<br />

KB 1637273 Customization process in LN 10.4 <br />
Description: <br />
Will Infor LN from 10.4 onwards allow the Customization process (Dynamic Form Editor, Reports Layout Editor…) ?<br />
We can make it from BW (but I’ve heard that in the close/medium future this also will be NOT SUPPORTED).<br />
 Anyway for a customer is a little bit strange the fact that they have to use that “old environment (BW)” to customize some elements. <br />
 <br />
Resolution: <br />
LN Studio is the way forward for any kind of customization activity in LN 10.4</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">18th February 2018, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Our developers still use BW as well. I don't know why they don't want to start use LN Studio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rochus</div><div class="date">26th February 2018, 07:43</div></div><div class="posttext">There are much better options for debugging in LN Studio compared to bw.<br />
Last versions are stable and there are lot of nice features.<br />
so give them a try.<br />
<br />

user datra template is gone in newer versions (or not used anymore).<br />

hello everybody <br />
<br />
I had the same issue with the mots of  LNUI installation. Only in one installation I can see the help in BW/BECS.<br />
<br />
Maybe This KB  can help you: <br />
