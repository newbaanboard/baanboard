<br />
I'm taking a look at the SMTP eMessage Connector and setting a SMTP as a SMTP printer. Does the SMTP Device support SMTP authentication?<br />
<br />
I've been trying to send email via a gmail account and discovered that Authentication is required. I've not seen anywhere on the SMTP device any entry for a username and password.<br />
<br />
I am currently using AIX 6.1. The other options is to figure out how to get a printer device set up to make use of mailx in the AIX system (though I'm not very familiar with LN or AIX) this seems to be my thoughts if the LN doesn't support Authentication. Would appreciate any feedback on this.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Thanks.<br />
<br />
The SMTP  ttcmfsmtp  has no authentication. I am trying to see how to use an existing SMTP server but am not totally familiar with SMTP stuff.. Ideally if i could get Gmail to be used, that would be good.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that I set the Unix machine as an SMTP server and then use the SMTP connector and it should be able to function? I'm new to Unix. We now use google mail but does this mean i would have 2 sources of email.<br />
1) Google Mail for everyday use<br />
2) The Unix server as a email server that is dedicated to just sending out reports and i use a mail client just to retrieve from this email server <br />
<br />
The drawback about using outlook is that using a single client online fulltime isn't the best of ideas if I'm generating reports. So ideally would like something on the server side shooting out emails via a scheduled job.<br />
<br />
I have read up things on SendEmail and Mailx and so far it's quite a fairly complex procedure.</div></div><hr />

We are on the Unix servers. I just noticed that you were on Windows. I wouldn't suggest for 2 sources of email, creates more confusion and maintenance overhead.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can get Nazdaq's email tools (http://www.nazdaq-it.com), if you do not have in-house technical expertise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go some information from the Nazdaq tools... A bit pricy but we might look into it.<br />
<br />
Actually I have both Windows and Unix machines for separate customers running. Windows can handle stuff with Outlook pretty well i guess..<br />
Its the Unix that is a problem.</div></div><hr />
