To do that Baan-documentation said that:<br />
after rc.stop script <br />
we have restart<br />
Shmmanager6.1 -I <br />
and Tbase6.1 -I, <br />
and then Tbase6.1 -I<br />
&amp; Shmmanager6.1 -uk<br />
and after that FULL BACKUP script.<br />
<br />
In your opinion - are all that steps needed for secure backup?<br />
and<br />
Can we put licmon6.1 -k into rc.stop script<br />
( this is only command which we now have to run manually)?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
After the backup you can start the environment again.<br />

Yes, I can do it all manually, but - the problem is that I do not want to do it that way;<br />
We want to make it all automatic - croned by night saturday to sunday.<br />
That's the reason I want to put licmon -k into a script, but is it OK,<br />
and if something can't be &quot;killed&quot; is it ok to be killed with kill -9?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th June 2002, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless you have major problems with hanging licenses I would not stop the license daemon for every backup but rather once a week for example. In that scenario you can leave the licmon6.1 -k out. If you are using tbase then the safest way to backup is to stop everything (except the license daemon maybe). <br />
<br />
If you want more robustness and flexibility in your backups, then you should consider switching to a proper RDBMS like Oracle or Informix.</div></div><hr />

It was my opinion too but I wanted to get it confirmed.<br />
<br />
Thanks - my next backup script will work that way....<br />

I know that it has to be sometimes but be warned!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">4th June 2002, 21:17</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a clarification sometime back - <br />
<br />
Do not use kill -9 (sure kill).  This may be adversely affecting the license manager.  Please use kill -15 (software termination kill).</div></div><hr />
