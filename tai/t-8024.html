<br />
As mentioned in an earlier message I am helping out one of our sites that is running Baan.<br />
<br />
At the moment the site is running IVb2 and we are looking to upgrade this to IVc5 so we have no support issues.<br />
<br />
As a non Baan person I have no idea whether this is a few patches or a major, major upgrade.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate it if anyone would comment on the size of this task, whether we can jump straight from IVb2 to IVc5 or do we need to go through the individual patch levels .... and whether it is something onsite support should be able to handle.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />

Anyway, you can directly migrate to c4 from b2. It is not a small exercise. Some Finance tables are split in c4. Also, there are Service Packs available which need to be installed after migration.</div></div><hr />

It took us, to migrate from b2 to c4, 20 days!! There was around 45 GB of data. Of course there were customizations, which took another 10 days, but nothing standard was changed.<br />
Also, there are two methods of migration -<br />
1. Upgrading b2 to c4 on the same machine.<br />
2. Installing c4 on a new machine, and then importing the customizations of b2.<br />
<br />
Option 2 is a safer one.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
