Hello,<br />
this has been discussed a lot:<br />
<br />
Virtual Server support<br />
VMware<br />
The following statements apply to the Infor ERP LN 6.1 and ERP 5 Microsoft Windows x86 distribution and Linux x86 distribution:<br />
With Enterprise Server 8.3 and later, it is supported to run ERP LN 6.1 on VMware for demo and test purposes. However, benchmarks show that ERP LN in OS environments directly on the hardware performs better than ERP LN in a VMware Server environment. Therefore, Infor will not handle performance support calls when ERP LN runs on a VMware Server environment.<br />
Distributions on VMware ESX 3.5 and ESXi 3.5 are supported for all purposes, including production. When you size the system, take the overhead of VMware ESX/ ESXi into account. For guidelines, see the ERP LN sizing guide. 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and 32-bit and 64-bit Linux are both supported in combination with VMware.<br />
Note: Since the Infor SLM Server (Solution License Manager) is not supported in a virtual server environment it must be setup on a separate nonvirtual server. SLM Client is supported in a VMware environment.<br />
Disclaimer: The previous support statement of VMware ESX/ESXi 3.5 does not extend to any third-party product. For example, if the DBMS vendor does not support VMware ESX, the porting set is still supported on VMware ESX, but the DBMS is not. In this case, a solution is to run in 3-tier mode and configure the DBMS on another, non-virtual, system.<br />
<br />
HP Integrity VM<br />
With Enterprise Server 8.3 and porting set 8.3a.01 or later, it is supported to run ERP LN 6.1 with HP-UX on HP Integrity VM for demo and test purposes. Infor Global Support will not handle performance related inquiries about running ERP LN with HP-UX in a HP Integrity VM environment; support is limited to test and demo environments.<br />
HP Integrity Virtual Machines with the ERP LN 6.1 HP-UX IA64 distribution are supported.<br />
Note that the Infor SLM Server (Solution License Manager) is not supported in a virtual server environment. SLM Client can run on a virtual server<br />
environment. <br />
<br />
