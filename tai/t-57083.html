<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">26th October 2009, 12:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally such estimates depend on CPU speed , cpu load , available memory , IO  sped etc. So difficult to give any such exact idea. However for  us  it had taken half a day .<br />
<br />
Recommend u to do a testing on this before final import with a possibility to drop the same if not required later on .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th October 2009, 06:05</div></div><div class="posttext">While doing a migration of this sort  ,we had imported  daily export of production data to the target new environment and estimated the appx import time ourselves. Also we had increased order number digits from 6 to 7 , done other testing with that data . Subsequently we recreated the tables and imported the data again at the final time .<br />
<br />
U too can adopt this methodology if suitable to ur requirement .</div></div><hr />
