 lp -dprinterl -oc file.txt<br />
<br />
I looked at the Device Data in BaaN and I see a unique driver being used to print from BaaN (two different drivers - one for Portrait and the other for Landscape).   Could someone tell me how I can include the driver option in the above lp command or is there any other way to print on landscape format directly from Unix?<br />

Appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />

If this is not available on HP-UX you could get the GNU version.<br />
<br />
This is a program that converts text files to postscript. It has lots of features/flexibility - rotation==landscape, font selection, print-tray selection, media size,  etc<br />
<br />
[eg:  enscript -r -fCourier7 -MA4 -dpkpedp2 /etc/hosts]<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 06:16</div></div><div class="posttext">To print landscape use the same print command you would use as printing in portrait except in the Driver section of the Device Data you would simply use the landscape driver.<br />
<br />
You will have a driver for portrait and one for landscape, thus have one device that is portait and one for landscape - same physical printer, two devices in Baan.<br />
<br />
If you want to print portait/duplex or landscape/duplex, you would create two new devices and two new driver files too, if you feel so inclined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
when you print from Baan on an HP-Ux Server, thenactually two drivers are invloved:<br />
<br />
a) The Baan driver is the one you see in &quot;Device Management&quot;. This one is an ascii file used by the filter6.1 binary of Baan to replace generic escape sequences by printer specific sequences.<br />
<br />
b) The HP river is the one you will find somewhere below /var/spool/lp/interfaces. This one is actually a shell script, which interprets some of the options passed to the lp command.<br />
<br />
Now some conclusions:<br />
<br />
1) The &quot;oc&quot; options only works, if the driver you used by creating the printer  in HP-Ux is actually supporting this option. You will only know this, if you check the driver script. <br />
<br />
2) The Baan driver can not be directly used in the lp command. But you can analyse the driver in $BSE/lib/printinf and try to use the escape sequences defined under &quot;initpr&quot; and &quot;resetpr&quot;. These are ordinary PCL escape sequences, which Baan sends at the start of printing and which put your printer in landscape mode.<br />
<br />
You can also just get some PCL documentation from HP webssite.<br />
<br />
3) Last of all, enscript sounds like a good idea to me. You can get a precompiled version from http://eigen.ee.ualberta.ca<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />
<br />
Markus<br />
<br />
P.S.: Try o avoid remote printing under HP-Ux, use hppi (formerly known as jetadmin) instead. Remote printing will discard a lot of your options!</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all your input, guys.<br />
