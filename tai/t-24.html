<br />
I installed BaaN IVc on Windows NT 4.0 with Oracle 8.0.5.<br />
<br />
Everything seems to work fine except Tools. When I'm trying to launch sessions from this package (e.g. &quot;Maintain sessions&quot;) I get the message &quot;Package VRC unknown&quot;.<br />
<br />
An other problem is that I can't login to BaaN with other users except user baan. I set up these users in Oracle and NT (applic, bsp, tools, root), but I get the error message &quot;Error 514 (Security error; probably no permission) on ttadv002000 in db_first&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Bogdan</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your 2 questions:<br />
<br />
Unable to use tools sessions: package VRC unknown:<br />
<br />
You have to setup a proper developer's profile for your user (baan, bsp) and assign a default package VRC to it (ttaad0140m000)<br />
<br />
Unable to login: error 514:<br />
<br />
This is an authentication error from Baan -&gt; Oracle/Informix. You can check the $BSE/lib/ora/ora_users file first and make sure that all users have an entry and that the encrypted password = database user password<br />
<br />
Otherwise I know that NT installations used to create a wrong baan group in $BSE/lib/ora/ora_groups (not baandb but baandbc or something like that). There are several cases on this topic on the Baan support website on how to fix this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Also with that info, you may have installed a patch that has effected the Tools VRC structure. If possible, run the 'Convert Tools to Run Time', just in case you have installed a new patch in the last few days. <br />
<br />
A similar things once happened to me, but I lost the entire Utils module as well, took me 3 days to sort out. Absolute nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bogdan</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 11:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help, but I can't run session ttaad0140m000 (it doesn't exist).<br />
<br />
But in session &quot;Maintain developer autorization by package VRC&quot; ttadv0141m000 I have been inserted a record with user baan and package=tt, VRC=B40c1, authorizations for all modules and languages. No result.<br />
<br />
I'll check BaaN support too.<br />
<br />
Thank you again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you done a convert to runtime for the user? Plus, check that the tools files are there in the directory structure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to set your current VRC, initially this is blank.<br />
All the development/customisation sessions require a 'current VRC' before your can enter them<br />
<br />
Can't remember the session code, but its under User Data - Developers data...<br />
<br />
PS - if you only have standard Baan VRCs, you can't set them to be current!  You get an error like 'no authorisation for standard', in that case you have to add a single temporary VRC and set that as current.  Once you get in, then you can setup stuff properly.<br />
<br />
Hope that's clear<br />
<br />
Oh yes, error 514 must be due to not adding the database user, under Database administration - RDBMS admin - Link Baan to DB user (don't forget to conv to runtime)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">The session to use are:<br />
<br />
ttadv0110m000: Maintain Development Parameters by User<br />
ttadv0145m000: Maintain General Developers Authorizations<br />
ttadv0141m000: Maintain Development Authorizations by Package VRC<br />
ttadv0140m000: Change Current Package VRC of User<br />
<br />
They can all be found under User management, developer's data<br />
<br />
Sorry for giving you the wrong session code earlier.:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bogdan</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you all for help.<br />
<br />
I did set up the development parameters for users, I did convert to runtime and all.<br />
But: few minutes ago I did a Check table and I found an error 512 on table ttiex188000.<br />
Maybe because I tryied to import a tools patch and this action crashed. I try to do it again today but I got an error message (data dictonary corrupted).<br />
Is there a possibility to reinstall only the Tools ?<br />
<br />
Thank you again.<br />
<br />
P.S. This site is realy cool ! Congratulations to webmasters and everybody else who build it !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, it is possible to recover the tools applications and modules, data is another problem (it depends on your database setup and backup solution)<br />
<br />
Sadly, with a data dictionary corruption, a restore is one of the few ways to solve it without getting a consultant in there and looking at the problem first.<br />
<br />
And yes, I have come across this problem and solved it, but it took ages and stopped the company working (due to the database solution installed).<br />
<br />
This is one of the problems, the possibility has to be considered at install time.<br />
<br />
It looks like during a patch of tools (always a problem), you suffered a crash or manually stopped the install. This has lead to a corruption of your tools module. No matter what you play about with here, you are sort of in a screwed situation. <br />
<br />
Recovery has to be at a file level to start with, this involves recovery of the tt files and the dict files. Then a check has to be done on the table definintions to see if there is any problems there. If so, then you have to recover your 000 table. Unless this has been saved as a seperate file (ie seperate instances, data dump or other) the you will have to recover the whole of your data for this. This means that any work done since the backup you are recovering is lost. Okay, you can dump the company as it stands but an average idea of how long this kind of work is about 3 - 4 DAYS... Its a lot of prep and work and should only be done by an experience consultant if you have any worries about doing it yourself</div></div><hr />

<br />
check whether you find a file $BSE/tools/dd/dttiex/dttiex188.old.<br />
If yes, rename the dttiex188 to dttiex188.new and dttiex188.old to dttiex188 and try to access the table f.e. by ttaad4100. If that is successfull run the command  bdbreconfig6.1 -R -nmi -Nttiex188 -C 000 . When this is finished, rename the dttiex188 to dttiex188.old and dttiex188.new to dttiex188. That's it.</div></div><hr />

an error during a reorg you should read the additional information carefully. <br />
<br />
Please always make a copy of that file you would<br />
like to recover by using this command!</div></div><hr />
