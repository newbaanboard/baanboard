<br />
Weve got a multi-company installation of BaanERP 5.0c (service pack 7, an I-series platform), with 72 different companies in our production environment, installed in the same package VRC.<br />
<br />
We have to apply the solutions provided by Global Baan Support, for the IBAN (International Bank Accounting Number) according to the new EC directive. (I think solutions #119826 &amp; #123370). <br />
<br />
Our BaanERP official provider, download the solutions and apply them, but they have to reconfigure some tables affected by the solutions. They log off the users and they reconfigure the first group of tables and it lasts 20 minutes. After that, they started reconfigure the 2nd group of the tables and the system is running already for 2 days.  As I can see in the bshells log (tmp directory), the reconfiguration procedure reconfigures all the tables (!!!)  of each one of the companies. It takes 5 hours per company and estimation says that we have to wait for 9 days more. And there is also a third group of tables.<br />
<br />
That means that our companies have to be closed for at least one week more. <br />
<br />
You know Im not a baan expert, but Ive got to ask if it is the normal procedure; Is it normally the reconfiguration to last such a long time. And after all why the reconfiguration of just three tables, produce such a mess. <br />
<br />
These are some snapshots of the bshell.xxxx log file in our BaanERP/bse/tmp directory of the active job (tail f  bshell.xxxx).<br />

<br />
As you can see, the reconfiguration, is running for the company 069 (just for the record its the 12th company of the 72), and converts (maybe Im wrong) the fields xxxx.txta, yyy.txtn and zzzz.blob  (domain (?) tttxt001069.ctxt) of other companies( see 056, 047 , 049, 355 etc) . The fact is that, when 069 company will finish, the next company 070, will reconfigure again the same tables.<br />
<br />
Were did I go wrong; Our Baan provider says that nothing cant happen we have to wait until it finished, and we must NOT STOP the reconfiguration procedure. But the cant explain why this is happening. And Ive got to ask, what will happen if we try to upgrade to the next service pack!!!<br />
<br />
Any comments, suggestions or ideas are accepted. After all we have plenty of time!! <br />
  <br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

I do know the time depends on the tables, indexes and amount of data it exports and re-imports.  I am not an expert on this topic.  I think I'll move it to the tools admin area where you may get a better response.<br />

do you have linked text-tables (tttxt...) across companys ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tgeorgiou</div><div class="date">12th October 2003, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you Mark. <br />
<br />
Rochus, <br />
I don't know what exactly this means. I'll get the answer on Monday. But... what is the proper way.  To link them or not; Anyway Ill get the answer and then let you know. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">12th October 2003, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">we faced a similar situation once.<br />
if it is just reference check that is going on now, I guess you guys could start working for now(reconfirm from Baan support).<br />
There is a workaround if you wish to avoid getting stuck in this maze.It revolves around using a different session to set off your reconfigure.<br />
I can post the details tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tgeorgiou</div><div class="date">13th October 2003, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">tools123: <br />
It will be very helpful for us if you could send me the workaround.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 03:40</div></div><div class="posttext">To check if your text tables are logically linked, run this from Unix shell:<br />
<br />
grep &quot;txt&quot; $BSE/lib/compnr6.1<br />
<br />
If you see output similar to the following then tables are linked (in this case, all txt tables in companies 031, 032, 033 are linked to company 030).<br />
<br />
tttxt:030:031                      <br />
tttxt:030:032                      <br />
tttxt:030:033<br />
<br />
If that is the case, then you might consider renaming the &quot;refint6.1&quot; command so repairing reference counters fails during the reconfigure so that you can run it manually afterwards on just the necessary tables using the -s option (single parent table).<br />
<br />
In Baan IV this option isn't used when called by bdbreconfig6.1 (fixed in Baan V) so it will look at current tables parent as well as child tables.<br />
<br />
Review the log.reconfig6.1 which will show list of tables just reconfigured.  Check their &quot;dd&quot; files for REFC entries with reference type &quot;r&quot;.<br />
<br />
For each of these run<br />
$BSE/bin/refint6.1 -p $pkgcmb -N $tablename -r -s -C $compnbr<br />
<br />
I've used this to repair reference counters only where necessary thereby bypassing unnecessary repair of text tables.<br />
<br />
For more info or if questions, please send an e-mail.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">These are the steps:<br />
<br />
1. Rename $BSE/bin/refint6.1<br />
2. Run Create Run Time DD<br />
3. Track the tables to reconfigure<br />
4. Run Reorganize Tables (ttaad4225m000) with the options Reference Integrity, Repair Reference Counter and Repair Reference Counter of Parent only checked.<br />
Use your own discretion and confirm from Baan support<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />
