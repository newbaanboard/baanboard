In order to ensure that all GTM activity on our production system is properly documented, we have created a couple of Emergency user IDs that must be used for this purpose.  The passwords on these IDs expire quickly, so the support user must contact our helpdesk for a password reset on an ID when they want to log in to do GTM, thus ensuring that the access is documented in our helpdesk system.<br />
<br />
Since the users we are restricting are support personnel, they have to have access to the system under their own user IDs to do their routine work, so we can't just remove their personal access.  We also can't simply change the GTM password, since the support users are the ones who will be using the Emergency IDs to log in and do GTM.<br />
<br />
These are all 'Normal User' accounts.  I tried creating a role that explicitly set the authorization level for ttaad4100 to 'No Authorization', but that didn't work.  Does anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

We give them access to only certain tt sessions - mostly around text and devices.  Also we do not give out run program. Is LN different than 4c4? I mean can't you just go into maintain session authorizations by session/user and remove these permissions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Authorizations in LN are done differently than in 4c4.  What I attempted to do was basically exactly what you suggest, only using the LN system, but the user was still able to run the session.  Most of our users do not have access to run program, but since these are support users, we give them access to make life easier.<br />
<br />
My expertise in LN authorizations is somewhat limited, so I was hoping there would be someone here that knows a way to restrict this that I don't know about. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">28th January 2011, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds like the users are associated with a role that has access to the session.  Do you have a global tools role that gives them access to everything?  You may want to edit that role/create a new role to replace it with that only gives them access to the tools sessions you want/they need.<br />
<br />
You will also want to remove the &quot;Call Session by Code&quot; option in the User Data Template.<br />

<br />
You can only ADD new rights to the users by attaching a new Role to them, you cannot REVOKE a right granted by another role they have. So, as already stated above, those Users must have a role attached that allows them access to ttaad4100, and for this role, you have to remove the execution rights to ttaad4100. (And of course, for your &quot;emergency users&quot; you must create a role that contains that right).<br />

I thought I had removed any roles that had ttaad4100 in it other than the new one setting it to No Authorization, but it is possible that one of the remaining roles for these users has it still.  I will double check this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">3rd February 2011, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to maintain GTM audit information for the Japanese version of SOX.<br />
<br />
If somebody (only two users) requires access to GTM they complete a request form which is stored electronically. The user is given the GTM password. Once they have finished with GTM the password is changed.<br />
<br />
Every month I run the ttaad4400 - Print GTM Log. I then cross check this report to the request forms.<br />
<br />
Both internal and exernal auditors are happy with this system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The users in question had a role that gave them print and display access by company for all companies and sessions.  Apparently, having even display access to ttaad4100 allows users to open it, which is bad but kind of makes sense.  Unfortunately, since ttaad4100 has a different interface than other LN sessions, simply being able to open it allows the user to enter the password and then modify data.<br />
<br />
To restrict it, we had to explicitly set the access for ttaad4100 to 'No Authorization' with a Session Authorizations by Session entry under the same role that gave print/display access for all companies/sessions.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who responded to offer advice.</div></div><hr />
