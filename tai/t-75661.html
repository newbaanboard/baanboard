<br />
I need your help on BAAN.<br />
<br />
After creating a session to insert several or one operation, I saw that one person does not have access to insert operations.<br />
When I do the job, it's fine, but if it's her, an error message appears. <br />
It's really strange and nothing special about her profile setting!<br />
Maybe an inconsistency with the default setting of the standard session I use in the session I created for the occasion?<br />
<br />
Do you have any clues? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

If it was me on my 4c4 system I would be comparing permissions between a user it works for and her permissions.  What is the error this user gets?  Plus if you use something like a function server to insert the records - you have to be careful.  Users save favorites all the time and I learned with my function servers to put every form field even if we did not use it.  At times I also had to delete user defaults to get them printing again at various times - never did figure that one out.</div></div><hr />
