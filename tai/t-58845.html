<br />
We are using LN 6.1 FP5.  We have setup the multisite exchange scheme to synchronize few masters from one baan company to other on regular basis based on audit information.  Both companies are on the same LN server.  We could have achieved it by using regular exchange scheme but we opted for multisite as it will still work if the batches between export/import are out of synch.<br />
<br />
The 'Receive Remote Procedure Call' is running in the target environment, but still we get frequent message 'Export done message coult not be delivered; the target environment is not available'.  Someone has to resend these undelivered messages from the Subscription to complete the process. <br />
<br />
I am expecting some input on why I am getting frequent message for undelivered messages when target system is very much available as both source and target on same server.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
