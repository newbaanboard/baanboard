<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kamafasa</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a book /web site/ resource that talks about BaaN to people who are expected to know little or nothing about the setup and operation of Baan.<br />
I stumbled into knowledge quest and that IMHO did not  quite do it.<br />
Simple explanations about the installation and configuration of ora_users,ora_storage ,two_tier,three_tier, tabledef6.1,dbresource file , creating baan accounts etc<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not unfamiliar with databases<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your time and response<br />

<br />
as of now i don't think u would get much books on baan as comapred to other software languages for which u get easily.... and this is the best web site that i have come across though where u can post your baan doubts.</div></div><hr />
