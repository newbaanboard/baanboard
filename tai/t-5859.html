<br />
Is there anyone who can share information on 5b to 5c migration. <br />
<br />
I would like to know information on the 5b to 5c migration tool and is there a way by to migrate only part of the data. There is a company split and we would like to migrate only part of the data after creating a new company on 5c. If anyone has done this before please post your replies. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Babu</div></div><hr />

<br />
I often wonder how many 5b versions are out there. It just feels to me like it's not the most popular version (and I can see why).<br />
<br />
It also seems like Baan is more or less abandoning it. This makes the original promise that came with BaanERP (modular structure, upgradable in parts) a farce.<br />
<br />
As one who painfully remembers the Triton 3.0 release, I am extremely weary of upgrades. After tens of thousands of patches, we seem to have 5.0b more or less under control now, but require some of the functionality that is offered only in 5.0c and up.<br />
<br />
Oh well...it keeps me off the street.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nicholas</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 07:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently doing Vb to Vc migration... and it's very straight forward.. there are 48 tables that need to run thru a migration tool, the rest is a standard reconfig.  We will be migrating all 50+ gigs of data within an extended weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keith Harvey</div><div class="date">27th September 2002, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Upgraded from 5.0b to 5.0C Easter just gone.<br />
Use the migration tool it works well. You will need it customised for partial transfer, use Baan.<br />
<br />
When we upgraded the tool worked for SP10 in 5.0b and SP6 in 5.0C.<br />
<br />
Test your Cash Management thoroughly. You may find upgrading to SP9 extremely useful. <br />
<br />
Presumably your upgrading for a reason, Crystal, SCS Schedular and Big Projects (MSP interface) are added features.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Socalsm</div><div class="date">14th April 2003, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">We are also in the process of migrating to 5.0c from 5.0b.  If you had customizations, did you move them over by package?  Did you encounter any problems?<br />
<br />
Also, Keith, I am curious about your comment about the Cash Mgmt section.  I haven't started testing that area, but would like to get a heads up on the types of problems you encountered &amp; the need to go to SP9.  We have installed SP6, but during testing of the pricing simulator, I found we might need to go to SP7.<br />
<br />
You also mentioned Crystal as a reason for migrating.  We are on Seagate Info &amp; would like to upgrade to Crystal Enterprise.  Any problems there?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
