<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wmickey</div><div class="date">24th March 2011, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a goal of creating a new instance of BaaN on our development server for a training environment.  This training environment gets updated on request to be a copy of both production data and production customizations.<br />
<br />
We carried out the following step and are nearly there with one exception:<br />
<br />
1) We copied the entire /baanivc and all the files to /baanivct.  <br />
2) We then went in and modified all the $BSE/lib files we new about to update the path to be /baanivct and this seemed to work.   <br />
3) We were able to change the client configuration to point at BSE of /baanivct/bse and then we could log in.<br />
4) We updated all the tools tables (through the Database Management - Maintenance menu) we were aware of to have the correct /baanivct path.<br />
<br />
The only problem with this environment is that the Report LAYOUTS and Form LAYOUTS that are stored in the database in company 000 are STILL pointing to the development server database instead of the training database!  Can anyone tell me what we missed?  <br />
<br />
We are on Oracle on UNIX.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wmickey</div><div class="date">24th March 2011, 21:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the part we changed was the ORACLE_SID .  The Oracle SID is the training database and all data in the training environment is from the training database with the exception of these tools table.  Oddly enough, when looking from GTM I also think it's looking at the training database but when you go into Report Layouts, it is not, it is the same layout as in the development database.</div></div><hr />

So, try to change ORACLE_SID in this session as well.</div></div><hr />
