<br />
BaanERP does great job in separating company data within the same database. Unless you're doing something completely on the edge, most of the time you don't really need to create test company in another database. Even if you'd like the test company to behave completely different than the live company, for example by means of heavy customisation, you can still put it in the same database but under different VRC. By putting the test company under different VRC, any modification to the way it operates wouldn't effect the way the live company operates<br />

Unless you don't have too much more storage space on your current db?<br />

  The story is a bit more complex. This new company will have A LOT of shared tables in which we do not want to to be updated in prod. I thought  to xfer the prod Db to a new server and work on the prod VRC pointing to the new tables on the new DB server... Get the Idea?? I hope.<br />
