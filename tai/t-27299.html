<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">7th June 2006, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">it is critical question and you should be more careful. In this operations, first step is that you should know your VRC structure very well and especially customizations on it. If you know your current VRC strucutre then you can start to install it. I suggest that firstly install patch on Development or Test VRC. After testing , you should install higher VRC up to sessins and report object curent VRC. I mean there can be VRCs between b40u c4  and b40l c4. After that you can run it for b40c4in5 pkg if it consists table definations VRC and path's VRC.<br />
That's all I think.<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />
