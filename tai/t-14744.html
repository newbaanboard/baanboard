Just a follow up on this issue  :) <br />
<br />
Any (new) experience concerning report archiving and the SCLM mechanism? We are currently working on it and will post our efforts and results as soon as possible.<br />
SSA promised that this feature is free of charge in Germany. In other countries as well?<br />
