<br />
I am looking for a password enforcement tool/utility for BaaN IVc2 (on UNIX and Oracle) so that the users are forced to change their password every x number of days (let's say 180).<br />
<br />
This should also us establish password rules/restrictions like the password should be a minimum of x(say 6) characters and a maximum of y(say 10) characters and it should have a minimum of 1 number and alphabet, etc.<br />
<br />
It should also maintain password history(of let's say the last 5 passwords or so) so that when users change their password, they do not use the one used earlier.<br />
<br />
Also, it should control the number of (un successful) attempts a user is allowed before the account is locked.<br />
<br />
Anyone using any of such tools(even if it is 3rd party, please let me know).<br />
<br />
I know BaaN has a tool which accomplishes most of it in BaaN 5 (ERP) by taking advantage of the OS (Unix, etc.) password management features but not sure if they have a similar thing for BaaN IVc2.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if others implemented this as part of the SOX or any other regulatory requirement (or just as part of best practices).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
You are lucky, because you are running Oracle, so the solution is pretty simple:<br />
<br />
If you are on Unix and your users connect via the ASCII Interface, then you can just use the built-in password aging restrictions of your Unix box.<br />
<br />
If your users connect via the GUI, then you can still get it working, by using a wrapper script around the bshell binary.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are using Informix, then Baan is using the OS passowrd for authentification, so changes of the password by the end user would give you a headache.<br />
<br />
I am not sure, wether there exist an actual product for this issue, but a bit of scripting will get you there.<br />
<br />

<br />
Will you please provide more details the wrapper script you just mentioned? And more details about the solution at the oracle level....95% of our users log in via GUI and very few (mainly IT) use the ASCII mode sometimes.<br />
<br />

Thanks,<br />

<br />
the good thing about Baan on Oracle (compared to informix) is, that the user does not need to know his oracle password. Actually you do not even need a dedicated oracle user for each Baan user. This way, the IT department can maintain and change regularly the Oracle password and adopt the changes in the ora_users file.<br />
<br />
Iin regards to the bshell wrapper, please search the forum first. There are lots of references to the general concept of a bshell wrapper and what it can be used for.<br />
<br />
