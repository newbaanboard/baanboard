A few weeks ago I used the cleanup session to cleanup all files up to august 2004. The cleanup session didn't give any errors.<br />
Is there anything I can do to get things working again without removing ALL the audit files for this table ?<br />
<br />
I know that the audit files for this table are kept in $BSE/tables/audit/100/atiitm.<br />
There is also a directory called $BSE/tables/audit/100/aTiitm. What is that for ?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

I could not find such a session.....<br />
<br />
Do you have a lot of activity on this table so that all the sequence numbers for this table are used ? (I mean 999 audit files for this table )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think, the directory name is changed from atiitm to aTtiitm when there is a table change in the ti package and itm module. This was sometime ago and this caused some other issues. So one of the recent solutions actually fixes this issue and the capitalized &quot;T&quot; would not be appearing anymore for any table changes.<br />
<br />
PS - This based on my tools version. I am not sure if the fixes are in place for your version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The program tuxch4463 is a copy of ttaad446 but we have the ability to create our own reports for it.<br />
<br />
Currently the seq number range is 630 to 908. <br />
What happens when I reach 999 + 1 ? The range is from 000 to 999.<br />
As far as the activity goes, the audit creates 3 to 4 seq files of 2Mb per day. Most of the changes are done by some night processing that we need.<br />
<br />
I'll see what I can do with the aTiitm directory.<br />

When it reaches 999 then it goes back to 000.<br />
<br />
The Audit sequence numbers are specified by the settings in - $BSE/lib/audit_spec<br />
<br />
You can refer to the Audit Management in the Tools Administration Guides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anybody have experience with manipulating actually the entries in audit_spec?<br />
<br />
What does &quot;security 28&quot; mean?<br />
<br />

Yes.<br />
What does &quot;security 28&quot; mean?<br />
You can refer to the Audit Management in the Tools Administration Guides.<br />
The different security levels and their codes are as follows:<br />
Security Value<br />
Print 4<br />
Clean 8<br />
Maintain 16<br />
Application defined 32<br />
The combination of these is explained in the section&quot;Authorizations''.<br />
To specify clean and maintain, security is specified as security 24<br />
(the sum of 8 + 16).<br />
Application-defined cannot be combined with print and clean. It can be<br />
combined with maintain permissions only.</div></div><hr />
