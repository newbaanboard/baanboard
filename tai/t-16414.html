<br />
Our VRC Structure (tree ) is like as displayed below.<br />
<br />
1) B40C-c4-cus	(Customization / Live VRC)<br />
	|<br />
2) B40U-c4-in5 	(IN5 Update)<br />
	|<br />
3) B40L-c4-in5	(IN5 Live)<br />
	|<br />
4) B40L-c4-in3	(IN3 Live)<br />
	|<br />
5) B40U-c4-stnd	(BaaN 4 Update Standard)<br />
	|<br />
6) B40-c4	(BaaN 4 Standard)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, there are many sessions / reports / objects which the existing team have customized. All these are placed on the top of VRC (i.e. Customization /Live ). There could also be many sessions / reports / objects which the earlier team might have customized. It would not be possible to know each and every session.<br />
<br />
When we are loading any patch in IN5 if there is already an object in the topmost VRC then the new object will not be considered. As the patch could have updateds for a lot of sessions it can not be possible to check for each and every object manually.<br />
<br />
Is there a session which can give us  a list of objects (session/form/report/...all) which have been added in a lower VRC but already have an object in the VRCs which are above it.<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does not give which are the newer patches.<br />
<br />
Suppose we want to check the pathces installed as on particular date.<br />
for eg.  I have loaded an patch in IN5Update VRC on 2nd Sept. But there are similir objects in the Live VRC which were updated in IN5U on 2nd Sept. <br />
<br />
Hence a session which accepts the date, Package combination, module and gives a list of those objects which were installed in IN5U VRC on 2nd Sept and are having objects older than 2nd Sept in Live VRC would help.</div></div><hr />
