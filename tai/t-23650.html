When upgrade was running, it was sitting on &quot;Import data dictionary&quot; for several hours. When I checked the Event Viewer, I found that the following error:<br />
<br />
Env   Bse2(V:\Baan)<br />
Prog  msql7_srv file\db\lib\dbs\dbs_rowact.c # 4085<br />
.....<br />
......<br />
Message  Reference in tttxt001000does not exist, key '57670'<br />
<br />
<br />
occcured over and over hundreds of time. The session was still running and I accidentally closed the Windows session.<br />
<br />
Now when I try to logon to Baan, I get the following message:<br />
<br />
v:/baan\bin\ntbshell.exe' not executable <br />
<br />
How can I make the Baan work again. I think the first error was due to some missing Text no? Please advise. Thanks in advance :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The text errors...was this &quot;Import Data Dictionary&quot;, for software components?  Was there text in the software components?  I have not seen the reference errors from Import DD.  Did you mean moving the data..&quot;Create Tables from Sequential Dump&quot;?  If so, you should load data with ignore referencial integrity, then rebuild that when it's all done.  I think that should take care of the references during import data.  <br />
<br />
The ntbshell.exe ... did it get renamed during the process of import?  Sometimes people rename it during import so no one else can get on.  Some backup software will rename it automatically...check if ntbshell.exe is still in there, and if not, maybe it's just renamed in that same directory..?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for responding. I think the Baan installation client had was not a proper installation. It was just copied form their live install. I am going to uninstall it and will start afresh. Hope you are doing well. Thanks again.<br />
