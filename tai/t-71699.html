Currently we use Control-M for Baan (BMC Scheduling Software) for all of our batch jobs.  Our method on AIX is not working on  Our porting set on Windows is 9.1c.01.  What are other users using for Baan 5.0c on Windows for Batch scheduling jobs.</div></div><hr />

That is a generic and vague statement. <br />
<br />
My previous company, has Control-M on Unix/Linux/Oracle platforms and everything is still working there for 17 years.<br />
<br />
You need to be explicit of what are your issues and resolve with Baan/Infor Support or BMC support or post details here if you seek others help.<br />
<br />
If you cannot get the BMC working in your environment, you can use the simplistic Windows Tasks Scheduler.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vnusbaum</div><div class="date">15th February 2019, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks NPRao, our BMC is working fine on our AIX, Oracle installation, but the piece Control-M for Baan is aix specific.  I have contacted BMC and they do not support this any longer, they also do not have a &quot;Baan piece&quot; so we can have one script that we can run mutliple users / multiple companies with only one script.  We run our whole company through BMC for backups, Baan jobs, PDM jobs so I do not think scheduling all our Baan jobs outside of BMC will work since some of the other areas are dependent on starting once certain Baan jobs are done.</div></div><hr />

Yes, their connector software was de-supported a long time ago. <br />
You can search for different threads on this site, so you can build a shell script which can activate the baan job daemon, sessions and make it generic to run for all companies. <br />
We built our own version with our customized settings for our environment specific and its been working well for years.</div></div><hr />
