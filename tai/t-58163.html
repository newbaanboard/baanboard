Hello Volker,<br />
<br />
licmon6.1 -c is used to release/clear orphaned licences.<br />
<br />
If no orphaned licences available, nothing is done !<br />
<br />
With licmon6.1 -h you'll find the parameters.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

thank you for your answer. But I have still a question what is a orphaned licence, how is it defined (in Baan)?<br />
<br />
Sorry for that (stupid) question, but it is very important for me to understand this option 100%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">1st April 2010, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The license daemon counts the number of licenses in use. However if e.g. a bshell stops unexpectedly it can happen that it doesn't 'logoff' at the license daemon so that thinks the process is still running. If this happens a lot you will get the messages that a user can't login due to the fact that you run out of licenses.<br />
<br />
By using the -c option the license daemon will check if the process using a license is still running. If not that the license will given free.<br />

it happens when user abrubptly disconnected from bw client due to reason like abnormal shutdown , power failure etc... <br />
<br />
this command clears orphan connection and make the license available to other users.<br />
When the license is reached to its maximum limit , user will face slowness in connection they wont be able to login to baan until other user leaves the session and releases license and sometime gets error &quot; no license server available &quot;</div></div><hr />
