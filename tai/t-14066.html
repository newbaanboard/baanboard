<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unicron</div><div class="date">29th December 2003, 12:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
Is there a baan session that scans the database and reports tables with records that have invalid references?<br />
<br />
eg.: an orderline with no orderheader.<br />
<br />
This is normally not possible in a database, but there are some imports done with the option &quot;no referential integrity check&quot; :mad: <br />
<br />
I tried session ttaad4225m000 and the option &quot;file for undefined references&quot; but this gave no result. And I know there are invalid records.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appriciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">30th December 2003, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The session you mentioned is to check tables that have reference counters to other tables. More and more the check is not done by reference counters but by lookup. Seems that Baan has a gap in its functionality here. <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unicron</div><div class="date">30th December 2003, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Than I have to do all the checks by hand, this is not nice :( <br />
<br />
Is there maybe an external tool who can do this? Afterall all the data is in baan :<br />
going over all  the table  definitions and do a select count statement for each related table.  It is not that difficult to do,<br />
so I hope somebody has done this before me ;) <br />
<br />
thanks for the reply though</div></div><hr />

Now most of the imported records would have references, otherwise it would make no sense to import them.<br />
<br />
What you can do is: create a SQL query that prints all records of the imported tables and print them. I assume that when you print all fields of the table in a report and the reference is mandatory, you will hit an error 606 when the reference does not exist.<br />
<br />
If you find that this is going well, you may also (in the report) read additional data from the referenced table (like desc fields) to be sure the reference does exist.<br />
<br />
And the most straightforward way: redo the import now with referential check and have illegal records written to a file, filter them out of your database later.</div></div><hr />
