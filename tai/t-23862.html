Turn auto ERP refresh on/off<br />
By default the ERP menu is cached on the client and not refreshed on opening of a Worktop document. The DEM menu on the contrary is always refreshed at startup. You can define the ERP menu also to refresh automatically on opening of a Worktop document by editing the Worktop.ini file located in the Worktop installation directory. Change the attribute &quot;RefreshERP&quot; from 0 to 1 to</div></div><hr />
