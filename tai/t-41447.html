<br />
PLease help me out in this!!<br />
<br />
I have installated a new baan5c environment with porting set 8.2b. Since 8.0 onwards we require the bclm for licensing, so i had installed the same along with baan installation. However, when we tried to apply the validation key to this, we got the errors that 'Applications at client side could not be initialised'. In bclmclienttest also the same erros came. We have checked our environment variables and they seem to be fine.<br />
<br />
One more thing is that on this server we had the licensing for 'Baan Open architecture' already done and that service was running during the baan installation.However, it all started once modified the license file to accomodate for the licenses for baan.<br />
<br />
Now, we are getting the message that 'No license to start the bshell' as well and baan would not start. I'am trying to reinstall the bclm but in the component window, 'All Component' field is disabled, as a result the bclm server is not getting installed properly. I'am attaching the screen shot for error coming in bclm.msc and the component window during reinstallation. Please look into this and suggest.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

In the component windows, it says that the virtual server is present. What does that mean?<br />
