<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">3rd March 2005, 05:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have this session in Baan that I have put in Job. The session has a date in it's form and the session runs every day. I want the current date in the form everytime it runs. But I think it has the date in the form that was stored in it when the job was created.<br />
<br />
Any way to default the current date ( utc.num() ) in the form when it runs in the job? Help appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it just has one field and I say the value of date as +0 and hence the date should move to reflect current date as days pass, as I read from another post. <br />
<br />
Hope it works. Any inputs or more information greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
