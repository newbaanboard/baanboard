<br />
it´s not enough to change the password on operation system level, because the entry with the encrypted password in the<br />
$BSE/lib/informix/inf_users will not be affected by that.<br />
<br />
Using session ttdba0115m000 should be enough, however in some circumstances after running it you also have to change the password on NT.<br />

<br />
If some services are running with the baan-account (e.g. job-daemon, scheduler etc.), don´t forget to adjust those services too after changing the password.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to tell u something more about my current setup, right now whenever i want to add a user in baan i just create one user user using session ttaad2100m000 ( Maintain user data ) and after that i use to make an entry at o/s level and then i use to manually add a entry in inf_user file, which means that we are NOT maintaing users using sessions like ttdgba0110m000 Maintain Link between BaaN User and Database User.<br />
<br />
so my all the users which were in inf_users file r having the encrypted password of baan since they r binded to only one database user i.e. baan<br />
<br />
so does this means that as soon as i change my baan user password using session u told me i have to update my inf_user file also for all the users.<br />
<br />
Am i right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you're right.  You will have to copy the encrypted password from the baan:baan line to the other users as well.  Pity you don't have access to a UNIX version of Baan.  One program they forgot ( :confused: ) to port over to Windows is encrypt6.1, which allows you to create those encrypted password strings outside Baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">yep i agree with u , one more main problem is that if there is one user with the name 230rm i cannot create a database user with the same name in informix since informix doesn't allow to create a user with the name starting with a numeric, anway more probnem is that i will have to change all the users password also since i don't know their baan passwords currently.<br />
<br />
anyway thanks for the info, it helped me a lot and cleared my doubt. r ua ware of how to create this user in informix ???<br />
<br />
is it that i have to give the command <br />
<br />
grant dba to rm230<br />
<br />
is that enough ??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well there is one more undocumented function to encrypt passwords in BaaN.<br />
<br />
<br />
tgbrg160.pssw = crypt.password$(&quot;BAAN&quot;)</div></div><hr />
