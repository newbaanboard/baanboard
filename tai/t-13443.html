<br />
I'm using Baan IV, first release, and I'd like to use the windows-type GUI, and stop using the Ascii interface. <br />
<br />
How do I do this?<br />
<br />
I noticed in my user settings that it says ASCII, but for some reason I'm unable to change it. <br />
<br />
Any help is very appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

It is even possible to use BW for triton3.1...<br />
<br />
You may have to start a rexec daemon and open port 512 to allow rexec commands to be executed on the server.<br />
<br />
You can test is using a rexec command other than is implemented in bw to perform the command date on the server - something likeC:\&gt;rexec baanserver -l bsp &quot;TZ=UTC date&quot;<br />
Password (baanserver.localdomain.local:):<br />
Tue Nov  4 16:02:18 UTC 2003If you get output, you can use bw to connect via rexec (port 512).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">4th November 2003, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm actually looking for the executable for BW itself. I can't seem to find the file to run to start up BW. <br />
<br />
I'm new to Unix, so could you possibly explain how the rexec daemon works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">4th November 2003, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">bw.exe is a Windows program, see solution 13743.<br />
try &quot;man rexecd&quot; on the Unix prompt. Talk to your system administrator.<br />
Or run bx6.1 (and a local XServer)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">4th November 2003, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">To access the solutions, I have to be a current maintenece customer, correct? I'm not a current maintenence customer. <br />
<br />
At my company, we don't have anyone doing our IT administration. I handle alot of the problems that crop up myself.<br />
<br />
I read the man file on the rexecd daemon, and understand about testing to see if it will work. <br />
<br />
Is there anyway I can get the bw.exe file?<br />
<br />
what I'm really confused about with Baan is that if you're not a maintenece customer, you get no help with anything, unless I missed something somewhere. <br />
<br />
We've had alot of trouble with lack of documentation, and all I get from Baan is that we're 4 releases behind current and that we can give them more money for 'support' with no guarantees.</div></div><hr />
