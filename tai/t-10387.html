<br />
We just copied our Baan pruction environment to a testserver. If I want to login to this system an error message appears  regarding the license (of course)<br />
<br />
(Everything is copied including the license; which is not valid on our testserver)<br />
<br />
The thing is; if I want to login with root or bsp in ASCII mode I automatically get kicked out of baan but when I log in using GUI I stay in the Baan menu, after clicking away the error message<br />
<br />
How is this possible (ASCII vs GUI)?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions how I can log in using ASCII (without changing the sysdate)<br />
<br />
<br />
regards<br />

Max</div></div><hr />

You can tell the test server to use the licence of the production server by changing the content of the $BSE/lib/licence6.x file. If you already messed up your environment by Nico's trick I advise to copy all tools objects before.<br />
<br />
Off course you need a licence that is large enough to handle both environments.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

The reason for my (obvious messy) solution was the fact that Max mentioned they had copied the whole environment.  If so, the licence6.1 file would still be pointing to the old machine, and it would automatically use the old licence daemon!  Since this is not the case, I assumed that the new server is not able to see the old one.  In that case, patching is the only way. :p<br />
<br />
As for copying all tools objects again, this isn't necessary!  After pointing the licence6.1 to the old server, you can happily start on the new server.  It will complain about having to patch the objects (configure application actually), so, you just have to do what it tells you!  The licence codes in the ttiex tables will be valid, and the patching will be without troubles.</div></div><hr />
