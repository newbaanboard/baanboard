<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">9th July 2013, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We are migrating from HPUX to Windows and we have some devices which are of type Windows Server Printer.  We are using the devices in jobs and through webUI.<br />
<br />
Please confirm that it is OK for us to use networked printers through both of these interfaces.<br />
<br />
Also, we have noticed that sometimes the whole report does not print.  Yesterday a 23 page report printed only page 1 and page 2 through webui.  Today a 5 page report printed only page 1 and page 2 through a baan job.  When I selected a device which is a windows printer and chose that printer as my default printer, that same 5 page report printed 5 pages.<br />
<br />
I am stumped.  Please help.</div></div><hr />
