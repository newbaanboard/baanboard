I have set a bshell command in order to track some fishy query:<br />
-- -dbgres -keeplog -logfile resource.txt<br />
<br />
the first line of the resource.txt is<br />
<br />
Can´t change process group<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
What is the &quot;process group&quot;? and Where I allow the user to change that Process group?<br />
<br />
This is the only difference between users that runs a particular session &quot;normal&quot; and a user that runs the same session and hangs.<br />
<br />
Any clue?<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I have done a search of that message that appears me. And I realized that the message is related with the SO. Follow this, I verify the set up user at operating system level and, in the parameter &quot;USER SHELL&quot; I have put the ksh as shell.<br />
<br />
Suspecting that this is the problem I switched to sh, and the message not appear any more.<br />
<br />
I check with the user and, my suprice was that the session is running normal!<br />
<br />
Changing this parameter was the solution? Honestly I don´t know, but it works for me.<br />
<br />
I want to thank everyone who help me on track this problem, and I want to share this &quot;solution&quot; to all who have a similar trouble. Maybe they will find this helpful.<br />
<br />
Thank you again Dave.</div></div><hr />
