<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd February 2016, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious if anybody is printing to M402n type hp printer from unix?  Printing straight from unix works, but printing from Baan does not.  The printer just hangs and never prints.  We use hp_lj baan print drivers, and I was wonder what setup or driver you would be using?<br />
<br />
I also tried some PS drivers, but everything seems to just hang and never print on the printer.  I figure it is some setting on the printer itself, but I am not seeing anything standing out to me.</div></div><hr />

I think since I posted this they swapped the printer out.  If I get a chance I will check tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th February 2016, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The printer as it was installed had only 1 tray.  I think they put the printer somewhere that they do not do any baan printing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JavierElric</div><div class="date">1st November 2016, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi MARK_H can you please share the driver configuration? maybe it's missing something in there, or do you have setup the LP in UNIX? the Printer IP is responding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd November 2016, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">At that time the printer would respond, would get the report, but would lock up.  What we did was swap printers with another that was not used for Baan printing.  So we took out the M402 and dropped in another HP laserjet - we just swapped IP addresses on the printers. So the one we dropped in the M402n's place works just fine - with no baan or UNIX setup changes.  We have been using the same laserjet HP5 print drivers for years. This is the only printer that has had an issue.</div></div><hr />
