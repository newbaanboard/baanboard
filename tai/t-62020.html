I found query I need in /baan2/bse/application/zpB40C_c4_glck/ozpsql2 <br />
but not sure this is the correct one. User made some changes to the custom query and I need to restore it. However, after restore, query is still showing as the changed one (not the old, restored one). I even renamed query in this directory, but user can still open it. This makes me think there has to be another location as well (I do understand query has two files oXXX and uXXX).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
