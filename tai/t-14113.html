The connection speeds are 128 Down and 512 Up.[It is a hardware based VPN].<br />
<br />
QUESTION: What are the factors that impact the response speed when using Baan remotely.<br />
<br />
<br />
SPECIFIC QUESTION: When using a remote connection, is it the network bandwidth that decides the response time or is it the database server processing speed that decides the reponse time?<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE OF DECISION TO BE MADE:<br />
Our subsidiary is going to use only around 3000 items. However, our current company has around 60,000 items. <br />
The disadvantage of having only 3,000 items is - we need to add  new items as and when they are needed by the subsidiary.<br />
Will having 60,000 items instead of 3,000 in the subsidiary company significantly impact the response time?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">7th January 2004, 02:50</div></div><div class="posttext">In general terms Baan has better keyboard-response time than a lot of systems when used remotely because keyboard data is sent field by field rather than whole screen at a time.<br />
<br />
As to your specific questions: <br />
<br />
All the things that impact response time locally will of course also impact remote connection response time.  Put another way: If database access or other processing times are slower than the latency of the transmission lines then the relative slowness of the remote connection will not have much impact. <br />
<br />
The response time will also be affected by both the band-width and the latency of the connection.  That is if there are few users and little data then the latency of the connection will be the limiting factor (with keyboard response). Alternatively if there are lots of users and lots of data then the bandwidth will be a limitation.<br />
<br />
As to the number of items involved: It is not clear whether you intend to run the subsidiary as a separate baan company or whether they will connect to your US baan company. However, the number of items is not likely to have any particular affect on the remote response time. <br />
<br />
Note: The time to find an item from 60,000 or from 3,000 is not very much different in practical terms.    <br />
<br />
Perhaps you could post a bit more detail:  Such as Baan version, database and hardware platform;  number of uses already on the application/hardware and the number of new users proposed for the remote site. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

Have you been successful in implementing connectivity from Brazil? We are looking at connecting an office back to the us and are looking at what is the most effective cost solution.</div></div><hr />
