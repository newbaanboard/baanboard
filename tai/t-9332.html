<br />
Do you have any experience with setting up single sign on in ADS-LDAP with baan c4?<br />
<br />
Environment is client(W2k) on ADS integrated to LDAP UNIX(baan servers).<br />
<br />
Any information really helps!.<br />
<br />
thanks Eric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
substitute the ba6.1 with a script that look at licmon6.1 information and denies access if the user is listed in it, some like<br />
<br />
licmon6.1 -w | grep $USER &gt; somefile<br />
<br />
if the file contains something, the user is already logged in baan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean a user logged in windows workstation getting validated to Baan via Unix server using ADS-LDAP integration already in place. Directory Services. No need to type in password or user name.<br />
<br />
thanks,eric</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only did a little experimenting  with ldap.<br />
I assume that there is only one authentification, being done when the user logs into the NT-Domain?<br />
Have you tried vbs scripting yet?<br />
If you connect the ldap server, can you retrieve the current password? Then it should be easy to write a small vbs script that calls the Baan-Gui and fills the fields with username and password.<br />
<br />
No other idea - but please report what you find out.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

Good thing is that we have one place to keep all authentication details.<br />
<br />
But BAAN(blogind6.1) protocol fail with LDAP and I think blogind6.1 is not PAM aware. so we are having that part solving.<br />
<br />
If any one experienced with this authentication method please let me know if there any problems probably not noticed by me.<br />
<br />
If anyone interested in the setup then I can provide some help if they have HP 11i and ADS in native mode.<br />
