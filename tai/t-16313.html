<br />
There seems to be some good functionality available in exchange around conditions and 'program name', which one can specify in the batches to write their own 3gl / Unix scripts. <br />
Does anyone have examples / documentation available which will help me understand these a bit better and explore them more? I have already asked Baan and they could not provide any more information!!  :confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">31st August 2004, 02:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You can basically put any 3GL code in an exchange condition.    Treat a condition merley as a function which must return a data type - integer, string etc.<br />
<br />
In the condition you can use any 3GL function call you desire - even open up seqential files, do extra processing etc. <br />
<br />
If you have a programmers manual that should suffice what you CAN put in a condition.<br />
<br />
What you SHOULD be in an exchange condition should probably be limited to data checking etc. to determine whether a field, record, table or batch should be processed in a specific manner, as opposed to duplicating functionality you can achieve with exchange (or writing an update session).</div></div><hr />
