<br />
I have copied the complete Baan environment from one Live server to another Test server, did following:<br />
<br />
Installed SQL server database<br />
Installed BaanERP <br />
copied BSE folders (Applications, dict, tools)<br />
copied all td* files from BSE/lib to new server<br />
<br />
Now I try to start the Baan on the new Test server, I am getting the following error:<br />
<br />
bdb_errno 510 on ttadv999<br />
Error 510 (Database not on) on Select<br />
Can not continue in ottstpstdlib (mess)<br />
<br />
Let me tell you one more thing, the database location on the Live Server and Test server are different. On Live Server, SQL server is installed on &quot;D&quot; drive while on the Test Server, SQL server is installed on &quot;H&quot; drive. <br />
<br />
How could I change the location of the Server?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

How to Insatall the License server/services on the new machine? If we want to move the License server/services from the existing Server to the new one, What we should do?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
As Dik suggested - &quot;follow the support procedure to get a licence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Refer to the BaaN/SSA support site for the procedure documents/process.<br />
<br />
This general solution describes the licensing mechanism for the following Baan <br />
software : Triton 2.2 , Triton 3.x , Baan IV , BaanERP 5.0b<br />
<br />
It also explains the concept of Network Licence Server and what the<br />
implications are when running a High Availability cluster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">4th January 2005, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Ramone, NPRao<br />
<br />
Thanks for your responses. I have two more scenarios to be clear:<br />
<br />
1. Situation is that the new server is in a separate test-network at remote side, not in the working/operational netwrok. Let we place the second server in the same network of first server, and put the hostname of the first server in the license file of the second one ( as PV Ramone suggested). Now, in this way second server will use the Licenses on the first server. After configuration, if we remove the second server from the working/operatioanl network, is there any possibility that the second server will work?<br />
<br />
2. Is there any possibility that we can run the second server in the trail/test mode without having the Licensing services/server ? Yes, at the fresh Installation the second server was running in the trial mode for 30 days, but as soon as we copied the directories from the first server to make it at the same level, it giving messages for License.<br />
<br />
Yes, last thing, If we ask to Baan Support for License for the new test machine (to run the new License services/server on new test machine), what will be the issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

2. you can ask baan for a demo license key. When i was working for an implementation partner it usually was no problem to get this kind of key. Demo keys were always 1 year valid and they follow the same procedure as a normal key in the validation process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apart from this you may also need to copy ttiex300 and ttiex301 from server running license daemon to the server which borrows license. Then run configure applications.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lot of time I have moved prod. environment to Dev/QA environments, But I never copied ttiex300/1.<br />
<br />
I am just curious, what you mean? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catwalk</div><div class="date">12th January 2005, 07:25</div></div><div class="posttext">After validation Baan patches the tools objects, based on the validation and security key.<br />
It is necessary to patch the tools objects with the information of license key which is used by the license daemon. Licensing information, validation and security keys are stores in ttiex300 and ttiex301 tables.  Hence when you have two systems sharing the license damon it is necessary to have this information synchronized.<br />
In your case you must have copied the &quot;000&quot; company to other environment.<br />
<br />
Please try installing Baan from scratch on other system and point to the system running license damon by modifying the licence6.1/2 file.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the Info.<br />
<br />
In your case you must have copied the &quot;000&quot; company to other environment. <br />
<br />
Yes, you are right, I am always importing 000 company first.<br />
