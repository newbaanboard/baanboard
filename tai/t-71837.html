<br />
After we installed solution, I need to compile the DLL script but when we go to session “ttadv2230m000”, I got the messages below.<br />
-	Cannot start session<br />
-	Process 14 - Fatal Error : No license to run object 'V:/Infor/bse/tools/tt7.6_a/ottadv/oadv2230' (productId 10146)<br />
<br />
Please help me to solve this error or could you please give me another way to compile DLL script.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks,</div></div><hr />

So you have to work with Infor Support to renew/issue you a new license with that Product Id (if you are entitled to).</div></div><hr />

Hi NPRao,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your information. :)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure for this case, I already have developed at Development Server and I need to promote to another server by Install Solution PMC that I got message &quot;No License.. &quot; same as the first comment.<br />
<br />
Could you please suggest me about PMC installation need to used &quot;LN Studio license&quot; ?? <br />
<br />
Many Thanks,</div></div><hr />

If you are delivering and installing a PMC solution with a script and its object into a Target system why are you re-compiling there without a Development license?</div></div><hr />

Hi NPRao,<br />
<br />
After we installed the solution that it object not work, I got the messages and I knew &quot;No License&quot; for Development Server <br />
but I need to make sure &quot;No License&quot; concern with installation not work that the answer support to Infrastructure team to fixed this problem. <br />
Because they have mentioned &quot;target system no need to used Development License&quot;.<br />
In the same time I try to find other way for install solution when we not have license to complete my work.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks, :)</div></div><hr />
