<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">20th December 2005, 23:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading through Baan's Multisite document (U7031B) about which tables need to be shared for a single-financial/multi-logistics company setup, I have a question I hope to get answered.  Appendix A of the document dictates to share all tables in the Finance package.  In addition, the group company must contain the data that exists in each logistic company.<br />
My question is in regard to the last sentence: the purpose of setting up another logistic company is to separate data such as items, BOM's, customers and suppliers, among others.  When posting integration records to Finance, some of this data is contained in the integrations.  Does this mean that these tables need to be shared as well?  Your feedback is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 03:49</div></div><div class="posttext">No, Dave, tables like the customer, supplier or item master whose data is transferred from the logistics to the finance company with the integrations transactions.  If I don't share the customer master for example, will I see the customer number in sales integrations records?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, the document is not very clear on that.  But if you do have to share items, customers, and suppliers, does that not defeat the purpose of having a separate logistics company?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking at the table definition for tfgld410 and there are no references to any of the TC or TI tables, so it seems that it is not necessary to share those tables.  I guess I will have to run through the scenario.....</div></div><hr />
