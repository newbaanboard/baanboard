<br />
We have a big problem with an batch job running on our server. <br />
<br />
The same job runs OK in the morning but not during lunch (not always) <br />
when it takes far to long time. <br />
<br />
Sometimes during lunch it takes 30 min and sometimes it takes 4 hours.<br />
<br />
The report is printed to a printer. <br />
<br />
We have never had this problem before.<br />
<br />
It is an report in session tdsls4402m000.<br />
<br />
Can this be an perfomance problem in Baan? Database problem? <br />
<br />
I hope someone can give me an advice <br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

   If it were not for the job, this session would have completed its run in short time? Have you tried running this or activating this session (outside the job) manually? Were there any difference in execution time then?<br />
