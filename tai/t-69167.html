<br />
I want to know if there is a concept like &quot;record lock&quot; in BAAN just like &quot;application lock&quot;.<br />
I came across a session A which goes to next session B.<br />
Where session A is a MMT session and upon form command actions it traverse to other session B.<br />
&quot;session A &quot; suppose say  having  sales order numbers a,b,c,d..... etc.<br />
even though I choose record  --- &quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot; ,&quot;d&quot; etc ,it only displays particular record &quot;d&quot; in session B</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">12th August 2016, 10:29</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends upon synchronization of Session A and B..If its a simple synchronization and no query extend is provided in session B then only the record which is last read would be read would be present or the result will be unpredictable..<br />
<br />
If you want record A..B..C...D all to be present then you need to include query.extend in before.program of Session B</div></div><hr />

hello, yes there is :)<br />
<br />
You can remove the application locks by running the session 'Remove application locks' [ttstpdellocks - for Baan IV and ttadv9598m000 - for ERP LN all versions] (Tools - database management - miscell). If you are sure that the application that has set the lock is not running anymore then remove the application locks only! The session displays the locks that have been set. With the option [D] you can delete a lock. By using the session 'Remove range of application locks' [ttstpdellock - for Baan IV and ttadv9298m000 - for ERP LN all versions] you are able to remove a range of application locks. You can use this for instance in a night job after all the users have left the system and when no other programs are running. When running this program you must ensure that no locks are set. They may cause problems when running other programs in a night job.<br />
