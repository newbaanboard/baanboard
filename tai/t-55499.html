Triton Version 6.1c.04.01<br />
<br />
When we wanted to stop triton using rc.stop, the shared memory manager refuses to stop.<br />
<br />
Both shmmanager -k and -uk do not get the job done.<br />

The problem occurred last weekend during our weekend backup. We want to avoid the same situation as this causes our backup to wait for the Triton stop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
don't know whether I may be of help.<br />
If this situation occurs again, what does &quot;ipcs -m&quot; show?<br />
I have often seen situations where shmmanager couldn't free shared memory, but usually this is shown by &quot;# of attachments &gt; 0&quot;.<br />
What did you do to restart triton? If you rebooted the system and locked shared memory was the problem, you could free shared memory with &quot;ipcrm&quot; without reboot.<br />
<br />
good luck and another &quot;welcome&quot; to you<br />

<br />
Thanks for this update. I have discussed this with our team, and we will investigate this further. It looks like this is pointing in the right direction.<br />
Thank you,<br />
Gert.</div></div><hr />
