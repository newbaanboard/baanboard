When he attempts to access tdpur4230m000, it can take  4-13 minutes to open this session.  When I access it as a menu user, I access it in seconds.  We have recreated his user and it will work fine for a while, then it is back to several minutes to open the session again.  Has anyone seen this?</div></div><hr />

Does this happen with any other session besides this one?  This work a while and then starts happening again is wierd.  Does it ever run normally after it starts slowing down?    What is using resources when the process is running? (DB, Driver, bshell -- there are no processes spinning are there)<br />

Tina usually ends up deleting his user and recreating it to get it to work.  It will behave itself for a couple of weeks and then start acting up again.  I can log in using this session and not have an issue, but if I log in as his user, I can see that it is taking as long as 15 minutes for his user.  I have never seen anything like this before.  It really has us baffled.  <br />

I know I asked these questions in my last post, but can you answer these?<br />
<br />
1.  Does this happen with any other session besides this one? <br />
2.  Does it ever run normally after it starts slowing down? <br />
3.  What is using resources when the process is running? (DB, Driver, bshell -- there are no processes spinning are there) During the fifteen minute interval can you interrogate the bshell and see any ticks incrementing on specific process?  <br />
