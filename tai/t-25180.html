I have taken back-up of the relevant tables before archiving integration transactions. If I encounter problems during archiving and wish to restore the tables from back-up, what will happen to records that are newly created and records that are updated since the time I took the back-up? For example, some unposted records would have got posted and new integration transactions created in table tfgld410. Can someone please clarify me whether using the following options in session 'Create table from sequential dump' will take care of that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Append if table exists&quot; = Yes<br />
&quot;overwrite duplicate records from dump&quot; = No<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Yes you're correct in that these two options could be used to restore any records you removed in error duirng archiving. However this should only really be a last resort as the archiving process around tfgld410 from memory is a little complex and you have to be sure that you have captured all the tables.<br />
<br />
There is of course an option to copy these transactions to history and I would also advise printing the report to file.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<br />
Thank you very much. Fortunately the archiving of 'integration transactions'<br />
has completed without any error. There is an excellent document by Baan for <br />
archiving which says step by step what to do and what are the tables that are affected. So it is easy to take back-up of only those tables. The document code is P-ARCH-4.0c.<br />
<br />

<br />
I've always found the Baan archiving sessions pretty rugged and thankfully never had to go back. If you fully understand what the session is doing to which tables before pressing the button you're generally ok.<br />
