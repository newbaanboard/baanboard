The job is getting executed at the right time.<br />
<br />
Later for some reasons, i had to change the directory of the dump files. to do this i had no other option except to  access  the table &quot;ttaad503&quot;  for company &quot;000&quot; through GTM and edited the data which has been stored as a single string under the field rcrd <br />
<br />
Can it be done in a better way (through baan sessions) ? any possibilities ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">telgar</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">There is one way, you must start the session that you have in the job, and click on the Tools drop down menu and select Make Job.  Just like you were adding this session to a job.  When the session ttaad5102s000 pops up select the button at the bottom called 'Session Info', or choose the Application drop down and then 'Get Session Info'.  This will bring up session ttaad5104s000 and you can choose the job name that you put the session into and then zoom out and select the session from the job.  This will populate the session with the data that you had input previously, at this point change the input that you need to and add the session to your job.  Then Maintain your Job by session and deselect the old version.<br />

Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

If answer is Y - how can I temporary kick-out users (if there is any hanging by night...) in a job SCRIPT !?<br />

<br />
Another alternative idea if you have a number of records paths which have to be modified.<br />
<br />
Use the bdbpre command with a delimiter (ex-|) and get the table dump of the table ttaad503, then edit the file with VI or any other editor then use a find and replace file dump paths, save and quit.<br />
<br />
then use the bdbpost command in replace mode, which imports and overwrite the table data.</div></div><hr />
