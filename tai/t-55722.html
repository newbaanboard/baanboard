<br />
We have been plagued with an issue for a long time now and neither Infor or our Oracle support people can give me a resolution.<br />
<br />
Every now and then when running the tdilc4201m000 - Generate Outbound Advice - session the process is taking 2 hours instead of the usual 1 minute.<br />
<br />
There doesn't appear to be a pattern when the issue arises. It can be fine for weeks and then all of a sudden it will start to run slowly.<br />
<br />
I have used the Baan call profiler debug tool which details query times and the sql statements (attached) to identify what's taking so long to run. I have then reorganised these tables but to no avail.<br />
<br />
The same query is seen by our Oracle support people but they haven't really come up with any suggestions.<br />
<br />
Can anybody make some suggestions as to what else I can look at.<br />
<br />
We are running Oracle 10.2.0.4 in RHEL 5.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<br />
First - i assume you've set the parameters in solution #166049 from Infor. The oracle 10 ones there pretty much specifically address the type of problem you're seeing. Specifically:<br />
_optim_peek_user_binds = FALSE <br />
_unnest_subquery = FALSE <br />
<br />
Assuming you've tried that and it's still an issue, what you may be seeing is a bug in oracle that involves it's automatic statistics gathering messing up and sometimes allowing you to get a horrible execution plan.<br />
 <br />
In Oracle 10.2.0.4 you can use AWRs to collect information on queries across a span of time. [ See metalink note: 748642.1 for how to do this ]<br />
<br />
What you can do is get an execution plan of the query when it runs well and when it doesn't run well, you can compare that. I guarantee that they are different - show that to oracle, ask them why. Maybe they've got a patch for it.<br />
<br />
But if they don't then you need to think about generating statistics on those tables and then &quot;locking&quot; them so that oracle doesn't mess them up.<br />

<br />
I had also re-opened a support case with Infor from some months back and they've managed to find a solution that addresses performance issues with tdilc4201m000 (232583)<br />

<br />
have you had any experience with the _optim_peek_user_binds=FALSE parameter? <br />
<br />
Will it have any adverse effect on sessions that are not giving performance issues?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">27th April 2009, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say pretty confidently that it won't affect &quot;out of the box&quot; baan.<br />
<br />
but custom sessions.. i can't be too sure.<br />
<br />
To be fair though, that basically just sets the default behavior back to oracle 8i<br />
and most baan code runs just fine in that version.<br />
