We want to copy all objects/forms/scripts/reports etc. to a new package combination in version c4.  We have used the session ttaad1220m000 (Copy Package Combination), placed the pack.comb. we wanted for a source and then entered a name for the target and entered the correct c4 directory for table definition path.   Now, how do we get our objects/forms/ scripts, etc. into the new pack.comb.  that we just created?<br />
<br />
Thanks..</div></div><hr />
