<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">17th October 2006, 22:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We are in the middle of planning an upgrade from BaanIVc3 to BaanIVc4 as well as upgraded hardware.  Our HP servers are 7 years old and maintenance is becoming increasingly cost prohibitive.  As a part of our cost analysis, we are evaluating running BaanIVc4 on SQLServer and Windows 2003.<br />
<br />
We typically run 70 - 75 concurrent users.  Our Oracle Database is approximately 55Gb.  Our current platform is an HP V2200 4Gb RAM 4x 300Mhz processors.<br />
<br />
Any advice regarding sizing or other performance related information is greatly appreciated.  We are also looking for companies who have been running in a SQL Server windows environment and any issues they may have experienced.<br />

Thank you,<br />

Cost or Well-designed system ? Think twice !<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

You are anyway planning to upgrade, so why not go for LN? <br />

Our Oracle database is about 120Gb but a lot of it is archive data.<br />
<br />
We use 5.0c on two servers, one application server, one database server both have 3,5Gb internal memory, 2 cpu's (2.8Ghz) with HT. On these 2 servers we run 3 baan with 3 oracle instances.<br />
<br />
Considered to use linux with oracle instead of w2003 with SQL server?<br />
<br />
Baan on windows is stable, your end users probably will not notice the difference. Maintaining it is another issue.<br />

I think they will feel the difference as a 7 year old system is performing much less than a current Intel box. Indeed for most environments up to 100 users a 2 way Intel box is great. As most environments have also jobs running during the day I would not recommend to buy a 1 way system.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

I recently assisted a client to move from HP-UX (K Class machines) to single tier Intel + Oracle platform.  Concurrent Baan sessions about 65 and organization has 130 user licenses.  Hardware was spec'd with 12 Gigs ram and dual Xeon processors.  We've been live for 6 months and no performance issues.  Database remained Oracle and we upgraded to 9.2 from 8.x during the process of moving to Intel / Win 2K3.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

We are scheduled to go to SAP (Corporate driven iniitiative) in 2010, so we can't justify the expense of LN (training and migration)  Going to 4c4 brings us a more stable Baan environment and eases patches management issues, without having a lot of retraining and process re-engineering.  If we weren't going to SAP , I would definetly advocate a move to LN.<br />
<br />
As far as the SQL Server vs Oracle debate, I really think that SQL Server has come around to a viable mature platform since the days of SQLServer 6.5.  If we were dealing with thousands of concurrent users then I would have more concern about a move to SQL Server.  My major concern with regards to switching to a full Microsoft platform is risk associated with viruses, security and Microsoft updates.</div></div><hr />
