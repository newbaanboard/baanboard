<br />
After the BECS setup, when users tried to log in, Baan is unable to trace the unix Change Password prompt and it stops user to login. After user tries couple of times, I think their account freezes up in unix. Our unix password aging is not enabled.<br />
<br />
Since, all the users are newly created on our new application server, by default Unix force them to change password first time when they log in. And Our Baan Client is unable to handle this situation.We are logging using REXEC.<br />
<br />
Baan support suggested to remove ADMCHG flag from /etc/security/passwd file. This is the workable solution if the use is a local user .But Most of our baan users are LDAP users? Does anybody know whats the equivalent of ADMCHG for a LDAP users OR is there any other work-around ?.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

First step: BaaN user has to login via telnet to BaaN server. In his .profile it is only written: 'exit'. If this is new unix user or sys.admin had cleared his password then he gets prompt for a new password.<br />
Second step is, of course, login to BaaN-GUI.<br />
I know that this is not very good solution, but it may help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dilip_mehta</div><div class="date">7th January 2005, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks frajer for the response. The problem we faced is Most of our user do not know or telnet directly to unix server. <br />
I was able to create a workaround-- Created a BWC link, which uses BaanLogin instead of Rexec, and in command window, we  call a customized 3gl script. So when user clicks on BWC link, he/she will be immediately prompt for change password. Every users were asked to click on the link for the first time login, change the password and then they can continue using their regular BW setup.<br />
<br />
Indeed we also got response from IBM: here's what they say:-- <br />
===============================================<br />
AIX uses the &quot;flags&quot; attribute to store the ADMCHG flag, as seen in     <br />
/etc/security/passwd.                                                   <br />
If you need to manually clear the ADMCHG flag for a local user, you just <br />
take it out of the /etc/security/passwd file.                           <br />
                                                                        <br />
However, for LDAP authenticated users, the AIX &quot;flags&quot; attribute is     <br />
actually mapped to the &quot;passwordflags&quot; attribute on the LDAP server. So, <br />
you can either use the server's GUI admin tool (i.e. IDS Web Admin Tool) <br />
to clear the &quot;passwordflags&quot; attribute on the LDAP server. Or you can   <br />
use 'ldapmodify' to remove the ADMCHG flag, as shown below:             <br />
                                                                        <br />
Here's how to modify an LDAP user's ADMCHG flag.                         <br />
                                                                        <br />
1. Find the DN for the user to modify                                   <br />
                                                                        <br />
In this example, the user's DN is:                                       <br />
                                                                        <br />
uid=newusr3,ou=aixuser,cn=aixsecdb,cn=aixdata                           <br />
                                                                        <br />
2. Find the ldap server hostname, admin ID, and password                 <br />
(You can get this from the ldap.cfg file on a working client)           <br />
                                                                        <br />
In this example, we are using:                                           <br />
                                                                        <br />
hostname = bestbso                                                       <br />
admin ID = cn=admin                                                     <br />
password = secret                                                       <br />
                                                                        <br />
3. Create and ldif file similar to the following                         <br />
                                                                        <br />
Here's a file I called &quot;modify.ldif&quot;:                                   <br />
                                                                        <br />
dn: uid=newusr3,ou=aixuser,cn=aixsecdb,cn=aixdata                       <br />
changetype: modify                                                       <br />
replace: passwordflags                                                   <br />
passwordflags:                                                           <br />
                                                                        <br />
All we're doing here is specify that we want to modify the passwordflags <br />
and set it to a null value.                                             <br />
                                                                        <br />
4. Run ldapmodify against above ldif file                               <br />
                                                                        <br />
ldapmodify -h bestbso -D cn=admin -w secret -f modify.ldif        <br />
============================================<br />

We have not yet tried this but might be doing it pretty soon.<br />
