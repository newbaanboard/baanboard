<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acapulco</div><div class="date">24th June 2004, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I can imagine where your question is coming from.  You are trying to ask for your licence code, and SSA is saying you need to pay support.<br />
BEWARE, that is illegal, the Baan contract that you singned is divided in two parts, Licence and support. thay are independent and you are able to perpetually use the Baan software without paying support (after the first year) <br />
That is a practice that thay have been using with BPCS customers, they have exchanged licences for  &quot;KEYS&quot; so they have to renovate your key every three months, and then force you to pay support. Also with the new &quot;KEY&quot; System, they open unlimited licences to your server and at the end of the quarter they come to see how many users you used against your licences and if you exceeded the number they force you to pay the extra ones or they donÂ´t renovate they KEY.<br />
<br />
These are unfair practices and We are starting a legal process against SSA <br />

<br />
I have similar inquiry regarding SSA license and support maintenance.<br />
<br />
In our case we intend to cut down the cost of software maintenance by decreasing the number of our concurrent users which are under support maintenance. let say we have 100 concurrent users and we intend to decrease to 50 concurrent users, does it mean SSA will need to revalidate our key to reduce it to 50?<br />
<br />
If they will reduce the number of license to 50 what will happen to our remaining 50 though previously we bought it already from Baan?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<br />
even though I agree mostly with the previous postings:<br />
<br />
SSA should revalidate, even though a customer has no running support contract. but SSA might charge a fee for the effort. <br />
<br />
The courts will judge, wether this is legal or not.<br />
<br />
But I disagree with your request. Or to say it different I find it funny: You have 100 users, but you want to reduce your support to 50 users and at the same time keep on having 100 users? Obviously that is not possible. Any support you get and any patch you install will benefit all 100 users, so you have to pay for 100 users also. Otherwise you might as well reduce support to a single user and save even more money!<br />
<br />
Funny idea ...<br />

Thanks Markuz. Yeah I understand its impossible just asking though I expect that kind of reply. However, what about the development license we have around 10 dev't license and wanted to reduce it to 1. Is that possible? since in c4 there is no field which you can specify the number of licenses for deveopers and with that we can reduce it to one. we've been paying for a maintenance of 110 users licenses though actually the number of our licenses is 1 ba and 100 bx/bw.<br />

<br />
my logic would tell me, that you should have paid from the very beginning only for 100 users, but the legal side may be different.<br />
<br />
The topic of 10 developer licenses is anyway a fake in baan. Wether you have 10 or 1 does not matter. In reality with the developer license the developing functionality becomes available for all users.<br />
<br />
But honestly I do not know the consequences on support for this.<br />
