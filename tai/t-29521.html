<br />
We have two servers, on booth server we have Baan one production server and one test server.<br />
<br />
After a Oracle crash we had to export and import all databases to make sure everything works.<br />
We did this some weeks ago and tested first a production export to import on the test server (all seems to work).<br />
<br />
Now I want to change some Baan reports on the test server and we get a lot of errors. As I see the software architecture of the test server is not the same as the production server, so the VRC are not the same. As we tested the production export on the test server the database things to have the same software architecture as the production server.<br />
<br />
How to get the software VRC structure the same as the database VRC structure on the test server? <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
as i understand you right:<br />
<br />
You restored only the oracle db back to the server.<br />
<br />
What about the filesystem under $BSE/ ???<br />
<br />
To run Softwarecomponent you need both the database AND the filesystem (especially $BSE/application)<br />
<br />
$BSE/dict can be created with the data stored in the database.<br />
<br />
One solution would be a BaaN internal export / import of the DD which creates data in the database AND the filesystem for the softwarecomponents and others.<br />
<br />

<br />
If I understand you correctly you restored an oracle backup from production on your test server. It will help if you tell us what kind of errors you are getting but if I understand what happened correctly you are most likely getting 512 errors and maybe some 513 as well.<br />
What you need is your dd&lt;pack combo&gt; directory from production on your test box.<br />
Got to test (use bsp) and find your dd&lt;pcomb&gt; directory. You'll find it in $BSE/../dict (%BSE%\dict for windows). Once you've found it back it up (I would move it to dd&lt;pcomb&gt;.save or something inside the same directory). Now get the dd&lt;pcomb&gt; from production and copy it to test to the same location ($BSE/../dict). That alone should get rid of all the 512 and 513 (Run a wide open check tables to confirm this). However your application will be out of synch with your tables and domsins RTDD. To fix this log on to Baan and run Create RTDD for all domains and all tables with reconfiguration:Yes for the pack combination with problems. Make sure you do this with no users on the system and be prepare for long reconfigurations in case large tables are hit.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">8th January 2007, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like you are going to have to troubleshoot this one a little bit. Your BSE_TMP variable seems to be wrong which according to the messages in the log it should not be causing a fatal error since it is defaulting to $BSE/tmp. But again maybe that setup is erroring out as well (permissions problems?). However I'd start trying to fix that first. You'll need to find where the BSE_TMP variable is being setup. Places to look for it: The bwc file on your pc, a bshell wrapper script (if you have one), tabledef6.1 file... those are the places I can think of right now.<br />
The error on the screenshot many times happens due to problems in the code. In this case since it is tools and it worked fine before and also because of the other errors in the log I am leaning towards issues on the configuration that might be triggering the &quot;out of dims&quot; error.<br />
One more thing. It is not a good idea to use user root to work with baan. Files permissions might end up screwed up leaving sessions and maybe even the whole system inaccessible for regular users.</div></div><hr />

Look at the errors you sent before. Specially this line:<br />
<br />
Log_mesg: /lvtmp1//usr2/bse/tmp: not accessable; defaulting to $BSE/tmp<br />
<br />
Path &quot;/lvtmp1//usr2/bse/tmp&quot; does not look right to me. The setup of variable BSE_TMP is messed up somewhere. Try fixing that first.<br />
<br />
As I said you are going to need to spend some time reviewing your environment (configuration files and stuff) to fix this one. <br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong on the last screenshots you sent. All the directories for the VRCs on your derivation structure are out there. I assume dir usr2 is hanging from root dir &quot;/&quot;, correct? Where is &quot;/lvtmp1/&quot; coming from? Do you have it on your production environment?<br />
