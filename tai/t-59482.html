SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
For Windows based platform SCM has not been enabled. <br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
SCM has been enabled for Windows based platforms. <br />
This solution contains a Functional Addition. Please read solution 134994 for the background of Functional Changes. <br />
<br />
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: <br />
The following actions have to be executed to enable SCM for a Windows based platform: <br />
1. <br />
Install RCS binaries on Windows Server machine. <br />
These binaries can be found at /ftpdownload/updates/7.6_b4_tt/230630tt_rcs.zip   . <br />
The original binaries can be found at http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/trinkle/RCS/   . <br />
For normal SCM actions the 'win32' binaries are used, for merge action the 'dos' binaries are used. <br />
The ZIP file also contain a small 'mergewin.bat' script for merging purposes. <br />
The following directories are present in the ZIP file <br />
- .\rcs binaries needed for SCM (including small bat script) <br />
- .\rcs\dos original dos binaries. <br />
- .\rcs\win32 original windows binaries. <br />
<br />
2. <br />
Via the environment variable 'RCSDIR' the location of the RCS binaries must be set. <br />
This must be done at the server e.g. in the logic service. <br />
E.g.. RCSDIR=&quot;D:\RCS&quot; <br />
This path should be added to the PATH variable (before $BSE/bin). <br />
Also a global system variable 'TZ' must be set. <br />
<br />
In case of problems a special logging activated. This is done via the environment variable 'WIN_SCM_LOG'. <br />
The logged data with become present in $BSE/tmp/log.RCS <br />
<br />
Users also should have write permissions on c:\windows\temp on the server. <br />
<br />
3. <br />
To make the SCM/CMT sessions visible in the menus the refresh button (or F5) can be used. <br />
PATH NAME IN DIAL-UP DIRECTORY/WEB SITE: <br />
Below are the supported VRC's based on the Baan standard derivation structures. <br />
If your Current Tools VRC is: <br />
