<br />
several times on this board we discussed, which variables can be used to influence Baan behaviour. Examples are BSE_LANG etc.<br />
<br />
Also mentioned was the variable PACKAGE_COMB for setting the package combination. Example:<br />
<br />
ba6.1 -- -set PACKAGE_COMB=B4Sc4 -set BSE_LANG=2<br />
<br />
Funny enough, from the variables we tested all seem to be working as expected, just PACKAGE_COMB has no influence.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
by the way, we are using BaanIVc4 with the latest porting set, so maybe this variable only works in BaanERP?<br />
<br />
if you combine aboce command with &quot;-dbgres -keeplog -logfile log.txt&quot; then you can see very nicely, which variables have an effect and which one do not.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me out here?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
1. Terminal Windows/switch to shell and type in the command at the prompt - <br />
<br />
$ env | grep PACKAGE_COMB<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2. Write a 3-GL in the common VRC with a simple code -<br />
<br />
message(&quot;Current Package Combination %s&quot;, curr.pacc$)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">30th June 2004, 10:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried it and the result was as expected:<br />
<br />
In our case env gives me &quot;PACKAGE_COMB=B40Sc4&quot; and the curr.$pacc gives me &quot;B40CCSS&quot;, which is the package combination from the u-file.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Did anybody try this in BaanIV (not ERP)?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
After some more tests it seems to be working. The variable is correctly called PACKAGE_COMB and also works for BaanIV.<br />
<br />
Must have been some typing or control character in my settings, which messed things up!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help <br />
