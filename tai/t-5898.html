<br />
I tried to install B4c4 on NT with Oracle 8.1.7 and when the installation is done.  Nothing was created as dict directory unde BSE.<br />
<br />
We was not able to install from the CD due to portingsets to old.<br />
<br />
We copied the CD on disk and updated the portingsets to 6.1c.06 before starting setup from i386 directory.<br />
<br />
Did anyone had this problem before?<br />
<br />
What should i check to make it works?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Sylvain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BaaN IVc4 can be installed in NT 4.0 with ORACLE 8.0.x versions<br />
only because the install medium supports only upto ORACLE 8.0.x<br />
<br />
 If you want use any other higher version like 8.1.7 - 8i, you<br />
 have to install in ORACLE 8.0.5 using install medium and after<br />
 complete install of BaaN, the ORACLE DATABASE alone have to be<br />
 upgraded to new version - 8.1.7 using the standard procedure of<br />
 ORACLE Upgrade.<br />
<br />
 NEW INSTALLATIONS OF BAAN BASED ON ORACLE 8.1.x (Oracle 8i)<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;  BaanIVc<br />
&gt;  --------------<br />
At this moment it is NOT possible to do a new installation of BaanIVcx on basis of Oracle 8.1.x because the installer doesn't support Oracle 8.1.x yet.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;  Workaround:<br />
&gt;  First do a a full installation on basis of Oracle8.0.x, and afterwards upgrade to Oracle 8.1.x. Refer to descriptions before for upgrading from Oracle 8.0.x to Oracle 8.1.x.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;  Availibility:<br />
A new cd -containing a installer which supports Oracle 8.1.x will come. It is not yet known when this cd will be available.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; We have gone through the exercise for three sites and following are the issues which will come up if you follow the above mentioned procedure<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; OS : Windows NT 4.0 SP 5<br />
&gt; BaaN : BaaN IVc4 SP3<br />
&gt; Database : ORACLE RDBMS 8.0.5.0.0 upgraded to 8.1.7 using<br />
&gt;            oracle migration tools<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Porting Set : Install 6.1c.03.01 - Update 6.1c.04.02<br />
&gt;               Installed 6.1c.05.02 after oracle 8.1.7 upgrade<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; We have migrated the ORACLE RDBMS to ORACLE 8i - 8.1.7 from<br />
&gt; ORACLE 8.0.5 using ORACLE native Migration / Upgrade Tools.<br />
&gt; The Porting Set was upgraded to 6.1c.05.02 with BAAN DB type<br />
&gt; selection using ora_column_format:7 in db_resource file.</div></div><hr />
