The issue is when the user selects the printer and click continue, after that it takes long times (around 2 min). We tried different version of BW, made the user local admin on the machine.As you can notice we are in windows enviroment, so what could be the possible issue?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th August 2007, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - what I recommended is the first thing I do no matter what when dealing with printing and user problems.  I have seen the &quot;saved defaults&quot; cause some weird problems.  So having said that.<br />
<br />
Is this &quot;some users&quot; always the same users?  Is it always consistent for this same set of users?  Is it slow for one user and fast for another in the same location(same office)?<br />
<br />
What if they use a machine configured for someone else that has normal response times?  You could have them logon to the machine with their id and test.  If it is fast then it may be the machine setup.  If it is slow for them on both machines then the user that prints fast can log into the machine.  Then the slow users can log into Baan and see if it is still slow.  I think at this point you need to try to isolate it to a problem on the machine or a problem for a user-id?</div></div><hr />

System get stuck when a user is trying to print something. It takes more than 10 minutes to prompt the 'select Device' screen (ttstpsplopen). After selecting device even system takes a long time to display or print the output. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have the same experience and know the solution for this? Please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
