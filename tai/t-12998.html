<br />
We have Windows 2000 operating system. We are able to see the users that are logged into Baan from the dos prompt by using the command &quot;licmon -a&quot;. This gives details of all users that are at present logged into the server. However, this does not give details of the client machine from where the user has logged in. Is there any command to find the client machine name of the user that has logged in.<br />
<br />
Please let us know....this is very urgent!!!!<br />
<br />
Earlier we had unix and using the &quot;sh users&quot; we could get the information of all users that have logged in and the machine from where the user has logged in also. We would like to get the same in our present set-up with Windows 2000.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />

I thought this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1705&amp;) will help you out well..(This was within the thread that I asked you to go through...)<br />
<br />
I guess, you might have to write a utility program to accomplish this as NP Rao says...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!!<br />

If from the username you know from where it is connecting, then you can use the w2k resource kit pulist.exe (read/download from Microsoft here (http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/tools/existing/pulist-o.asp).<br />
<br />
I think I saw some utilities (non-free like this here (http://www.astrontech.pl/html/body_wint_tcpwiev.html) ?) were you can see the IP address associated with a PID (other possible option is to see the IP's thru a firewall installed on the server...).</div></div><hr />
