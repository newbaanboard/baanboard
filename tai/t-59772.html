I mean, i run some reorganize tables session and each session reorganize 1 package (ti, tf, ts, etc).<br />
I have assumption if we run these sessions together, it will reduce time. I don't know how long it will take time, by maybe it will be faster.But I don't know whether it has affect the result of reorganizing tables.<br />

Are there any suggestion?:o</div></div><hr />

<br />
because unless you've made changes to the ora_storage* files<br />
it won't do anything.<br />
<br />
Also, you're almost always better off doing table maintenance via oracle.<br />
