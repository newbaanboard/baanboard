<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csmith</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to develop a customized method of giving users authorizations to Baan modules and sessions.  To do this, we've set up users templates for modules/session combinations and then assign the desired template to a real user.  The process creates  ttaad230 and ttaad231 records for each user just like using standard Baan sessions ttaad2130m000 and ttaad2131m000--but is filling in the table data through our own program and not really running the Baan sessions.  However we're not able to get the data converted to the runtime data dictionary.  Standard Baan must populate some tables during sessions ttaad2130 and ttaad2131 that decide what records should be converted.  We've found and tried populating ttaad400--but this isn't sufficient to get the convert to work.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone know of any other tables that might require values in order to get the convert to runtime DD working?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont see a point why do you like to do that when you can specify the settings with the Developers authorization template - ttams1151m000.<br />
<br />
BaaN owns the tools sources and tables, and the logics and they can be changed anytime. Hence, having a custom tool to modify tools authorizations etc isnt  a feasible solution when you move across BaaN Versions. A user's authorizations settings are stored in various tools tables and also $BSE/lib/user/u-files<br />
<br />
I could not find the table ttaad230, 231 on the BaaN-5.2 version.<br />
<br />
Please clarify your purpose, BaaN Version etc info.</div></div><hr />

That script was useful... Those tables are not used anymore now. They are now located in the ttams200, 201, 330... series.<br />
<br />
I think the AMS mechanism has undergone a lot of changes from the BaaN-4 series to the BaaN-5 series.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know Baan5 uses a different user schema process.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csmith</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 21:07</div></div><div class="posttext">We're using C4 version of Baan.  <br />
<br />
The customization has been requested in order to do mass changes of users authorizations.  When we add new sessions to Baan, we would simply update a couple of template package/module authorization records and then these templates refresh the real Baan user authorization records (all of them being previously associated to a template).  This method keeps us from having to update each Baan user authorization record individually for changes.  It also allows us to group our users authorizations together easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">The solution we use is to have template users setup in Baan, e.g. a template sales user will be  SLSNORM.<br />
<br />
When we wish to create a new sales Baan user who's system login is, say pgc, we create a record in ttaad200 with Baan User=snpgc, and System Login=pgc.  Any other sales users we also create with Baan User=snabc, System Login=abc.<br />
<br />
This means we can use the copy authorisations between users to copy a template (SLSNORM) out to a range of users (snaaa to snzzz) in one move.  Then just convert all to runtime.<br />
<br />
So long as your users are reasonably generic this works ok.  Ps. we use Baan IVc<br />
