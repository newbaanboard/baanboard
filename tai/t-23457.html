<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">16th March 2005, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is possible. There are 2 ways to accomplish this:<br />
* first you can use bdbpre/post on tu tables, if scripts are present do not forget tttxt tables, and be sure the receiving company doesn't have any data in it which could be overwritten.<br />
* second: create export scheme for the tuxch tables, using range active; do not forget to change the flag for text from numeric to multiline text; in the receiving company create an import scheme for tuxch tables.<br />
<br />
The latter would be the wisest I guess. In the past I have done this numerous times, e.g. for hours accounting schemes, without any problem.<br />

<br />
it's a long time since I used exchange myself, since I found it faster and more elegant to actually write small sessions for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Anyway I found it then the most practical to have an exchange company, where only exchange schemas were defined. If I remember correctly you can specify the company, when you execute a schema. In this case it is ease to dump and load the whole company let's say from a test to a production server.<br />
<br />
Obviously this option might be too late for you ...</div></div><hr />
