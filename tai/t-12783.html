I have a very basic doubt, whenever we create any new domain/table or modify an exiting domain/table we do convert to runtime data , which inturns modifes/creates a file at O/S Level in my $BSE/dict/&lt;Package Combination folder&gt;/<br />
<br />
but i am not able to understand how baan is actually utilising this aascii file for it's operation... why baan is dependent on an ascii file, ...when anyway whatever i am creating anything new or modifying is actually saved in tools 000 co. table ???<br />
<br />
what beneift it gets when it refers to this run time data dictionary file ???<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">30th August 2003, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Just imagine the following: if it did not have a runtime DD of a table that explains how the table is setup and what domains it uses for its fields, how could it know how to access and what type of data to expect from the table?<br />
<br />
Also, this brings other advantages also, like:<br />
- independence of the DB and OS<br />
- the possibility of using different &quot;versions&quot; of same tables/domains (assiciated to VRCs/PCs)<br />
- &quot;load balancing&quot; between Baan/OS and DB<br />
- faster access to a specific RTDD to know a table structure than to ask the DB<br />
- ...<br />
<br />
Just think that the difference between the Application DD (APDD - what is stored in tools company, that also has a RTDD for tables/domains!) and the Runtime DD as like a program without beeing compiled and a compiled program - which would be fast running, the first thru a just in time compiler (like java)  or natively compiled?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yaah after i got your reply i did some home work &amp; read about APDD and RTDD, i agree with all the points u said ... now some other doubts with this topic only........ as u said that RTDD would be much faster as compared to APDD, since it doesn't have to refer to database or table.... now doubt is then it means that when i dump the form, the file which gets created at O/S Level is being refered by BaaN when i execute a session.<br />
<br />
So does that means when i execute a session all the labels which r there on the form is actually picked up from form dump which is located at $bse/application/&lt;pvrc folder&gt;/ftdcus2 rather than from database / 000 co. table.............. if that is so then why i don't have log off and login again when i modify a form and dump it again, where as in case of domains / tables if i convert to RTDD i have to log off. <br />
<br />
so basic question is that in case of domains/ table i have to log off after doing convert to RTDD ? why so ??<br />

Because domains/tables/objects are loaded in shared memory.<br />
<br />
There are BW options on the Board search, use and try to explore more to get more info.<br />

<br />
The DD is read at the start of your bshell, the form is read at the start of a session. Simple. <br />
<br />
The reason is also simple, we have around 2000 different tables used in many more sessions. So it makes sense to read all table definitions and cache them, but it does not make sense to read all sessions/forms, which would need much more in terms of disk/RAM space anyway.<br />

I observed that you can have the scripts objects/report object as well as forms in the $BSE/lib/srdd_tab6.2 which lead me to believe that you can also load form dumps in the shared memory.<br />
<br />
Here is my trace of the shared memory usage -<br />
<br />
Table dump /app/lms/lmss/opt/bse/tools/dd/dttadv/dttadv999 load from disk<br />
Domain dump /app/lms/lmss/opt/bse/tools/dd/dtt.pd/dtt.pd load from disk<br />
B:0000000::: (00001):Object /app/lms/lmss/opt/bse/tools/tt7.3_a/ottstp/ostpoledaemon load from srdd <br />
B:0000001::: (00001):       0: before fun:     get.display.data ()<br />
B:0000002::: (00001):       0: after  fun:     get.display.data ()<br />
B:0000003::: (00001):Object /app/lms/lmss/opt/bse/tools/tt7.3_a/ottstp/ostp_stddll load from disk <br />
B:0000004::: (00001):       2: before fun:       get.var ()<br />
B:0000005::: (00001):       0: after  fun:       get.var ()<br />
<br />
I think due to the lack of documentation to the minute level in BaaN we are all constantly trying to explore and learn by trail and error. So I am open to be corrected and learn from everyones experience on here.<br />
<br />
You are right with the Swap/Ram info, but its a trade off against having a lot of disk IO reads against using a block memory with frequently used objects so that you have a most used objects in the LRU list. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">10th September 2003, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi again,<br />
<br />
I am not sure, wether form data is loaded into shared memory, this might be a feature of BaanIV.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let's clraify things a bit:<br />
<br />
a) When the Baan application as a whole is started, Baan will inbitialize shared memory and read the DD and objects specified in srdd_tab into shared memory.<br />
<br />
b) When a single login happens and a beshell is started, then this bshell will read the DD of the curent PKG into it's personal RAM, wether this DD is read from disk at this stage depends obviously on the fact, wether this PKG is specified in srdd_tab or not.<br />
<br />
c) When a session is started, then the bshell wil try at this moment to read the object/form etc again from Disk or from shared memeory, depending where the bshell can find it.<br />
<br />
This is my understanding, which is not derived from any documentation, but from pure observation. Consider the following:<br />
<br />
to b) When you change a table or domain and perform a CRDD, then the new runtime files are created. But any user, who is already logged in, will not now about it until closing and starting his bshell again.<br />
<br />
to c) In Contradiction to b, if you customize a session, then the change is activated instantly for all users, also the once allready logged in. If you are running unix and the object is in shared memory, then Baan will invalidate his object in shared memory during customization. If you are running windows and the object is in shared memory, then sometimes (or always?) you need to initialize your shared memory manually for this to be the case.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would you agree with this? Or did I miss something?<br />
Maybe if you trace different szenarios, we will find out more.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />
<br />
Markus</div></div><hr />
