<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">2nd July 2003, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Error 512 is corrupt data dictionary.  This can usually be solved by running Create to runtime / reconfigure tables....  Was this not part of the installation instructions of the patch?  If you ran this already, you should check the error logs to see if anything did not work, especially related to those tables.  This will usually give you a clue.<br />
<br />
If you are on NT, you may also be having a shared memory issue.  After installing the dump and running create runtime, you should shut down the system and reboot - or find another method to restart that shared memory (I find it hard to do on most NT systems without rebooting, but I know there are ways). <br />
<br />
If there are still errors, another good session to try is Convert/Recover  Tables (ttaad4228m000).  If this still does not work, you can get more control and use bdb.pre and bdb.post to manually reconfigure the table...search the forum for help on those commands.<br />
<br />
If possible, backup first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">2nd July 2003, 22:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes Baan has a mind of its own and would not run the reconfig even if you put on a new table definition for these tables. What I've done when I get a 512  error is to create runtime dd for Domains, table, reconfig . Since there is a paramater table involved you will need to make sure users are not logged since there may be a problem dropping the table. To ensure that the reconfig invokes the bdbreconfig you need to make a small insignificant change or if your really want to ensure that it invokes the bdbreconfig, add in index in which is unique -&gt; convert to runtime dd with teh above options -&gt; remove that index -&gt; convert to runtime with the above options.<br />
<br />
But before doing any of these. MAKE A BACKUP!!!!  as well as do a sequential dump of the two tables!!!! . I would hate to see your next post coming from the job seekers section.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you didnÂ´t mention the solution number, but that sounds like a problem I had some weeks ago, too.<br />
Cause was the ostp_textdll. Was that dll importet by your solution ? If yes, try to copy an older version of that dll to $BSE/tools or (maybe better) check the Baan Knowledge Base for the latest verison of that object.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<br />
After the create run time for those tables, don't forget to start and stop shared memory for those tables or remove those table objects from shared memory manually.  That may be the culprit.</div></div><hr />

Can teach me how to using ttaad4228m000 n Whatever that I must choose in this tabel ??<br />
how to start and stop shared memory for those tables or remove those table objects from shared memory manually ??<br />

<br />
1. under start go into the Baan NT Manager.<br />
2. right click on shared memory service<br />
3. this brings up shared memory mgr<br />
4. do a show loaded<br />
5. click on the table object you want to remove and click on remove object<br />
6. close it and Load again<br />
<br />
Like I mentioned, rebooting also works.</div></div><hr />
