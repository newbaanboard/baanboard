This is not something that you should be worried about unless you are going to setup the myday application.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrankManders</div><div class="date">30th November 2009, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the help of that Session:<br />
<br />
Use this session to configure how ERP LN selects the relevant tenant, accounting entity, and location when creating Business Object Documents (BODs). <br />
<br />
The codes for tenant, accounting entity, and location defined in this session must be the same as the codes used in the other applications that integrate with ERP LN. <br />
<br />
Before ERP LN can use a record to create a BOD, you must approve the record. To approve a record, or undo the approval, select the record and click the corresponding command in the Specific menu. <br />
<br />
To generate records for this session, use the Generate Tenant, Accounting Entity and Location (tcemm3200m000) session. <br />
<br />
Search strategy <br />
<br />
Each record in this session specifies a tenant, and optionally an accounting entity and location. If a Business Object Document (BOD) is created, ERP LN searches for an applicable record. If ERP LN attempts to create a BOD for which this session contains no matching record, ERP LN fails to create the BOD. <br />
<br />
A distinction is made between BODs for transactional data and BODs for master data. <br />
<br />
Transactional data <br />
<br />
For BODs for transactional data, ERP LN first attempts to select the applicable record based on the following information: <br />
<br />
The company number. <br />
Additional input data, which is one of the following: <br />
A department. <br />
A warehouse. <br />
A project. <br />
An enterprise unit. <br />
If no matching record is found in the previous step, and the input data is of type Department, Warehouse, or Project, ERP LN retrieves the enterprise unit of this department, warehouse or project and searches for a record for that enterprise unit. <br />
<br />
Note <br />
<br />
For BODs for contracts, requests-for-quotation (RFQ), purchase requisitions. and some types of warehousing orders, the department can be unspecified. In that case, ERP LN can select a record with the Type field Department and an empty Code field. <br />
<br />
Master data <br />
<br />
For BODs for master data, the input data is of type Master Data. <br />
<br />
For BODs for master data, ERP LN attempts to select the applicable record based on the following information: <br />
<br />
The company number. <br />
The code of a master data element. <br />
If no matching record is found in the previous step, ERP LN selects the record where the Type field is Master Data and the Code field is empty. <br />
<br />
Important! <br />
<br />
Specify a record for each relevant company with the Type field Master Data and the Code field empty. These records serve as default.</div></div><hr />
