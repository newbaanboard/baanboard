What is the actual issue or error message? <br />

You can use the following session and bounce the environment to clear the shared memory to pick up the new dictionary files. <br />
Create Runtime Data Dictionary (ttadv5210m000)<br />
Use this session to create a runtime data dictionary that contains software components per package combination. This session starts automatically if you create a new package combination). It converts all specified components to the run-time data dictionary, including those that have not been changed.</div></div><hr />
