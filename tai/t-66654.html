<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">16th July 2014, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
I´m using wordpad as an external text editor.<br />
I have configured the user and the text window to use it.<br />
<br />
The user can now, use the functions of worpad like copy &amp; paste, for the sessions with Text fields enabled. Even they can go out of the text, for example in maintain batch transactions and, when they return to their batch, the text is still there.<br />
<br />
The weird situation here is, when I check on the tfgld102 table, there is no text number associated with the batch number. Just if the user use the internal text editor, that text number appears.<br />
<br />
Anybody have faced this situation?<br />
I have checked with normal and superuser with the same results.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

So that's a bit unusual as it tends to be one of the last fields.<br />
<br />
I then changed default text group by text table field (tttxt1112m000) and inserted notepad as the text Group. Then went back to the journal and on a new line inserted some notepad text. I can see that text number in tfgld102 also.<br />
<br />
We are on 4c4 at quite an old service pack level if that makes any difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">25th July 2014, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
tfgld102 does not store the text's. The text is stored in other table.<br />
<br />
For example,<br />
<br />
If you are booking a Sales Invoice, the text will be stored in tfacr200 with the field tfacr200.text<br />
<br />
If you are booking a Purchase Invoice, the text will be stored in tfacp200.<br />
<br />
Please check and let me know if it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi EdHubbard &amp; GaryED<br />
Still have the same problem. I can´t see the text number related with the text that I type on the external editor.<br />
<br />
Hi bhushanchanda<br />
You are right, the text itself are not stored directly on the table. It just store the text number as a reference.<br />
The text are stored in the table tttxt010. My problem resides in the fact that when I try to record a text using the external editor, the reference are not recorded.<br />
<br />
Any other idea?<br />
Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which table are you checking? As I said, text no will not be stored in tfgld102.<br />
<br />
check tfacr200/tfacp200 for the Transaction type-Document No combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">31st July 2014, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">i checked and tfgld102.txta exists in both IVc4 and LN 8.2.1. This is the only text number field in this table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shailu90210</div><div class="date">27th August 2014, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried it on B5 on a different session but the text number gets saved using wordpad as a text editor.. <br />
<br />
In b5 once the wordpad window is closed, whatever text you wrote is shown in the normal Baan Text Editor where an option is provided to save the text or not. Is this happening for you as well? If not then this will be a hint to your issue since unless you have the standard Baan Text Editor saving the final text, the Text Number and other parameter values that gets stored tttxtxxx tables will not happen probably..<br />

I have checked  the acp/acr200 but there is no info about the texts.<br />
<br />
Hi Benito,<br />
Yes, in gld102 it stores only the text reference. The texts stores on tttxt010.<br />
<br />
Hi shailu90210<br />
Yes. Everything happens as you said. Exept when I tried to save the text.<br />
<br />
Any other idea?<br />
<br />
By the way I asked for support at Infor, but I´m afraid to said, appears like I´m the only who asked to do this on BaanIVc4, at least in Mexico.</div></div><hr />

I want to thank all of your inputs. Finally there was a problem with the tools objects.<br />
<br />
Apparently I have a very old version of baan and after a upgrade process in tools, I was able to save the required text reference in tfgld102 and then in tfgld106.<br />
<br />
