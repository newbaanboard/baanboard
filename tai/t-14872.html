<br />
We are on Baan IV c3.<br />
<br />
I am aware of the Baan provided built in version control for Baan V etc.<br />
<br />
But for Baan IV is there any product available which can be used for versioning Baan scripts.<br />
I looked at Merant ... That's no good for Baan scripts since it doesn't talk to Baan.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

They do allow for variants, I know that's not much but it's something.    As a script gets updated the old one can be saved as the last variant.  That way it can be recalled.    Not sure what SOX is or if this meets that requirement.<br />
<br />
Edited:  SOX = Sarbanes Oxley?  Just curious.</div></div><hr />

Sarbanes Oxley is right.<br />
<br />
As for version controlling, you may have seen my interest in doing something for some time.<br />
<br />
Anyone wants to offer me access to a Baan server?<br />
