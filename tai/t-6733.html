<br />
I have installed Baan5 on AS400, the installation takes in my opinion to much time (Master CD + UpdateCD + SP from 3 to 8 = 8 days), maybe that's because the AS400 is not the fastest one :)<br />
OS400 version is V5R1;<br />
I though about installing the Baan5 on the other AS400 machine  in a faster way.<br />
So I am going to install only the Master CD + Update CD and than directly replace the folders from my first AS400:<br />
  Baan, BaanInst, BaanErp             and libraries:<br />
  BaanLib, BaanData, BaanCommon<br />
<br />
I will receive the second AS400 soon so my question is:<br />
does anyone has some experiences or interesting hints ?<br />

<br />
The only machine dependent settings are the license daemon, your brand info and of course (possibly) the database settings.<br />
<br />
So choose your licensing strategy and edit the license6.2 file accordingly, rebrand your machine and you are good to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it is know that the install on an AS400 machine is not the fastest Baan installation way. A copy of an existing environment is possible. The time consumtion is in the way the AS400 is handling files. The creation takes a long time on that machine but it is much faster when working on it.<br />
<br />
If you want to make a compleate installation you can use the new batchinstaller for B50_c. This will install service pack 3 till 7 in one step. I am doing such an install at the moment and to do it on Baan4 level (it was available some weeks earlier) it took only half a day for the compleate Batchinstaller (OK, that was on an Unix machine and not on the AS400).<br />
<br />
So for B50_c I would suggest to use the Batchinstaller. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />

<br />
your approach is okay. No problem.<br />
<br />
Just make a dummy installation and copy teh application over.<br />
<br />
Naturally you also have to dump and load company 000 from the origional system, as 000 needs to be consistents with the application files.<br />

the Batchinstaller is a package that can be bought in the Baan distribution store.<br />
