<br />
Did anybody made a session to edit the job selections in ttaad503? It seems that you have to add a session to a job again to change one of its selections. It would be a lot easier to just change the selections with a session.<br />
<br />
With kindly regards,<br />

<br />
If so, then in Baan 5 they can be modified by selecting 'change session parameters' in the 'sessions by job' session.<br />
Howeer, I can't remember if this functionality was available in Baan 4.</div></div><hr />

I did this once, but not by using a Baan-session. My solution is to make a sequential dump (ttaad4226m000) of three tables: ttaad500, ttaad501 and ttaad503. In the dump on UNIX you can copy/paste the extra lines you need. Then, by using the &quot;sed&quot;-command or manually, you can adjust the parameters as you wish. Do NOT forget to edit ALL THREE dumps, because these three tables &quot;work together&quot;.<br />
Then you have to import the tables again (ttaad4227m000). Now it should work.<br />
<br />
There was one problem I ran into by working in forementioned way. When you want to adjust a parameter of just one character (say, for instance, a period-value &quot;3&quot;) and change it in a two-character value (like &quot;11&quot;), the import of tables will skip these records, because Baan sees these records as being corrupt. 'Till this day, I still have no proper solution for this problem.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this solution works for you.<br />

This is copied from an earlier post by Baanboard user telgar. I can confirm that it works OK but it is a little long winded.<br />
<br />
There is one way, you must start the session that you have in the job, and click on the Tools drop down menu and select Make Job. Just like you were adding this session to a job. When the session ttaad5102s000 pops up select the button at the bottom called 'Session Info', or choose the Application drop down and then 'Get Session Info'. This will bring up session ttaad5104s000 and you can choose the job name that you put the session into and then zoom out and select the session from the job. This will populate the session with the data that you had input previously, at this point change the input that you need to and add the session to your job. Then Maintain your Job by session and deselect the old version.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doornbos</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The solutions mentioned by hsteenwi and Neal unfortunately aren't suitable in our case. The selections should be maintained by an end user, so using dumps and sed is not an option. I already found the post mentioned by Neal, but the user said that that isn't much more added value.<br />
<br />
So i'm trying to make a session to update ttaad503. Until now I only wrote report sessions with only selection forms. Now I need forms to display and update data. Can you give me some hints and tips. What type of form/sessions/script should i use? Main table ttaad503 doesn't work: no integration with tt. How do I interact with the form? The form should look like a type 3 form with job (ttaad503.cjob) and session (ttaad503.seri) field on top and fields/value pairs (extracted from ttaad503.rcrd) as multi occurence rows. How do I catch 'page up' and 'page down'.  I hope you can get me going. Thank's in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gentercz</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">just some thoughts on ttaad503<br />
<br />
@hsteenwi: your import probably failed because you did not pay attention to the correct format of field &quot;ttaad503.rcrd&quot;.<br />
Here before every field a number is shown. This number is VERY important, because it is the field length of the following field INCLUDING the field-length itself<br />
for example: 029item.f:=&quot;                       &quot; 029 means, the string starting from 0 to &quot; has length 029. if this length is not correct then import of data fails.<br />
<br />
so if you modify value from 2 to 99 then you have to increase this field length by 1.<br />
<br />
AND<br />
mind that there can be more than one line by job line (sequ), because ttaad503.sequ is only 200 long.<br />
if you job data is longer that 200 you have to issue a new sequ.<br />
<br />
good luck for your program, but maybe it is faster to delete a line and put it into the same job again ...<br />

Or is it someone in Baan Admin?  Either way of changing the selections is not that difficult for someone in Admin, if it is an end user then pulling the session back up is the only way for them to change it.<br />
<br />
What is the user wanting to change on the session?  Is it a complete change of the session or just one or two selections?</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much for your helpfull remarks. Indeed I did not pay attention to the field-format. It turned out exactly as you said it would.<br />
<br />
Again: thanx!<br />

It is an admin user. He wants to change for example the period selection which occurs on a number of sessions in a job. Now he must add every session again to the job with the new period. It would be nice to just change this value in ttaad503.<br />
