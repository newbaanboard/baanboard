<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">31st August 2006, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">The intent is to create an environment that can be accessed by users having a role other than r_baan (because of sensitive data).  Any software developed in this environment will be brand new, with no derivation from standard baan  VRCs.<br />
<br />
Here's what I have done so far (with the ORACLE side being handled by the DBA):<br />
<br />
- created the software environment (new package, new modules, new VRC, new Package Combination, etc.).<br />
- Maintain Database Definitions:<br />
   The 'Parameter' field is as follows:<br />
<br />
ORACLE_HOME=/opt/app/oracle/product/9.2,ORACLE_SID=newsid<br />
<br />
- Assign Tables to Databases<br />
<br />
The ORACLE DBA created the new database and the new role.<br />
<br />
Now for the problem description:<br />
<br />
If I link up a new user ID that is linked to the newrole (using ora8_maint6.1 and all that magic), and try to log in, the start up menu does not come up at all. There is a fatal error relating to some SELECT but no table names are logged. This is probably because the login process is trying to get to some Company 000 tables that are still in role r_baan, and Company 000 is in a different SID.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to make this work?</div></div><hr />
