If you want to restrict session usage, do NOT create a super but a NORMAL user instead and then grant access to the sessions needed.<br />
Create an export of the live company and then import it into the demo company - this is the standard way of copying company data. Make sure that the data definitions (DD) of the tables is the same bewteen the VRC of the live company and the demo company to avoid DD errors while importing the data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Export version dump of the live company and then import it into the demo company but VRC should be same of both the companies and to create user having all authorisation accept TOOLS, you need to create a normal user with MENU Browser as GUI and give all the session module authorisation to him.  This will resolve your problem.<br />

Create a Normal user. Give access to all the packages except for the session you want them to restrict. I think this should serve the purpose.</div></div><hr />

Please use ttaad2130m000 if you wish to give permissions for all sessions of a particular module.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you really need to create a DEM if you want the DEMO user to access all the sessions except for tt ? According to me No, it is not required.<br />
<br />
Secondly, in ttaad21000 Maintain User Data on Tab 2. Startup, if you select the start program GUI as Menu Browser, the screen appears as for a &quot;Super user&quot; screen with Baan Standard Menu Browser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganesh_kapase</div><div class="date">20th July 2005, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi mam<br />
<br />
I had maintained data in ttaad21000 on Tab 2. Startup, I had selected the start program GUI as Menu Browser. Also in the session ttaad2130m000 for DEMO user I gave authz for pkg/module tdpur.<br />
<br />
Now for DEMO user screen appears as for 'Super User' but if tried to run any sessions including sessions from tdpur it is showing error msg as 'Cannot Start session' (no permission for session no so &amp; so)<br />
<br />
What to do ? Please guide me....<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />

<br />
First of all it should be clear whether you need to create a super user or a normal user.  If it is a super user then no need to define any session authorisation but if it is a normal user with DEM browser then you need to add session module with required role in his login. But if it normal user with MENU Browser then you need to define only session module authorisation not any role.<br />

<br />
As far as I understand, you require a super user with no authorisation for tools.<br />
<br />
When you create a super user, he/she has no authorisation for APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, APPLICAITON CUSTOMISATION, SQL QUERRIES, MENU MANAGEMENT etc.<br />
<br />
And when you give permission in session ttadv0142m000 (Maintain General Developer Authorisation), then the super user able to access the above menus.<br />
<br />
But if you don't want to give permission for entire TOOLS, then you have to create a normal user and give permission by module using ttaad2130m000 as said by RITA.<br />
<br />
I think this will solve your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganesh_kapase</div><div class="date">29th July 2005, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Manoj<br />
<br />
I want to go for second option ie for normal user with authz of all modules/sessions except entire TOOLS.<br />
<br />
I do agree with you and Ritas suggestions regarding ttaad2130m000 and tried for the same but its not working. I had given authz for Package / Module as td/pur for Start/End Time as 00 to 24 hrs., done CRDD.<br />
<br />
But as soon as I login by Normal user and I try to run session (tdpur4501m000) from above Package/Module it says 'Fatal Error No Permission for tdpur4501m000'. The same error message shows for any sessions.<br />
<br />
Please guide me in this matter at the earliest as its urgent for me.<br />
<br />
Thanx <br />

<br />
If session tdpur4501m000 is showing &quot;No permission for the session&quot; and the entire module of td pur is already given to the user then you have to check the same session i,e tdpur4501m000 in session ttaad2131m000.  You will notice that the session is showing EXCLUSIVE.  You need to delete that record and run CRDD.<br />

<br />
In the session ttaad2131m000 authz for tdpur4501m000 is not given even no other sessions are authz for the module td/pur.<br />
<br />
Please add your more comments....<br />
