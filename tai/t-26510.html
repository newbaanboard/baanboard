<br />
I changed daemon from rexec to blogind.<br />
In case of rexec, i could get access log by looking syslog but,<br />
blogind, i don't know how i can get access log.<br />
<br />
i found log.blogind file in $BSE/log but it's seems just for daemon, not for user access.<br />
<br />
Please advice for me:( <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) $BSE/log/licd6.1 shows an entry, whenever a bshell registers itself with the licence daemon. This is obviously usually at login time<br />
<br />
b) $BSE/lib/TIME.HIS logs for a user, the start end end date/time of each session, if you enable history in the user properties. This creates only a minor performance overhead, as this is only written, when a user ends a session of menu.<br />
<br />
The blogind also has an option &quot;-v&quot;, maybe this is standing for &quot;verbose&quot; and writes more entries to the log. But I did not try this.<br />

<br />
I checked log.licd6.1.<br />
There were some informations what I need.<br />
<br />
I tried &quot;blogind6.1 -v&quot;, as NPRao said, many informations about OS, Platform, etc. appered. Those were things what in blogind6.1(I watched that using &quot;strings&quot; command).<br />
<br />
Other hand, I tried to add access log to syslog using inetd.<br />
But I couldn't that.<br />
I edited /etc/inetd.conf &amp; /etc/services.<br />
Actuary, Inetd seems running, because BaanLogin port has been opened.<br />
But  BWC said an error message like &quot;Block couldn' t be read&quot;(Sorry I missed capture).<br />
I think , it's because of blogind uses BaanLogin protocol(rexec uses tcp).<br />
<br />
So, What are defferences between tcp and BaanLogin Protocol? <br />
<br />
Thank you &amp; Best Regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">1st March 2006, 14:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are looking for a Unix solution for something, which is allready solved in Baan:<br />
<br />
a) blogind is a real daemon by itself, which listens on a socket. It is not like telnetd, which basically waits to be started by inetd to get a stream passed.<br />
<br />
b) The successfull logins can be seen in log.licd6.1, the failed in log.blogind and the started sessions in TIME.his. <br />
<br />
So what are you actually looking for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayamylv</div><div class="date">2nd March 2006, 05:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for great informations, Markus.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I didn't say what I'm looking for clearly.<br />
<br />
I am looking for access informations such as &quot;Who&quot;, &quot;When&quot;, &quot;From Where&quot;, &quot;How(rexec/blogind)&quot; and &quot;Result(Successful/Failed)&quot; about baan.<br />
And if possible, I want to add them to syslog.<br />
<br />
All of my users usually used rexec to access to baan.<br />
So, I could always get access logs from syslog.<br />
But a part of users said to me that they wanted to use BaanLogin.<br />
I started blogind6.1 and edited syslog.conf(inserted &quot;daemon.info /var/adm/syslog/syslog.log) for getting logs on syslog.<br />
But, They didn't appear on there.<br />
<br />
So First, I was looking for access log files for baan because I didn't know log.licd6.1 &amp; TIME.HIS.<br />
By your aid, I knew them.<br />
I could get two things &quot;Who&quot; and &quot;When&quot;.<br />
And log.blogind told me &quot;Failed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Next, I was looking for the way to add them on syslog.<br />
But, I'm sorry. It ' suitable for here. It's an Unix solution as you said.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm looking for informations about &quot;From where&quot; and &quot;How&quot;<br />
Do you know that? <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you and Best Regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one reason why you as a unix person might also appreciate blogind should be that the password is passed encrypted, why with rexecd it is passed in the open.<br />
<br />
Now to your question &quot;from where&quot;:<br />
<br />
I think this is actually not so easy but can be done. Some of my customers wanted to actually find out the where, so that they can restrict double logins from the same PC, but still allowing double logins with the same user name.<br />
<br />
So the solution we are using there is to use a little utility called &quot;lsof&quot; and some scripting to get the TCP source adress of the bshell. This works pretty well. The trick is to configure baan not to call directly the bshell, but a script, when the GUI connects to baan. This is done by changing a file called ipc_info in $BSE/lib. Search the board for ipc_info and you should find plenty of hits how to do this.<br />

<br />
I searched lsof...It's good tool.<br />
I'll ask to my Boss if I can install lsof to our server.<br />
<br />
Thank you and Best Regards.</div></div><hr />
