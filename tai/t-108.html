<br />
Does anybody know how to determine the value of rds_full?Or how to know that the default value 5 is enough or not ?<br />
In my opinion the reason why the same report running with baan results slower than any other third party reporting tools or using a plane sql could be rds_full beceause it is the value of the maximum number of rows transerred between the viryal machine and the driver...any comments ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">28th August 2001, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no single perfect value for rds_full and related db environment settings. Baan absolutely insists not to put the value any higher than 5, preferably only set to 2 when working in a OLTP environment.<br />
However, when performing actions like table exports, reorganize tables, rds_full could/should be temporarily bumped up a much higher number to improve performance (e.g. 400).<br />
<br />
You can create several $BSE/lib/defaults/db_resource files and use the appriopriate one for each of your activities.<br />
<br />
You can 'set' which db_resource to choose by:<br />
<br />
export USR_DBC_RES=lib/defaults/db_resource.custom (client)<br />
export USR_DBS_RES=lib/defaults/db_resource.custom (server)<br />
<br />
Note: do not specify the $BSE path when using the USR_DBx_RES variables. $BSE is by default implied.</div></div><hr />

I think if the rds_full value is too small (even 5) it causes lots of network round trips.<br />
But the question is still : how to know ?  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">28th August 2001, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">You will have to 'experiment' with different settings and empirically determine which one works best for you. The trade off for smaller rds_full is user responsiveness and data contention (as OLTP is heavier on writing than for e.g. DSS systems). In a recent case with the Oracle8 client data corruption, Baan Support actually explicitly said not to put rds_full any higher than 4 to avoid data corruption in tdgld018. If your system shows a 10% write and 90% read split, then you may want to opt for higher rds_full values it will resemble more DSS characteristics.<br />

Also setting INF_MAX_ARRAY_INSERT (at least with Oracle that help, but Murat you are using informix) will help getting a better performance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the rds_full variable may not be the cause of your problem.<br />
<br />
There could be many reasons why a plain SQL has a different response time compared to when run through Baan.<br />
<br />
When run through Baan, you need to take into account <br />
<br />
1 The Baan database driver<br />
2 Index Optimisation in ora_storage file<br />
3 Settings in db_resource (not only rds_full)<br />
<br />
If you let us know some more info like the exact SQL statement(plus tables), db_resource settings, difference in times, Porting Set, Database version, then we maybe able to find the problem.</div></div><hr />
