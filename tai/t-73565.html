It also looks like we end a with a m_help*.mlog files.  Which I assume is some type of memory log file.  Now we just upgraded to 19c and a new porting set so we probably need to add more memory on the test server.  But does anyone know what is in these m_help log files that might point me to something specific?  We are getting any oracle errors just these alloc mem errors.</div></div><hr />

It appears that the billable cost report (tpcin9280m000) is slowly eating up memory until the job cannot allocate any more.  We have a incident open with infor on this and I sent them the last mlog file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they are memory logs showing you how much memory a program is allocating/de-allocating after usage. It shows memory allocations at different levels variables, functions, sql queries etc. I remember one time it helped us identifying a certain problem when we were getting fatal errors while running planning engine. It was a problem at configuration part due to which millions of orders were getting generated consuming way lot memory. I don't remember exactly what information helped but I do remember it was these memory logs.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully support see's something in the file.  I had the DBA's put in a trace on it on the last run - I am hoping they see something that might help.</div></div><hr />
