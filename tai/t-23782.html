 This had happenend to us couple of months back. The index had gone corrupt and there were lot of zero values in the index fields. Ended up logging a case with Microsoft and they were able to weed out the bad records, recreate the index and import the values back. $250 well worth :)<br />

do you have any other solution which won't cost any money? (^_^)v<br />
Noticing the errror messages given, do you think executing command &quot;DBCC CHECKTABLE repair_rebuid&quot; from SQL query will fix the problem without risking the data?<br />
We don't have any clean back up of the corrupted table.<br />
Anybody, please help.<br />
<br />
best regards.<br />
Richard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Even we did not have any clean backup. Did a export of that table data to a copy of that table (call it tfgld517)... and dropped the indexes of that table, recreated them. In our case, the tfgld417 had some records with zero values in it. Those need to be dropped out... If there are any in your case, probably you could right a script to delete any such duplicate records. <br />
I remember we did use the DBCC CHECKTABLE repair_rebuid command. This did the correction, but the issue is with those zero indexed records, if any. In case you dont have any such records, then your table should be repaired correctly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">20th April 2005, 06:05</div></div><div class="posttext">hi John,<br />
everytime we run a query on that table (select * from ttfgld417), the query will stop at a number of rows and these error messages appear at the end of the query:<br />
<br />
Server: Msg 8908, Level 22, State 6, Line 1<br />
Table Corrupt: Database ID 7, object ID 630891402, index ID 0. Chain linkage mismatch. (1:4039403)-&gt;next = (1:4080644), but (1:4080644)-&gt;prev = (1:4104369).<br />
Connection Broken  :mad: <br />
<br />
I tried to find records with zero values in the index field, and so far hasn't been able to find it because the query can't show all the records in the table.<br />
I even don't have any clue of how many records exist in this table, how many are fine and how many are broken.... :confused: <br />
<br />
The command &quot;select count&quot; in SQL will return error messages.<br />
Count Row in ttaad4500 for this table also returns error.<br />
<br />
Please advice. :( <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Can you do a DTS export of that table, to a flat file. I guess you wont have more than 1.5 million recs in that table. (the row length in that table being about 240 chars). Then you can take a look in the flat file for any such zero values in the indexes, if any.<br />
<br />
Also.. if you copy tfgld417 to say.. tfgld517... delete and recreate the index (there is only one index) on that new tfgld517 table and rebuild repair that table using DBCC.  See if this works. Then you can do the same on your tfgld417 table as well.<br />
<br />
Let me know how this works. All the best<br />

please give me hints of how to export the table into text file.<br />
I've tried the DTS, but seems to lost somewhere because i got this messages:<br />
<br />
Copy Data from ttfgld417101 to [newbaaan].[dbo].[ttfgld417101] Step<br />
<br />

<br />
If DTS is failing... you might want to select the data through query analyser, order by some field (instead of index). If that does not work.. can you try create a seq. dump file using std baan session.<br />
<br />
Also.... did you try to make a copy of that table in sql... ( you dont have to do any export there...it copies the data as well)... and do a DBCC rebuild on the new table ?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
LittleJohn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">21st April 2005, 05:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Little John,<br />
selecting the data excluding the index field (hash 1) doesn't work. The SQL query will always stop at around one hundred eighty six thousand rows. While from DBCC CHECKTABLES (see my first post in this thread) we know that there are 1791718 rows in this table. <br />
<br />
Happens the same when creating sequential dump table from Baan session. The error message shows error 850 when it reach around row 186600.<br />
<br />
I also tried to make a copy of that table in SQL, however it failed because once again the SQL can only return around 186600 rows. I think it quite confusing since we can browse the table in Baan session ttaad4500 without any problem, although executing Count Row from this session returns an error message.<br />
<br />
Do you have other idea of how to make a full copy of this corrupt table?<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

Richard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just a thougt .... does the table have more than one index?<br />
Perhaps it might be possible to write a mini-programm that uses index_x (if only index_1 is corrupt) to read and write all records (to a tmp table or seq file)?<br />
<br />
Funny that ttaad4500 doesn't die also :-O<br />
<br />
hth<br />
<br />
Norbert<br />
<br />
P.S.: As this seems to be a M$ problem and somebody mentioned it to have been solved by microsoft staff for 250$ .... don't you think that this might be an option too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">22nd April 2005, 02:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Norbert,<br />
I think the table has only 1 index. <br />
Anyway, i just found the corrupt record(s) in this table. <br />
ttaad4500 dies everytime i browse to this record, resulting these error messages:<br />
<br />
1. process 6 - Fatal error: Error 522 [Database driver lost connection to the database] on commit_trans<br />
2. process 6 - Fatal error: Can not continue in ttaad4500 [data.input]<br />
3. process 6 - Fatal error: Lost connection to database engine.<br />
4. process 8 - Fatal error: Transaction rolled back,please try again.[tfgld417101]<br />
5. process 8 - Fatal error: Can not continue in ttaad4500 [data.input]<br />
6. process 8 - Error: commit_trans: Automatic ttaad4500 failed [error 522]<br />
<br />
Do you know how to erase this corrupt record? I can't even access it either from Baan nor SQL....<br />
<br />
Danke.<br />
<br />

Richard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Another thing you can try......<br />
<br />
Open up the Enterprise Manager and go to that specific table. When you right click on the table... It should let you export or even BACKUP the table... go ahead and do either of these. Then, try to access that backed-up file and open it in excel or whatever and delete that record from that file. Try to re-import it. See if that works....  <br />
If you are able to do the above step... you might want to re-import that data into a temp table to see if there are more such corrupted records (try not to build the referential integrity after the import).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">25th April 2005, 05:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Little John,<br />
i can't back-up the table even from Enterprise Manager. The process will stop when it reaches the corrupt records. Anyway, we will try this following query:<br />
<br />
CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED<br />
  INDEX [Ittfgld417101_1a] ON [dbo].[ttfgld417101] ([hash1])<br />
WITH<br />
    DROP_EXISTING<br />
ON [PRIMARY]<br />
<br />
My senior try this query on the corrupt tfgld417 back-up, and it fixes the problem.<br />
This evening, i will try to execute this query on the original corrupt tfgld417.<br />
Please advice whether this query is safe or not....<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
  This will recreate the index for you and should hopefully fix the issue. Once this is done, also run the DBCC CHECKTABLE repair_rebuild.<br />
<br />
Just make sure no one is logged onto Baan at that time and there are no jobs posting any integration transactions (basically no record or table locks).<br />
<br />
All the best.<br />

 Any luck with the process. Were you able to recover the data ?<br />
<br />
hope things are back on track now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">27th April 2005, 14:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Little John,<br />
we have successfully restored tfgld417 by executing DBCC CHECKTABLE REPAIR_REBUILD after we changed the database access mode to 'single user'.<br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />
<br />
But we have a new problem, Houston. :o <br />
FYI, rebuilding tfgld415 is our main issue since we fully lost it due to corrupt data. And to rebuild this table, we need tfgld410,tfgld418, and tfgld417 in fine condition and session tfcor1218m000 (downloaded from Baan Support).<br />
Just then, we have executed session tfcor1218m000 but got nothing.<br />
Table tfgld415 is still empty.<br />
<br />
Anybody knows what happen?<br />
<br />

Richard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is good news.... <br />
But, Are you sure that tfgld410, tfgld418 are not corrupt ?<br />
once tfgld417 data is in... you might want to rebuild the referential integrity for this data. I remember doing that.... but not really sure. Check with Baan Supprt</div></div><hr />

i performed DBCC CHECKDB last night and the result shows no error.<br />
I have asked Baan Support about this tfcor1218m000 issue, but they haven't answer yet. Do you know how to rebuild the referential integrity? <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anybody know what could have been the cause of this &quot;consistency error&quot;? Was it BaanERP's or SQL Server's fault? It gives you uneasy feeling when you don't know the actual cause. Because you know that it could easily happen again if we don't find the cure at the root cause. Thanks, guys<br />
