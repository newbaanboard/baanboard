SP-6 is now in the status of &quot;To install&quot;.<br />

But, when we try to install SP-6, we are getting the following Fatal Error message:<br />

But, we did a mistake that after scanning the solution of SP-6 , I just did CRDD for Tools for all package combination. After that few users worked on the system and then we did CRDD for all package combinations.<br />
<br />
Then we disconnected and unloaded total SP-6 and tried to install the same without any intermediate mistake.<br />
<br />
Pls. suggest the corrective steps.</div></div><hr />

Error 2 usually indicates to 'file not found'. If it does then I would say that the object has not been properly patched with the license info and then you could try to run the session Patch objects after error solving and see if that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After all the users were offline, I did run the Patch Objects after error Solving session for all Baan tools. I did not run this time CRDD session for all Package Combinations.<br />
After that I tried to Install the solution. But getting the following Bw messages:<br />
<br />
1: Process 9 - Fatal Error: Dynamic Link Failure function 'ttpmcdllcom.special.tools.solution'<br />
<br />
2: Process 9 - Fatal Error:Cannot continue in ttpmc220505s000().<br />
<br />
However, the status of SP-6 got changed to Installing.<br />
<br />
I am looking for your reply.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason that the status now is 'Installing' is of course because your session crashed out in the middle of the SP-6 install?<br />
<br />
Did you check the $BSE/log files for any relevant errors?<br />
Did you try to restart the SP-6 installation?<br />
Are you absolutely sure you did not encounter any problems during the SP-5 installation?<br />
<br />
In any case, I would take this to Baan support as well!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure there was no problem during SP-5 installation and it is now in Installed status. I did not get relevant error msg. in ${BSE}/log, but I noticed some errors in Window NT's event viewer. I am attaching the sreen dumps of the errors<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
