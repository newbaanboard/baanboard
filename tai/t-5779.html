<br />
When  we select ascii file as output for a report ,it creates the asci file on the server (on a shared folder). <br />
<br />
Is it possible to let the ascii files create on clients own disks.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Caner</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also you can create a new device for output to MS WORD or Notepad, or excel (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=691)  How to create it is described in some other threads and explained in BaaN Support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Creating a folder in C drive &amp; sharing it full without any password.<br />
<br />
2. On fileout giving path as \\computername\shared folder\filename.<br />
<br />
3. This is working fine at our end.</div></div><hr />

amarpreet,<br />
 I tried your way but the file still is creating on the server and not on the client  disk.<br />
<br />
what are your settings of your ascii file device?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">device type - Rewrite file.<br />
<br />
4GL program - ttstpconv<br />
<br />
Argument - ASCII<br />
<br />
path - fileout<br />
<br />
change allowed - Yes (Marked)<br />
<br />
Also please check the path correctly. e.g My computer name is Amarpreet &amp; shared folder name is report, and creatign file stock.txt on my hard disk I am giving output file's path as <br />
<br />
  \\amarpreet\report\stock.txt<br />
<br />
i think this will work.</div></div><hr />

I am trying to create the dump on my system (client). I have created the device. Also, I have a folder on my PC which is sharable. Ouput file path is - &lt;\\Client PC name\shared folder\file name&gt;. But, I get the following errorS -<br />
<br />
Cannot create &lt;The Output file mentioned&gt;<br />
Conversion is cancelled.<br />
<br />
Am I missing out something!?<br />
<br />

<br />
The folder should be shared completely without any PW. <br />
<br />
Also in that folder there should be a file existing with the same name as you are giving in the output file name</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Notice that Amarpreet has given a UNC name (a machine name starting in '\\'). This naming convention is limited to Windows. If your Baan server is on Unix, this will not work. For those on Windows it is a working proposition. I would like to throw a spanner in the works though. Open network shares are a security risk, especially in these days of worms. For both the above reasons Kevin's solution (reimplemented and posted by Mark) is a better bet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our device settings are the same .<br />
what is your server's OS . <br />
Our OS is HP-UX.  <br />
I have tested it on windows 98 and 2000 but both did not work . it is creating it on the server with a file name like '\\Computer Name\Shared folder\filename'<br />

<br />
Please see my above post. Amarpreet's solution will not work if the Baan server is on Unix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 11:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
The OS is Windows NT. I am giving the UNC name in the output file. The shared folder has no password and has got all the permissions. Also, this time I created the text file (test) in that shared folder. In the output file, I mentioned this file name, along with the complete path. But, still I get the same error!! But, one more thing - what is the point in creating a file before mentioning it in the output file!!?<br />

<br />
My mistake, please ignore my previous message<br />
<br />
Also in that folder there should not be a file existing with the same name as you are giving in the output file namenot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
Fine. But, still I get the same error!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ashimvig</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">On the client end.<br />
<br />
Create a folder and give full access sharing without password..<br />
<br />
When printing any report in the device give &quot;ASCIF&quot; (Plain ASCIF File - Rewrite File).<br />
In the Output file give &quot;\\computername\foldername\filename&quot;.<br />
and then Click on Continue...<br />
<br />
Check in the folder created earlier and the file will be there.<br />
<br />
OS - WINDOWS NT<br />
CLIENT - Windows 9.x or above<br />
<br />
I hope u have NT Domain.</div></div><hr />

[list=1]<br />
 Check to see if you have any spaces in your filename or sharename<br />
 From your server's command prompt try a copy command to the path and filename you are trying in your device data. For ex: c:\&gt;copy foo.txt \\mycomputer\myshare\foo.txt[/list=1]</div></div><hr />
