This component was delivered in solution 147020 (Base VRC 7.6_a_tt) and is needed to be able to scan Feature Packs and solutions on top of Feature Pack 1 or higher. <br />
Maybe some PMC objects were copied from another (newer) environment to this environment?</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your valuable info  &amp; help..<br />
