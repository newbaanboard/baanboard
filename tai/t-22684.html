I would like to know if anybody has had any recent success with session &quot;Connect Components to PMC Solution&quot; (ttpmc1221m000) and the customisation admin functionality. I have being able to load compenents using the selection criteria on form 2, but its will be easiest on our department utilizing the Cust. Admin functionality as this forms part of our SOX requirements / procedures.<br />
<br />
Any help or documentation (please not PMC news) would be greatly appreciated <br />
Many Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
Personally, I use PMC Distributor to move solutions from one machine to another, I think that it is much more flexible than Customization Admin..<br />

Within the new PMC functionality and session ttpmc1221m000, Connect Components to PMC solution - this session has 5 different methods to add components to an individual solution that you have created in ttpmc1100m000, Maintain Solutions. <br />
One method is to attach a Customization Admin. Project and then through this session it would add all the components from your Cust. Admin Proj.  to the PMC distribution solution that would be seen in sub session ttpmc1120s000, Maintain Components by solution.<br />
So unfortuately in our organisation they are connected and would like to know if anybody has had any success with this functionality. <br />
Many Thanks<br />

<br />
My fault. <br />

Good luck, I know nothing about CA.<br />

If the latter, then we have some tools we developed that we can give you to try.</div></div><hr />

If your problem is that no components are added to the PMC solution if you select the Cust. Adm. option on form 1, be sure that you select the full ranges and all component types on the 2nd form. The help info on the Cust. Adm field contains the phrase: &quot;The selections on the second form also apply to this option&quot;.</div></div><hr />
