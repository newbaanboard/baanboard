<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ciavaglia</div><div class="date">23rd February 2004, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Each package in Baan (tc,td,tf,ti....) can have multiple VRC levels.  A package VRC combination consists of taking one VRC level from each package.  This combination is then linked to a company so Baan knows which VRC level to start searching for components.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">23rd February 2004, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi James,<br />
<br />
this is such a basic (but also important) question in Baan, that I strongly advise you to take an Administration course (AA), if your job is administrating Baan.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, here a short description:<br />
<br />
<br />
VRC = Version Release Customization<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
B40 c4 stnd<br />
<br />
Version: B40<br />
Release: c4<br />
Customization: stnd<br />
<br />
The VRC is the concept within Baan for version management (within a single installation). for each package (td, ti, ...) you define a so called VRC structure. This is basically a derivation structure of version, ie. the update VRC is derived from the standard VRC, the customer VRC is derived from the update VRC and so on. A typical but simple example would be:<br />
<br />
<br />
TEST VRC<br />
   |<br />
LIFE VRC<br />
   |<br />
Patch VRC<br />
   |<br />
Standard VRC<br />
<br />
Which structure is suitable for you, can depend on a lot of factors (customizations, in house developments, patch strategy, ...)<br />
<br />
In principal each VRC can contain a specific version of a software component (ie. a form, report, session , ...). If your current company in baan is assigned to the Test VRC (or to be correct Test Package combination), then Baan will first search in the TEST, then Life, then Patch, then Standard VRC for your SW. <br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that cleared things a bit. If not, as I said, better get some training. This subject is important!! Companies like mine actually make a living from giving consulting in this area!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a question: Are you really using Baan6? <br />
Your are one of a kind!!!</div></div><hr />
