There is no 'fixed' post for Baan GUI topics as such. By creating this thread you have set up one for you and other board members to use as discussion area.<br />
<br />
Regarding GUI: it is usually recommended to use the latest GUI version possible as each newer version irons out - should do least - more bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never had a problem with the latest BW client...<br />
<br />
except<br />
<br />
The infamous display server termination message when the BW client was new and the porting set was out of date.  I have had the DS problem when the BW client was old when a new porting set was put in as well (very common).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks for information regarding GUIs but can you advise of where I can find the version numbers , what the &quot;enhancements&quot; are and the date of release ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">As advise, you should have the same level of:<br />
- portingset<br />
- BW client (latest from solution 13743)<br />
- ottstpstandard (standard program)<br />
This will get rid of several &quot;common&quot; errors.<br />
<br />
When a new release is made of a BW/BWPrint, you also get a list of bug fixes. Check solution 13743 for the latest bug fixes and latest binaries.<br />
If you need an old version of BW, use anonymous ftp into  ftp.support.baan.com and then /updates/B40/bw40c  (for BaanIV, check under /updates for other Baan versions).<br />
The BW's are always sync'ed with the portingset releases (eg., portingset 6.1c.06.02 has BW 062 - you have also minor versions in between major portingset releases) and the date of the binaries in the ftp above are the dates of release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks for the explanation and clarification<br />
<br />
I will now do some research</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 22:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The BW client version can be determined by looking at the &quot;splash&quot; screen that comes up after the BW client is launched.  Or, you can look in the &quot;about&quot; button on the BW configuration screen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">8th December 2001, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for advice again <br />
<br />
To explain my team are just taking over Admin and from a standing start having been ( and still ) supporting a legacy system<br />
so we have to get ourselves some education without much resource time <br />
<br />
Question<br />
<br />
We are currently &quot;testing&quot; SP8 on IVc4 but the BW Clients are a mixture ( not very satisfactory )<br />
<br />
In our live environment again we have a variety of versions of BW client<br />
<br />
It would be &quot;neater&quot; from Admin pov if we could upgrade all to BW62  ie the porting set we are using for SP8 testing<br />
<br />
Is it advisable to do this in the live environment ahead of the upgrade to SP8 with the new porting set ?<br />
<br />
IE Is it advisable to go to to later version BW than the current porting set version ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">8th December 2001, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience most of the problems I have seen are with older BW clients with newer porting sets.  I cannot recall when I have seen a problem caused by the reverse.<br />
<br />
I have done a mass upgrade by first pushing the new BW client out several days before the porting set upgrade.  But before I did this, I ran the new BW on a select group of power users for 1-2 weeks before doing the mass rollout to make sure that no problems would develop.<br />

<br />
Will follow that strategy <br />
<br />
I received the email below from a &quot;helpful user&quot; <br />
<br />
Have you any knowledge as to which GUI this is as I cannot find reference in the documentation( Bugfixes) I have for BW62 / or have you any experience in using this  <br />
<br />
&quot;Linked tool will give you the possibility to print directly from Baan to<br />
Windows applications. Ask your systems manager to install this software.<br />
This software has been integrated in the latest GUI software, so when you<br />
are using the latest GUI version you don't need this software at all to<br />
print to Windows.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">8th December 2001, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, must be refering to ttstpconv.<br />
<br />
When you are printing, you can select as your device ttstpconv and then Baan will send the output more or less &quot;formated&quot; for Excel, Word, etc. Have a look at an example for Excel in the thread:<br />
