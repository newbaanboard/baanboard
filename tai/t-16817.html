<br />
if you have R.* files, you need to make sure something didn't go wrong with a bdbreconfig before you remove 'em..<br />

Also keep in mind, that re-printing needs that files.<br />

<br />
Hello,<br />
i aggree with malutz,<br />
to prevent deleting of all files in BaaN tmp-dir we're running <br />
<br />
find /daten/tmp -name &quot;tmp*&quot; -mtime +14 -exec rm -f {} \;<br />
<br />
Deleting all &quot;tmp&quot; files are older than 14 days !<br />
<br />
find /daten/tmp -name &quot;tmp*&quot; -size 0c -exec rm -f {} \;<br />
<br />
Deleting all files with size = zero !<br />
<br />
find /daten/tmp -name &quot;qp*&quot; -mtime +2 -exec rm -f {} \;<br />
<br />
Deleting all &quot;qp&quot; files older than 2 days !<br />
<br />
in cron.<br />
<br />

could download Active Perl and run my little perl program here<br />

to write their own...<br />

If it happened that you did not down baan/print daemon every day then it would probably be incorrect to delete everything older than a day.<br />
<br />
We use scripts that are similar to the examples posted by bdittmar<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">19th October 2004, 03:32</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a good point, But windows doesn't have a printer daemon.. Plus pd_lock just holds the pid of the printer daemon.. the only thing that this MIGHT affect is being able to rc.stop_pdaemon, (or maybe you could start 2 pdaemons) all around, no big deal..<br />
<br />
Still though, its probably good practice not to delete them. On unix, look out for pd_lock and .licd6.X in $BSE/tmp.<br />
<br />
The only things that can really get you are<br />
A) Long running processess<br />
B) tmp files that you wanted to reprint..<br />
C) R-Files that you wanted to recover.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">24th December 2006, 03:27</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you running on Windows if you have perl on your servers (If you don't you should :)  ) you can take advantage of bernd's good &quot;find&quot; advices by using find2perl. The way this works is you replace find for find2perl. This will not execute the command but will generate the necessary perl code for it. You can then send it to a file with &quot;&gt;&quot; so you can see, modify and improve the code (it is amazing how much you can learn that way) or you can pipe it to perl like this:<br />
<br />
find2perl /daten/tmp -name &quot;tmp*&quot; -mtime +14 -exec rm -f {} \;|perl<br />
<br />
That will execute the command as if were running the regular find in UX<br />
<br />
I hope that helps<br />
<br />
I personally think it is very neat.</div></div><hr />
