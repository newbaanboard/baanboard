<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">14th March 2009, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a work around for SLM (i guess). For this you would have to get hold of a Baan4 master CD thats meant for Windows 2000/SQL 2000. Once you install the OS, DB followed by Baan, upgrade the OS to Windows 2003. To incorporate SQL 2005 compatibility, install porting set 6.1c.07.13 or anything thats below 20. Then upgrade the db to SQL 2005. Though this is theoretical,  its practical (from my experience) till applyng the porting set 13 part...The rest is up for testing..<br />

Along with porting set, the limitation of this work-around is that you keep your environment on SP 20 or 19. I guess from SP 21 onwards, it brings about the change in the way Baan4 is licensed. In short, birth of SLM!! <br />

<br />
Yes, you have to install the SLM on real hardware as long as you try to use it with VMWare. If you really want to have a complete virtual environment just try Suns Virtualbox, the installation of the SLM works fine...<br />

1. the will tell you exactly which versions are supported<br />
2. you have an official statement.<br />

You probably pay for support so I would say don't hesitate to ask them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">7th April 2009, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">They reply this...<br />
<br />
Please find the attached document ( latest porting set guide page no.13) which talks on vmware support.<br />
Please follow the same.<br />
<br />
INFOR SUPPORT<br />
<br />
Details: Hi,Which version of Baan IVc4 Service Pack which Infor support as guest on VMware Server?<br />
Client's Reference ID:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">7th April 2009, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I reply back..<br />
<br />
I don't understand. Currenty I am on Baan IVc4 SP10 and it is tested able to run in virtual.<br />
<br />
Then they reply with this and say This is the recommendation from INFOR as part of standard support process. However out of your own interest you can decide accordingly.<br />
<br />
From support , we have suggested our recommendations. I addressed your incident with the necessary resolution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">7th April 2009, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">now they reply me..<br />
<br />
Please let me know what is not clear to you. You are in BAAN IVc4 environment and there is no SLM concept in it.<br />
<br />
SLM is there from ERPLN . Please write your requirement very clearly and more specifically.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">7th April 2009, 11:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Steve,<br />
  I guess there is some confusion here between Porting Sets and Service Packs as they(Infor) have responded to Porting Set but your initial doubts concerns Service Pack. Correct me if i got it wrong!!:o<br />
<br />
Its your organization's prerogative to decide what Service Pack you should be on. As long as you have a support contract with Infor, they are bound to &quot;support&quot; you with your problems. Service Packs brings with it certain advantages in the form of enhancements (&amp; certain disadvantages in the form of new bugs, Cant help it :p). From what i have read, on some posts and service pack instructions (some time back), one of the changes implemented by these Service Packs (&gt;20) is the adoption of SLM as the licensing mechanism. SLMs don't like VMs. The appropriate porting set that you need to have to install a particular Service Pack is mentioned in the Pre-Requisite section of the Service Pack instructions. <br />
<br />
Now to your requirement, if you want to have both the licensing &amp; the application on one VM server, then i suggest you stop at Service Pack 19 or 20 (which ever that doesn't bring along SLM) and it will work fine on a VM server. This wouldn't mean that Infor wouldn't support you just because you stopped at 19 or 20 (unless someone proves me wrong!!). You could check with Infor about the availability of porting set 6.1c.07.13 (which is the minimum p.s needed if you want to use SQL 2005)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">1st May 2009, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">so to have SP 20 which does not have SLM, which porting set version should i use?<br />
<br />
6.1c.07.20 ?<br />
<br />
the latest porting set is 6.1c.08, follow by 6.1c.07.21, then 6.1c.07.20, 6.1c.07.19 etc..<br />
<br />
<br />
now i am on SP10 with porting set 6.1c.07.13<br />
<br />
for SP installation, i have to do one by one till SP20..<br />
<br />
what about porting set. can i jump to install the latest?<br />
<br />
also can i use latest porting set with only SP20...<br />
<br />
as the porting set pdf say below..<br />
<br />
<br />
With porting set 6.1c.07.21 and later, it is supported to run the distributions on VMWare ESX 3.5 and ESXi 3.5 for all purposes, including production.<br />
When you size the system, take the overhead of VMWare ESX/ ESXi into account. For guidelines, refer to the Sizing guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">2nd May 2009, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi steve,<br />
  Service Pack 20 will work on porting set 6.1c.07.13, and so you don't have to move on to a higher porting set for the sake of applying SP 20. The documentation of Service Pack 20 would confirm this.<br />
<br />
I am not sure about the other questions regarding the compatibility between porting set 21 and service pack 20. There shouldn't be a problem since one relates to the OS and the other is related to the application respectively. <br />

<br />
2.) Baan_IVc4_Master_incl._6_1c_07_13_Windows_ENG<br />
<br />
3.) PMC Service Pack 3<br />
<br />
4.) Service Pack Up to SP8<br />
<br />
5.) Service Pack 9 then 10 and then install 40 over solutions.<br />
