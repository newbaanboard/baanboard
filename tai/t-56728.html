Our Hard Disk of the BaaN Server crashed and we were unable to recover the data from  it. And hence, no backup of sequential dumps and $BSE folder could be recovered<br />
<br />
We had only SQL Data backup(&quot;.bak&quot; file). Now we had installed the BaaN server afresh. We have tried to restore the data (All tables except TOOLS tables) using SQL DTS import/export wizard in SQL Server 2000.<br />
All data have been copied except &quot;parameters table&quot;. Error - &quot;Duplicate index value&quot; is displayed every time we try to restore/export any parameter table.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">9th September 2009, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">This means u did not have SQL backup . U have only export dump of each table. <br />
<br />
If importing para tables say duplicate , then it already exists . Why import again . Check in SQL ent manager the data in para table . <br />
<br />
Further if u are not importing any tools tables , then all customizations (form,report, program , sessions, label , tables , domain ) are not imported . And your create runtime dd (ttadv5210m000) will wipe out  all customized domain/ table / sessions dictionaries. And form,report , programs etc will not be available for modification in future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vktonk</div><div class="date">12th September 2009, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hitesh,<br />
Thanks for your reponse. Actually we are having only SQL Server Database Back up file - &quot;.bak&quot; file. I just deleted the rows of parameters tables thro' GTM. Then export parameters tables from .bak file to newly created baandb tables using SQL DTS functionality. All tables exported successfully<br />
<br />
Now next step is to export data of tools tables, so that the customization is also uploaded. But as you mentioned, i have already done CRDD for tools. Are there any selective tools tables which store customization? If not what is the other wayout?<br />
<br />
Please help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">14th September 2009, 06:55</div></div><div class="posttext">As u have the entire  environment backup , there is no reason why u should not restore entire tools directory unless u have installed the same again and at a different service pack level .<br />
<br />
Selectively it may be better to exclude the tables not to be restored rather than to select tables to be restored .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vktonk</div><div class="date">14th September 2009, 07:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually guys here were having no info about the PVRC, Combination, Service pack level etc as their IT guys resigned and did not pass on info. I got to know only company numbers<br />
<br />
I arbitrarily created pkg. combi, pVRC, and installed upto SP 23.<br />
Is there any way to load tools tables to restore customizations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">14th September 2009, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">U have / had the environment . First restore the same so that work can go on<br />
from runtime.<br />
<br />
Then U can study package combination / packge VRCs from packagefile defs .  Create such packge comb/vrcs in actually . From the tools dump import/export records of customized VRC's  only (No ready list of tables!) . And import the filtered records and then rebuild ttadv5210m000 .  <br />
<br />
In short there is no short cut to ur customization restore problem.<br />
<br />
If there is not much customization , it is not worth . U may simply create the customization again.</div></div><hr />
