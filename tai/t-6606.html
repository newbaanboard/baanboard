<br />
However our change control processes dictate that all solutions must progress through each server and be signed off<br />
<br />
This means that we have &quot;some&quot;  solutions on the test server which are not on the live server<br />
<br />
We are likely therefore to be loading solutions onto the live server using the tools from SP9 when we had loaded them previously using the tools as SP8 on the test<br />
<br />
Is this much of a risk ???</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is always a risk in these kind of situations and they maybe hidden to some users out there, as the main problems could appear in solutions linked to your DEM or EDI! <br />
<br />
The tools solutions may change a few things which could alter the way that SP 9 solutions are used. Baan say that you can install tools before doing the applications but as with most things, this is not the best way. A total upgrade should be done really and not be in a state of limbo between SP9 tools, SP 8 solutions or the other way round. <br />
<br />
In other words, do the full upgrade on your test server then the live server in full before trying to do anything halfway.<br />
<br />
Having recently done this procedure, I know how problematic a half installed system can be. If you want to talk it through with me, you know how to get me.</div></div><hr />
