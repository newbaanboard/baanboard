i am using standard functionality of baan to display drawings.<br />
the problem is we have aroung 660 user license and different user logs in to different application server.<br />
my problem is how do i access drawings from a different server .<br />
i can quite easily access it from the sam application server , what it does is actually downloads the file from application server to alocal folder (c:\temp) and then using the *.exe which i have maintaines in edi parameters displays it .<br />
how do i access drawing from diferent server , i tried using remote shell commands but it didnt work .<br />
am i missing something.<br />
i also tried using remote shell daemon but that doesnt work too.<br />
any one ready to throw some light  on this area .<br />

<br />
How about making the files shared by NFS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ankybanky</div><div class="date">12th December 2001, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">hello patvdv<br />
i didnt get  by sharing it as nfs <br />
i am using  unix servers as well as nt servers for my application.<br />
can u be more elaborate on this issue<br />
regards ankur</div></div><hr />

You can get NFS clients for Windows too (e.g. Reflection NFS). Or alternatively you could use SAMBA/CIFS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">12th December 2001, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I vote for the samba/cifs solution.  NFS between platforms runs into too many issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ankybanky</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello <br />
nfs makes the system damn slow , isnt there any other way i can do this .<br />
please look in to this <br />

Personally I would use the Samba/CIFS but you won't avoid the additional pressure on system resources. Somehow your data still has to cross between servers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ankybanky</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">hello pat<br />
what settings do i need to make  just give me a brief , never had a chance to put on hands on samba/cifs<br />
would require a detailed settings.<br />

<br />
That would be very difficult as I do not know your systems. Assuming you are running HP-9000 servers you can read some good stuff on CIFS at: http://docs.hp.com<br />
<br />
But with hindsight and rereading your post: where are those drawings actually stored? Are you accessing them through BW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ankybanky</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">hello pat <br />
 the setup as below , we use  hp k class servers , on informix.<br />
i have to access drawings from another application server ( we share baan licenses across servers). and only one database server<br />
say 100 users access server A<br />
other 100 users access servers B<br />
and my drawing are there in server C which only 25 users access<br />
so i want my drawing in server C , so that all users can access these drawing from there baan session.<br />
what settings do i need to make in &quot; Maintain Edm paramters &quot; session to access all these drawings .<br />
regards ankur <br />
We use Baan4c4 .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">If your users are not using BW, then you could write a shell script to FTP a drawing over and then display it.  But, I'm guessing they are using BW.  In that case, I think you have a few options:<br />
<br />
(1) Implement something like NFS to allow servers A and B to &quot;see&quot; the drawings as if they were local to them (as described in previous posts), OR<br />
(2) Customize the itiedm0015 function (which does the drawing display) and compile all of the appropriate scripts that use it.<br />
(3) Write a windows app that can do the FTP and then display the drawing.  However, the windows app won't be passed the filename and path on unix, only the temp file path and file name (and this temp file won't exist because the server2client call will not work w/o NFS), so you would have to discern the unix location.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I don't have better advice.<br />

<br />
I am not familiar with EDM and its setup. I guess the session requires you specify a hardcoded path to your drawings. In that case you would the  same directory to be available on your application servers. For that you could use NFS/Samba/CIFS as said before. I do not think you can tweak this purely from the EDM parameters.</div></div><hr />
