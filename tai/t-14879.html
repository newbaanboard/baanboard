<br />
When using caracters from Alt 0129 to Alt 0159 the user gets a &quot;can't convert TSS character&quot; error. <br />
<br />
From this forum I found some descriptions regarding the TSS problem, indicating a problem related to the porting set (we use 6.1c.06.02) but have Baan released a solution to the problem ?<br />
<br />
The really weird thin is that baan actually saves the character in the informix base, and afterwards the character show's correctly (but the user still get a error message). So things is in some way working but annoying the users.<br />
<br />
But the problem have hit another stage, when accesing the informix db from an ODBC connection, the interface resurns a &quot;CLI fetch row&quot; error when trying to read a string field containing a caracter from 0129 to 0159, but all other unicode characters is working fine. The problem is that the SQL interrupts when hitting the error and the script breaks. <br />
<br />
One solution is to search the database and change the characters to some other characters, but as long as the users can enter &quot;illigal&quot; characters and Baan stores them can the problem reoccur.<br />
<br />
Any Ideas is appreciated</div></div><hr />
