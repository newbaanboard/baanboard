I do want to know why the JOB DAEMON is company wise.<br />
Why not PVRC wise or anyother</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">19th February 2007, 01:56</div></div><div class="posttext">It has to. If you have 10 different companies linked to the same Pack Combination you could potentially have ten different sets of &quot;Job Data&quot; tables (you know the ttaad5XX). That means that nothing prevents you from having a job with the same name on each company. The only way to differentiate them is by linking them to their companies.<br />
Even if potentially it could have been implemented as one daemon polling all the associated companies it is not a good idea. The biggest problem job daemons have is that it is a single bshell attending the requests of all your jobs. That is terribly inconvenient as it is right now running all the scheduled jobs in only one company. Imagine letting it handle those of all your companies in your Pack Combo. One bshell means only one session will be run at a time. So for starters you can't run simultaneous jobs. But the worst part is that one sessions that hangs your daemon will cause all the next jobs to fail. <br />
Don't use job daemons. Cron for UX and Win scheduler for Windows work much better.</div></div><hr />
