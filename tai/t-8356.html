We are having problems of connecting our Server in the Head-Office to the clients at the Plant, As the Plant is in a remote location, there is no stable connectivity for the clients with the Server. Thus for this, we looked at a number of options like using Citrix, PC Anywhere and RAS, but nothing seems to be working for us. Now we are looking at the option of VSAT for the connectivity, can someone let me know if there are any BaaN sites which use the same for the connectivity and what is the minimum bandwidth needed for one user for transfering the data across. we have to connect minimum number of users as the cost is an important factor over here.<br />
