It works fine.  How can I get Word to start a specific macro after it loads the file?  Do I add something to the Argument field in the Device?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

for starting a Macro, automatically, as soon as it starts, you dont have to do anything in Baan.<br />
You need to change your macro, which you have written in Word.<br />
<br />
What ever function that you want to be executed in Word, as soon as it starts, place it under this standard function in Macro.<br />
Sub Auto_Open()<br />
      'put your code, which you want to execute as soon as word starts<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

I had someone spend some time trying everything we could think of and finally came up with the solution.<br />
<br />
If your macro is named xyz, then your argument in your device is &quot;RTF:winword.exe -mxyz&quot;.  You have to be using baan client 58 or above for this to work.</div></div><hr />

This is a new thing - 'activating a specific macro from baan client'.<br />
which I dont know.<br />
Thanks for sharing the info..<br />
