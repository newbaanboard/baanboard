<br />
I just wanted to give a heads up.  I installed some tools patches last week to update my system.  After doing that, I found some baan (IVc4) reports in &quot;run away&quot; mode.  I had tmp files in the tmp directory that were just huge!<br />
<br />
I found out that the system was stuck in an endless loop while trying to retrieve text.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that I spend two days in debug mode before I foud the problem.<br />
<br />
I had data in ttttxt001 (ttttxt001.opwd) that refererenced a text window that did not exist in ttttxt004.  In running a report, the report would issue a query to retrieve ttttxt004.coln.  In this case, because the text window got deleted, a NULL value was returned and that created a run away process.<br />
<br />
It really got ugly when the report went beyond 9,999 pages.  Then I got format overflow allerts added to the event log and I got windows messages that the application log file was full.<br />
<br />
To be safe, I recomend everyone to do a check to make sure that all the text windows that exist in txt001 are defined in txt004.<br />
<br />
Baan will let you delete the text window even though it exist in txt001.<br />
<br />
I logged a case with support even though I fixed the problem on my system.<br />

Hi Roy,<br />
 <br />
The solution that nailed you was: 143542.<br />
 <br />
I've created a defect, I'm not sure how they will choose to solve it. As if see it, there are 3 options:<br />
 <br />
1) Fix the reference between tttxt004-&gt;tttxt001, currently it is Mandatory / No Check / No Check / No Reference Check. (Reference mode / Update / Delete / Check By DBMS )<br />
This would most likely cause tttxt001 to be reconfigured which is not an ideal solution, and could result in loss of data..<br />
 <br />
2) Fix the code of &quot;Maintain Text windows&quot; to manually do a check, this is a good option, but it still leaves <br />
text in tttxt001 with bad text windows.<br />
 <br />
3) Resolve whatever problem in repdll causes the looping. This is the ideal solution from my point of view, however, it may not be possible if there is no other way to code the fix made in sol 143542.<br />
 <br />
I will keep you informed of the status as I find out more.<br />

Hans, I think we had a similar issue but not bad as in Nelson's case.<br />
Then I wrote a 3-GL program to cleanup/fix all the texts in all the system, I couldnt find that program now.<br />
But later we came up with standard text templates(windows, groups, authorizations etc), which are created during company creations.</div></div><hr />

because the Text Window linked to your text is deleted), the session will<br />
