<br />
You have defined 21 fields. That means that in each line in the file ther should be 20 field separators. (I'm assuming that you did define field separtors for files in exchange scheme). Also the field separator should be the same as the one defined for the scheme &quot;;&quot; or &quot;|&quot; or,...</div></div><hr />

As per your screenshot all start positions are &quot;0&quot; which is incorrect. They need to be recalculated.<br />
Hope it works for you.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
define all the fields as alphanumeric. The problem shoud go away. Now you can set each field one by one to the desired type and test. By the way when you define field separators the beginning and end lenghts are ignored and need not be entered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">18th January 2006, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">After you set up you ASCII file you can use it to print out your datafile and see if the data looks correct. Use Print ASCII files under the misc. menu and don't supply any field numbers to get them all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easiest thing to do with this is to set up an Export identical to the Import and see what data it spits out. This should give you a feel for what is wrong with your import data.<br />

   Use the Print ASCII File Session tuxch0202m000 to display all your fields.  This will let you know if you have incorrect fields.</div></div><hr />

They can't be empty or Baan will complain when you run the import and give you just the error message that you are getting.   Try putting a zero in if the birthdate field is empty.</div></div><hr />
