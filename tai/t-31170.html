   While installing Baan4 on a SQL 2000 Sp3a running on Win 2000 SP4 it gave me failure notice &quot;Table cant be locked&quot; for each and every table it was trying to create in baandb database. Once the installation was over and i tried logging in to Baan, it gave a message Table not found in the BW Error window..<br />
<br />
Mixed Signals: The installation was however successfull at creating baandb database that i confirmed by checking the SQL 2000 Enterprise Manager. But apart from the system tables that comes with the creation of a database, there were no tables related to baan. I was able to login to Query Analyzer using the sa username and password and SQL Server manager showed that all the services were running. The local system account with which i am logging to the server, named baan, is a member of the administrators group. <br />
<br />
Finally on checking the application event log, it revealed that the tables were not created due to lack of permissions!!!! <br />
<br />
If it was permission related issue, how come the database was successfully created? Any ideas as to what went wrong and where?<br />

I have run into many problems when using remote desktop for installs.  If you have been, try installing it from the console and see if that works.<br />

Thanks,<br />

The problem was solved however not in any manner anyone would be proud of. Started From Scratch!! Oh yeah, formatted it again. <br />
Nope, it wasnt done through remote desktop. What i &quot;think&quot; went wrong was during the installation of SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2000 SP3a in the Authentication Mode section. Since this machine had to go live in few days time, didnt spend time tinkering with the problem. <br />
