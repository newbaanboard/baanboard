<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">27th January 2004, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Last week I had to stop and start BaaN to clear a table lock and now I have a problem with some of my print queues.  When I try to repeat the request, I get a message because the status states &quot;Removed&quot;.  I noted the delete delay was set to zero so I modified the user and the delete delay has been set to 168.  This has not corrected the problem.<br />
<br />
The user that is at issue is the user that drives my nightly jobs and the report in question is the result of a session in the job.  These set ups are not new and up till last Friday morning, following a rc.stop and rc.start, the status in the device queue was done and I was able to repeat the request.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks in advance. - Joy</div></div><hr />

I think another factor is the temp. files created in your <br />
{BSE}\temp folder, if those are removed then also you can't run through Device Queue.<br />

Often, rc.stop or rc.start has something like rm $BSE/tmp/* <br />
<br />
It sounds like that's the case here..<br />

It may do that... but a lot of people actually have it wipe out the whole $BSE/tmp directory. <br />

So you may want to check this as well.</div></div><hr />
