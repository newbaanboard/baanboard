<br />
we're experiencing issues with the Baan client.  for some unknown reason, users are getting dicsconnected from time to time.<br />
No error message in the logs.<br />
We're using the B40c.102 client and we're starting to think it might be a problem related to all the updates done on windows 10 that might be the cause of that.<br />
<br />
Anybody else had the same type of issue?<br />
is there a new version of the client?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
PB</div></div><hr />

Not sure if something more current or not.  Any network blips have always caused us to get dropped.  We used to have multiple sites running out of a regional data center.  We always have had some network drops - I can't say for sure we ever had any windows issues related to the client - at least none I can recall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th February 2023, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Those remind me of the errors we got when we had network issues.  I can't say they are the same, but that is what it reminds me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">21st March 2023, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Somewhat late response but it may give some more insight in what is happening... as you will know the bw client is talking to the bshell process where the actual actions (running sessions) is done. The bshell &quot;talks&quot; to the BW client every once in a while and requires response. When this response is inadequate or not present at all, the connection with the client is terminated with that error.<br />
<br />
There are settings you can use when starting the bshell process, that influence this call-response mechanism.<br />
-set DS_MAX_WAIT=value the timeout duration [seconds] in which BW has to respond to the sync message, and override the default of 30 seconds<br />
-set DS_TIMEOUT_DETECT=value the timeout duration [minutes] before the bshell starts sending a sync message to BW<br />
<br />
And - but you did not mention your settings - there is also a setting that terminates the idle BW instances:<br />
-set SESSION_TIMEOUT=value the number of minutes the bshell can be inactive before it terminates itself, when the timeout is triggered a message is sent to the UI and the bshells stops<br />
<br />
In case you are curious of this Client-Server communication, there is this option in the client:<br />
Right Click the BW icon in the systray, opt for Debugging/Tracing. Choose Output to Console and set the other options<br />
- Show Events<br />
- Show Messages<br />
- Show Socket Notifications</div></div><hr />
