Thanks for the reply. After the online cache initialization is done, i get these errors(attached with this post) while opening any of the sessions of Baan. I have BCK installed on this version of Baan and i need to know if thats causing this error. If not then what is? I have followed the instructions in the Webtop installation document properly but i am stuck with this error. Almost driving me nutz..<br />

I can install Webtop8.4 if I use standard installation with Tomcat 4 and everything works fine. Deploying Webtop on Tomcat 5 doesn't work in my case. I can't connect to ERP LN using webtop (error is wrong password) and can't connect to Webtop administration page (same error).</div></div><hr />

I ran that particular session. After opening Maintain Sessions, i could see that some of the sessions of a particular package has the &quot;Webtop Enabled&quot; field checked. However when you open with Webtop it gives out the same error as i reported. Could you tell me how can i know otherwise if thise ttconwebtop has executed properly?<br />
 <br />
Jclju,<br />
I tried both the versions. Although i dont get the wrong password error and the installation is carried out smoothly without any blip. The big blip happens when you run the session..<br />

I read the pre-requisites and supported versions of Baan with their Service Packs in the Webtop documentation. All the above were met. I am not sure about the standard program you are talking about. We are on porting set 6.1c.7.10 and SP19 with all the solutions(downloaded using multi-download) mentioned in the Webtop documentation. So what am i missing out?<br />
 <br />
As far as Infor support is concerned, its been like a week since i got a reply from them. That again was to explain about their FIFO system. Lodged the case on 23rd Sept, got an initial response on the 24th which was inadequate(asked us to download solutions that we already had) and even went on to close the case. We re-opened the case and then on our inquiry about the status of the case, they went on to explain their FIFO system and how we were not up the pecking order. If going by what they said, then i rather close my shop and wait till &quot;their highnessess&quot; get time to solve my case..<br />
