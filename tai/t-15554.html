<br />
&quot;error in start bdbpost.exe&quot;.<br />

Any idea, how to resolve this problem?<br />

Is it restoring some tables, but not all? My first guess would be to make sure that on form 1 you are pointing to the correct directory with the file names you want to restore.  Did you create these files with ttaad4226m000?  Did you use a separator?  Also on the import you may want to turn of referential integrity checking.<br />

<br />
Sorry to come again after long time with the same problem.<br />
<br />
yes I have created the dump by using the session ttaad4226m000, and it was created successfully. Now running the session ttaad4227m000 to create table from sequential dump. I have also used the session tccom0214m000 to change the company number (from source to target as 400&gt;902).<br />
<br />
yes I used the seperator &quot;|&quot;.  and also turned off the referential integrity check.<br />
<br />
Now the situation is that it gives the error as <br />
<br />
&quot;Cant read table definition (error 513)&quot; <br />
<br />
for all tables and can not creating and table, I am not restoring but want to create new tables in demo company 902. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Example in my environment our Customized package combination table definitions are different than my Standard PC. So that I can't bring by Customized table data into Standard companies.....<br />
<br />
One more thing..did you check the logs?</div></div><hr />

Actually the situation is that; sequential dump is created from a seperate server with company number 400 (test company), and I tried to create table from that sequential dump in another system with company number 902 (demo company). Yes, the package combination of two companies on two server must be different. so what I could do to resolve this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Did you try the &quot;Delete Existing table&quot; option?<br />
Please let me know.</div></div><hr />
