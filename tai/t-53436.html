<br />
Baan ERPLN Installed on a server with Windows Server 2003  has a local IP 192.168.1.250  in the LAN. The PCs in the LAN access the Internet through a server which has 2 Network Cards   First IP : &quot;Real IP&quot;  Second IP : Local IP 192.168.1.1<br />
<br />
The problem how can reach to the Baan Server with IP 192.168.1.250   and open the Webtop login page through the internet  and through the Real IP<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Many Thanks for your reply, I want to tell you that the Baan Webtop open correctly from any PC in the LAN , But the Problem : How to access it form the internet through  other PC which has  Real IP and  Local IP  on two Network cards? <br />
<br />
If you found a address syntax can be transfer the Internet client from the Real IP to the LAN (Local) IP of the PC which Baan Webtop installed on it.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
is your Server having Public IP(ISP IP) ??<br />
If yes , then it is as simple as connecting from LAN . <br />
<br />
If no,Contact your network admin to give your server access via SSL or citrix or any other means.<br />
<br />

<br />
The address forwarding  a good idea in case of the Baan Webtop Server has a Public Real IP <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Any G.</div><div class="date">9th June 2009, 07:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everybody. I'm facing the same problem while publishing webtop through the Internet. I already have installed it on a Windows server and it's running great locally. This is a web server actually so it has the local and public IP also.. there is no problem with any port, I perfectly reach the database application, etc etc<br />
<br />
Now I'm designing the web page so user reach a welcome page before the login/password, and then there's a link to this ..servlet/login.. the problem is where is the link supposed to be pointing, since this is java tech?<br />
<br />
I really need your help for this, so any comments? Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">24th April 2012, 00:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand - i am replaying to an Old Post - Just in case , if Some One faces similar issue ?<br />
<br />
Problem Def : Server have 2 NIC  - One Connected to LAN other one to Public IP.<br />
Where LAN Connectivity Works Good , Public IP Fails.<br />
<br />
Solution : Remove DNS in LAN Private IP as well as Public Static IP .<br />
<br />
Note : Ensure - your ISP Does not block any ports ex: by Default Port 25 is Blocked by all ISP.<br />
