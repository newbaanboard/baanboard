I haven't had the time to test it, but there is a package for linux called gnokii.<br />
With this software you should be able to send and receive SMS on a nokia cellphone connected to a linux machine.<br />
Setting up a logic to put files from the Baan system there to initiate sending should be easy.<br />
On the other hand there may be providers who offer this service to you - but I haven't bothered to collect information about this way - if there will be a project that requieres SMS to be sent, I would for sure prefer the first solution.<br />

<br />
I have been using a Linux based open source package called smssend for some years now and in combination with a stable SMS provider, it works like a charm. The homepage of the creator has been unavailable for a while but you can download the required sources also from this page: http://systembash.com/content/smssend-zabbix-clickatell/<br />
<br />
Personally I use the UK based provider SMS-Gold (http://www.sms-gold.com) as SMS gateway. I have found them to be very reliable.<br />
<br />
Note that the most recent smssend package does not ship the sms-gold provider file anymore. If you are interested I can post it here. However, it does require you to use smssend v3.4 instead of the latest v3.5. The latter one keeps throwing errors back at me when using the SMS-Gold service. So I stick with version 3.4.</div></div><hr />
