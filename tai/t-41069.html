<br />
I'am getting this strange error in my LN SP1 environment. In session tdsls4100m000(sales order), if I click to add a new order, it open up tdsls4100m900 session. Now, as soon as this session opens, I get a bw error &quot;no permission to run tdsls4101m000 (sales order lines)&quot; and it won't allow me to add any lines to this new header. I have tried with normal and super user as well and I keep getting this error. <br />
<br />
This error is coming only if I try adding new sales order. If i go into tdsls4100m900 for an existing order, I'am able to go to lines session.<br />
<br />
Error log shows a problem with the records in ttadv999, so I did a CRDD for entire Pkg Comb. and all sessions, but still the error is coming. Is there any way as to figure out what record is causing this problem. I have also tried copying the ttadv999 from our prod server (Test and Prod are replicas and error is coming only in test server), but this also didn't help.<br />
<br />
Any suggessions??<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

2. Go to correct package combination and put Key Runtime Data as &quot;progtdsls4100m000&quot;<br />
3. You should get the records for above session.<br />
4. Delete these records....they are multiple records.<br />
5. Then, run create run time DD for this session.<br />
6. Now, try to run the session...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jatin_sanghi</div><div class="date">30th August 2007, 08:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sukesh/Kaukul,<br />
<br />
I tried deleting resocds for these sessions from my current Pkg Comb. and then did a CRDD, it didn't help. I have also checked for the objects for session tdsls4100m000, 4100m900 and 4101m000 and they all are lying in Update Standard VRC and nothing looks to be a problem with them.<br />
<br />
There is one thing, I did notice y'day that if on entering sales order session tdsls4100m000, I open an existing order and then close it. After that if I try to create a new sales order, it doesn't come up with any errors.<br />
<br />
Looks opening an existing order, sets some variable for this session and thus error doesn't come up after that. This remains OK, till I log out of LN. When I log back into LN, and try creating a sales order directly, it again pops up with the error and I have to open an existing order to let me create a new order.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on that??<br />
<br />
I havn't tried reorganise tables so far as I need to take client permissions for that, but try to et that done for tdsls400 and tdsls401.<br />
<br />
