<br />
In Form2 of session tuxch0121m000(Maintain Table Relations(Import)), I set &quot;Add Record&quot;, &quot;Overwrite&quot;, &quot;Update Record&quot; to NO, and set &quot;Delete Record&quot; to Yes, then create the Condition to return &quot;True&quot;. But I can't delete a record when I import the ascii file. <br />
<br />
In the help file, it said that the record I want to delete should starting with a 'd', I don't know how to set the record to starting with a 'd'<br />
<br />
In the help file of &quot;Condition to delete&quot;, it said that there are preconditions of conditions, first is the &quot;type of action&quot; should be &quot;delete&quot;, I don't know where and how to set the type of action.<br />
<br />
So, if you have any idea, please help me, thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seem to recall that it only works in &quot;regular&quot; imports, which I personally have never used.<br />
<br />
Here is a thread that mentions a workaround though.<br />

You need to edit your import file and add a lowercase 'd' (the letter only, no quotes) in the first position of each record, followed by whatever field separator you have chosen.</div></div><hr />
