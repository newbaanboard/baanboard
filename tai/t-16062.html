<br />
As the session help does not explain what type of processing against tables would be improved, if you have experience with table boosters, I would like feedback for the following questions.<br />
<br />
If large number of deletes are being performed against a table, is it a good candidate for being &quot;Boosted&quot;?<br />
<br />
If a large number of references are being checked against a table, but the table is only read, would it be a candidate. The reference checking is not always against the same key.<br />
<br />
Finally, I presume yes to the following.<br />
Repeated read references to a table using the same key would benefit from the table being listed for boosting. True of false?<br />
<br />
Did I miss any condition where the table would be placed into the booster category?<br />
<br />
Your feedback would be most appreciated. (We have no source so we also do not know fully which tables are used by a session). (Ex. session tdpur4223m000)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Table boosters mostly just load the table into the bshell's (or driver... don't remember) memory area, this means that if you are doing a lot of reads from a table (such as reference lookups) then you may see some benefit from the table booster. <br />
Deletes, inserts and updates will be unaffected.<br />
<br />
Additionally, this was really meant to help tbase/bisam.. If you're using a real database you might not see any improvement..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">22nd July 2004, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">As Dave described, table boosters tell the bshell to cache table contents. Even though this sounds like a good idea to improve performance, here comes the catch:<br />
<br />
This caching is done within the single bshell. So if a second bshell updates data, than the first bshell will not see the changes. Obviously this can only be good for data, which hardly changes, like lookup tables.<br />
<br />
My personell recommendation is: Only if you are absolutely sure, that nobody will change the &quot;boosted&quot; tables, use it. Otherwise forget about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also like Dave said: A &quot;proper&quot; database will do it's own caching and this works, as the database knows it's own updates.<br />
<br />
By the way, if I am not mistaken, there is a slightly better mechnism for this in BaanERP. Here caching is done on application/server level. This way, it will work, as long as you have excactly one application server. But I am not an expert on BaanERP, so do not ask me for details here.<br />

<br />
The Application Performance Guide that Baan put out with Baan ERP Documentation disk will give good guidence for table boosters.<br />
<br />
Also look at the bic_info command.  It will list the tables, external functions etc. of objects that can be used for zooming, overlays, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">2nd August 2004, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Especially when using a &quot;real&quot; database, table boosters help to improve performance. Remember Tbase/bisam/bbase is much faster compared to e.g. Oracle and Level 1 has caching. As a fast lookup in a small cache is much faster than going over several processes it gains. <br />
<br />
Table boosters especially gain for batch sessions. Don't expect dramatic gains, but 10% is a possible gain.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
