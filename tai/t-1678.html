<br />
I've been able to capture the job status using the qptool6.1 tool.  This is great for determining is a job is in a &quot;free&quot; status and ready to be executed, but it doesn't tell me if my call to execute the job was successful.  $BSE/bin/rc.startjob &lt;jobname&gt;<br />
<br />
I'm trying to capture return codes from the rc.startjob script, but more importantly from the &quot;ba6.1 ttaad5203m000&quot; command within it.  I want to know if my call to execute the job was successful or not.  It states in the rc.startjob script that a variable, BSH_JOBOK, will get updated with the characters &quot;OK&quot; if the job was successful, I can't seem to get this to work.  I'm not sure if this is what I should even be using.  <br />
<br />
Any thought?</div></div><hr />

This file really doesn't provide me with a status or return code necessary to tell if the call to execute the BaaN job was successful or not.  Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />

If you find the return code in BSH_JOBOK unreliable then I would recommendend checking the job status by executing a SQL query directly on your database from within a shell script or similar. The job history tables (ttaad510-ttaad512) would be the best candidates for this.<br />
<br />
In the end the solution may look clumsy but reliable. Unfortunately by default Baan does not provide any good job monitoring/reporting tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kimmda1</div><div class="date">16th April 2002, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">you could customize an rc.start script to call a particular job daemon, bsp will still be the user but the process will be identified by the daemon name. This will make the tracking of the process via command line much easier. This way you can quickly isolate your process and verify that it is getting time from the cpu's and proper priority for the process. If you have a job with multiple sessions, the session that is currently running will not show up in baan job history, that is one way to determine the  current active session of the job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Cron runs a batch file (example below)<br />
<br />
BSE=/baan/bse<br />
BSE_TMP=$BSE/tmp<br />
#BAMODE=1<br />
#DS_SERVER=ba<br />
PATH=$BSE/bin:$PATH:.<br />
export PATH<br />
#export BAMODE DS_SERVER<br />
export BSE BSE_TMP<br />
TERM=vt100<br />
export TERM<br />
BAAN_EXTJOB=1<br />
export BAAN_EXTJOB<br />
$BSE/etc/rc.startjob EDICOM /baan/bse/log/log.edicom<br />
<br />
I must admit I'm not sure what some of the lines mean. Perhaps somebody could enlighten me?<br />
<br />
2. A log the gets written with the following:-<br />
<br />
bpid:27466<br />
sess:tcedi7205m000<br />
sesn:1<br />
info:EDI Communication - 501<br />
comp:501<br />
stim:20020417080500<br />
usti:20020417070500<br />

ueti:20020417070500<br />
ssta:OK<br />
jsta:OK</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the input.  I was able to get the logging to work using the BAAN_EXTJOB variable.  I export the variable in the profile of the user(s) I need the log information from.  Now, if I could just get BaaN to write to the log as soon as I execute the rc.startjob command I would be all set.  (there's a couple second lag time depending on system load; nothing I can't work around)</div></div><hr />
