       I'm a new guy to baan administration and I've read most of the thread regarding taking baan bacpup and restoration.<br />
<br />
I'm working on Baan IV C4, database Oracle 8I and OS is WIN2k.<br />
<br />
Can some body advice me step by step backup methodology for above mention setup [Kindly mention sessions to be used]so that we can do safe restoration in case of any disaster.<br />
<br />
<br />
Till now I'm taking All live companies backup [ttaad4226m000]and copying the Baan Folder from server.<br />
<br />
Database and Application is residing on same server.<br />
<br />
After reading most of the threads in this regards i reach to a conclusion that whtever I'm doing is not sufficient .<br />
<br />
Kindly educate me to avoid any kind of data loss.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

1. Bring the database down<br />
2. Backup your server (everything)<br />
3. Bring the database up again<br />
<br />
I assume that you have storied your installation software (Oracle) in a save place? In case you need to restore it on another server you need to install that software first. (registry, or is your backup software taking care of that?)<br />
How about Oracle patches, do you apply them?<br />
You can get Baan up and running on another server by just copy the BSE folder and install the portingset.<br />
Please check the procedures how to get a new license.<br />
<br />
Maybe others can respond in case I forgot something.<br />

I feel for baan application u should copy baan folder with 000 comp seq dump<br />
thenit works for application only.<br />
for database u should take the whole databackup at database level itself.<br />
