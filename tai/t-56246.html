<br />
I'm using the newest installation wizard (Version 13.5.9). I just can't manage to get the installation done, because that wizard hangs up after some steps. It seems to be completely random when that happens. It can be at any time, at any panel of the wizard: Sometimes it hangs directly after asking the credentials, sometimes during ftp check, during installation of the initial environment, sometimes during upload of the installable unit. Sometimes I even manage to get an installable unit installed. If it hangs, it greys out, and in the task manager I see two programs labled &quot;installation wizard&quot; running instead of one.<br />
<br />
Could that be something like an ftp timeout? The connection to the remote server is still alive, when the wizard hangs. Has anyone experienced similar problems?<br />
