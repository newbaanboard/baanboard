  Is it a good practice to run the Re-organize Tables {ttaad4225m000} periodically? If so, whats the ideal time period to run it? Monthly? Quarterly? <br />
<br />
In the end, does it help in avoiding data corruption?<br />

Its a session in Baan, you know, in tools&gt;database management&gt;bla bla bla... I am sure you must have figured out by now as to where it is..<br />
<br />
So is it a good practice to run it periodically to avoid data corruption and to speed up the accessing of data...<br />

<br />
speeding up data access will only be achieved with this session if you use bisam. To speed up other databases use their optimization techniques.<br />
As this session may run extremly long, I guess that most of us do use it only when something indeed is wrong with the data.<br />
Referential integrity should exist, as references are declared in the DD and the database driver of Baan shouldn't allow any operations violating it (try to erase a record in tcmcs001 with ttaad4100 :-).<br />
Of course this is theory and in real live you will likely have errors in your reference counters, but I haven't met any situation yet where this led to errors.<br />
A completely different situation occurs, when you use bdbpost and explicetly turn off referential checks - then you should use the session to avoid problems.<br />
<br />
These are my 2 cent - we are not running ttaad4225m000 on a regular basis.<br />

  Thanks a lot for the reply. Speeding up the data access would have been welcomed however not expected when running the re-organizing. What i am really looking for is to know if it would help in rectifying small errors before it would get bigger and cause the whole thing to crash. Is it better to have this(re-organize) as a periodical check or rather run dbcc checkdb on the baan database at SQL level?<br />

from one &quot;guru&quot; to another :-) (congratulations btw)<br />
I don't know!<br />
I would guess that the reference counter logic is done on the Baan side and that a database tool could state &quot;no errors&quot; after a consistency check although there are some errs.<br />
As I always say: &quot;If it doesn't help - it won't harm&quot; ..... so doing both shouldn't harm, if you have (run)time to spare.<br />
From oracle I know that there is something like search optimization based on the history of the sql-statements run against the database - if you have something similar with M$sql, this should be improve performance.<br />

I see that i have crossed a milestone on this board..Not bad!! If only Pat could convert those into air miles, it would make it all the more to look forward to. Not that i would get any far with 300 miles..<br />
<br />
Anyway..So to conclude, i could safely consider that if i have the luxury of server offline time then i could have this run on a periodical basis..otherwise just hope and pray hard that it doesnt crash during my employment period...<br />

Within the last 9 years we've build up a 1.3 TB database (and did upgrades to 8.1.7.4. 10.3. is in planning by our database guru). We've never run reconfigure on a periodical base and didn't run into problems. <br />
But I'm sure we would get problems if we would try to do it :D.<br />
Our biggest problem is to avoid reconfigure if we change i.e. tfgld410 or tdsls051 (ok, not really a problem with level 2 and oracle if you know what you are doing).<br />
I don't think that it is necessary.<br />

So that puts the score for Re-organize tables Yes:0, No:2<br />

Interesting...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">30th May 2007, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">The Session help gives you the info:<br />
<br />
Reorganize Tables (ttaad4225m000)<br />
Use this session to rebuild data and indices and/or to check and rebuild the referential integrity.<br />
Rebuild data and indices<br />
Rebuilding data and indices is useful for tables on which many delete actions are done. To use this option, you must select the Data and Indices check box. The data will be temporarily stored in a sequential dump file. Subsequently the data and indices will be rebuilt.<br />
Check and rebuild the referential integrity<br />
A table field may have a reference to another table. For example, the &quot;Invoice-from Business Partner&quot; (ifbp) field in the Material Costs (tpppc211) table refers to the Business Partners (tccom100) table. If you try to delete a business partner, the system checks whether the business partner is used in other tables. This is done by checking the reference counter for that business partner. If the reference counter is zero, the record is not used anymore and can be deleted. In this session, you can repair these reference counters, check referential integrity and nullify undefined references. Refer to the field help for details.<br />
You must repair the reference counters, for example, after running the Create Table from Sequential Dump (ttaad4227m000) session with the Ignore Referential Integrity Constraints check box selected. The import process sets the reference counters of all imported records to 0. This is a wrong situation, because now you can delete records, even if they are used in other tables. To repair the counters, you must run the current session with the Repair Reference Counter check box selected.<br />
Executables<br />
Internally the session uses the following executables:<br />
bdbreconfig6.2 (-Z option): to rebuild data and indices<br />
refint6.2: to check and rebuild the referential integrity<br />
For more information on these executables, refer to the SSAÂ® Enterprise Server 7 Technical Manual (U8172B US).</div></div><hr />

So would you run it periodically? Or just use it like those correction sessions whenever problems occur?<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">31st May 2007, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Sukesh,<br />
<br />
No, we do not run it periodically. If you create new tables with references to existing one or change an existing table's fields' to have references to other tables, the reference counters are automatically [re-]generated when you execute runtimes (ttadv5210m000 or ttadv5215m000). <br />
<br />
You have to execute ttaad4225m000, only when you execute import/export sequential dumps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">1st June 2007, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">My 2 cents:<br />
- from a functional perspective it is not needed if you only use Baan and never corrupt tables by other programs or by a bad portingset.<br />
- Only for some tables a reorg can be useful but this could have to do with a bad database management or after archive a large amount of data. In these cases I propose to use database tools instead as these are faster in most cases.<br />
<br />
The bad database management could lead to an excessive database fragmentation. A huge archive could lead to a lot of empty space in the database and memory.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

  Thanks for the reply. Suffered yet another crash few days back, due to raid controller, and was busy bringing it back on. <br />
<br />
Just to be on the safer side, since we use AFS to insert data from in-house vb applications, should we do a re-organize on the tables involved? or Does baan takes care of these data like it does with the ones that are inserted from a normal baan session? <br />
<br />
sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaukul</div><div class="date">2nd June 2007, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
There is no need to run re-organize for such tables. AFS takes care of the referential integrity in its scripts, while inserting. It will throw you an error while inserting, if references do not exist.<br />
<br />
If you are carrying out lot of deletes on a table, you can reorganize that table (just to free up the extents occupied by the table).<br />
<br />
References are to be rebuilt only after running &quot;Create table from sequential dump&quot; i.e. bdbpost6.* (that too....only if references are present in data dictionary of that table)<br />
<br />
Best,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">agoes.s</div><div class="date">13th June 2007, 08:45</div></div><div class="posttext">HI, we usually run re-organize table after we restore the database from the dump. and it usually takes a very long time.<br />
<br />
I don't think you need to run that session, if you didn't restore the DB.<br />
<br />
For the speed up the data, i think you can tuning the db. and use a powefull server :) <br />
I think doing it will not avoid data corruption. CMIIW. Do backup daily :)<br />

<br />
Periodically rebuilding the database can actually help a lot to prevent costly hardware upgrades.  When upgrading database versions, rather migrate to the new version than upgrade, since this will give you a completely refreshed database, and all deleted content is usable free space again, and indexes are rebuilt, making them faster as well.  If you rebuild the statistics after the migration, that will increase the performance even more... At 75% of my customers where the database is bigger than 1TB, we were able to postpone hardware upgrades by up to two years using this approach.<br />
<br />
The only problem might be the necessary downtime for a migration, but for this there are solutions (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=24736) available! ;)</div></div><hr />
