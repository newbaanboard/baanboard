The client m/c are on windows. The user wants to view drwings on a different m/c. In the EDM parameters unless the directory is c:\temp\ and the image is physically avbl in the drawing the drawing is not getting opened in Revisions session.<br />
<br />
If I give the directory as c:\xyz\ and keep the image there still the drawing is not getting opened and I am getting error message that \temp\image.jpg  is not avbl.<br />
<br />
Can't I specify any directory for this to work?<br />

When the user clicks on the drawing button, script copies the drawing file from server to directory \temp on the client machine and starts drawing viewer or editor. After drawing program exits, the drawing file on the client machine will not be deleted. This is the case with BW client. Also install the latest patch (solution 79582).</div></div><hr />

This is working fine for any images (Type jpg gif etc) and if I view through Internet explorer. But If I use Word as the display drawing program it is not showing the documents in proper formats. It is showing in a junk format. Any solutions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isimeon</div><div class="date">5th July 2002, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Word cannot open picture directly. You can write your own template with macro to insert picture in a new document. <br />
<br />
E.g. .....\winword.exe /t&lt;templatename&gt; /m&lt;macroname&gt; /pict&lt;picture file&gt;<br />
<br />
(/pict is unknown switch for Word and it does nothing with it. Your macro have to analize command line switch and insert &lt;picture file&gt;)<br />
<br />
But why do you want to use Word? If the drawings are in any popular graphics format, Microsoft Photo Editor (part of Microsoft Office) can open it. Also there exists many third party products (freeware or shareware).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Customize EDM parameters and tiedm0015 function source.<br />
2. Write a small program to get drawing file extension, read registry to get open command for this extension and open it. Install this program on every client machine and put it in EDM parameters</div></div><hr />
