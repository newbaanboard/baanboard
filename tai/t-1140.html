<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">22nd February 2002, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Our servers are located in North America (Baan IVc4, Oracle DB, HP-UX 11.x OS), but we have a European office using Baan as well (connected to the NA server).  North America uses &quot;letter&quot; sized paper (8 1/2 X 11) and Europe uses A4 sized paper.<br />
<br />
When printing out a report in Europe, the report header or report values appear lower/higher than the page break (due to the printer and report being sized for &quot;letter&quot; sized paper).  <br />
<br />
I have setup A4 in the paper types and assigned them to the Europe printer devices.  I have also adjusted the Fonts by Paper Type to compensate for the paper size difference.  Now the reports fit on the paper, but the following messages constantly appear whenever a printout is made:<br />
<br />
&quot;Report does not fit on paper&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure you want to print?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait until device paper type has changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
The report DOES fit on the paper.  It shouldn't ask these questions.  My question is, how do I get rid of these questions?  Is it in Baan or is it in the Unix Printer driver/queue?<br />
<br />
Incidentally, even if you say &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;wait until device paper type has changed&quot;, it still prints the report.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">22nd February 2002, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">This problem has to do with the paper size, or better the number of characters that can be printed on one line.<br />
<br />
Check how many characters your report wants to print on with line, check the number of characters for A4 with different font and correct accordingly.<br />
<br />
Normally it should be 80 for 10CPI, 94 for 12CPI and 132 for the small size in A4.<br />
In landscape it's more, 132, 162 and 194.<br />
<br />
However if you use windows printers then its slightly different and I know that there is a solution for the reports which tries to print up to 215 characters but I have to look that up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the help.  What about printing from the BW for Portrait?<br />
<br />
I have the landscape setup done.<br />
<br />
Small  215   48<br />
Med    132   48<br />
Large  94    48<br />
<br />
I checked Baan support and I found a solution (that has the paper sizes, but it doesn't work).<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what they use for A4 Paper Portrait, Fonts by Paper type?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">7th March 2002, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">A4 - height 66 char, for all fonts.<br />
<br />
 Paper width (char):<br />
<br />
 Small        - 132<br />
 Middle      -  94<br />
 Large       -  80</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">7th March 2002, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick reply.  Those are the settings that I used for Portrait.  I printed Terms of Payment to portrait and it cuts off the right edge (it should be a portrait report).  The part that is missing is the page number, so I am guessing that it is only a couple of characters.<br />
<br />
I printed a PO and it was fine.  I guess it is a problem with the Print Terms of Payment report?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">7th March 2002, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to check the report, how many characters does it want to print on one line? If that's more than 80 and you use the 10CPI font for portrait you will for sure lose some characters.<br />
<br />
Your font should allow you to print 80 characters with 10CPI.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">7th March 2002, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool.  Thanks for the help and sorry about all the dumb questions.  I saw that it is printing (defaulting) as Large font.   I moved it to Medium and it fit.<br />
<br />
I have a quesiton into our developer as to where this come from.  Baan should size it correctly so that it fits.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">7th March 2002, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The size of the report is defined in the report header. As far as I know that size is checked with the paper and the number of characters in the font.<br />

<br />
Our reports are A4, and at the moment I need to test the basic *portrait* reports. I created a device an figured out *62* lines. Is that a typical value for US-Letter in portrait?<br />
<br />
What are the correct settings for US-Letter in landscape?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />
