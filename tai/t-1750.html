<br />
We use BIVc4 version. <br />
After creating new company from dump file, most of the session  -only in the new company - give error message:<br />
<br />
&quot;Fatal Error Unknown program domain 'tcmcs.s999m' &quot;<br />
<br />
and can not be opened.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
A.</div></div><hr />

The fix was with solution 112647, and a creation of runtime for domains and tables, including reconfigure was needed (no users). Confirm this one with Baan support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the info.<br />
Unfortunately it didn't help.<br />
<br />
First of all, I've not found 150185 within the installed solutions...<br />
I've also read and followed instructions to the solution 112647<br />
- run &quot;Create Runtime Data Dictionary&quot;(ttadv5210m000), but there is no change. <br />
<br />
The problem still exists.<br />
<br />
So this is probably not the case.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
A.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ar-cik</div><div class="date">22nd April 2002, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Victor,<br />
<br />
Yes, I imported software dump for add on solution (Baan Dimensions) to update runtime DD with the whole procedure (new pack. combination, vrc,...).<br />
<br />
Than I create new comapny from dump supplied. <br />
<br />
All activities were done based on the Baan's Instalation Guide.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the problem, you just updated your package combination with sessions/tables that use that domain.<br />
[I don't know Baan Dimensions], my bet is that if you go to Baan Support they will mention that you need to install 150185 and 112647 to install the missed domain. Now you only have these options:<br />
<br />
- Or you install those solution to update your system and afterwards all will be fine and your current PC will also be OK.<br />
<br />
- Or you cannot use the current PC because it is using a missing domain.<br />
<br />
- Or copy the domain to this PC, but I don't know what else may depend on other stuff.<br />
<br />
I would go for the first one, because sooner or later you will have to update it, but this depends on your degree of customizations, your current patch level, etc. It's up to your real needs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
After we have imported this domain in our environments and created a DD everything were fine:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you send me please a detailed way how to import this domain ? <br />
Do we have to use PMC tools (this causes error message) or there is other way to import this domain ?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
to import this dump you have to use session ttiiex1285m000 'Import Data Dictionary'. Afterwards you have to run a convert and create Runtime Data Dictionary (but just for module tc and for domains)<br />
<br />
