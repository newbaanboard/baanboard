<br />
I think I have a problem with the ttstpconv converter.<br />
<br />
Actually we print as a pdf-document and then we print this document normally on a Xerox printer. Everything ist fine here and the text fits perfectly.<br />
<br />
When we print directly through BAAN we have the problem that the text is not fitting correctly and it seems that ttstpconv is resizing the complete document to another format. (also we have a non-fitting size of 2cm on the left side, which is missing on the right side and the text is not the &quot;normal&quot; size of the pdf document described on the first step)<br />
<br />
Do someone have a solution for this?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much! :)</div></div><hr />

i am not sure about the PDF , but for printing from baan to printer , there is a driver that set the font size and type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Vamsi said, check in the preview what Paper Type are you selecting and also the Margins. Make sure user has not stored any user defaults for any other report in ttstpsplopen. <br />
<br />
Also, check what are the fonts defined against the selected paper type and the size of the fonts in Fonts by Paper Type session.<br />
<br />
Printing in PDF and printing directly to the printer are 2 different things and needs to be handled likewise. PDF device converts the baan report into PDF and then while printing you can do your own print setups and get proper printouts.</div></div><hr />
