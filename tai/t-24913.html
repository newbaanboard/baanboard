<br />
I just installed sp12.<br />
When I tried to install the translation solution, I had aproblem relating to b-language support and the installation was aborted. <br />
<br />
Because of the new tables created by sol 123464 (b-language) support, restarting the aborted pmc process gives an 606 error. <br />
<br />
I need to revert the installation process just for the translation solution. I already changed the status of the solution to &quot;available&quot; in ttpmc201, ttpmc203, and also deleted the &quot;to install&quot; and &quot;installing&quot; records from ttpmc260. <br />
<br />
The problem is that now, when I try to scan a solution, I get: <br />
<br />
&quot;There is an aborted installation process that needs to be restarted first&quot; <br />
<br />
What am I missing in order to revert the installation?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

<br />
Check your application locks though, and check for more &quot;installing&quot; records in the pmc table (maybe other update VRCs?)<br />

In the other tables I just changed the status. There must be another table I need to change, but which one?<br />
<br />
No application locks present, by the way. That was my first guess.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I was just able to solve the problem.<br />
One of the tables ( ttpmc203 ) had 2 records for that solution. I changed only the first one to &quot;available&quot; and assumed it was the only one for that solution.<br />
<br />
When I changed the other (which was also &quot;installing&quot;) to &quot;available&quot; the problem became solved. I rescaned the solution and reinstalled it. <br />
<br />
PMC works ok now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your prompt assistance<br />
