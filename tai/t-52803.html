<br />
I have the following problem:<br />
I am working on a UNIX to Windows migration and after the initial installation and transfer of Tools environment the following errors occur<br />
In any Baan IV session whenever a date is inserted or updated we get an error 205 form the system telling hte value is out of range.<br />
The Windows Event log says the following<br />

Is there anybody out here that knows why a wrong date is sent to the database.<br />
An other point is that when I enter a record via ttaad4100 in a table this DOES work and no errors occur.<br />
<br />
Any advise is appreciated</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">20th June 2008, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, it obviously has to do how null dates are represented in your old system.<br />
<br />
Baan in general does not store any null values for any datatype, but has for each datatype a valid value defined, which is interpreted as null. So in old times, the value for a null date was -2 to the power of 32, I think.<br />
<br />
Later Baan chanegd this to another value, because this was not compatible to ODBC drivers.<br />
<br />
Here must be the root cause of your problem, even though I am confused, since bdbpre/bdbpost should cover this. So here some questions:<br />
<br />
On which DB platform is your old system?<br />
What method do you use for transfering the data?<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
It was Tbase on UNIX DEC Alpha<br />
I have used bdbpre and bdbpost for the datatransfer.<br />
There is no other way<br />
<br />
Thanks Alexander</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
We are using portingset 6.1c.07.13 otherwise you cannot install Baan IV on SQL Server 2005.<br />
<br />
Thanks Alexander</div></div><hr />

Hi all,<br />
<br />
Yesterday I have solved the problem, the tabledef6.1 file did not contain the MSQL_LEVEL1=0 parameter and that caused the problems. Thanks to all for your help <br />

Alexander</div></div><hr />
