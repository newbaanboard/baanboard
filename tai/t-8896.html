And to test sales, you could create a purchase item (with no integration in finance), entering stock by purchases and by a stock correction.<br />
Also you could make warehousing transactions without other modules.<br />
Testing production and finances separately also is easy.<br />
But the majority of the problems that you could find out in a new version can be related with integration processes.</div></div><hr />
