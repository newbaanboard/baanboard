This would be through a normal Baan client.  Is there any way of doing this?<br />

<br />
if you copy the package combination to another one, then assign one company to the origin pc, the other one to the copied pc, you can divide your users into 2 groups, allowing them access to only the company that fits to their package combination.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand then you can't have users who are allowed to switch between the 2 companies AND you would have to take care that every change of software is done in both pc. <br />
If only the latter was a problem, then instead of copying the pc one would derive 2 package combinations from the current one.<br />
<br />
P.S.: I remember that with certain portingsets the bshell would recognize if  no changes had been applied to a pc and still grant access to a company assigned to another (identical) package combination. If this should be the case, some dummy change has to be applied to one pc (for instance by creating a new table).<br />
