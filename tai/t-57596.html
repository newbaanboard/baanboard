<br />
I installed Baan IV c4 on a server with SLES 11.<br />
I would like to connect to Baan through the Baan login daemon, but I get the message &quot;user or password not correct&quot;. The connection through rexec works fine.<br />
I started the blogind6.1 on the default port 7150 and can connect to this port through telnet.<br />
If I start the blogind6.1 in debug mode, I get this message:<br />
<br />
Daemon: Incoming connection, spawn child.<br />
 Child: handle BaanLogin request.<br />
 Child: received:  user bsp, action 1<br />
                  IBCmd /baan4/bse/bin/ipc_boot, bseVersion 6.1<br />
 Child: logon for bsp failed.<br />
blogind6.1: Login failed for user bsp<br />
Daemon: revert to listen-mode.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(blogin6.1 -h should give you the help for the setting, i think you can do -d -d -d for 3 levels of debugging.)<br />
<br />
Are you doing anything out of the ordinary with your authentication? like  using PAM to connect to active directory or kerberos or anything?<br />
<br />
Also, blogin may need to be setuid root to work (not sure on that.. been a while since i set it up)<br />

To solve your issue using REXEC, you must disable the reverse resolution of that protocol.<br />
<br />
IÂ´m on RedHat and I solve doing this:<br />
Go to the file: /etc/xinet.d/rexec and add the server_args=-D flag to the end.<br />
<br />
By exmple:<br />
{<br />
disable = no<br />
socket_type = stream<br />
wait = no<br />
user = root<br />
log_on_success += USERID<br />
log_on_failure += USERID<br />
server = /usr/sbin/in.rexecd<br />
server_args = -D<br />
}<br />
<br />
Stop and start the REXEC service.<br />
<br />
The line server_arg =  - D, disables the reverse resolution. By the way, with this option you can avoid to put all ip client's address on file hosts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you'd need to add more -d's to get better debug output if you care to get blogind running.<br />
<br />
Have you run the setperm in $BSE/bin? i'm not sure if blogin needs to be setuid root or not to be able to access the password file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lebowski</div><div class="date">14th January 2010, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello guys,<br />
<br />
I appreciate your help very much !<br />
<br />
@mig28mx:<br />
<br />
I added the server_args argument so now it looks like this:<br />
{<br />
        socket_type     = stream<br />
        protocol        = tcp<br />
        wait            = no<br />
        user            = root<br />
        group           = root<br />
        server          = /usr/sbin/tcpd<br />
        server_args     = /usr/sbin/in.rexecd<br />
        flags           = NAMEINARGS<br />
        log_on_success  += USERID<br />
        log_on_failure  += USERID<br />
        server_args     = -D<br />
}<br />
<br />
Then I restarted xinetd (&quot;service xinetd restart&quot;), but the situation didnt change. I guess it has something to do with PAM since there is another file named &quot;rexec&quot; under /etc/pam.d and if I rename it, xinetd starts but no rexec connections are possible.<br />
<br />
@dave:<br />
Adding more -d's doesnt give more information  (blogind6.1 -d -d -d -d has the same output like blogind6.1 -d).<br />
I executed binperm6.1 after the installation of the portingset. I guess the permissions of the binary are allright. If I start blogind6.1 with another user than root it says &quot;You have to be root to run this program&quot;. So I started it as root.<br />
<br />
I will google a bbit more to get this reverse lookup disabled and will let you know if I succeed.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

Did you notice that you have server_args parameter duplicated?<br />
And the server line it not pointing to  /usr/sbin/in.rexecd?<br />
<br />
As a suggestion, try to approach the more to the configuration file that I sent.<br />
You can comment some lines and restart the service.<br />
<br />
As a comment, when I migrate to RHES, my installation have the same symptoms that you mentioned, and one thing is sure, it is rexec reverse resolution related.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem doesnt exist anymore. I didnt get rexec running satisfyingly, but after a portingset update the baan login daemon works now.<br />
I doubt that it has to do with the portingset itself, but with some permissions in $BSE/lib or wherever.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support &amp; have a nice weekend.<br />

<br />
we do have exactly the same problem here. OS SLES-10 SP1, BaaN C4.<br />
<br />
The -D option for REXEC doesn't solve the problem. RED HAT seems to compile the TCP stack in a different way than SUSE (Novell) does. So no changes at all.<br />
<br />
We 're also stuck since we moved from True64 to SLES-10.<br />
<br />
Where are the experts? ;-)<br />

<br />
are you able to start the baan login daemon ? It's only a workaround and not a solution for he rexec-problem. But it solved my problem.<br />
As root: blogind6.1 and then change the connection method in your GUI from rexec to BanLogin.<br />

We are also facing similar issue wehein users that are migrated to LDAP are not able to login in baan with baanlogind6.2 but same login works fine for rexec..<br />

I searched posts regarding this but not sure what the solution is..<br />

If I start blogind with -d, I get this output:<br />
<br />
Daemon: Incoming connection, spawn child.<br />

IBCmd /baan4/bse/bin/ipc_boot, bseVersion 6.1<br />

Hi everybody,<br />
<br />
I'm coming late and I don't know if my message will be helpful but I'm struggeling for many years with rexec and the 30 seconds I had to wait before my gui starts. I did also use blogin as a &quot;workaround&quot; but I was faced to the &quot;password expire only with blogin&quot; (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=39502&amp;highlight=password+expire) issue. Now, I found the working solution to make rexec working without having to wait for more than 2 seconds :)<br />
<br />
Simply replace USERID by HOST in /etc/xinetd.d/rexec file as shown below :<br />
<br />
{<br />
socket_type = stream<br />
protocol = tcp<br />
wait = no<br />
user = root<br />
group = root<br />
server = /usr/sbin/tcpd<br />
server_args = /usr/sbin/in.rexecd<br />
flags = NAMEINARGS<br />
log_on_success += HOST<br />
log_on_failure += HOST<br />
}<br />
<br />
You can forget the &quot;-D&quot; option which won't do anything more on SLES servers.<br />
<br />
You will have the same output in log files (/var/log/message and /var/log/xinetd.log) and you won't have to wait that long to run the gui.<br />
<br />
This is working with BaaN IVc4 sp19 with portingset 6.1c.07.09 on SLES 9 Ent. SP3.<br />
<br />
I hope this will help some of you.<br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />
