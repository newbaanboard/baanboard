We have built an integration with an external application (made in .net) and everything is working ok except the fact that is not printing through the device we need.<br />
We have LN FP3.<br />
We have installed the device in the server but when we execute the WS, the systems is &quot;hanged&quot;; no response got and finally a time out is retrieved.<br />
<br />
If we put a device (ASCIF), it prints correctly to a file.<br />
But we need to print through a printer (is the Shipment note).<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea of what is happening?<br />
Maybe the BW Print is not supported through the WS and only ASCIF devices are supported?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">29th September 2010, 08:59</div></div><div class="posttext">BW print is only working if you have a UI (either Worktop/BW or Webtop). The connector for webservices makes a connection to LN without a UI and no client is involved. So, the solution is to use a direct printer.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot for your answer.<br />
I don't know how to set up a Direct printer in Windows Server.<br />
I've look for information but I have found something to setup in Unix.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

Finally we have been able to print through the Web Service via a Windows Server Printer, installing on the server the Infor E Reporting Server, using the setup instructions that the Help provides.<br />
Anyway, we already have a problem:<br />
- The printer is a HP Laserjet P 4010 with 3 Trays.<br />
- The Shipment Note that we send to the printer has been setup, in order to be printed,  depending on some parameters through one tray or another one.<br />
<br />
But it seems, that the Windows Server Printer is not taking into account the Printer setup and preferences of the device queue and always sends the report through the first tray.<br />
<br />
Some ideas about what is happening ?<br />
Have someone had the same (or similar) problem with the trays and the Windows Server Printer? <br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
