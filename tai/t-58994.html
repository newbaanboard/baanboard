<br />
We need to buy a new server for baanIV.<br />
<br />
We decided on two servers connected  to a SAN<br />
<br />
Baan should be located on the SAN storage and users access the system through one server <br />
The other server is backup if something happens to the first.<br />
<br />
Attached is one of the offers  we are considering with the SAN storage it is IBM. The other system is DELL with the same setup.<br />
<br />
Two servers, 1 switch connected to one SAN.<br />
<br />
Please tell me if we can install baan on the SAN and access it through the server. Or if we have to change our setup to be suitable with Baan IV.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please find the attached</div></div><hr />

1. Hardware config depends on sizing (which depends on user , modules used ,user makeup , other applications u run etc) . Though the configs look ok , it's good to get it checked by some expereinced person .<br />
<br />
2. Since having 2 servers with SAN  ,  would recommend u do clustering failover , which ensure good business continuity and insulates u from failures of hardware with more redundancy and little downtime. <br />
<br />
3. In windows (even in *nix also) environs , u can some sort of loose load balancing , by actually running db server on 1 and app server on another and which actually fails over to another in case of 1 hardware failure .<br />
<br />
4. Such failover clustering requires , that systems be in same LAN and hardware u get meets the vendors hardware compatiblity lists and 2  servers  are identical without exception.</div></div><hr />
