<br />
I find that many times the value in GTM shows as zero but when the same is viewed at database level it shows some other value.<br />
<br />
eg.<br />
<br />
field t_stoc in tdinv001 is showing as 0 in ttaad4500<br />
while when I see the same by running a query on the database directly it shows the value     7.10542736e-15.<br />
<br />
Because of this many times when we are printing reports where we want to ignore zero value records it still prints the report.<br />
<br />
It must also be affecting the transacions. <br />
<br />
What is the cuase and how to solve it ?</div></div><hr />

Please post a reply when you solve this issue. I faced the same issue with tdinv001 table but not with others.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">14th September 2009, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">that's the result of float arithmetic.<br />
<br />
when working with float data types sometimes you get values that are not-representable on a computer, so the resulting rounding leaves those types of values in the database.<br />
<br />
Baan will generally be unaffected because it will round<br />
0.0000000007 to 0.<br />
<br />
but it can mess up any external access.<br />
<br />
The only way to solve it is to not use the float datatype, many databases now have datatypes like numeric(X,Y) where x and y are precisions. that handle decimal values well w/o using floating point operations.<br />
<br />
But to switch to that would be a major overhaul for baan that would probably take years of work. so i wouldn't expect a &quot;fix&quot; for it soon.<br />
<br />
Now, that being said, i believe that baan has released a few fix sessions that basically take any value of nearly &quot;0&quot; in the database and update it to zero.<br />
or you can just do it at the database level<br />
update table set field = 0 where field &lt; 0.001 ;<br />
