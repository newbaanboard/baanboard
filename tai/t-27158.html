Current configuration :<br />
<br />
O/S 	: 	HP Unix<br />
BaaN	:	BaaN V c4<br />
Sp Tool	:	sp 10<br />
Sp App.	:	sp 10<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a package combination with the name B50cdevl ( Development ), I have 2 customized vrc in this package combination, refer to the attached doc file for the Package combination tree.<br />
<br />
Problem is that if I do any development for component present in VRC (B50C c f1 ), when I do the check-out and bring it in its SCM vrc, I have to check-in Object to see the applied changes, where as if I do any development in the bottom most vrc B50C c f2, and do a checkout , I dont need to check-in the components.<br />
<br />
So my doubt is , is it a normal behaviour of BaaN, or is it because I am on very low Tools SP ?? because issue is if I do changes in components present in B50C c f1 vrc via login X, login X cannot see the changes untill check-in is not done.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

This is normal behavior. I don't think your VRC structure in the document is correct. Normally it is not possible to derive another VRC from an SCM VRC and according to the picture, your f2 VRC is derived from the SCM VRC of f1!<br />
So, I assume that the SCM VRC of f1 is not in the runtime path (you can check the fd file for that).</div></div><hr />

Yes, you are right , my bottom most is not derived from SCM vrc, just to show the exact tree structure i had incorporated that as to where my SCM is kept.<br />
<br />
f2 is derived from f1 only, but are you sure its a normal behaviour of baan because then in that case baan expects that we should check in the components back to f1 vrc to see the changes :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">It is normal behavior. Baan cannot 'look around the corner'. So, you will only see the components, which are directly in the VRC tree. <br />
What you want to achieve is very risky. If you compile f2 components, you may include components from f1, which are not checked in yet.<br />
I recommend you to create an additional package combination on f1 level. With that package combination you can test the f1 changes when the components are still checked out.</div></div><hr />

Well creating a new package comb. binded to f1 vrc could solve problem to some extent, but not fully.<br />
<br />
Assume, I am developing a Maintain session whose Form is kept in f1 vrc but program script is kept in f2 vrc, so in order to see the script change affect i have to again take a new connection which is binded to different package combination. So i cannot see in totallality both the vrc changes via single package combination, where as if SCM was not implemented I would have been able to see.<br />

In that case your f1 environment will never be consistent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well reason is we have developed a Insurance related product on BaaN, so we have used f1 vrc where all the components are kept, but when we go and implement this inusrance related solution at Cleint side, at times it doesnt fit the client requirement, then in that case we do client specific customization in f2 vrc.<br />
<br />
This is the reason , that our product is kept in f1 vrc and customer specific changes are kept in f2 vrc, which is quiet normal in any industry, if we want to focus on product development.<br />
