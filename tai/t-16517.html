<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">10th September 2004, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">(This is Baan 5c) I have a job that contains a query.  When the job tried to run queued, I get a session message saying that the report is not present.  When I activate the job within my bshell, it appears to run correctly and find the report.  I have already checked to make sure that the PVRC on the user associated with the job matches that of the report (per another post).  Any other ideas on how to track this down?</div></div><hr />

The fix was to blank out the &quot;Owner&quot; field of the report so that everyone could use it.. could that be the case here? I'm not that familiar Easy SQL in Baan 5.<br />

Any other thoughts???</div></div><hr />

<br />
The default range could be a problem if it is not able to run for the desired range.<br />
<br />
Another trial could be to build the query as the &quot;job&quot; user and try running it<br />
both manually ( logged in as job user) and in job.<br />
<br />
if it is the problem with the report object itself, may be a compile might help????</div></div><hr />
