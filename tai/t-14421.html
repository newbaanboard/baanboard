<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cancoon2000</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 04:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I need some one input on how to move data from Oracle 7.3.4 under Win NT to Oracle 9i under IBM/Aix.  I know that Baan tools has the capability to export using Create seq. dump from table, and to import using Create table from seq. dump.  Baan application is running baanIVc3 under windows 2k<br />
<br />
Is that the only way or there are faster ways?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done several migrations from Unix to Windows or from Windows to Windows machines.<br />
<br />
As the creation of the sequential dumps is very time consuming, I have created some little shell/batch scripts to export and import the database table by table.<br />
<br />
The export can be done like this:<br />
<br />
c:\baan\bin\bdbpre -E d:\temp\tccom001.err -N tccom001 -C 020 &gt; d:\export\tccom001<br />
<br />
In the error file the number of records can be found.<br />
<br />
The import is done like this:<br />
<br />
c:\baan\bin\bdbpost -nmfk -pB4CcCH -E tccom001.err -O tccom001.log -I d:\export\tccom001 -C020<br />
<br />
From the error and log file you can see the starttime of the import as well as the number of records which are imported. <br />
<br />
It is recommendable to splitt the export and import by module.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ralf</div></div><hr />

you can do an oracle- export/import as well,<br />
if you come from 7.3.4 to 9.2.0.4,<br />
its faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cancoon2000</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Rochus for your feedback. If I got it correct, you mean we create a full Oracle export form Win NT and import that to Aix using Oracle tools which is included in both packages (Oracle 7.4.3 and Oracle 9i). If that is correct, the output file format should be compatible or will require some manual updates ?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rochus</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">you should export schema baandb/baan<br />
no full export.<br />
than you can user features of oracle9i,<br />
(space managemant, undo managment) ...<br />
be careful with NLS_LANG (for binary tables).<br />
<br />
than there's are no manual actions after that.<br />
<br />
please read also the thread &quot;poor performance<br />
with ora9i under AIX&quot;, for settings in the<br />
db_resource-file</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you export the whole Oracle database from Windows2000 server onto a UNIX environment, you are very likely to run into all sorts of problems with company 000.  Amongst other things, issues with pathnames being different from one environment to the other.<br />
<br />
You have to exclude company000 tables if you want to use Oracle tools for import/export</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rochus</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">i see only problem with binary tables<br />
(form, menu, report layouts).<br />
therefore set enviroment variables (NLS_LANG,...)<br />
<br />
which paths do you mean ?<br />
<br />
i meant: <br />
no full export/import, only baandb-schema,<br />
create schema, (role), tablespaces under 9i before.<br />
so i see no problem for company 000.</div></div><hr />

Finally we agreed that the DBA will handle the migration not me as a BaaN developper.<br />
<br />
Thanks again and I'll forward your comments to the DBA.</div></div><hr />
