<br />
As per requirement, want to access the sever from remote with VSAT connectivity with a low Bandwidth. Can we install FAT cliend on Windows XP machines at remote location in order to achieve a good speed. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately you are on completely the wrong track here. If you look at a typical 3-tier architecture, then you will find a pretty low traffic between the UI-tier and the application layer and a very high amount of traffic between the application- and database layer.<br />
<br />
This holds true for Baan also. So if you install on your client a fat client, then you will create a very high bandwidth between your client and the database. Baan recommends at least 100Mbit for this. Compared to this, you should be able to run 2-4 GUIs (depending whom you ask) via a 64kbit ISDN line.<br />
<br />
You can improve user experience even more, by using a terminal server and server becoming a bit less sensitive for network latency problems.<br />
