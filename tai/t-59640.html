<br />
I need opinions.<br />
<br />
My patches/solutions installation is out of date.<br />
<br />
Tools: build 2267 (21/5/2007)<br />
Application: (not sure, but latest than Tools patches)<br />
Porting set: 8.4a<br />
<br />
Last time I faced problem during patches un-installation.<br />
According to Infor365 support, that was because I didn't update my Tools patches (which is older than Apps patches). <br />
<br />
LN rules on patches: Tools patches should be same or latest than Apps patches.<br />
<br />
To make my Tools patches updated, I need to upgrade the Porting set from 8.4a to 8.4b first.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know the possible impact after the Porting set upgrade? <br />
<br />
I need to know this because we cannot have server downtime after the upgrading process. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your comments.<br />

Normally it has no consequences, I can't remember a case that I had to rollback a upgraded portingset.<br />

<br />
Try it on the test server first, the risk of rollback of a porting set is pretty low, unless you haven't read the manual and having some conflict with the OS/database.<br />
