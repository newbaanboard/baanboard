You have not supplied your environment and location details. My answer applies to baaniv4c4 on unix platform.<br />
<br />
licmon[6.1] -w   gives list of connected users (across the network if multiple baan instances and one licence server)<br />
<br />
from unix prompt    &quot;ps -ef|grep bshell|grep -v grep&quot;  gives list of active logons to baan to a particular machine.  If you only have one baan system running on the machine and you can identify the user by PC name then you can get your list (I use this method to kill users if necessary / requested)<br />

Process Explorer<br />
Copyright Â© 1996-2004 Mark Russinovich <br />

  <br />
Process Explorer is an advanced process management utility that picks up where Task Manager leaves off. It will show you detailed information about a process including its icon, command-line, full image path, memory statistics, user account, security attributes, and more. When you zoom in on a particular process you can list the DLLs it has loaded or the operating system resource handles it has open. A search capability enables you to track down a process that has a resource opened, such as a file, directory or Registry key, or to view the list of processes that have a DLL loaded.<br />
<br />
The Process Explorer display consists of two sub-windows. The top always shows a list of the currently active processes, including the names of their owning accounts, whereas the information displayed in the bottom window, which you can close, depends on the mode that Process Explorer is in: if it is in handle mode you will see the handles that the process selected in the top window has opened; if Process Explorer is in DLL mode you will see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded. <br />
<br />
Process Explorer also has a powerful search capability that will quickly show you which processes have particular handles opened or DLLs loaded. The unique capabilities of Process Explorer make it useful for tracking down DLL-version problems or handle leaks, and provide insight into the way Windows and applications work. <br />
<br />
You can obtain equivalent command-line tools, Handle and ListDLLs, at the Sysinternals Web site.<br />
<br />
Process Explorer does not require administrative privileges to run and works on Windows 9x/Me, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Server 2003. The 64-bit version of Process Explorer runs on the x86-64 version of 64-bit Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.<br />

Translation of the above (do not post in other languages besides English here, there is a specific post for Spanish and this thread starter is not a spanish user):<br />
goto $BSE (example C:\baan50c)<br />
goto \bin<br />
shows users connected by running: licmon -w</div></div><hr />
