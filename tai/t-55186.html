Hello,<br />
<br />
on UNIX you can modify your printerdriver in $BSE/lib/printinf/..... or<br />
built a new driver assigned to the BaaN printer.<br />
<br />
Define fonts like .<br />
<br />
<br />
pfont1=\E(s0p20h0s0b4102T,<br />
pfont2=\E(s0p16.67h0s0b4102T,<br />
pfont3=\E(s0p15h0s0b4102T,<br />
pfont4=\E(s0p14h0s0b4102T,<br />

<br />
If you print to a Windows Printer and do a Preview, a user can customize User Specific Settings such as Fonts and Font Spacing by right-clicking in the bwprint window.<br />
<br />
In the future, whenever the user prints that report, it will use the customized bwprint settings.<br />
