<br />
Has any body ever split a table into multiple parts to improve performance ? How is it done and whether it is effective.<br />
<br />
The Integration table has crossed 50,000,000 records, there are other such tables. <br />
<br />
Checking whether we can avoid archiving ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thnx<br />

We have considered Oracle Partitioning and discussed but have not implemented it yet. More info @ Partitioning in Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/bi/db/11g/pdf/partitioning-11g-whitepaper.pdf)<br />

Do you really need to save all those records? if not its better to purge them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Were you using it the normal way and have later splitted the tables ? and has this improved the performance ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nicholas</div><div class="date">26th September 2008, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes we were the &quot;normal way&quot;, as in the tfgld106 table was only residing in a single dbspace.  What happens with Round robin, is it writes record number 1 in the 1st dbspace, record number 2 in the 2nd dbspace and 3 record in the 3rd dbspace and so forth.<br />
<br />
We try to keep a single dbspace &amp; associated chunks on a single LUN, to assist with tracking where our performance hits are.  We were originally 100% on IO.  After we split this we dropped down to 33% on IO.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How did u measure the IO activity for a specific table ? Could u tell me the command ?<br />
<br />
I have the following queries :<br />
1) how many records do you have in tfgld106. <br />
2) Is it your largest table. <br />
3) How many extents do you have for each of the three dbspace for tfgld106<br />
4) For howmany tables have u done that ?</div></div><hr />
