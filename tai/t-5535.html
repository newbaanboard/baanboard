<br />
A user is running a report from Baan to the Excel device. One of the columns is showing quantities. e.g. 2.0000<br />
<br />
When using the Excel Import text to columns wizard you can see the values within the wizard are displayed correctly but when you press 'Finish' and the data gets converted in to Excel all quantities are multiplied by 10 e.g. 2.0000 becomes 20.0000. <br />
<br />
I've checked both the Baan and Microsoft KB's but cannot find anything. Has anybody else had this problem?<br />
<br />
The same report works fine on other users PC's<br />
<br />
If you send the report to MS Word the values are displayed correctly. I'm sure that this is an Excel issue but what I don't know. <br />
<br />
Excel version = 97 SR-2<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Excel version = 97 SR-2<br />
<br />
Looks like a problem of the Excel itself, not Baan.<br />
Compare the settings the user has, it may be that a '.' is beeing converted to ',' and things like that, so this changes the values. If they all use the same version of Excel, check the excel/user settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">19th June 2002, 01:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this depends on how its defined in Windows these separators.<br />
<br />
You define them in Control Panel, Regional Configuration.<br />
<br />
But when you import a text file into Excel you can over-ride these values. In the step three yoy have a buttom that reads Advanced...<br />
<br />
Here you can set Thousand and decimal separator specific for this import file, not depending on PC configuration.<br />
<br />
P.D.<br />
<br />
You can only set this if your import is not fixed length but delimited.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />
