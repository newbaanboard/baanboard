<br />
Authorisations with tools are not that easy. Could be that the user has another role which allows him/her to see it. <br />
<br />
Roles work like this (correct me if I am wrong): assigned in parallel you get the most open authorisation, assigned in a stacked way (sub-roles) you get the most strict authorisation.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps,</div></div><hr />

(the field is invisible in the session for the user)<br />
<br />
Just for the field &quot;Lot&quot;. As this field is a variable field (not link directly to a table field), i cannot guess what exact field to set for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe session form field variables need to me handled in the session script itself. I guess LN could be different, but I have not see that discussed any where.<br />
<br />
And searching did not reveal anything.</div></div><hr />

Only if u have source code.</div></div><hr />
