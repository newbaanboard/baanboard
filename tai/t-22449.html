to first company and another 10 to second company.<br />
So I want Baan should  allow ony 10 users to any  company.If any body logs after 10 users I need a message saying that &quot;Already 10 users are logged message&quot;.<br />
Both the above companies are linked to same package combination.<br />

In this case it should be pretty easy to build a script that not only checks that a user is logged in once BUT also check for the users already logged in, thru their ufiles, how many nr. of users are logged in per company and thus restict access based on the count per company.<br />
<br />
Oops, just noticed that you are on windows 2000, not so easy to have scripts... you probably have to resort to a 2rd party software or develop a session to be run each time a user logs in that does those checks - not easily done.</div></div><hr />
