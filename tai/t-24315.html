<br />
The bank file that creates the hard copy is in BAI code.<br />
According BankOne Global Treasury Services, there is one company out there <br />
who's using the BAI file in conjunction with Baan.<br />
<br />
Anyone has idea about this BAI file and how to upload to Baan? :confused:</div></div><hr />

I think they are also using it to load peoples expenses now.<br />
you will need to understand the format of the bai file so you can map the fields to baan. there is a document available from Baan on how to create the exchage scheme for journel entries</div></div><hr />
