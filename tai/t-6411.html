<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th August 2002, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the situation: We have a test/development box and a production box.  They attempted to copy our production company data to our development company data.  What I was told was that company 000 became corrupt. So they copied company 000 from production to development. Needless to say we lost all of our development vrc data. The only good news is that the program scripts are still there. BUT without the tables even those are useless.  <br />
<br />
Is there a way to take forms or the tables dictionary and import these back into company 000? I can see all the files out on the UNIX box but, not in our test company. Any possible way to reload them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">26th August 2002, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, I don't think so. There is no way you can recreate application data from runtime data. Best thing to do is get a backup tape and start restoring. You do have a backup right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th August 2002, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">No backup. We just found this out today. I work in Louisville,Ky. and our servers are managed in Minneapolis.  Our Oracle and Application Admins. sit up their.  I was really hoping I could import the forms/tables - if they ever fix my logon. If what you said is true, then I am going to lose just about everything on a couple of big projects I was working on, not including somethings I developed only for the test VRC. :(<br />
<br />
I do not think the admins want to talk to me at this point.<br />

I feel for you right now. No backup = BAD, IRRESPONSIBLE. Time for management to kick some ass I would say. Have you ever exported your work as dumps that you could re-import? Maybe even very old ones. But old is still better than nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th August 2002, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  This is not the first time that the lack of backups has burned us.  The first was in production. We were doing some Baan error correction programs, the backup was suppose to happen Thursday night. It failed and they went on with the error correction schedule. Needless to say the programs updated incorrectly and we needed to restore and couldn't.  Sorry for venting, but needless to say I am very mad. <br />
<br />
I better stop or take it offline before I say what I am really thinking. :)<br />

I have my toes, fingers, eyes, legs, and anything else I can think of crossed. :)<br />
<br />
As it is when and if the company comes up I am going to develop my own backup for the app. group.<br />

<br />
Thats hard to imagine, we have a daily backup of our dev and qa environments.<br />
<br />
Additionally, we also have a DR(disaster recovery in the East USA) and a hotback before we go any big code migrations etc on our Production box.<br />
<br />
I wonder what kind of setup/strategy do your BaaN/Oracle Admins have.<br />

Instead of relying on them from now on I will take care of it myself. Well at least when I can get back into the company and work.<br />

At least these posts can be used as a warning for other companies.  <br />

Maybe you can sell video rights to whatever else you crossed to one of those less-reputable websites. (You did back up the mini-cam, didn't you?) One always hopes that after 3-4 decades of professional developemt, IT would stand for something other than a Stephan King novel. <br />
<br />
Oh well, the brews are flowing for you at the local pub.<br />

Feel sorry for you. However it must be possible to create the tables again by analyzing the dict files isn't it? Ok, it a lot of work but at least you have something and don't have to invent all again. It must be even possible to create a small script for importing the table definitions again.<br />
<br />
Something else, at one of my customer site we always have to export our developments as soon as they are going into production. That must be something you can organize yourself without depending on your admins.<br />
<br />
Wish you a lot of succes,<br />

So today has got to be better. Maybe they will even give me back my developers permissions. :)<br />
