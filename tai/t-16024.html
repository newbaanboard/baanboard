       I am very new to Baan Platform.I hope my questions are very silly to u<br />
but these answers are helpful to me.<br />
Pls correct if am wrong.<br />
<br />
1) Every VRC have its own objects and source code right??(BSE/application)<br />
<br />
2) And also Every VRC has its own DataDictionary?(BSE/dict)<br />
<br />
I hope the above both statments are correct.<br />
<br />
My doubt is Does Every VRC has its own DB tables??<br />
If not why Baan is maintaining BSE/dict seperately for every VRC??<br />
<br />
And suppose in VRC1  in table1 having 5 fields,and in VRC2(is derived from VRC1) can I add or delete some fields??<br />
If so How baan manages??<br />
<br />
rgds,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">19th July 2004, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">As you are new to baan, I remember my first confusion about that ... But after a while you will find it quite simple.<br />
<br />
So here are my results:<br />
1.a) Every PVRC has its own objects - YES.<br />
<br />
1.b) Every PVRC has its own source code - YES and NO. For regular scripts (session scripts, report scripts, library sources) I would say yes. But for #includes the derivation will automatically find the correct file to be included (so that it is not necessary to copy the whole structure).<br />
<br />
2. Eyery PVRC has its own DD -- NO. Every PACKAGE COMBINATION has its own DD. For each packages (tc, td, ti) it is possible to have different PVRCs; you only have to decide which of them are used in a specific packagees combination. (But that is more for admins than for developpers.)<br />
<br />
3. Database tables are used according to the package combination (and or DD).<br />
<br />
Here is an example: You have a new package xx and module yyy; you have a test vrc (b40c/c4/test) and a live vrc (b40c/c4/live); and you have two package combinations &quot;B4Cc4tes&quot; (that uses xx from vrc b40c/c4/test) and &quot;B4Cc4liv&quot; (that uses xx from vrc b40c/c4/live). <br />
Finally, you have a table xxyyy001 that has fields aaaa and bbbb. In your test vrc you can now add a field cccc, (and convert to runtime) and test it. After all works as expected, you can export/import the dd for table xxyyy001 from your test vrc to your live vrc.<br />
<br />
Remember: It's easier than it sounds!<br />

we are using SQLServer with baan4.<br />
for a areas table in baan tcmcs045(company 400).for the same in SQL Server ttcmcs045400. <br />
<br />
Does one company can be linked to more than one package combination?<br />
If it so give me the answer for the 1st Question.<br />
<br />
1) assume that we have 3 package combinations exist in the system.<br />
Can we find  3 tables of ttcmcs045400. So what are those table names How can we find?<br />
<br />
or else Every package combination is linked to one separate company,so those three tables are like ttcmcs045(XXX),ttcmcs045(YYY),ttcmcs045(ZZZ)?<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">19th July 2004, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">You have some companies; in ttaad100m000 &quot;Maintain Companies&quot; you see their package combination, and so you can find out their PVRC.<br />
<br />
You normally have tables per company. So a table tcmcs045400 (maybe with an additional t, but that is only the database point of view outside of baan) is the table tcmcs045 from comany 400.<br />

In a PC (package combination) can be more than one company: 0,1,2,3...<br />
