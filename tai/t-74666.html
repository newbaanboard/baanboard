I never to - I either clear a specific cookie or look for a specific site to delete cache for.  I just hate losing my cache which I get used to - like baan board.</div></div><hr />

Hello, you have some options and can use one of them;<br />
close also the explorer(Google Chrome, Firefox)<br />
clear the cache<br />
start an incognito window and login there<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

maybe you've stored user and password in your browser.<br />
<br />
Try to use an other browser to access LN.<br />

As simple as logging off.<br />
(click on your name top right - select &quot;Sign out&quot;)<br />
<br />
I recognize what you are telling here: most users &quot;log off&quot; by closing the browser and this will eventually (depending on the settings responsible for this) kill the bshell and InforOS session, but very late by default settings.<br />
<br />
For instance I leave workplace and come back next morning, the ION sessions tend to work but when I want to get data from OneView it tells me to refresh my browser. And without logging in I just refresh and apparently I can access the data.</div></div><hr />
