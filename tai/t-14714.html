I`m facing a Baanc4 installation.<br />
the customer is currently running baanIVb2 and now I try to get the data from b2 and bring it to c4.<br />
I created a table dump but I can not import the data in c4 because of different table definition. <br />
error log &quot;dump don't match the table&quot; of course.<br />
Has anyone a good idea?<br />
best regards <br />

Further there is a Baan document which gives u step by step information on this upgrade . According to me this document is applicable  only when u do an upgrade and not fresh installation .</div></div><hr />

Create a packet combination upon the one used in c4. Create a company that uses that packet combination. Import the table definition of b2 into that packet combination/company. Import the table. Move the company to the c4 packet combination.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icke</div><div class="date">8th March 2004, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hitesh you are right, it is actually meant for an upgrade but it is helpfully for a new installation too.<br />
And now I got it.<br />
first I copied the old b2 PC in the new created c4 PC, but it deos not work, because baan did not recognise the new(old) table structure.<br />
So I copied the table to my test VRC added a fireld and run the Data dictionary and finally I deleted the Table again from the test VRC and the new(old) structure was in.<br />
The Point is, one have to force Baan to read the Standard Data dictionary again, or something like that..<br />
The way ,Han describes, is the global way.<br />
Thank you for your help<br />
regards icke</div></div><hr />

Correct me if wrong. That document has certain conversion and correction programs too. That can help u in making the data consistent.</div></div><hr />
