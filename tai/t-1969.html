<br />
       - We have B40c4 / SQL7 / NT    <br />
<br />
       - Application and Database all on one server<br />
<br />
<br />
Situation:<br />
=======<br />
Currently the data volume is very high.<br />
<br />
Now we are planning to add a new group company that will work on the same server.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
========<br />
<br />
1) How do i have the NEW COY TABLES in another data base in <br />
    the same server <br />
    OR data base in another server<br />
<br />
2) By keeping the another data base OR in another server will it <br />
    result in improved performance?<br />
<br />
Any leads, ideas, cautions....<br />
<br />
<br />
Highly appreciate your help, best wishes<br />

<br />
- You want to add just another company or you want to add another instance/new database?<br />
- If you want to add just a new company, do you really need another instance or can you just create a new tablespace for it?<br />
<br />
- Having Baan running on one server and the database in another will improve the CPU usage, and if integrated into a cluster, provides some sort of high availability (you can switch packages), but will put an higher increase in the network bandwith.<br />
<br />
- An increase in memory and/or increase of CPU's would not be better than having a second server?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">9th May 2002, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are asking about having the Baan group company in one instance and the remaining companies in a second instance, there are a number of issues you may encounter.<br />
<br />
You have added a second single point of failure which may decrease overall reliability.<br />
<br />
If one database fails and the second stays up, since there will be two database drivers (one for each instance), the transaction rollback will occur for one side of a transaction but not the second since Baan does not implement a two-phase commit. On top of the normal Baan issues of frequent commits, delayed locking, etc. this will introduce more complexity into your environment.<br />
<br />
If you need to offload the CPU and are constrained, then add a DB server and put everything into the one instance but segregate the IO for the group company into a tablespace on different disks.  <br />
<br />
Running three-tier will cause some performance reduction, so if you have headroom in the existing server, expand that server and go on from there.<br />

<br />
&quot;Jroberts&quot;   thanks for ur doc. I am learning.<br />
<br />
thanks Vic &amp; James,<br />
<br />
I think I will add to the scenario as follows.<br />
<br />
1) Common network, LAN / WAN  NOT dedicated for BaaN<br />
<br />
2) We have 5 yrs of data 60GB, performance can not go any slower;  we plan to hv one yr operational data under operational coy, but not wanting to remove the history but move it under a different archive coy. So I wanted this archive coy data in a different database.<br />
<br />
3) We are adding a new live group coy with similar volume expected which I wanted a seperate database to handle.<br />
<br />
If I can have these three data sectors(two group coy, one archive coy) in three different databases in one server or two servers .....?   Is it possible ...How? <br />
<br />
So that the performance is better (atleast I hope) Obviously a query on 5yrs data Vs. one yr data; maintenance backup takes less time on operational data; <br />
<br />
tks for some lights<br />

<br />
A 60 GB database is not that large in the Baan space.  If you are having severe general performance problems it may be related to the sizing of the servers, number of users or a problem with  the DBMS maintenance procedures.<br />
<br />
How many users do you have?<br />
<br />
What kind of box are your running on (CPUs, memory, model, etc.)?<br />
<br />
This will help us help you...<br />
