a bug. Otherwise it could be a corrupt index on the table (if you are<br />
DB2 level 1) or it could be corrupt data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">18th March 2005, 09:04</div></div><div class="posttext">A long time ago, you would get this error in Baan IV with Oracle, when the character set configuration of your database did not fit to the locale setting of a user and the key field did start with special characters like german &quot;Umlaute&quot;.<br />
<br />
What was happening is the following: Baan would query the database in the sense of &quot;get next row&quot;. Then the database would return a row according to the sorting of the characterset in the database, but the key of the returned row was in the ordering of the Baan locale before the allready given row. Then the error would be thrown by Baan.<br />
<br />
To solve this make sure locale of Baan and DB are the same or use ISO_BIN as the locale in Baan.<br />
<br />
Maybe you have a similar problem now in DB2,<br />
