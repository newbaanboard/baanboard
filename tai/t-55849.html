First, you need to enable Email capability from Baan - You can do that by looking at B2Email solutions from NAZDAQ - or the many good solutions that are posted in this site - both add-ons and home grown solutions.<br />
<br />
When E-mail is enabled, you can Fax also since most modren fax servers receive email requests. Depending on your country, there are companies that turn emails to SMS messages as well</div></div><hr />

<br />
try to figure out how to send an SMS from any other application (Word, notepad, whatever).<br />
To extract data from Baan (via report or writing to a file) is a piece of cake.<br />
I would prefer to use a linux server as sms gateway, but there should be solutions for M$ too.<br />
Perhaps you can find a third party (provider) to do the actual sending for you, but to be able to communicate with him, you should try to send emails from Baan.<br />
There are lots of hints how to achieve that on the board.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />
Alternative Solution - you can use http://www.freesms.net/freesms.aspx<br />
<br />
1.make a Baan Job to generate a single line report to flat file (not more than 40 char)<br />
2.Make a Windos macro to copy the text in flat file.<br />
3.Using Windows macro - Open IE with above said URL and send the message.<br />
<br />
Windows macro can be scheduled..!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is your SMS server capable of working from command prompt ??<br />
<br />
if yes , then try the following <br />
<br />
1.Create a Report data (what you need to sms) make it short and meaning ful (40 char)<br />
2.make a baan job and run report to a flat file.<br />
3.write a batch file to take the flat file data and send it thru your sms server.<br />
<br />
Note : you can use windows scheduler to schedule batch file.<br />
<br />
all the best.</div></div><hr />
