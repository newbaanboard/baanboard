PMC Parameters settings are OK.<br />
PMC Directories created.<br />

I could not scan SP3 because of error in ttpmc2200m000 Scan Solution:<br />
<br />
&quot; PMC parameter &quot;Path Individual solution dumps&quot; is not a directory. &quot;<br />
<br />
I know of slash/backslash problem and have try &quot;/&quot;, &quot;\&quot;, or combination of them. No way.<br />
<br />
Last week I have installed c4 , SP3-8 on NT 4.0 without problems. <br />
<br />
Is there any W2K issue?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been through a Baan c4 installation up to sp8 on windows 2000 without any problems.   It is the same as NT 4.<br />
<br />
Maybe just compare your setup to the NT4 setup and make sure everything looks the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it possible for you to scan in individual Baan Solutions (patches)?  Or is the problem just with scanning in the Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is the full name of the directory where your solutions are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isimeon</div><div class="date">19th November 2001, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Message appears after entering Update VRC.<br />
<br />
Path for individual solution dumps:  e:/baan/pmc/dumps/<br />
Path for uninstall dumps: e:/baan/pmc/uninstall/<br />
<br />
When I enter a root directory for individual solution dumps with backslash and slash - e.g.  g:\/ - the problem does not exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have installed B4c4/W2000 and had the same PMC problem.<br />
<br />
W/A: to change &quot;/&quot; -&gt; &quot;\&quot; everywhere (path columns) in the table ttpmc000000.<br />
<br />
I know there is solution on the BAAN Support Site to solve this problem W2K.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">20th November 2001, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I work with HP-UX I once installed Baan on W2K Advanced Server at home and made changes in the pmc tables as a workaround to this problem. However, as mentioned above the problem has now been solved by Baan....see solution number 107262.<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
&quot;This problem is solved in the bshell, and therefore the fix will be delivered with next Porting Set.<br />
For BaanIVc: Refer to solution 18505<br />
For BaanERP: Refer to solution 74687&quot;<br />
&quot;WORK-AROUND:<br />
Take care pathnames of directories do NOT end with a &quot;/&quot; or with a &quot;\&quot;<br />
For example: Change f:/baan/pmc/uninstall/ to f:/baan/pmc/uninstall&quot;<br />
<br />
There is also a temporary ntbshell.exe available, containing the fix as temporary workaround. See Baan solution for download details.<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
&quot;Note: This bshell is the 7.1b.01 bshell, which can contains this fix.<br />
This bshell is not officially supported, but only mentioned to use as temporary workaround for this problem!<br />
Unzip this file using WinZip, so you get ntbshell.exe (size = 1.05 MB)<br />
Replace your current ntbshell.exe in %BSE%\bin for this one. (To be save make a copy of your original ntbshell.exe)&quot;</div></div><hr />
