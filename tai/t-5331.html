<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerhard</div><div class="date">29th May 2002, 08:34</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a migration tool, developed by Baan and this realy works fine. But this tool is only available for certified migration alliances or certified Baan consultants. You should contact your local Baan organisation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pasadena</div><div class="date">29th May 2002, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your information but they will not &quot;give'' this solution away (even not for testing purposes) <br />
<br />
How can they convince us to buy BAAN ERP when we do not even get the possibility to test with operational data! (in a testenvironment of course)<br />
<br />
IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE WHO HAS THIS TOOL/SOLUTION???<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">30th May 2002, 00:16</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, there is not a general tool that can answer your question.<br />
<br />
I think we have to make a big difference between going from c2 to c4, than going from c4 to ERP, for example.<br />
<br />
ERP is a new application. You cannot go from c4 to ERP simply applying patches.<br />
<br />
Let us call migration when moving to cx to cy.<br />
Let us call install a new application and try to implement it and transfer data from an old application when moving from cx to ERP.<br />
<br />
Some modules does not exist in ERP, logic changes, etc... Maybe is easier going from BaaN c4 to BaaN ERP, than going form SAP to ERP.<br />
<br />
We call all Migration, but those different migrations are too DIFFERENT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan does have a conversion tool that migrates data from Baan IV to BaanERP. Like Pasadena pointed out, this is not available for everyone.</div></div><hr />

to migrate to BAAN V, have you used Exchange schemes and<br />
if yes can you tell me how you have set them up, I am especially<br />
