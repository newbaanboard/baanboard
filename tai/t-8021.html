Just wanted to know the following points.<br />
How do we install BaaN IVc4 on SQL 2000. i have heard that one can do it by installing the SQL 7 and load BaaN and then later upgrade it to 2000. The problem i m having that Microsoft people are telling us that they don't have SQL 7 and thus i cannot have the installation that way. Is there any other way to install BaaN on SQL 2000?<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />
Jericho</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is your issue that you cannot get a SQL 7 cd  or that Microsoft won't sell you a licence for SQL 7?<br />
<br />
If they won't sell you a licence for 7, as far as  I understand this isn't a problem as you are normally allowed to use an earlier version if ytou have reasons for doing so (and as you will be upgrading immediately you are not evading having a proper licence) - you are just constrained on how you can use their software.<br />
<br />
If you cannot get hold of a SQL 7 cd from normal retailers, you could try one of the auction sites - or when Baan were pushing us to upgrade from 6.5 to 7 they actually gave us a SQL 7 cd, so maybe you could be entitled to it from them?<br />
<br />
Incidentally - We have upgraded from 6.5 to 7 to 2000 over the 3 years of using Baan.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icaribe</div><div class="date">27th December 2002, 08:51</div></div><div class="posttext">for install BaanERP 5.c using SQL2000<br />
Baan will release new BaanERP 5.c include PS7.1d.01, just this could be install with SQL2000.<br />
other way is first install sql 7, then update ps to 7.1d.01, then try to update sql to 2k version.<br />
I doesn't sure if baan will release new BaanIVc4 with new ps which support SQL2000</div></div><hr />
