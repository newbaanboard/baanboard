<br />
I have several PMC Update VRCs that are no longer in use which I'd like to remove.<br />
<br />
Are there any &quot;gotcha's&quot; to be aware of?<br />
<br />
Any lessons from experience you could share?<br />
<br />
Lastly, what steps--if any--did you to take prior to doing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">21st May 2004, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Turns out that to remove the PMC Update VRC,<br />
solutions must be at &quot;Available&quot; status (not &quot;Installed&quot;)<br />
to be able to<br />
&quot;disconnect solutions&quot;  ttpmc2202m000 and then<br />
&quot;delete update VRC&quot; ttpmc2241m000<br />
 <br />
According to the Baan support person I spoke with, the only way to get the solutions which have been installed back to &quot;available&quot; is to either:<br />
a) UNinstall them<br />
-or-<br />
b) hack the table via GTM or SQL update query to change the status field.<br />
<br />
Since UNinstalling them would take hours as it would want to put back the previous versions (which might cause side-effect issues), we went with b) and modified the status for field rsta to &quot;1-Available&quot; in the table ttpmc201 (after taking a backup).<br />
<br />
Note-1:  Be sure to have a backup as well as test this on your test system before implementing on production.</div></div><hr />

The help info of this session describes the steps, which you have to perform to remove everything of an Update VRC.</div></div><hr />

May be some other better ways also there....</div></div><hr />
