<br />
I would like to install a new Baan LN Server with the following specification;<br />
<br />
Hardware requirements:<br />
1.	4 quad-core CPU Intel processers with 3 GHz speed<br />
2.	12 GB RAM<br />
3.	5 HD with 250 GB each<br />
<br />
Software requirements:<br />
1.	Windows Server 2008 R2<br />
2.	SQL Server 2008 R2<br />
<br />
What will be the best Architecture for this server taking into account that we are also going to install Hyper V since it will be hosting other three applications. It's going to be a Test Server. My complicated scenario will be licensing for LN &amp; other applications with the 4 existing processors. Obviously LN will be on the Physical machine, while the rest of the applications will be on the Virtual machines. And what will be the best Architecture for the Disk Array. Is it better to have a tower or a rack mounted considering the above specifications? Will love to hear your recommendations from all the Baan Gurus &amp; Professionals. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
correct me if i'm wrong,<br />
<br />
you want to install the ERP on the physical windows server 2008 and then enable the Hyperv and share the virtual environment on 3 other app?<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
do you install the Microsoft Hyper-V Server and then put all the env on the same server?<br />
<br />
if you choose the first, then you have to carefully count the processor and memory, as the first solution is hypervisor type 2, which run under OS, so you have to keep the OS running well.<br />
<br />
for the RAID, i recommend 1+0 as it provide performance and mirroring.<br />
<br />
Tower or rack doesn't matter actually, unless you're planning a datacenter then maybe you can use rack with networked storage.<br />
<br />
not to be a fanboy, but maybe you can try VMware, their ESXI are similar with Microsoft Hyper-V Server, but with added HA and DR, and more 3rd party enabled.<br />
<br />
hope that helps.<br />

However, my installation scenario will be the second, in which will have LN installed on the physical machine &amp; enable the 3 Virtual servers. The reason why am going with Microsoft Hyper-V Server is, the extra 3 virtuals are free and have never worked with VMware, are their licensing diffrent?<br />

Will we need to have an extra network adaptor since we will already have two adaptors to run the Hyper v which is the standard practice?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
from what i know, the equivalent for Hyper-V on the Win is Vmware server, which is free, you can install it on win7 also.You can check on this link(sorry if it's not allowed to put link on the forum)<br />
<br />
http://www.vmware.com/products/server/overview.html<br />
<br />
for the netwok card, the ideal one is using 2 NIC, one for each ERP, i don't know if Hyper-v can share it dedicatedly per VM though, i usually do it with Vmware.But the Vmware server i mention above is still hypervisor type 2, which shares the NIC with the host.<br />
<br />
hope that helps.<br />
