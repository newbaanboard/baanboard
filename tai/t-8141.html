<br />
The generation of XML files in BaanIV is used to push Baan reports to Crystal. This is extra functionality of Baan and Crystal, which is not free. You have to pay for it, so ask your Baan contact.<br />
<br />

<br />
Technically, I used to print data to xml format, by embedding data between hard coded tags and later spool this report to an output file with extension .xml<br />
<br />
Though this method is not effective for complex reports, some benefit, I was able to achieve.<br />
<br />
2. is there any 3rd party products available to do this? <br />
(Free or otherwise)<br />
<br />
Crystal Reports may be able to do this. Or for that matter, using any modern programming language, through ODBC, can stream data to an output file or reports in xml format.</div></div><hr />
