<br />
We have Baan 4 on Windows 2000 with 25 users licence.<br />
<br />
I have activated the job daemon via --Baan NT Manager--&gt; Job daemon. It is showing a Green Dot and there is a black ttaad5206m000 screen with &quot;Job Daemon active&quot; at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Now, I have created a simple job of &quot;Print Areas&quot; for testing.<br />
<br />
But it is not getting fired at the time specified. <br />
<br />
The no. of licences are less and it is difficult to enter into Baan at the date and time specified in job. Is this the reason the job is not getting executed? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Is the user jobd also configured correctly? It should start in the company in which the job is defined and the password should be stored in the bwc file.<br />
<br />
Make sure you store the password if you are loggon on as that person since the password is crypted with an algorithm that uses the account information. Check it by logon as he job users and start baan by using the bwc file. It should start the main menu without asking a password.<br />
