<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">7th June 2007, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using Baan IVc4 on a Unix based system.  All of our print devices point to Unix queues.  If we have a printer in our Information Systems Department (say an HP LaserJet 4000N with a duplex unit) we maintain the following Baan devices for that one physical device:<br />
<br />
 <br />
 IS-LAND 	(Landscape single side)<br />
 IS-PORT 	(Portrait single side)<br />
 IS-LAND-DUP	(Landscape duplex printing)<br />
 IS-PORT-DUP	(Portrait duplex printing)<br />
 IS-LAND-LEG	(Landscape single side legal size)<br />
<br />
The only real difference (besides the device name and description) is the HP driver being called in the $BSE/lib/printinf/h directory.  Does anyone have any ideas on how this can be consolidated into onc Baan device?  We are simply looking for a way to decrease the number of devices we have to maintain.<br />
 <br />
Thank you in advance for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />

I hope someone has a better answer.</div></div><hr />

Like you, the difference in our print drivers is the initialization string.  <br />
<br />
You and I had talked eons ago about setting up a customized ttstpconv for printing a .pdf document out of Baan.  Would we be able to do something similar in this case?  The customized ttstpconv would be layed out like this:<br />
<br />
 Zoom out to customized session where user can specify print characteristics (orientation, duplex, etc.)<br />
 Logically determine the driver to use based on user input<br />
 Somehow export that driver to the proper variable used by Baan<br />
 wait.and.activate() ttstpconv to print<br />
<br />
<br />
I ran the ttstpcreatdll session for ttstpsplopen (thought I am not really sure what all of this output is) and there is a line with the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
function extern domain ttaad.devd ttstpdevice.get.device_data_driver()<br />
Function to get Device Data_Driver (ttaad300.devd) from session ttstpsplopen<br />
return: - value of Device Data_Driver<br />
<br />
<br />
I was hoping that this may clue me into the variable Baan stores the device driver in.  I'm not sure... perhaps &quot;you can't get there from here&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th June 2007, 21:16</div></div><div class="posttext">How did you get ttstpcreatdll to work for ttstpsplopen?  Actually there is (on my system) a library for this called ttstpfsplopen(under ottstp directory). I can not see anyway this would help since I do not know how everything plays together(open report, open spoolfile, etc., etc.).<br />
<br />
Well I think you could use your own ttstpconv - with a lot of work.  What happens when you use your own ttstpconv is that a device independent report is created in the $BSE/tmp directory.  The first thing I do is run ttstpconv using the ascii format.  With the ascii file I do not see a reason you could not add the appropriate escape sequences to initialize(and reset) the printer.  The first problem would be that this strips out anything fancy do in the report(bold, fonts, etc.).  The second problem would be the page length - I am not sure what the default page length is for this, but I can almost promise that the page length would not be different for some of the 4 printers you mentioned.<br />
<br />
What you really need is to own source code to ttstpsplopen.</div></div><hr />
