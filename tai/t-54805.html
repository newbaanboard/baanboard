<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbomgardner</div><div class="date">19th January 2009, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks,<br />
<br />
I'm a sysadmin who is pretty new to Baan and I'm trying to troubleshoot why BaanLogin will not allow LDAP users to connect.  Local users connect just fine.  LDAP users can authenticate to the OS without issue (and rexec works just fine).<br />
<br />
I'm nearly positive this has something to do with PAM.  I was hoping someone else had come across a similar problem in their environment and could offer some suggestions.<br />
<br />
From the debug output it appears as if BaanLogin is detecting that my system is in trusted mode (incorrectly) which is causing the problem.  Does anyone know how/why this detection of trusted mode occurs?<br />

<br />
So if you're on the latest porting set, then it still hasn't happened =( but if not, then there is a chance. Look through the PS release notes to see if you can find it.<br />

<br />
On second thought though, I don't think this error has to do with PAM directly - the passoff to PAM appears to work just fine for both users.  This explains why both have no problems logging in to the OS and using the rexec connection method.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what Blogin is doing in these last two lines when the HP_check_password() function seems to be called?<br />
<br />
Is there documentation on Blogin anywhere that may describe this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

again, it's been a while but i think it calls badmin6.1 for that, badmin6.1 may need to be setuid root to make that work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbomgardner</div><div class="date">21st January 2009, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately changing the password didn't fix anything.<br />
<br />
This is what I think is happening:<br />
<br />
Blogin is first authenticating the user (via PAM), and then checking /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow to look for other password attributes.  Because it doesn't find my ldap user in either spot, it is assuming that I am on a trusted system and tries to look in the /tcb/files/auth tree (or somewhere else) but of course, it isn't there.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily want to go adding ldap users to /etc/passwd, but I may try it once to see what happens.  I also don't want to convert to a trusted system...<br />
<br />
If I'm right about this, I don't think there is much else I can do to get this to work.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">21st January 2009, 20:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Possibly, it would probably be a bug in blogind at this point.<br />
<br />
blogind has a higher level of logging you can set.. i think you start it like<br />
<br />
blogind6.X -D -D -D<br />
<br />
<br />
(that'd be 3 levels of debugging.. unless that's changed recently..)<br />
<br />
blogind6.2 -U[or -u] will give usage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbomgardner</div><div class="date">8th March 2009, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright,<br />
<br />
I am very grateful for all of the help everyone here has given me on this problem.  Thank you!<br />
<br />
It turns out this entire issue was caused by the default setting to return '*' as the hidden password in the configuration for the ldapux client on HP-UX.  Nothing mysterious at all.<br />
<br />
For those who are interested, getting this to work involved changing password_as in /etc/opt/ldapux/ldapux_client.conf:<br />
<br />
<br />
# You can set the user password to be returned as any string (consisting<br />
# of characters from the encrypted password and the &quot;*&quot; character) instead<br />
# of &quot;*&quot; when the password is hidden.  By returning something other than &quot;*&quot;<br />
# for the hidden password, along with a specific pam_ldap configuration,<br />
# r-commands such as rlogin will work with ldap users on the equivalent<br />
# remote host.  Since the password field of each /etc/passwd entry<br />
# contains an &quot;x&quot; when supporting shadow password, the example provided<br />
# below sets the return password to &quot;x&quot;.<br />
#<br />
# The default setting is to return &quot;*&quot; for hidden password.<br />
#<br />
# Warning:<br />
#    Setting the user password to be returned as any string for the hidden<br />
#    password could allow users with active accounts on a remote host to<br />
#    rlogin to the local host on to a disabled account.<br />
#<br />
password_as=&quot;x&quot;</div></div><hr />
