Is it possible to have one worktop environment with simultaneously connections to 2 (or more) different BaanIV environments on one of several servers 2 or more different connections to different versions (like baanIV, iBaanERP5.0c)Haven't tried this myself... with bw it is possible to connect to a triton3.1 environment... is it still possible to connect using this BWC file in a Worktop environment? What extra updates are needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer to the first two answers is yes. I actually have two connections to Baan IV c4 (sp 11), one to the development server and one on the production server. <br />
I don't know if it's possible for Triton 3.x environment to do the same... but the worktop (as I know) works only from Baan IV service pack 9...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The triton file did not load... as was to be expected... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two different wtd files (one for development, the other for the live environment). <br />
I can open one or both of the two. <br />
If I open both I can choose if the window is maximized (so I see only 1 wtd at time and switch between them thru the window menu of worktop) or reduce both the windows so I can see both at the same time.</div></div><hr />

I expected both servers to show up in the same window, so in the one wtd environment I tried to open a second bwc file, which did not succeed.</div></div><hr />
