<br />
we are looking forward to do a BaanIVc4 installation with Chinese language<br />
(on AIX 5.3, Oracle 10.2).<br />
I have read several threads about chinese/multibyte/unicode topics in this forum but I have to say that I am really confused about the correct setup.<br />
Therefor I would appreciate if anybody can give answers to the following questions:<br />
<br />
1. How needs the OS (AIX) to be configured with regard to the character set?<br />
2. what is the correct &quot;DB character set&quot; for the Oracle instance?<br />
    Can/must it be Unicode or not? why?<br />
3. Does the Baan installation needs to be multibyte? (I would really guess so).<br />
4. as we already have a testinstallation (but only in English, no multibyte)<br />
    can this existing non multibyte Baan installation be &quot;converted&quot; into<br />
    multibyte to be used with Chinese language? how?<br />
5. any other tips or general explainations?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Alex</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) If you use the ASCII interface, then you might be forced to install some chinese charactersets for the OS.<br />
2) Unicode will not work for Oracle under Baan IV, you need to configure the chinese (Z....) character set<br />
3) Baan needs to be multibyte. <br />
4) In the end this is just a flag during installation in a file under $BSE/lib, but most likely you can not easily convert from singlebyte to multibyte.<br />
5) Lot's of luck. Multibyte under Baan is sometimes challanging, sometimes works out of the box. You are lucky to use a Unix OS, under Windows your OS also needs to be in chinese and administrating Windows in chinese can be a real adventure.<br />

<br />
Below is the brief of the problem we are facing:<br />
<br />
Baan 4c4 installed with SP33 and translation pack installed till 22 for Simplified Chinese <br />
Itâ€™s a multy byte installation with DB collation as Chinese_PRC_BIN<br />
We are able to login in English and all function working properly.<br />
But when we login with user language as Chinese most of the menus are not opening (found missing menus, and menu fields in o language, and even labels are also missing for the session which are opening).<br />
In this setup we have already created all the required package combination, VRCs, and companies and data of these companies is also migrated using seq dump, which is working in English language.<br />
If there is a way to correct it please suggest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Navin Tenani</div></div><hr />

<br />
A new Baan IV installation in Chinese in 2014? How can that happen?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I left the Baan space some years ago, so my memory might be a bit clouded on the topic.<br />
<br />
But here some pointers:<br />
<br />
a) If the installation is on Windows, then make sure it's on a chinese language version of the operating system. My experience with Baan on Windows is limited, but the one time I tried to get chinese Baan to work on a windows server, it required a chinese windows.<br />
<br />
b) I am a bit concerned about the database collation used. The name suggests to me that you are using SQL Server? Which collation is suggested in the official installation manual?<br />
<br />
c) Log as english into Baan and check that the chinese language versions of forms and menus are listed in the application development sessions.<br />
<br />
d) go to $BSE/application and check that the corresponding runtime files exist<br />
<br />
If the chinese language menus and forms are in the tools, but not in the application directory, then obviously a create runtime is required to fix that.<br />
<br />
I fear, that is all I can do for you.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
<br />
