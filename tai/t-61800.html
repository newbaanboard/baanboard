<br />
A user at work has just been given a new Windows 7 PC. When trying to print to the EXCEL or WORD device from Baan they keep getting the following error.<br />
<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
Env        : Baan IV (c:\program files\infor\bw\baan iv)<br />
Program    : BW file q:\ui\bw\ts\win32\p_applet.cpp # 485<br />
Keyword    : TsApplet::start()<br />
Username   :  type:S language:2<br />
Process    : 4072<br />
ProcessSet : 987435@TEE987435:4072<br />
Lasterror  : 2 (The system cannot find the file specified.)<br />
Errno      : 2 (No such file or directory)<br />
BdbErrno   : 0<br />
Message    :    1 : Couldn't create process. File=excel, Parameters=&quot;C:\Users\987435\AppData\Local\Infor\BW\Baan IV\tmp\tmp029580563.txt&quot;, Verb=NULL, Error=2<br />
<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
The user's old PC also ran Windows 7 and could print to EXCEL or WORD without any issues. I have comapred the two PC's and can see no difference in the BW set-up or permissions on the BW files. The user has &quot;Full Control&quot; to all files under C:\Program Files\Infor and C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Infor directories.<br />
<br />
If I manually open Excel or Word and navigate to the txt or rtf files under C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Infor\tmp I can open the files okay. So the tmp029580563.txt file in the error message above can be opened directly from Excel. This would indictate that there isn't an issue with file permissions on the temp files created by Baan.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th January 2012, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the things we had to do was get the C:\Program Files\Baan\tmp permissions for the users to write into.  This the location that comes with the install of the client for us, but the security group locked down the program files directory originally.  Once we got the tmp directory enabled with the correct permissions it started working. I cannot remember the exact error we got.</div></div><hr />

The Baan Client crashes with a process error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It may depend on the version you are using also it varies with the WebUi/Worktop too. app_start() was used for worktop but it doesn't work for Webui, you can try start.application.local() function in you are on LN.<br />
<br />
Before that, check the permissions to the tmp folder on client machine. We normally give full rights to everyone for folder  C:\Program Files\ .<br />
<br />
Also, the excel report name should not contain &quot;/&quot; character. This will cause problems too.</div></div><hr />

You might have used Office 2003 and upgraded to Office 365 / 2013 and maybe from 32-bit to 64-bit. How is the device calling Excel?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">12th February 2015, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like it's trying to open Excel with just &quot;excel&quot;; see if you can type &quot;excel&quot; in a command window on the user's PC and if it opens Excel.  If it doesn't, the path to the Excel executable will need to be added to the PATH environment variable...</div></div><hr />

If I need that I have to find someone who had the right permissions.</div></div><hr />
