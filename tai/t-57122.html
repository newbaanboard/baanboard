<br />
we are running Baan IV under AIX and think about to migrate to Linux in a vmware when possible.<br />
<br />
1. question: Has anybody performance operating experience with BaanIV on Linux under vmware (our scenario: 100 conc. user, Oracle-server on linux hardware-server, BaanIV-application server on Linux vmware)<br />
<br />
2. Can the license daemon run under the vmware ?<br />
I know it´s not support but will it work?<br />
I searched in the board - i read that it will work until SP20 because then the licd6.1 will replaced with SLM,<br />
but i also read that the licd6.1 will not run under vmware<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help</div></div><hr />

ERP is normally bound by I/O, since you run your db on 'real' hw it think this should not be a problem. VMware has some overhead although this nearly disappeared. <br />
2. licd will NOT run in vmware, it's being detected. However since your db is running on physical hw you can easily install a so called fat client on that machine which enables you to run licd on that server.<br />
slm can't run too in vmware. But's more easy to configure it, the slm server can run e.g. on a simple xp station. However in order to be able to run slm you need to be on tools SP25 (not sure about the SP but it's one of the latest) and you need to have one of the latest portingsets.<br />
<br />
So basicly I don't see why you can't use Baan with the hw setup that you propose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's correct but you still can run Baan on a virtual server. You only need to run the license daemon on physical hw. There are workarounds for this.</div></div><hr />
