<br />
I am having a problem in exporting components from devl env. based on Customization administration.  Here is what I am trying to do:<br />
I run the session ttiex1280m000 : Export Data Dictionary. In the 4th tab (Components 3) if I select Customisation Project, than only those components which are attached to the Project/Customization Part/Project Part must be exported. But this seems to be not working. <br />
<br />
Can anybody through some light on  this or is it a baan bug?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, filling those fields won't help you export the components you really want to export.  It only specifies which customization parts (not the other objects associated with those parts) to export.<br />
<br />
There was another post not too long ago about this as well.  I think there is widespread agreement that this would be useful.  Unfortunately, for now, you have to pick and choose the things to export using the ranges for each object type.<br />
<br />
Sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ttiexdeliverp needs an ascii file which contains a list of components. That list can be used in ttiexdeliverp in order to export specific components.<br />
<br />
I did develop it for a customer and haven't took the code with me, so I am not able to share it, sorry.<br />

Is there any information around (that you can provide ;))that tells what the layout of the components file needs to be?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I developed a nice tool that I called tcmcsexportec of which I am enclosing the dump.<br />
<br />
I am still enhancing it but this version is pretty usable.<br />
<br />
Remember to set the variable CUNO_SRC to something (e.g. &quot;Y&quot;) if you want to export also sources.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th November 2004, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We released the tool that Ed was working in the above posts as Freeware - Export by Customization Administration code (probably similar to what Claudio has).  That way you do not have to create the patch first.  We put this and a few other handy tools on a CD and passed this out at BWU / Montreal.  We have Baan IVc3, IVc4 and Vc out there right now.  There is also a client tool that tracks the bclients that are logging in, their versions etc.  If you missed the conference, you can download these at:<br />

<br />
We hope to continue expanding these tools.</div></div><hr />
