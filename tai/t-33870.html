 Running JAVA VM 1.5.0_11 on all machines used in testing<br />
 System installs Licence Manager, ASM and creates the MSSQL DB without any problems<br />
 Install reports 'Installing BWC' and then produces the the error instead of starting 'ottiex1287' to import the Tools dictionary<br />
 Have tried to install onto the Database Server and got the same error message<br />
 Have loaded BW components from manual install and they install fine but same error reoccurs<br />
 I'm logged as local user with administrator rights being the 'baan' user<br />
 Have uninstalled and reloaded from scratch to no avail.<br />
 Tested the install on a machine that was previously successfully installed and get the same message<br />
<br />
Tested install on my home server running Windows 2000 SP4, SQL 2000 SP4 and JAVA VM 1.5.0_11 - ISO Files installed fine<br />

Right out of ideas as to what could be causing this error on all machines in the client's environment<br />

Shared memory does not play well with RDP.  If you are installing remotely, you will need to use something like VNC for your terminal instead of remote desktop.  If you are not using RDP, I don't have any other ideas off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Hope I helped.<br />

Thanks,<br />

Thanks any other ideas</div></div><hr />

The solution was to run under VNC or TS with the -console commandline specified</div></div><hr />
