<br />
Some one can give a proved defination of Run time Data Dictionary &amp; Application Data Dictionary , or difference in both.<br />
<br />
Please Share your Ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">1st December 2007, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Runtime dictionary is the place from where bshell takes information about domains / tables / user profiles / authorizations etc .   Domain /table dictionary fiels begining with d , user profiles beiginning with u , session groups and key groups in $BSE/lib/user , remote user file beginning with r  - all are examples of runtime dictionary .<br />
<br />
Application dictionary is the place from where runtime dictionary is created . All information in tools tables related to above files  is application dictionary.<br />
<br />
Any good software will always use runtime DD mainly because its faster and it's independent of  database driver related problems if any the database driver may have.  <br />
<br />
Normally these 2 dictionary are in sync if all changes in application dictionary are correctly and  completely converted to runtime . When developers manipulate application dictionary through tables or runtime dd at OS level , the discrepncy will be created for the same when convert to runtime dd will be done .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like : $BSE/application   dir comes in to what Runtime DD or App DD.<br />
<br />
same $BSE/tools ( all standard session and tables ) comes in to what?<br />
<br />
all user will be thankful if you ans this also.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">4th December 2007, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">$BSE/application &amp; $BSE/tools is runtime dd (forms , objects , report objects , menu etc ).<br />
<br />
Only information in tools tables ttadv/ttaad etc about all these is application dictionary .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shiv_softengg</div><div class="date">5th December 2007, 05:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that is really knowladge full but ...will you be considering $BSE/dict as run time DD.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">5th December 2007, 05:59</div></div><div class="posttext">By thumb rule , anything at OS  level is runtime DD  and anything at tools table level is application dd . <br />
<br />
An exception to this is session authorizations where application DD is  in ttaad23* tables which when converted gets populated in ttaaad999 (which is the runtime DD in a tools table and not at the OS level ). <br />
<br />
So answer 2 ur query is yes .</div></div><hr />
