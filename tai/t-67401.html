<br />
I am upgrading FP2 ES 8.2 environment to latest 10.3 version. I have successfully installed PMC solutions and it shows 7.6_a9 version in tools. But while running Enterprise Server 10.3 I am getting error as 'You cannot install Installable Unit &quot;Infor Enterprise Server 10.3 (2)&quot;. To upgrade: stage and select the appropriate PMC Installable Unit. '.<br />
<br />
I have also attached error screenshot with this thread.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, be sure to have also solutions 22842370 and 22842736 installed else it will fail. While upgrading you need to take help from log files and event viewer logged errors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please help me...<br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess if you are upgrading, you do not need to install/stage ES again. You will need to upgrade Porting set and install PMC solutions.You didn't mentioned about porting set upgrade. You will need that. Also, 10.3 comes with additional connectors for Webservice which requires the add-on PMC solutions and this comes with da, nt, ta and tm packages.<br />
<br />
Note - <br />
<br />
Mandatory<br />
<br />
• Infor Staging Wizard.<br />
• Infor Installation Wizard.<br />
• Infor ES Porting Set.<br />
• Infor Support Assistant.<br />
• Infor ES PMC Solutions.<br />
• Infor ES AddOn PMC Solutions.<br />
<br />
Do not stage these IUs while upgrading.<br />
• Infor LN<br />
• Infor Enterprise Server<br />
<br />
As said, please follow U9497I US document carefully. Everything is clearly mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please find the KB#22916327 on InforXtreme which is specifically regarding the mentioned solution - <br />
<br />
Also check KB#22899649. I guess you might get a link to download the solution here which you can scan and install. Again, please go through the KB before proceeding.</div></div><hr />
