<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chadwickh</div><div class="date">25th September 2006, 23:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to upgrade our porting set to support Oracle 10g. While we're at it I thought it would be good to upgrade our BW clients. Since we don't upgrade porint sets nor Baan clients very often I thought we'd get to the latest version of both, porting set 6.1c.07.11 and B40c.82 on the client. My question is:<br />
<br />
Can I use an older client to access a newer porting set? <br />
I'm having an issue with the 82 client - it seems when a user types in their name, it is capitalizing their letters in the user id. The user puts in us10556 and the error says:<br />

<br />
Baan says in their solution 13743 for the porting set that the porting set and BW are tied together:<br />
<br />
&quot;We advice to have always the latest BW version installed. But you can use a newer BW version against an older porting set version. <br />
So it is not mandatory to update the portingset on the Baan server also, when installing the newest BW version on the client computers. <br />
Although we advice to have also the latest version of the portingset installed on the Baan server. <br />
<br />
The portingset and BW (bw.exe, bwprint.exe, etc) are always created as one build, and secondly the portingset components and BW components are separated from each other. So we end up with a &quot;BW install&quot; and a &quot;portingset install&quot;. <br />
This means that a certain combination of a BW version and a portingset version do have the same source code base. <br />
Refer to the tables (PORTING SET VERSION VS. BW VERSION NUMBER) for these combinations. <br />
<br />
PORTING SET VERSION VS. BW VERSION NUMBER: <br />
porting set version: bw version number: <br />
6.1c.07.11 82 <br />
6.1c.07.10 81 <br />
6.1c.07.09 80 <br />
6.1c.07.08 79 <br />
6.1c.07.07 78 <br />
6.1c.07.06 77 <br />
6.1c.07.05 76 <br />
6.1c.07.04 75 <br />
6.1c.07.03 74 <br />
6.1c.07.02 73 <br />
6.1c.07.01 72 &quot;<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th September 2006, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have never heard that the bw client is tied to the porting set.  Baan has told us on a couple of occasions that we need to upgrade the client with the porting set.  At the point we are running B40c.80 and connecting to our service pack test company, which has portingset 6.1c.07.11.  At this point I do not know of any issues caused by this combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rpoenaru</div><div class="date">26th September 2006, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a known issue with BW 81 and 82. We logged an issue with SSA Global\Infor and suppose to be fixed in Porting Set 6.1c.07.12/BW 83. You have to use BW 80 or 79.<br />
<br />
If you want to keep the BW 82, you have to put -- set USER=xxxxxx in the command line of the BW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chadwickh</div><div class="date">29th September 2006, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the information :) . You're right, putting on the 80 client works now. Any idea who at Baan knows this. I'm working with support and it doesn't sound like this is a known issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please tell Support to search for Inquiry ID 320326 for MDA Space Missions and the resolution of the case is that will be fixed as part of Porting Set 6.1c.07.12. The SSA Global/Infor person was Chris Snyder.</div></div><hr />
