<br />
Run a creation of runtime for sessions (no need to get users logged out) for all package combinations to get rid of those messages.<br />
<br />
If using a language other than 1 to 4, you may need to copy language software components to your language and then create runtime for sessions - see solution 70102 for more information on translation of solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">When using the compiler (bic.exe), your objects will contain the code that is generated because of the programmers code (the script), but also code that is pre-compiled in a kind of link objects. <br />
<br />
These files are actually portingset independent (as is the application itself), but also contain fixes and modifications. These will show up in all objects generated with the new code, but also in own compiled objects.<br />
<br />
There can be Dynamic Link Failures because of these bic_ files, like when reports and ttstprepdll is involved.<br />
<br />
These files in solution 114812 are somewhere in between the application and the portingset, so applicable for all platforms, not platform dependent, but tools version dependent.<br />
<br />
So use the solution on NT also.<br />
<br />
But on NT you can install them best with a rename step: rename the tar-file (which is a *.dmp file) into *.tar and use winzip to extract the files. (best is: keep system date in tar-file, since the solution is generic and will be updated.)</div></div><hr />
