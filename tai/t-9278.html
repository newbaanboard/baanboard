to install localisations eg:supply chain on an existing Baan <br />
environment.Also the sch VRC's were not created during the<br />
Inital installation.<br />
Thank You.</div></div><hr />

On unix, you would have to re-run the installation to add those extra localizations. On NT, I don't remember if they are part of the standard installation CD of if you have an extra localizations CD...</div></div><hr />

This would mean you would not overwrite standard objects - just your package combination would see localized components (if they exist) first before seeing standard components.<br />

<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wouldn't be the first time that even saying you want an &quot;update only&quot; type of installation, some tools objects are overwritten with older ones from the CD.<br />
<br />
Another thing to remmember is service packs. Do not forget to install the same level of service packs on the extensions...<br />
