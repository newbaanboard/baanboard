We are running BaaN V b on sp13, we were facing one problem in one of the Archiving session, for that i found one solution also on baan site, solution no. 163951, now problem is that in solution description at the bottom of the page, service pack for baan V b is not associated with it. <br />
<br />
Refer to the screen shot. Does that means this solution has been released by BaaN till date as an individual solution rather than part of a service pack ?<br />
<br />
I would like to know this because then i can guess that if lets say this is part of sp16 or whatever then we are way behind the pre-requsites.<br />
<br />
This solution has been modified on 15th Dec 2004. When i scanned this solution it told me few more pre-reusited to be installed which further had more pre-requsites. Although i can always over come this problem via Multi Level download, but just out of curiousty i would like to know whether my initial finding of this solution i.e. it not being asscoaited with a service pack is right or wrong ?<br />
<br />
Waiting for your comments.<br />

Perhaps it will be included in SP17....</div></div><hr />

Well i belive since u r on BaaN IV , same solution might fall under diff. service pack in your case.<br />
<br />
eg : solution no. abc falling in sp13 in case of BaaN V , whereas in case of BaaN IV same solution might be falling in sp 14. I think this is quiet possible. Is it not ?<br />
