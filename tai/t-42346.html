<br />
Are you using Menu based browser? I will suggest you to use Process browser based DEM. It doesnt give such haphazard errors in DEM.<br />
<br />
You have to check &quot;Process Browser check box&quot; and uncheck the &quot;Menu Browser&quot; in User Management session. Please try this first onyour test server and check the results....<br />

<br />
Hi Neha,<br />
<br />
Colud you explain us in detail what happens after those 3-4 days? What error users get? It would be great if you could attach the screen shot of the error here...<br />
<br />
Also, how many versions do you have there? And in how many versions each of these users is attached? Is this error occuring for a particular set of users OR everyone?<br />
<br />
