When printing documents, the fonts (language) do not appear to be accurate with the Polish language.  It shows characters that contain a paragraph sign, power of 3, upside down question mark, etc.<br />
<br />
Is there anything else that needs to be done to get these fonts printing and showing up correctly on the display?  Baan told us that nothing needs to be done to our database(Oracle) to utilize this new language.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />

Do you print on local windows printers? If you do, you have to install a proper font on your workstations - a font that has polish national characters in ISO 8859-2 standard. If you print on Unix printers, you need to have and select a proper font in your printinf files, and use proper nlsinf files. Contact me, if you need details : g_komander@dst.com.pl .<br />
<br />
For display problems under BW you have to select &quot;Eastern Europe&quot; in bw configuration (on NLS tab).</div></div><hr />

I have some problems too with the Polish translation. I have installed polish translations for c4 and for service pack in a BAAN with languages 2, 4, 5 and P already installed. Operating system of the server is W2003 in english. At first sight, it seems everything is correct, but there are some parts that appears those strange characters like Tim mentioned.<br />
<br />
For example, i surf the menus and all session descriptions appear correctly. But if i run one of those sessions, I can see that the description of the session is not exactly the same. For example, in the menu I can see that the session description is Obs&#322;uga jêzyków but if i run the session, I see Obs³uga jêzyków. <br />
It happens in other parts too, like pull down options. I've checked all this data in the BAAN tables and everything seems correct. I see no strange character conversion.<br />
I've configured the baan client selecting the eastern europe locale and the user in baan has locale ISO88592.<br />
Is there anything else I could do???<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Seems like Polish characters are converting to ????  -marks.<br />
Tried with hp_lj4 with many different kind of variations in device data and user data for locale. Unicode in use.<br />
