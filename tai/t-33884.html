To get ASAP help, contact your local BaaN Support.<br />
<br />
Did you use ttadv4232m000 - Check Tables for all companies and packages to validate the Table Definitions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dilipk.pandey</div><div class="date">7th April 2007, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Mr. NP Rao,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your reply...<br />
And I have done what you suggested...but did not get anything related to solution...and the problem is also not consistent in nature as while I am debugging, sometimes its getting done without any problem and sometime its throwing the Fatal Error...<br />
Users are able to do in few attempts the Confirm/Freeze....<br />
<br />
I am planning to do the CRDD for Tools (ttadv5213m000), do you think this can help me somehow...?<br />
<br />
Other finding is there is some function in &quot;cpcomdll2000&quot;that is: <br />
<br />
cpcom.dll2000.offset.lead.time(), this function is returning the &quot;result.date&quot;...and the execution is getting stuck to this line...any idea about the same...? The item used in this transaction is Serialized Item. And one more thing I would like inform that we are doing entries for previous finanical year (April 2006-March2007).<br />
<br />
The result.date has the value of i.date but this i.dat varries according to Negative or Positive Lead Time...<br />
<br />
Please have a look on this and I will be very happy if with the help of any of you I could resolve this else I will have to go to ultimate destination that Baan Support....<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Regards,<br />
Dilip.</div></div><hr />

Have you checked the logs to find the table name? <br />
Some times domain changes can cause these situations<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Eduardo</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your response...<br />
Yes I checked the DB Log, and the tables were identified where the problem was there...and now the problem is resolved...<br />
I hope and welcome this support and cooperation in future also.<br />
Thanks again.<br />
