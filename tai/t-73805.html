<br />
<br />
We have Infor LN setup and BIDS setup are on same server (Server1). Both are working fine Infor+SSRS as they are on same server.<br />
<br />
But now we are making other Infor LN server(Server2). and We want to use same SSRS facility which we are already using in Server1. <br />
<br />
FYI,Both server has similar setup and similar kind of data. We just want share that SSRS utility (Server1) with New Server2.<br />
<br />
Also we have same reporting setup done for server2.like Device Data, Report Server, System.... But haven't got the success.<br />
<br />
While printing any SSRS report i got the below Error popup..<br />
&quot;Device is not available for report reporxxxxxx; Report not present on report server&quot;<br />
<br />
Any help will be very appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

But I assume you did that correctly already. Second thing is the Report Folder. Probably there is a $hostname variable in it. That is substituted at runtime with the server where the request comes from. And that is different. If you want to share report definitions between servers, you have to remove that variable from the Report Folder (in both servers) and move them manually in Report Manager. Or alternatively, deploy the reports also from server2, but in that case you have two copies, you need to keep in sync.</div></div><hr />
