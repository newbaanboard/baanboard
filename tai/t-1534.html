<br />
the object otccomspinfo seems to be missing on my system. Did it come with a SP itself? :-)<br />
<br />
By the way, did you also have so bad experience with the version scan tool? At least at the clients I am working on, it shows most of the time wrong information, especially in a client/server setup.<br />

<br />
you have installed Baan IV c3 and the following extensions:<br />
<br />
Controlling<br />
Supply Chain<br />
Supply Chain + Controlling<br />
Multicurrency<br />
Somehing called &quot;bc&quot;<br />
<br />
looks a bit like somebody installed the whole mastertape on your system, without selecting, which extension you actually need.<br />
<br />
Most likely the folders c4/c5 come from an wrongly installed patch. if you install a patch (without pmc) to the default location, without specifying a destination, this is exactly what happens.<br />
<br />
Normally the VRC for patches is called B40U_c3_stnd, but this convention was not applied in your case. <br />
<br />
Check where &quot;prod&quot; and &quot;cust&quot; are derived from, to see, which extensions you are actually using.<br />
<br />
If you have extensions installed, which you do not use, then this is no harm really. It clutters your system, looks messy and takes some disk space. But that's it. With some effort you could delete them, but with a Baan session not just with the &quot;rm&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
As Victor mentioned, I cannot use Process Solutions to identify the Service Pack since the PMC is not installed.    Any other ideas?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">4th April 2002, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt; I ran ttaad0500m000 and it gives all the information<br />
&gt; as you said. But, in my specific situation, this is what<br />
&gt; i see: <br />
<br />
&gt; Last Appln. Version = B40 c5 <br />
So you have been installing some solutions that were originally made for the c5 environment.<br />
&gt; Service Pack Level = 00 <br />
indeed, the service packs (which are PMC dumps with a special construction). <br />
&gt; Last Tools Version = B40 c1 <br />
This is the highest VRC for tools in the $BSE/tools/. directory.<br />
<br />
&gt; I was told that the system is running on B40c3 <br />
That is right, but since newer solutions have been installed, there is no c3 anymore.<br />
&gt; and now i see 'B40c5' on the VST<br />
If you should plot the VRC of your software for all packages you would see some components on c1 level (like tools), some on c2 level, obvious a lot more on c3 level, but also some on c4 and even c5 level. As you can imagine, these great generation differences can cause problems (just like in real life with a generation cap ;)). Also: in the pre-PMC versions you can install older software over newer software.<br />
<br />
&gt; And why the Service Pack Level shows '00'? Does<br />
&gt; that mean there was no Service Pack installed at all? <br />
Right.<br />
<br />
If you want to know exactly on what software you are, you should know what the policy of baan is with regards to maintenance etc. You can read it on the Baan support site.<br />
<br />
Briefly: All solutions within a version/major release (like B40_c), are supposed to be downward compatible. So the solutions that are offered to you are c5 solutions. Even if your current VRC is c3 (that is your application VRC's is B40_c3).<br />
<br />
Then why migrate to B40_c4? If you do so, then you will get updates on certain parts of the software (that can also mean a downgrade on other parts), but also new functionality that is not delivered in separate solutions (like PMC). These updates are done in the c4 layer. There may be stuff in the B40_c4 layer that is older than the stuff in the B40U_c3_stnd layer.<br />
<br />
But when you put PMC in place you will have a great mechanism to update (and never accidentaly downgrade) your software. Because of installing dependent solutions (one component needs a certain version of another component, like forms needed for a newer session). Every once in a while you will install a Service Pack in which you can update your software over the whole line of software.<br />
<br />
For now: you cannot tell on what level your software is, only the range in which your software is (c1 to c5). But there is are ways to determine the age of each software component separately...<br />
<br />
If you delete the &quot;tdB40_c5 (I don't see ANY files under this folder)&quot; folder, you will most probably in VST see c4 as last application version. Newer components in the ILC module should have been installed in the tdB40U_c3_stnd vrc.<br />
tdB40_c5 (I don't see ANY files under this folder) <br />
<br />
By the way: VRC stands for Version (which is obvious Baan IV in your case); Release (which contains of a mayor release like c in your case and a minor release which in your case is 3); and Customer which can be anything to differentiate between the different layers on the same generation of the software: empty or stnd for the standard software; sch0 or 1 stands for supply chain, etc).<br />
<br />
Then underneath the Baan software there is a layer that makes the Baan application platform independant. This is the porting set. The versions of these run different, because one portingset runs over different versions (like triton3.1 to Baan IVc4 run the same portingset). Here the version is dependent on the generation for the portingset (like 6.1 for Baan IV, see the version number in the $BSE/bin via the filenames or properties of the files). Typically these files are updated in batch, so all binaries have the same version. This can be seen with the &quot;-v&quot; option on any of the binaries or on &quot;Properties&quot; on the windows exe files.<br />
<br />
You can determine what localisations are really unused on your system, but this post is too long already :p</div></div><hr />
