<br />
our company upgraded our windows 2000 to windows 2008, domain was also changed , after migration user encountered problem of unable to  login to LN with protocol “Rexec” and were getting error of username and Password Incorrect , thus worktop  protocol was changed from “Rexec” to BaanLogin, now users are able to login with protocol “BaanLogin” , but some users,  the “Execute Query “ is  auto missing as explained in email below.<br />
<br />
Kindly assist ,  how to bring back the option attached to user  with BaanLogin <br />
protocol ? <br />
<br />
And why are we getting the error message when we are trying to connect thru Rexec, as before patching we never had this error....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">31st October 2011, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Rexec is installed with the porting set. If you went to Windows 2008 and additionally you went to a x64 version, you want to make sure that you did not copy or moved files. Re-running the porting set installation should correct the issue. <br />
In services there should be one named Infor Logic Service. That should be started. Also, if you go to the Infor Management console you should be able to view these services from that console (formerly known as the baanman.msc). If you have trouble pulling up that console most likely the portingset is not installed properly. Normally, reinstalling it should correct issues like this.</div></div><hr />
