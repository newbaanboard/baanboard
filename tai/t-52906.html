<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">2nd July 2008, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Ran into an interesting issue that I'm trying to determine if there is a workaround.  We have a request for a comma delimited import file change from around 70 fields to 250.  The prior import would save the entire record in a pipe-delimited record in a text field of the Baan table record where some fields are being placed from the import.  After creating the new import, I found that the condition on the text file would not compile (check syntax).  <br />
<br />
After checking the syntax in the text for concatenating fields and ensuring that the parameters by condition had the proper values (alpha vs. numeric), I trimmed the saved fields to the prior amount (70) and started adding fields back in five at a time.  After a few passes, I found that the compile error starts occurring when the 101st parameter by condition is added.  Therefore, it looks like an additional exchange limitation is 100 parameters by condition.<br />
<br />
I thought it would be good to post this fact since I couldn't find the limitation in Baan support or this forum and the compile provides a misleading error instead of stating that a limit was surpassed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">3rd July 2008, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The error wasn't actually caused by the count of 100 parameters, but limited by the length of the script lines that are created based on the exchange and conditions.  If the generated statement containing the conditions exceed 1024 characters, the line is truncated during creation.  This causes errors (often misleading) during the compile.  So, the actual number of conditions permitted involves the length of the exchange name (since the conditions are by exchange) and the length of the names of the conditions.  This was found by looking at the &quot;.i&quot; file that's created in the exchange scheme's object folder during the compile.<br />
<br />
This is present for 4c4 and recent service packs.</div></div><hr />
