<br />
I have just installed Advanced Printing on our Baan IV b on Compaq Unix tru64 server. After several tries I can now print to one of our printers in our printer pool. What I did is this: Create a spooler and a supervisor, then I created a logical printer say prt_all and at last I created 2 physical printers say prt01 and prt02. When I execute the next command twice: pdpr -f filename -p prt_all the file is printed on both printers once. This is what I want. (printerjobs must be equally distributed to both printers) I want to use this in BAAN both then nothing happens. In the session ttaad3100m000 I created the printer prt_all as a direct printer with driver hp_lj4 and as programm : /usr/bin/pdpr -p prt_all -n %d<br />
I also tried a logical printer and the real path to the printerprogramm eq. /usr/opt/apx100/bin/pdpr still nothing happens when I try to print something it just hangs for awail. Please can somebody help me with this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Device Type = Rewrite File<br />
Clear driver and print ques fields.<br />
4GL Program = ttstpconv<br />
Argument = &quot;ASCII\/path of your script %s&quot;<br />
Path = whatever you want (dummy file)<br />
<br />
This should do the trick.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your tip, It's working now something is printing at last. But now I have another problem, I must have a page width of 132 instead of 80 line. I will look at the man pages if I have to fillin some parameters.<br />
<br />
Again thanks</div></div><hr />
