I am trying to extract the installation files from a UNIX tape containing BaaNERP5.0c. When I say cpio -icvdB &lt;device path, it says <br />
<br />
&quot;Out of phase--get help<br />
probably the &quot;-c&quot; option shouldn't be used&quot;<br />
<br />
when i remove &quot;c&quot; from the command, it says<br />
&quot;probably the &quot;-c&quot; option should be used.<br />
<br />
I would like to know if anyone have seen this b4 and what was the solution.  I am beginning to think if the tape got corrupted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Out of phase--get help<br />
Perhaps the 'c' option should[n't] be used <br />
<br />
cpio -i could not read the header of an archived file. The header is corrupt or it was written in a different format. Without the R option, cpio returns an exit code of 2. <br />
<br />
If no file name has been displayed yet, the problem may be the format. Try specifying a different header format option: null for standard format; c for ASCII; b, s, P, or S, for one of the byte-swapping formats; or 6 for UNIX Sixth Edition. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, a header may be corrupt. Use the R option to have cpio attempt to resynchronize the file automatically. Resynchronizing means that cpio tries to find the next good header in the archive file and continues processing from there. If cpio tries to resynchronize from being out of phase, it returns an exit code of 1.</div></div><hr />

It didn't help me say -R too.<br />
I am beginning to think that the tape header may be corrupt.<br />
Is it possible? I guess they are right protected. The tape device is perfect. <br />
Thanks anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not so sure that the tapes are write-protected by default.... Makes me think of the following: did you by any chance, accidentally use '&gt;' instead of '&lt;' the first time you accessed the tape?<br />
<br />
If not then I would say the header of the tape is buggered up. Did the installation manual clearly say to use 'icvdB' options?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Well. I guess I have not done that. But thank God, the tape is on the way from BaaN. Hope it works fine this time. Thanks for ur time<br />
<br />
The BaaNERP5.0c default help files are not complete. I have not loaded any SPs. Is there any dump of help file that I can load, without bothering abt SPs?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

There are some incompatibilities with cpio between different plattforms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">That what Gerhards tells us is also my experience. You have somethimes to use the option -H odc if you want to read a tape created on another Unix platform.<br />

But I have installed in HPUX 10.20 before, with the same cpio command</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerhard</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have an original mastertape from Baan, this should be readable on a HP system always! So it seems, the tape is defect.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all the support.</div></div><hr />
