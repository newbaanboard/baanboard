<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cancoon2000</div><div class="date">17th June 2013, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I am including the following code in my Header Script of a customized Session/Script in which I am using AFS.<br />
<br />
#pragma used session &lt;vanilla session code&gt;<br />
<br />
After Compiling and generating a user Role which includes the Customized session, I was expecting to see the &lt;vanilla session code&gt; to be added automatically under userâ€™s session list authorizations, however it is not.<br />
<br />
Can someone enlighten me what is wrong or how to manage adding vanilla session without adding it manually in ttaad2131m000.<br />

Thank you<br />

I know at one time we had issues with generating a user role and them not getting all the sessions they needed.  That was when we started using the #pragma used session statement.  As far as I know it solved most of our issues.  I know there are a few sessions they still add manually - I just never had to look at or figure out why.<br />
<br />
I know some coding I am doing now will need this functionality to work.  I am not sure when or how the sys admins and users are going to test.  In my case I need them to have access to some inventory sessions - just not from the role or dem flow.</div></div><hr />
