<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theresa</div><div class="date">18th September 2001, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I am attempting to do some further testing of my table_extents on our test system before doing them on production (to sovle the KB vs Pages question).  The problem is that these 2 environments are on are different porting sets:<br />
Production (3-tier):  6.1c.05.01<br />
Test (host-mode):  6.1c.04.02<br />
<br />
bdbreconfig6.1 works on production, but it does work on the test server....giving the following error:  &quot;ksh:  bdbreconfig6.1:  not found&quot;<br />
<br />
I  called Baan Support and once again they have proven themselves less than adequate in troubleshooting problems to any serious degree...forgive my bluntness, but I'm so tired of hearing the same old...&quot;you have to update your porting set before I can help you any further.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I just want to know if anyone out there knows what this problem could be related to?  Is updating the porting set really my only option here?  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance thus far, the information provided has been more than helpful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't want to give an obvious answer but still: did you check your ENV settings? $BSE, $PATH? Do you run the bdbreconfig6.1 from within the $BSE/bin directory? Is the binary actually present in that directory?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've checked my env settings and the PATH/BSE variables are identical on both servers.  <br />
<br />
I have not attempted to run bdbreconfig6.1 from $BSE/bin on the test_server as I do not want the table_data to unload into that dir....will it prompt me for the directory to unload the data to before dropping records?  -- If not, will it hurt anything if I immediately CTRL+C - to stop the process?  <br />
<br />
On production, I 'cd' into the directory I was to unload the table to (/informix/reorg), then I simply type bdbreconfig6.1 and off it goes.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the informative (and speedy) responses!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theresa</div><div class="date">18th September 2001, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm such a yoyo -- after modifying the PATH variable on the test server to match the production server (early this morning), I failed to LOG OUT AND LOG BACK IN!!  So after figuring out the error-of-my-ways, it now works.  <br />
<br />
I did CTRL+C immediately after the reorg started (to check my error log), and I see it put a R.tdsls051 file in the reorg_dir (/junk/reorg)...but I didn't lose/hurt anything right? ...Hope not.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.</div></div><hr />

Try either one of this:<br />
<br />
<br />
bdbreconfig6.1 -t&lt;your output dump dir&gt; &lt;options&gt;<br />
<br />
*or*<br />
<br />
cd &lt;your output dump dir&gt;; $BSE/bin/bdbreconfig6.1 &lt;options&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no 'interactive mode' for bdbreconfig6.1 and I would avoid pressing CTRL-C during the bdbreconfig6.1 if possible!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">18th September 2001, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Theresa, glad to hear there are more yoyo's out there who make silly mistakes sometimes :)<br />
<br />
You should be alright after the CTRL-C. Depending on whether the table was already fully dumped or not - I assume not if you did the CTRL-C immediately -, Baan does not delete the original one.</div></div><hr />
