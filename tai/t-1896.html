<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">1st May 2002, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">What rules do Baan follow for patch numbering ?<br />
<br />
We ask as in some cases we raise the &quot;original&quot; patch is updated twice in two weeks with &quot;different&quot; solution numbers<br />
<br />
However we recently have been asked to load a solution number 81246 which was loaded on our systems on 8/6/00 and has been updated as recently as 23/2/2002<br />
<br />
Second question is what is correct procedure to install this &quot;revised&quot; patch over existing one ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">1st May 2002, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny. That is the first time I see the words Baan, patch and rationale in the same sentence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">2nd May 2002, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Some terms and definitions:<br />
Case: A issue you want to have the Baan support solved. You get a specific case number assigned for each issue.<br />
<br />
Solution: <br />
1) compiliation of software objects that may be put in your system (normally by PMC nowadays)<br />
2) An Information record in the solution database of Baan.<br />
<br />
So, when you log a case that turns out to be caused by a bug, you get a solution (hopefully) with new software objects. If that does'nt solve your problem you get another solution. Each new set of software objects must get a unique number (the solution number) to be identifiable. So, your case isn't &quot;solved&quot; by a solution, it is &quot;closed&quot; when a *particular* solution solves your problem.<br />
<br />
However, there is another type of solution: This type is not accompanied by software objects, but just textual information in the Baan support solution database. THere are solutions of this type that are regulary updated (eg: Latest information on Euro conversion or for a service pack) to show you up-to-date information on specific critical issues.<br />
<br />
An old solution may also be updated if it turns out to be hazardous. Then Baan support (they're really getting better!) put's a respective note on the solution.<br />
<br />
Hope that clears the things a bit.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the clarification<br />
<br />
Are you able to advise on the installation procedure in the second example where solution number is updated ?<br />
<br />
We have downloaded the &quot;new&quot; version but it obviously does not as it thinks it is already installed.<br />
<br />
We were assuming there would be some &quot;versioning&quot; contained with the solution which would enable the &quot;revised&quot; patch to be updated but this does not appear to be the case in our installation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">2nd May 2002, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Frank,<br />
<br />
which version are you on? Do you use session &quot;import patch&quot; to install solutions or are you using the PMC module?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">2nd May 2002, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Uli<br />
<br />
We are on 4C4 SP8 using  PMC</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure that you need to re-install this patch?!<br />
<br />
I checked it and there's no mention that has been changed (don't take as change date the date that is shown at the top in the &quot;last Modified&quot; field !).<br />
<br />
When Baan changed the Knowledge Base more or less two months ago, several patches got a &quot;last modified&quot; new date! When a solution content is changed, then the text message mentions it!<br />
Anyway, you will be out of luck since this patch was installed within Service Pack 6 (you are on 8) so you cannot re-install it (without hacking PMC) - that brings me to the first question, why would you need to re-install it in the first place?!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">2nd May 2002, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Victor !<br />
<br />
Thank you for clarifying &quot;date modified&quot; with reference to comments on the case.<br />
<br />
The reason for the request to &quot;install&quot; came from an internal source who also was &quot;misled&quot; by the &quot;date mofified&quot; and thought it would resolve an issue we had with restting a repayment status</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">2nd May 2002, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad to clarify that.<br />
<br />
Baan has been issuing new solutions since more than two years instead of updating the old solution (the change was made while I was still working at Baan so I remember that well). That's why I asked why the need to re-install...<br />
<br />
A solution is made when the defect case (handled by PEG) is closed, so the correct date is the date shown as &quot;creation date&quot; - except for the text solutions (help guides, information of solutions that point to the latest for a particular object/portingset) that are updated regularly (more or less).<br />
<br />
Now, sometimes old bugs re-ocurr, so it's possible that you may find more than one solution mentioning the same problem - this may be your case and, as I always suggest, have it checked with Baan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many thanks <br />
<br />
On a similar question , are there any standards as to how long Baan will work a case before classing it as a defect or is it up to the users to &quot;holler&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">9th May 2002, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Some sort of standard procedure:<br />
<br />
1. You open a case where you state your problem.<br />
2. If the bug is well known, Baan will send you the solution and this will solves your problem (case closed).<br />
3. If it's a bug (not something that needs hack of tables), Baan usually upgrades your session(s) with the latest object(s).<br />
4. I the problems persists, then it's tested internaly in a server (fully correctly updated regarding patches). If it's replicated, a defect is open to have it corrected.<br />
5. You are informed a defect is created, they will provide a workaround if needed, when the solution is released you will be informed to install it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">9th May 2002, 12:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Victor<br />
<br />
Thanks for the clarification again<br />
<br />
In our case they are unable to reproduce the problem in house<br />
so is there then a &quot;another sub process&quot; that is followed ?<br />
<br />
In fact the problem in question is the one I have raised on this board to do with negative values after an MRP run which 2 other postings have now stated they also have</div></div><hr />
