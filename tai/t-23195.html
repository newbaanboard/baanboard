<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th February 2005, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two systems - test and production.  In test when I run maintain purchase orders, maintain purchase order lines as a normal user I can zoom to tfgld0552s000 on form 3.  If I go delete access to this session when I try to zoom I get &quot;No permission for tfgld0552s000&quot;.  This is what I would expect to happen.  <br />
<br />
Over in production as a super user I can go into maintain purchase orders, maintain purchase order lines and zoom to tfgld0552s000.  I did a ps and it shows tfgld0552s000 running.  BUT as a normal user when I try to zoom on this field I get the following error message &quot;No permission for tfgld0552s0000&quot;.  Notice the extra 0 in the session name.  Not sure what else I need to check - the forms all look okay.  Permission tables all look okay. Done numerous convert and create runtimes for the sessions and users.  Nothing seems to work and I am totally stumped.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions welcome!<br />

Modify the form on the production to eliminate exrta 0 . It should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th February 2005, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">The form looks okay(See attached) - my old copy of the source does not show a zoom.to$ on the field.  Actually I found out more after I made the post.  This zoom.to worked on Friday for the user that logged the problem and when they came in on the Monday the 14th it no longer worked.  Neither tdpur4102s000 or tfgld0552s000 changed over the weekend.  I am thinking one of the tools tables (probably permissions) needs to be repaired.  When I started on this I thought it was something we had done, but it appears to be another problem.<br />

I checked ttaad231 on both systems and both looked okay.  Just can not figure out what is causing that extra zero.<br />
