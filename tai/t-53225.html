It works when I run it as bsp user. But if I try to run this as oracle user or other user, it will not work. I don't remember I changed anything. What could the problem possibility be? Seems like permission issue. But I double checked. oracle user is in the bsp group and licmon can be executed with users other than bsp. -rwxr-xr-x <br />
If you have any idea, that would be great. Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanworld</div><div class="date">4th August 2008, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Will this problem relate to the recent upgrade of oracle database to 10g? <br />
When I issue the command licmon6.1 -w| wc -l with oracle user, I got the following error:<br />
<br />
licmon6.1: User file for user 'oracle' does not exist. Last searched location '${BSE}/lib/user/uoracle;${BSE_REM}!${BSE}/lib/user/uoracle'<br />
licmon6.1: Unable to initialize user settings<br />
       0<br />
<br />
<br />
But oracle does have the bsp permission. I double checked. What other problem can it be?</div></div><hr />

<br />
that error means you don't have an oracle user setup in baan (rightly so!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanworld</div><div class="date">4th August 2008, 23:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, oracle user was never setup in baan. But it never complained before. Why now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanworld</div><div class="date">5th August 2008, 00:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried with users other then bsp and oracle. It does not work either. That users does have profile setup in the $BSE/lib/user directory. But the error message is the same when I issue the command. I am speculate it has to do with the permissions problem, but just don't know where to look.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you update the porting set?  maybe you changed permissions on the licmon binary.<br />
<br />
Sounds like something is messed up somewhere. and easy fix would be to <br />
chmod 4750 licmon6.1<br />

<br />
Please check that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaukul</div><div class="date">5th August 2008, 08:45</div></div><div class="posttext">licmon6.1 is present in $BSE/bin, so &quot;$BSE/bin&quot; must be part of PATH variable.<br />
<br />
Else, you can also try running &quot;licmon6.1&quot; command mentioning its complete path i.e. /baan/bse/bin/licmon6.1 -w (assuming /baan/bse is BSE directory).</div></div><hr />

<br />
$BSE for sure has been set, otherwise the command wouldn't be found at all. I tried succesfully to issue licmon6.1 from a user with no profile in $BSE/lib/user dir, it works fine once $BSE and $BSE_TMP is set correctly. Which version do you use (licmon6.1 -v shows 6.1c.07.05 here)?<br />

Is there something new going on about this new porting set?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanworld</div><div class="date">6th August 2008, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally get this to work. I made bbuser a valid baan user and then set the $BSE environment variable. Looks like this is something new with the new porting set 07.11</div></div><hr />
