<br />
What's the best way in Baan to check what references are being made to a table field.<br />
<br />
I've ran both the 'Print where used domains' and 'Print table definitions' reports which go part of the way to tell me where there are likely references but is there a better way?<br />
<br />
I've been asked to do a mass-change of a value in a certain table via the 'backend'. So I want to make sure that I don't introduce any referential integrity issues.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
the session ttaad4229m000 is a good way to find references of key fields of a table.<br />
<br />

I've looked at this session. I've entered my table and company number but I keep on getting an error saying 'Description not allowed'<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Look in $BSE/dict/&lt;package combo&gt;/d&lt;modfule/d&lt;table&gt;<br />
<br />
In that table you'll see the field data etc., but you can also see all the refered to tables and fields.<br />
<br />
Those will be listed in the &quot;REFC&quot; parameter of the table.  <br />
<br />
Using the session named above earlier is a good method to find data references to a table if you run into problems updating or deleting records and you run into problems.   <br />
<br />
Using the data dictionary method is a good way to know what tables you need to code for if you want to do an exchange scheme or update session.<br />
<br />
An example of the tiitm001 file to look at would be something like:<br />
<br />
$BSE/dict/ddB40c4prd/dtiitm/dtiim001</div></div><hr />

Thanks for this.<br />
<br />
Just one point, where I can find table defs with REFC parameters they are always found towards the bottom of the def file. I would have thought that each table field would have had a REFC parameter underneath each NAME line? <br />
<br />
So in the example below what is the REFC parameter attributed to? It looks as if the table index is being tied to a REFC, or is this telling me that fields tdilc009.bloc, tdilc104.bloc and tdilc003.bloc are being referred to by other tables?<br />
<br />
:RELE:6.1<br />
F<br />
:NAME:tdilc006.bloc<br />
:DOMA:tdilc.bloc<br />
F<br />
:NAME:tdilc006.dsca<br />
:DOMA:tcdsca<br />
F<br />
:NAME:tdilc006.Refcntd<br />
:DOMA:tdRefcnt<br />
F<br />
:NAME:tdilc006.Refcntu<br />
:DOMA:tdRefcnt<br />
I<br />
:IDNO:001<br />
:KEYF:tdilc006.bloc    <br />
:ACTI:1<br />
L<br />
:RELA:tdilc006.bloc    tdilc006.dsca    <br />
R<br />
:REFC:tdilc009.bloc    0 t1<br />
:REFC:tdilc104.bloc    0 t1<br />
:REFC:tdltc003.bloc    0 t1<br />
A<br />
:AUDT:tdilc006.bloc    tdilc006.dsca<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">28th July 2003, 20:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget, the REFC goes from the parent to child.<br />
<br />
The &quot;refc&quot;, stands for reference counters (as far as I know).  In your example:<br />
<br />
:RELE:6.1<br />
F<br />
:NAME:tdilc006.bloc<br />
OMA:tdilc.bloc<br />
F<br />
:NAME:tdilc006.dsca<br />
OMA:tcdsca<br />
F<br />
:NAME:tdilc006.Refcntd<br />
OMA:tdRefcnt<br />
F<br />
:NAME:tdilc006.Refcntu<br />
OMA:tdRefcnt<br />
I<br />
:IDNO:001<br />
:KEYF:tdilc006.bloc <br />
:ACTI:1<br />
L<br />
:RELA:tdilc006.bloc tdilc006.dsca <br />
R<br />
:REFC:tdilc009.bloc 0 t1<br />
:REFC:tdilc104.bloc 0 t1<br />
:REFC:tdltc003.bloc 0 t1<br />
<br />
The field tdilc006.bloc points to those three tables.  The &quot;t1&quot; and &quot;0&quot; have special meaning.  There are are few types inclidcating the reference mode and ref. control for delete etc.<br />
<br />
There are also REFA:, designations would point from the child to the parent reference tables.<br />
<br />
With the refc, you need to look at the child to figure out what field it is referencing.  In your example above, those three tables are all pointing to field tdilc006.bloc.   I believe in 99% of cases, this points to the primary unique key in the table.  I can't think of any examples off the top of my head where it points to anything else.</div></div><hr />

   Here are the definitions of REFC in the dd files(Baan IV).  The code is made up with 4 characters which are:<br />
<br />
1- Reference Mode<br />
     0: Mandatory<br />
     1: Mandatory unless empty<br />
     2: Not mandatory<br />
<br />
2- Update Mode<br />
     c: Child will be updated<br />
     n: Nullifies<br />
     r: Restricted (with counter)<br />
     t: Lookup (restricted)<br />
<br />
3- Delete Mode<br />
     c: Child will be deleted<br />
     n: Nullifies<br />
     r: Restricted (with counter)<br />
     t: Lookup (restricted)<br />
<br />
4- Check by DBMS<br />
     0: No<br />
     1: Yes<br />
<br />
for example, if you have:<br />
:REFC:tccom736.suno	1rt1<br />
<br />
It means that field tccom736.suno is mandatory unless empty, the update is restricted with counter, the delete is restricted with lookup and that the referential integrity is checked by the database server.<br />
