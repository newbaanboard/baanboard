<br />
is it right, that I can find every object / source which is installed by a SP or a solution, in the solution history ? Without any exception?<br />

<br />
If they're installed through PMC, they should be in the solution history. The ones installed before PMC won't be there, if you just recently installed PMC. They also won't be there if Baan Support people, for example, send you the latest object file for you to move into the correct directory and overwrite the old object.<br />
<br />
What happened? Did one of the solution you installed through PMC fail to show up in the solution history?<br />

<br />
as far as I know PMC is installed from the beginning. <br />
I would like to write a small program, which compares the dates from objects in the solution history, with the dates of equal filenames in custom vrc.<br />
<br />
Because I am not sure, if esp. objects / components wich are installed via service pack are listed in detail, I asked this question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">25th February 2003, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, also the Service Packs solutions will be printed (they are on PMC, just with a specific flag turned on that makes them &quot;within&quot; a Service Pack...)<br />
<br />
You can setup jobs to print the solution history per Update VRC and then use on your script something like this (for BaanIV, PMC v2, ksh and *not tested*):<br />
<br />
# $report is the PMC report<br />
# #custom is your customer VRC to have checked, eg., B40C_c4_own<br />
grep &quot;| Installed&quot; $report|sort -u|while read LINE<br />
do<br />
type=`echo $LINE|cut -f4 -d&quot;|&quot;`  # object type<br />
pack=`echo $LINE|cut -f5 -d&quot;|&quot;`  # package, eg., ti<br />
code=`echo $LINE|cut -f6 -d&quot;|&quot;`  # object name<br />
mod=`echo $object_code|cut -f1-3`  # module, eg, mrp<br />
case $object_type in<br />
&quot;Script/Library Source&quot;)<br />
obj_loc=$BSE/application/${pack}${custom}/p${pack}${mod}/p${code}<br />
if [ `ls $obj_loc|grep not found|wc -l` -eq 0 ] ; then<br />
# object found<br />
echo &quot;message of new object&quot;<br />
;; <br />
(continue build for the remaining objects)<br />
<br />
Note: for the tables and domains, the best way to check is to see thru qptool6.x if the same domain/table exists on your custom VRC to avoid overheads of unix scripting (and this also change in less extent, so you can afford a extra time more from using qptool6.x select statements :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
can I find the menthioned falg in ttpmc260 (table: Solution history) ? Sorry at the moment I doesn't find it<br />
<br />
:confused: <br />
<br />
Anyway, I thought I could write a prog which takes table ttpmc260 and compares that with the files in the cust VRC's. Prerequisite is, that realy every component is (also from SP's) can be found in this table.<br />
