<br />
I'm having an issue with my audits. When I list my milti-line audit report I have a column called &quot;Transaction&quot;, which gives me a sequential number from 1 to n. Sometimes the number restarts, and it's consistent with the sequence number change in session ttaad4560m000.<br />
<br />
The problem is that sometimes there are &quot;jumps&quot; between sequential numbers, so for example I have transactions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and then it jumps to 8, 9, 10, etc. I don't know what happened with transaction number 7. I have this issue specifically in table tdsls030.<br />
<br />
One additional thing is we have two application servers, each one logging audit transactions on their own.<br />
<br />
I hope you can help me, thanks<br />

<br />
Transaction Starts<br />
Get next sequence from list of audit sequences<br />
-- That step is irreversible, you cannot wait until you commit because if you have 2 simultaneous transactions you could have 2 equal transaction id's<br />
Update to table is made<br />
update to audit file is made<br />
&lt;&lt; Transaction fails &gt;&gt; <br />
Table is rolled back<br />
Audit file is rolled back<br />
