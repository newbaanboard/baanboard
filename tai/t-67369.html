<br />
ttstperrlog involves multiple log files. Each of them signifies something. They act as a guide to track errors and trouble shoot.<br />
<br />
e.g<br />
<br />
ttaad4100.sox gives you information about the GTM changes.<br />
log.tlpublishbod gives you troubleshooting data for BOD publishing.<br />
log.ttaad4225  gives you troubleshooting data for reorganize process.<br />
<br />
etc. <br />
<br />
To understand action=&quot;50&quot; or action=&quot;21&quot; etc, you can go to GTM , make some change like add record, copy record, modify record etc and check in the log what action is specified.<br />
<br />
The purpose behind the usage of these log files are two way-<br />
<br />
1. Troubleshooting Errors<br />
2. Technical Auditing.<br />
<br />
You need to study each of them individually to understand what they specify. Or you can open an Incident with Infor to understand them. <br />
<br />
Also, search on Board for the errors people face during reconfiguration and how they use log files to track them-<br />
<br />
Here are a few of them -<br />

Log files might change depending on the databases used as well and varies according to the different error logged.</div></div><hr />
