<br />
You can contact your mail server team to provide relay access to your LN server by allowing its IP Address. Once done, the issue will be resolved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it is giving you relay access denied when you are trying to send an email from outside your network to a domain that your server is not authoritative for then it means your receive connector does not grant you the permissions for sending/relaying. Most likely what you need to do is to authenticate to the server to be granted the permissions for relaying but that does depend upon the configuration of your receive connector. In Exchange 2007/2010/2013 you would need to enable ExchangeUsers permission group as well as an authentication mechanism such as Basic authentication.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps !!!!</div></div><hr />

This problem comes only in LNUI , but in BW email is sent . do you still think it is permission issue?</div></div><hr />
