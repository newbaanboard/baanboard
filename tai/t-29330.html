1. Why is the periodical job not getting executed for hour/day?<br />
2. How do i check whether the job deamon is running or not? infact how do i start the job deamon thru NT on the Server(for which i do not have any access)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
trying to remeber some years back, i think you can only controll the job deamon with the BaaN NT Manger, therefore you need access to the server.<br />
<br />
Only if the Deamon is running you can execute jobs.<br />
<br />
Another possiblity is to use the task manager on another server/computer to start jobs in periodical intervalls, but the job deamon has to run ! (Green light on BaaN NT Manager)<br />

<br />
I've created a Job in Baan and added a custom session.  There are only four fields on my form Project From/To and Warehouse From/To.  I can run this session manually and get output.  I'm running wide open blank-ZZZs for each range.  When I run my scheduled task on the Server the info to the left on the Scheduled Tasks window says last run time - it's updated and the Last result displays 0x1 - does this mean there was a problem?  I see another job that runs several times everyday say Last result 0x0.  Also - in Baan the job does not show having been run.<br />
<br />
Also - I've checked the data in ttaad503 and my criteria is correct, shows blank - ZZZs for each field.  however, if I just run my .bat file and you can see Baan startup and the session pops up the Warehouse range is blank-blank.  I can then go into Baan the Job data shows the job ran and in Display Job History I get No Data in Selection errors.  <br />
<br />
What am I missing??<br />
<br />
Thanks - Nikki</div></div><hr />

<br />
in which company are the jobs registered (e.g. 000 and the data is in 100)?.<br />
<br />
Please check the company number on mask 2 in session ttaad5101m000.<br />
<br />
You can check the job settings with ttaad5401m000 including &quot;Print data&quot; option.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Also - the range for the Warehouse is blank - ZZZ according to the Print Sessions by Job session.<br />
<br />
I got the job to run through the Windows Scheduler and the Last Result display 0x0 now.  I had a typo in the bat file name it was calling...<br />
<br />
I'm still getting No Data within selection though.<br />
<br />
ugh.</div></div><hr />
