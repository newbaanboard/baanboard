<br />
We use notepad for text, however it won't work on these pc's.  The notepad program will not open.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this is a PC issue not Baan, but wonder if anyone has run into this.  <br />

<br />
I would like to inform you regarding case number 2013233 that is now on<br />
status In Process.<br />
<br />
I did find something else<br />
Can you check this on your system?  <br />
<br />
Problem<br />
When a user tries to access text from any session, instead of pulling up Notepad, nothing happens. This started happening when his desktop operatingsystem was upgraded to Windows XP Professional. It looks like Baan can't find the Notepad executable.<br />
<br />
Sol<br />
We fixed it.  Our PC tech figured out that with XP, he had to explicitlygrant modify permissions for the user to the Baan folder containing the executable.  <br />
Thanks for trying to fix this.  You may want to include this in the<br />
knowledge base for any future customers that run across this problem using XP.  Please close the case.</div></div><hr />
