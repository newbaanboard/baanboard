Several changes have been made as well as patches on the production server.<br />
<br />
ttiex1280 (Export Data Dictionary) can be used, but you have to do packages seperate and also status's seperate.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />

<br />
You can ask your system administrators and DBA's to make clones of the file-system and the database from Production to your Test Server. <br />
<br />
Then change the system settings where the hostnames used like $BSE/lib/tabledef6.2 or Remote user data info etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would be a great alternative, however, I do not know all places these 'unique' names (i.e. hostname) need changed.<br />
Any help with this?<br />
<br />
I am UNIX, AIX and BaaN administrator.  There is noone else here to help with this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
simply create a similar $BSE directory on the test machine.<br />
Copy the complete $BSE (using tar or cpio) from the &quot;real&quot; machine to the test one.<br />
If your tables are not sooo big, you might even try to use tbase as &quot;RDBMS&quot;. If you want to use oracle, build instances with the same names. (often it makes sense to use tbase instead, as test systems often are too small/weak to have a real RDBMS running on them)<br />
Make sure that the user tbase and bsp and the group bsp have the same id-numbers (this will help to get the permissions right by simply extracting your tar/cpio archive)<br />
If you switch to tbase, change the $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1. (change oracle to bisam).<br />
Set $BSE, $PATH and $BSE_TMP correctly, run binperm6.1 once.<br />
Try to bring up Baan $BSE/etc/rc.start.<br />
<br />
Now create a dump of the company 000 on your real machine and bdbpre it onto the test one.<br />
Then do the same with the other companies.<br />
There always is one problem or two, but keep in mind:<br />
it is only a test system, so keep cool<br />
The only file that I can think of right now that has to be changed for sure is $BSE/lib/licence6.1. Simply fill in your real system's ip or host name (then it has to be in /etc/hosts). Now the &quot;real&quot; system will act as licence server for the test one. <br />
<br />
feel free to ask more questions as you go along, but this way is pretty cool and always preferred to a new installation (not even talking about the endless SP- and solutions-installs and SW-ex/im-ports).<br />
<br />
good luck<br />
<br />

<br />
1. Export the 000 company and take the 'tar' backup of $BSE folder (and may be $BSE/../dict) <br />
2. Restore this tar file on test server, upload the 000 company dump<br />
3. If the test environment is on another server and you want it to use the Production Server license to it, modify license6.x file.<br />
4. some files like ora_storage etc need to be changed.<br />

<br />
First of all, you need to distinguish between your objects and your data.<br />
As for your data, you need to distinguish between meta-data and working data.<br />
<br />
To sync objects between servers, you need to migrate the objects plus the meta-data that describes the objects.<br />
<br />
In Baan that means, copying the application and the dict directory (objects and data dictionary) plus copying company 000 (meta-data).<br />
<br />
To copy data between servers, &quot;all&quot; you have to do is copy the company you are interested in. This can only be done on a database level, either by assuring that your company number is the same on the test box, or by creating an extensive script to change all tablenumbers while importing into the test database.<br />
In the second case, you also have to perform your version of tfgld9000 to make sure that the company number in the Baan data matches that of the tablespace.<br />
Because lazyness got me into this business, I prefer the first method.</div></div><hr />
