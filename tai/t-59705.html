I not familiar with BaaN administration but, I have a question to answer.<br />
<br />
How could I know what additional permission a user needs for sub-sessions after we grant him permissions for a particular main session(i.e. Release Outbound). Is there a way to know this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

... by going to the session and try all the zoom sessions which you can zoom to from your session (from menu and fields)....<br />
I know no other way.<br />

idea 1: Use DEM. In ERP LN there is session Application by Component (tgbrg5115m000) and it's possible to generate Sub-apps, i.e. all subsessions. All components are collected in 1 list, so steps to do depend on situation. <br />
<br />
Idea 2: use &quot;Print where used session&quot; session (ttadv2410m000) whith following conditions:<br />
package &quot;  &quot; - &quot;zz&quot;<br />
session &quot;       &quot; - &quot;zzzzzzzzz&quot;<br />
your PC<br />
specify forms and script of session you need (remove check boxes for menus and functions).<br />
leave only 1 check box in the bottom (print session where used).<br />
<br />
1-st way is preferable, but I do not remember how it works in Baan4 (maybe someone else can help), 2-nd one has some limitation - it will not catch situations like &lt;filed - menu - session&gt; (You may use session &quot;print where use menu&quot; to find out list of menus called from your session and to bypass this problem) and it works only for 1 level whereas generation of Sub-apps looks for ALL subsessions (sub, sub-sub,.....).<br />
<br />
If session is not very complex way offerd by lakoon could be more reasonable.</div></div><hr />

What I did, not the nicest but worked...I created a user with only access to that session (Release Outbound) in a test company and ran the session. I was more concerned to calls like zoom.to$(... within the main session.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
