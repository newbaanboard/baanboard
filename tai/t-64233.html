<br />
I found the run program option to directly start session by codes. We are using BAAN IV 4c and I asked our IT for access but they mentioned that this would enable me to run session if I know their codes and bypass the authorization limitations.<br />
<br />
Now I am wondering if there is any way how to keep authorization limitations still active to prevent user to run specific sessions without completely disabling the &quot;run program&quot; functionality.<br />
<br />
I am thankful for any help.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Levlex</div></div><hr />

That can be handled however your it department has probably a lot more to specify in detail which sessions you are allowed to run or not. They are right that enableing it is a security risk.<br />
<br />
Maybe start using worktop is a workaround? Within worktop you can specify groups and shortcuts to sessions meaning you have a lot less to click in order to start the right session.<br />

I got in touch with our IT guys and asked about worktop. So if I understand it correct worktop is another gui for BAAN that lets the user take control of a favorite menu etc. right?</div></div><hr />

That was an issue - but I also found it hard to believe than an employee would just guess on run program to hit a session.  Anyway, log story short, we created our own run program that checks only for sessions on the DEM flow directly - then runs it.  So for example - if the DEM created access to tisfc0101m000, but it was not on one of the DEM flows you cannot run program.<br />
<br />
As far as I know if you are not using DEM flows you still need permissions to the session to use run program.</div></div><hr />
