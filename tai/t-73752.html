<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">afaglia</div><div class="date">25th February 2021, 17:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to import records into the TTTAAD231000 table to massively deny access to sessions for specific accounts. I am using a schema exchange. I apply the convert to the affected users. Unfortunately this is not working and the user can open the listed sessions. If I insert the record with the session ttaad213m000 and I apply the convert it is working: the access to the session is denied. The record entry in the TTTAAD231000 tables is exactly the same, but it's clear that the original session is doing something else. Has anybody ever tried to achieve this? what am I missing?</div></div><hr />

The production or normal company or company 000.  I recall something from 15-20 years ago when our admin had to login into company 000 before some kind of load would work.  I can't remember the details or what the load was.  My guess is for some reason the convert to runtime is not working and that I do not recall what our admin used to do to force a convert to runtime when no changes were made.</div></div><hr />
