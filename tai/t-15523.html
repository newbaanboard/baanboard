We want to update our development server with the data from the production server, but, we only wnat data from the past 2 years. Is this possible (data integrety issues?)<br />
If so, how - sequential dump, backup tape??<br />

Anyway, If you want only two years latest data, I don't think you can use sequential backup because bdbpost.exe is a standard static program dipolyed with porting set which will not allowed you to specify from..to..to dates. But somebody made incremental backup program, for that do search here.<br />
<br />
Your profile shows you are using Oracle, so I will suggest to perform &quot;Time- based incomplete media recovery&quot;. Incomplete media recovery produces a version of the database as it was at some time in the past. Incomplete media recovery must either continue on to become a complete media recovery, or be terminated by an open resetlogs operation that creates a new incarnation of the database. The database must be closed for incomplete media recovery operations. But your database should be on Archive mode.<br />
