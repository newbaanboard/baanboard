<br />
How do I set up a device in Baan to use BLAT as an email client?  I have a batch file which contains all the parameters for blat.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

If on LN, you can use the CMF functionality provided by Baan. It has all the functions to enable you to send the mails with all the required configurations.<br />
<br />
Refer this : - CMF (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_emessage_connector_overview)<br />
<br />
Else, if you still want to use BLAT, you can write a 3GL script which will run the blat commands on the server with the required parameters. And then you can attach the script to your session from where you want to send the mails.<br />
<br />
Following things are required:-<br />
<br />
1. Blat utility on Client/Server<br />
2. smtp server with relay authentication if there is any<br />
<br />
Just install blat using following command:-<br />
<br />
blat -install smtp_server_address email_address<br />
<br />
To send mails :-<br />
<br />
blat c:\test.txt -to recipient_mail -subject &quot;Hel<br />
lo&quot; -server smtp_server_address -ti 10 -log C:\blat.log -u your_email -pw<br />
your_pass<br />
<br />
The above will send a test.txt file to the recipent. If any error occurs, they will be logged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">23rd July 2013, 06:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so far so good: I have been able to send emails with the generated Baan report attached.  However, the email recipient as well as the subject line is hard coded in the batch file.  If I wanted to use the new blat device for several notification reports then it would be nice if not important to change the subject line accordingly.  Any ideas here?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you can do is, create the bat file at the run time. i.e. When you are printing some report or sending some notification, you can create the bat file using seq.* functions and then simple run the bat file using run.prog command. In this way, you can change the subject line and the recipients at the run time either by passing the parameters or by hard coding based on some conditions.<br />
<br />
I guess you are trying to send the mails from the server side, so this is the method you can use. I use, SQL Mail to do this.</div></div><hr />
