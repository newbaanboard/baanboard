<br />
we have X 236 dual xeon 3.0 and 3GB memory<br />
and baan version is Baan c4 in5 sp18<br />
<br />
we have started the session ttaad4225m000 for the package 'tf'<br />
and all tables for a single company at 9.00 pm on 13-05-07<br />
and selected 'Data and indices' option.<br />
<br />
The session is still running (now - 11.00 am 14-05-07).<br />
<br />
Can anybody know that how much time it takes to complete for a single<br />
package. Also is there any method to find out, on which table it is<br />
indexing now. the cursor is just busy for last so many hours<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

The TF module can take a long time, because there are several tables with very many and long records . Such as tfgld106 with 8 indexes, or the range of tfgld4.. with its indexes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can we kill this session so that we can continue working in BaaN. If we kill the session, will it create any problem? <br />
<br />

Which table do you see?<br />
Also you can take a look into Oracle and see if the process is rebuilding the indexes again of this table. Pls. ask your database admin.</div></div><hr />

Venu,<br />
You have to be clear on why are you executing that session? What are you trying to solve?<br />
<br />
The time estimates depends on the datasize in the TF tables for that give company and also the System Configuration, Load etc.<br />
<br />
You can use the RDS_FULL and other database driver settings to improve the speed. Refer to the database driver manual or use the search option on the forum here for more information on its usage.</div></div><hr />
