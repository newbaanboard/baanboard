<br />
I assume , you request is as follows:<br />
<br />
1.Everyone can have &quot;print item data&quot; which shall print only certain items , excludes restricted items<br />
2. Whereas those Restricted Item codes  can also be printed along with other items in Some assigned logins using same session.<br />
<br />
where field is common but only data that matters , is that so ?<br />
<br />
Then &quot;Table field data authorization&quot; might not help much.<br />
<br />
try following :<br />
<br />
1.Approach PSO and get it done from INFOR.<br />
2.you could try to extend baan code using Qkey.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">17th February 2011, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh. I meant ttams3145m000 (Table Data Authorization).<br />
We have implemented it to hide employee addresses from normal users (other than in the staff department).<br />
The hidden addresses don't show on the program nor do they get printed.<br />
The normal user doesn't even guess that there are more addresses.<br />
So the role that's given to every user is &quot;Not Authorized&quot; for the table tccom130 in case the addresscode meets a certain condition.<br />
<br />
Another role can be given to the folks of the HR department.<br />
They have the authorization &quot;Delete/insert/modify/read&quot; for every addresscode (&quot;&quot; to &quot;ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ&quot;).<br />
<br />
If you can limit the items to a few conditional expressions, you can use this method.<br />
But do NOT use several conditions like<br />
<br />
<br />
 item equals 0815 and<br />
 item equals 0816 and<br />
 item equals 0817 and<br />
 item equals 0818 and<br />
 .<br />
 .<br />
 .<br />
 item equals 9999 end of expression<br />
<br />
<br />
Than it makes no sense because you cannot foresee the length of the list in the future.<br />
Try to have a system with the item codes e.g. to hide the items that start with &quot;321&quot; or &quot;H&quot; ( for hidden ;-) ) or all items between &quot;500&quot; and &quot;699ZZZZ...&quot;. Just one or two conditions. That should be enough.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps... ;)</div></div><hr />
