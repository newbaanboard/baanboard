<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cvertz</div><div class="date">1st October 2002, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All<br />
We have around 18 + million rows in tfgld410.  It has been suggested that I write a script to dump rows from tfgld410 to an ASCII file based on a year parameter.  We would then delete the pulled rows and access them outside of baan if we needed.  I am wondering if this is a good plan?<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

I have not had a chance to review the script so am not sure what he is doing.  He is also looking into doing the same thing with tfgld106</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must have slightly different requirements.<br />
<br />
Good luck with it.<br />

I've never seen that gain more than 4% - we're on a 40mln records tablesize now.<br />
<br />
We're also archiving using this 4210 session. Backdraw is that it will only archive those lines (gld410 thru 419!!!) that have no relationship to an existing ordernumber.<br />
<br />
Thus it will archive the warehouse transactions as there is no table storing warehouse transaction orders. But it will only archive production, purchase, commisions, sales, ... transactions if the related order has also been archived.<br />
<br />
The first time we could delete integration transactions (from the archive-company), I wrote an PL/SQL (Oracle dbms) to do the job. <br />
<br />
But for archiving (i.e. writing to the archive-company) we use the gld4210 session.</div></div><hr />

If you delete records for an open project, project COGS (Cost of goods sold) will be wrong<br />

<br />
   I have used tfgld4210m000 - Archive and Purge Integration Transactions, however when I go the the display sessionsto view these integrations transactions , I can't see them.Any suggestion?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you Archive or Purge?<br />
If you Archived, are you looking in the right company?<br />
If you Purged, obviously you won't find them again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">29th May 2003, 03:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
      I Archived the transcations. Is there any significance of this field - Copy to History Company(Is it the same as the archive company?) I tried to change it to my Archive Comapny but I couldn't do it. How about the Compressing of Data? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">29th May 2003, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">If you could not enter the archive company number (yes that's the same as the history company) you did not set up your archive company properly.<br />
<br />
If you did / could not enter an archive company number, you probably did not archive but purge only ... but I assume that you test this first before exposing your live data to new functions.<br />
<br />
Compression works for some integration types only, compressing multiple Cost Component Codes to a single (parameterized) one. The effect I know is a compression of about 5%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">1st July 2003, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">To view/print archived finance transactions in the various print/display sessions in the archive company, it's necessary to have an entry for the original company number in tccom000 of the archive company. For some finance sessions it's also necessary to have an entry for the original company number in tfgld001 (Financial Companies by Group Company) in the archive company. <br />
<br />
Although the discussion above is quite old and might not be interesting for the original posters anymore, I'd like to add a few remarks:<br />
<br />
Financial Integration transactions are needed for reconcilliation of various logistic data and should not be archived or deleted before the logistic data that it relates to, has the proper status (purchase order invoices approved, sales orders invoiced). The transaction date of a integration record might be old, but it might belong for example to a sales order for which installments still have to be invoiced. In that case it will still be needed. The date of the transaction doesn't necessarily mean that it can be archived. <br />
<br />
I would be very carefull, before removing something with a self-made script. If BaanIV archive sessions are used, most of the necessary checks are made (in Baan V, some improvements are still needed). <br />
<br />
But even before archiving with Baan sessions, I always analyze where the tables which are going to be archived or deleted are used, to prevent bad surprises. That can be done with session ttadv4430m000 &quot;Print where used table&quot;. (It's somewhat cumbersome though, I've written a program that analyzes the tables to be archived/deleted in one run). Tables might also be needed in non-standard add-on sessions.<br />
<br />
The output should be reviewed by someone with very good functional knowledge and given to key users with the necessary explanations, so that they can make informed decisions about the archive strategy. <br />
<br />
If archive companies are set up by year, it is possible to take archived data of the system by year and it's not necessary to &quot;archive data from the archive company&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">2nd July 2003, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">cvertz, isn't disk space a lot cheaper than trying to fiddle with gld410/gld106 - I've seen an it manager get the chop for allowing a fiddle with gld106 that resulted in data loss and of course the backup didn't work... <br />
<br />
Maybe look at your costing setup, the number of cost price components may be excessive! Remember for every transaction (stock movement) baan posts the entries by cost price component: example 10 cost price components for a manufactured item with one production receipt = 10 lines in gld410.<br />
<br />
Regards oh - and good luck,<br />
