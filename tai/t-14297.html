<br />
A few days ago, we had 26416400 blocks on 1 volume (tape), <br />
today we have 25246500 blocks on 1 volume (tape).<br />
<br />
(there was intensiv work this days, in financial department, on batches ... )<br />
<br />
Question: Is this normal situation?<br />
                 Is there temporary tables in financial package with<br />
                data dissapears after some actions?<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
We are backing up /company /baan and all subdirectories ...</div></div><hr />

- tables have been reorganised<br />
- a (temp) file/ directory (e.g. a portingset) has been removed<br />
- (old) log files have been removed<br />
- $BSE/tmp has been cleaned<br />
<br />
I assume that lots of people can/ will continue<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
Is there temporary tables in financial package (or any other) with<br />
data that dissapears after some actions?<br />

<br />
What I'd like to know is, why did you jump to the temporary table question? Are you seeing problems? <br />

In backup skript I have some lines to clear Baan temporary files older than ... some days, and didn't notice this big size changing on backup.<br />
<br />
So I wanted to find another reason for this.<br />
(Thanks to Dikkie Dik)<br />
 <br />
What I wanted is what Mbdagla said.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all</div></div><hr />
