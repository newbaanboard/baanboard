<br />
I have created a group say X using ottstpmirror. I can also enter into the group. I get the message SRINIVAS added to group X. But how can I activate bshells at user terminals with mirror tool. How to proceed further?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

Then login as a different user from another system and run mirror6.1 X where X is the group name. You will be prompted for  Name and so you will be able to join the group. I am stuck up here at this position<br />

I cannot uncompress the file, always sends me an error without decompress it, maybe somebody else has more luck with the quick guide...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used it for onsite training courses before when a projector for my screen was not available.  It can be difficult to use, and timing seemed to be the problem.  The instructor needs to start first and get the group.  Then the others will sign in.  I also believe that there was a needed priv. or auth. to get into a group.  The other limitation is that it was only working for ascii (ba6.1).  Sorry, it's been awhile since I have used it.  It took several attempts at writing down the proper sequence of events to get it working properly.</div></div><hr />
