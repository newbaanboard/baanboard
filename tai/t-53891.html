I tried ttaad4130m000, 4131 &amp; 4132. Convert runtime, also check $BSE/user to make sure the runtime object is up to date. But still, the user account I created have read/write access.<br />
<br />
There are some read-only user accounts created by ex-admin that works. Did I missed any steps?</div></div><hr />

     If you want the particular user to have only read-only permission to all the sessions he has in his Menu, then setting it at the ttaad4130m000 level would suffice. Make sure the right company and permission (&quot;Read&quot;) is selected when you set the authorizations in the above session. Apart from that, when you run session Convert User Data to Runtime Data Dictionary {ttaad4200m000}, enable the checkbox named &quot;Session and Database Authorization&quot;.<br />

I did exactly like what you have mentioned before I posted to the board.<br />
Well, a colleague of mine found the issue. Our database server is in a seperate machine, and apparently after copying the runtime object of the user from $BSE/lib/user in the application server to the same directory in the database server, it works fine. <br />
<br />
I thought I would like to share this for the benefit of all.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your fast response.<br />
