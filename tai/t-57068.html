Hello,<br />
if adding the remote printers via SAM you don't need to stop and start the spooler if your're sure that nobody prints at this time, SAM does this by itself (Message Warning, the spooler will .......).<br />
<br />
The steps are right.<br />
<br />
1. Add IP in /etc/hosts (Not always needed, if UX-Host and printer are in same subnet, and ....), try with ping !<br />
2. Stop spooler (if needed)<br />
3. SAM -&gt; printers and plotters .... -&gt; Add remote printer<br />
(if spooler is running, SAM restarts the spooler)<br />
4. Start spooler (if needed)<br />
5. Continue with BaaN settings<br />
<br />
But ther are many ways directing to Rome ;-)<br />
