<br />
When installing the DFE8.6.b7 client it creates a file named dfe.exe<br />
However when I try to open the DFE through the bw client 8.6a.02.6, it's still looking at the file dynfrmed.exe.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know where the &quot;dynfrmed.exe&quot; is hardcoded and how it's possible to change it ? Is it a bw client related issue ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your profile indicates you are Baan-5c? maybe your Porting Set and Tools 4-GL layer is not compatible against this BW, DFE version. Check the Porting Set release notes for the support versions.<br />

The call is inside the Tools session's code, you cannot change it.</div></div><hr />
