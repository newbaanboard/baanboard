<br />
We are in the process of deleting some components which we dont need from the development VRC. The components can be any of the Sessions, Program Scripts, Forms etc ( All Software Components).<br />
<br />
I cant use the traditional delete component since it asks for a range, I cant do it manually since the components can be more than 500.<br />
<br />
Please suggest or send a solution.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

However I'm not sure if it is possible to use AFS on tools sessions.  An other option is creating a script that deletes the records involved directly from the tools tables and that deletes the objects on os level,  in this case you need to be very sure what you're doing!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Yes that is possible. <br />
Make sure you have the latest patches for ttadv6250m000. In our versions, it would not remove a component which is currently checked-out. We got a enhancement request, which was fixed in recent version it generates a output report. You would also need the correct Package VRC authorization etc to make it work properly. <br />
<br />
Also be careful who can run this utility, they can wipe out some/all components  :(</div></div><hr />
