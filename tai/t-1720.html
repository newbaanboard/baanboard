<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nizamudeen</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 11:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We are having BaaN IVC4 running on HP Unix 11.0 under Oracle 8i Database. We have developed lot of  reports using Oracle Report writer 6.0. We have installed Oracle runtime files of reports and forms on the User PC's and users are accessing these report directly from the Oracle database<br />
 <br />
Now the question is, can we call these .exe files through baan sessions so that users need not to switch systems to access these reports<br />
<br />
Can any one shed light on this ?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

OR You can create a Baan session to call this script using shell function if at server or app.start() if at client.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 21:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Oracle Developer is available for a number of platforms including HP. You could license another copy of Developer for the HP and port the reports over to run under Developer on the HP. Then you could run them from your Baan shell command. We have done this before when we had both an SGI (UNIX) server and PC's (Windows) and had licensed versions of Developer for both. You can create applications on either, and then port the application to the other with little change required to get it running under the new environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Syntax<br />
<br />
long app_start( string commandline, string directory, string stdin, string stdout, string stderr )<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
This starts the application specified in the commandline argument. It returns an ID for the started application. You can subsequently use this ID as the app.id argument in the app_status() function.<br />
<br />
Arguments<br />
<br />
commandline	This specifies the command that starts the application. If commandline does not include a directory path, Windows searches for the executable file in the following directories, in the order shown below:1	The directory where BW is loaded.2	The Windows system directory.3	The Windows directory.4	The directories listed in the PATH environment variable.<br />
directory	The default working directory for the application.<br />
stdin	The standard input file name.<br />
stdout	The standard output file name.<br />
stderr	The standard error file name.<br />
Notes<br />
<br />
If commandline specifies the name of a nonexecutable file, Windows starts the application with which the file name extension is associated. For example, if commandline is c:\temp\file.txt, and .txt is associated with the Notepad application, Windows will start Notepad. Because users can change the association of a file name extension, you cannot predict which application will start.<br />
This functionality is not available when you specify standard input, output, and error files.<br />
<br />
Return values<br />
<br />
&gt;=0	success; identification number of the started application is returned<br />
  &lt;0	error (that is, the negative value of the system error)<br />
<br />
Context<br />
<br />
ttdllbw library function.<br />
