<br />
Just today I upgraded Baan4a from 6.1b.03.03 port set to 6.1c.07.  Once I was completed I logged in using bx6.1 ( X interface ) but I cannot type anything into Baan.  The only thing that works was the mouse and the tab key.<br />
<br />
This is using WRQ ReflectionX and the server is HP-UX 11.11.<br />
I also tried using an actual X-term but the same results.<br />
<br />
I tried to use BW.exe and it works - the only problem is that we don't use BW.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on where to look or what to try would be greatly appreciated.  I did get an error on kcho domain running running session ttadv4571m000 ask_enum domain 'ttadv.kcho' is wrong.  This happens only moving to the last record / last group.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philpom</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">:D I looked on the Baan support page but under &quot;keyboard&quot; or &quot;keyboard stopped working&quot; I could only find 2 possible solutions.  One was a dump for adv475 this was to fix an error with &quot;ask_enum domain 'ttadv.kcho' is wrong.  The dump didn't seem to work although I am still working on it.  The other was regarding keyboard shortcuts and dtopt3 file.  It is not just our &quot;quick keys&quot; but every key.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philpom</div><div class="date">31st July 2003, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">The fix for the keyboard not working is to download and install the bx6.1 binary from 6.1c.06.05.  I tested it and it works great.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
6.1c.07 port set works fine using bx6.1 version 6.1c.06.05<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
