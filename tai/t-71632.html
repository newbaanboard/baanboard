<br />
I was just wandering if there is any way to create an Excel device that open pipe separated (Baan Standard reports) reports directly in Excel (Automatically separated whenever it encounters Pipe)?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Probably more complicated that what you are looking for.  But basically we have a table that we give it a report name and tell it where to download the file to and which macro to run to import the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">17th January 2019, 08:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We did change the standard delimiter in Windows to pipe, which did the trick. The Excel printer setup is the one given in examples of Infor.<br />

Thanks for the guidance. My concern is how can we make this change to all the Ln clients? As it is cumbersome and may create  issues in users's day to day working as they are so used to comma as separator.<br />
<br />
I tried to search if we can pass the delimiter as command line argument in start.application.local, it would solve all issues. But could not find any solution.<br />
<br />
If anybody comes across how can we pass a delimiter while calling Excel and passing the text file, that would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Now all of customers at all the sites we support have a common directory where we just launch a macro from that does the conversion for them.  And each site can have a different macro to get the same report in a different format.  Not elegant - but it did what the customer wanted.</div></div><hr />
