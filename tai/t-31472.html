<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SOXAuditor</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 23:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to understand what is Authorization Management System (ttams) module which was added in Baan 5 and how it relates to user security. For example I see that there is a new set of fields in the tttaad200000 table:<br />
<br />
t_crol_2	t_crol_3	t_crol_4	t_crol_5	t_crol_6<br />
<br />
that lists &quot;roles&quot; that are assigned to users and it looks like these roles are defined in the tttams200000 table.<br />
<br />
How do these link or further restrict the t_role assigned to users in the ttgbrg820xxx tables. DemFlows are used at this instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">17th February 2007, 01:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The ones in ttaad200 and ttams tables are related to session authorizations. The ones in tgbrg are related to DEM roles.<br />
<br />
One tells you what sessions you can execute while the other one determines which sessions you'll see in your menu or dem flowchart. <br />
<br />
It does make sense that they match and they are called the same to simplify user administration. However technically they could be completely different. Maybe some one more experienced with DEM can confirm this but there might even be a way to generate authorization roles based on DEM roles.<br />
<br />
This is just a thought: Maybe it'll help if you try to understand this from the application perspective before going down to the table level.</div></div><hr />

So which tables do I need to look at in order for me to see what sessions a user has access to if the are restricted by some role in AMS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">2nd March 2007, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I am inclined to say if you had access to the session, ttams2400m000 it is easier to interpret the authorization settings and gather all the information than trying to interpret the authorization set for user (if they are linked to multiple roles or if they are company-based or package, module based settings etc).</div></div><hr />
