<br />
I don't have any idea if this is the right place to post my thread. I'm facing the following problem: <br />
One Company is working with Baan IV c4 ags0 (automotive) and an other one is working with Baan IV c3 scc1 (Supply Chain). <br />
<br />
the first one is working with the standard Baan EDI BEMIS by use of Seeburger. The last one is working with Odex from OMS, a non - integrated Baan EDI system.<br />
<br />
Both companies belong to the same holding and for a future project they need to cooperate. The Odex company is not ready to accept EDI coming from the new customer or to communicate with the BEMIS company. The adjustments needed will lead towards a budget that is way to high because both companies will be placed on one server in the future. <br />
<br />
As there is an urgent need for a solution now (project starts in 6 weeks) I wonder if the BEMIS file defaults.edi from the c4 environment can be copied towards the c3 evironment easily, so that this will be the quick solution untill both companies end up on one server.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone who can tell me:<br />
<br />
If this is possible at all<br />
what is to be done to accomplish this<br />
if there are advantages/disadvantages<br />
if there are things to think about<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
thanks for any helpfull reaction...<br />
<br />
Kris</div></div><hr />
