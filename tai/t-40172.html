<br />
I completed a new report session and as usual I tried to add it to an existing job; except that this time I had an issue. I launch the session and under tools I select option &quot;Make a Job&quot; and rather than having the ttaad5102s000 showing to chose the job I want to place my session; everything disappears.<br />
<br />
It's the first time I have this problem. I tried to log off and log on again but it doesn't correct the problem. I tried to place another session in the job and it worked fine. So, the issue is with only this session.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what could be the reason?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />

Anything in the log files ?<br />

I am sorry, but I don't see what Log file you meant. I tracked under baan server every file with ttaad5102s000 and my login but didn't find anything that could help. Could you be more specific?<br />
<br />
I have to mention that I run profiling on the program script not because I need it but just by curiosity and I am not sure that this could be the cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th August 2007, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Neal meant to look to see if any of the log files got any message from trying this.  In this case I would turn off profiling and try it again. I would not think profiling would cause an issue, but it could be the problem.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
is &quot;JOB&quot; enabled / valid for this session ?<br />
<br />
OR is somethin programmed in &quot;choice.run.job&quot; ?<br />
<br />

I thought every session can be added to the job, if it has &quot;Make a Job&quot; session available in header toolbar...:confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<br />
I think what bdittmar meant is if the option &quot;make job&quot; in Maintain Form Standard Option is disabled. Open your session then go to Maintain Forms and click on Standard Options and it is option 24.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nad2006</div><div class="date">13th August 2007, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your suggestions guys. I found finally the problem and it's about programming. Actually, I need for some purpose to set the job. process variable to true to simulate a section of my script that should run only when in Job manager. Now I put it in comment and I can place my session in the job. <br />
<br />
Thanks again and have a nice week.</div></div><hr />
