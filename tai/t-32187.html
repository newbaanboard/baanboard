<br />
sort -r -t: +1 -2 +0 -1 +2 -3 inf_storage &gt; [sorted inf_storage file]<br />
<br />
I think it'll work but just wanted another dozen sets of eyes on it :D <br />
<br />
Besides since I could not find threads talking about it I thought maybe someone else would find it helpful.<br />
<br />
Your opinions will be welcomed.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
if your inf_storage is so long, that it requires automatic sorting, then you should consider to restructure your setup.<br />
<br />
A very long inf_storage has a negative impact on performance. When the bshell starts it wil read the inf_storage only once into an internal array. But for each table access it has to consult it and look up the corresponding settings.<br />

<br />
It is advised to store the inf_storage file only on one server, from where table creation and deletion activities are taking place, since this file will get loaded in shared memory and it will occupy a lot of memory.<br />

<br />
1 - Sort it however you like, but your &quot;catch-all&quot; entries need to be at the bottom of the file.<br />
<br />
2 - everyone should have large x_storage and small x_storage2 files.<br />
<br />
x_storage2 is loaded into bshell memory and should be 2 lines (based on what your driver parameter manual says). <br />

Like often, I can only agree to everything Dave says. Just a small addition: The storage2 concept was added some time ago with the upgrade of the porting set. So if you run some anciant 6.1c.04 or older Portingset, you might not have that feature.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, enough Baan users do.<br />

Thank you all for the comments.</div></div><hr />
