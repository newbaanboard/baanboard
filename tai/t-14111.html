We have started replacing our (small but large distances) Frame network with an AHDSL network.   This is working very well so far.<br />
<br />
We also have some casual access to Baan using our general ADSL internet connection.  I personall access the system for support purposes via my cable internet connection through the ADSL using CISCO VPN hardware and software.  This works fine.  Response time is ggod.  <br />

I am looking to connect our office in Brazil back to the US. How many concurrent users do you have in a small office accessing Baan?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our WAN network extends to a branch office and distribution warehouses in all state-capital cities in mainland Australia. Geographically this covers a faily large area (3 million sq miles).  <br />
<br />
However, the number of users at each of these remote sites is faily small -- ranging from 2 to 10 (plus several network printers.)   At our main office and 50 acre factory site we have another 70 or so concurrent users who are connected via fibre-optic LAN. <br />
