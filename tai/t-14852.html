<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmbarr</div><div class="date">19th March 2004, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I encountered a problem un-installing solutions with post requisites.  Baan support provided an additional solution 142227 now available on the support site.  Otherwise, it was easy to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janneman</div><div class="date">3rd April 2004, 01:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Answer to question Ã¤re they helpfull?&quot; Yes, it is. It will prevent missing software components for related solution that influence each other.<br />
Without PMC thios was happening often resulting in fatal errors and strange software behaviour.<br />
Disadvantage is that sometimes a lot of solutions will be installed and need to be tested and/or customized before uploading in live environment. <br />
I guess both questons are answered now.</div></div><hr />

In the past you needed to have done pre-requisite actions but PMC did not tell you what to do.</div></div><hr />
