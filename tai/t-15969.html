<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amac14</div><div class="date">13th July 2004, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having a problem installing Baan 5c on AIX with DB2.  During the process where you select what software you want to install, I select the B50c (standard), the 7.1 (tools), the da2.0a and the tm2.0a, and NO to the B50L_c_bgl0.<br />
<br />
After I run the install through the BW client, I login to Baan and I see that the VRC's that have been created include B50L_c_bgl0, even though I indicated &quot;NO&quot; during the install setup.  <br />
<br />
When I check the log files, it indicates that the VRC sp02 will be created for tc, td, tf etc, but it is not, those packages have the localization bgl0.<br />
<br />
I have run this numerous times with the same results, does anyone have any idea what is wrong?  And I have contacted SSA Support and they are just as confused as me.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
