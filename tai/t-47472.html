  <br />
I want to put permission of sessions for a company.  <br />
  <br />
I am making the following thing:  <br />
  <br />
1. Create ROLE  <br />
2. Assign as sub-role default + fulldb + fullsess  <br />
3. Create property ROLE in ttams3133m000 (Permission of session by company)  <br />
	Put on total permission for company 630  <br />
	Put on without permission for company 631  <br />
  <br />
I expect that when I change to company 631 BaaN doesn't allow to execute anything, but I don't get it.  <br />
  <br />
What am I making bad?  <br />
  <br />
Any ideas????  <br />
  <br />
Greetings</div></div><hr />

<br />
Session authorizations<br />
The session authorizations define which sessions the users can start and what the users can do with these sessions  in ERP LN. You can specify the session authorizations and on several levels for either a specific company or for all companies. For example, you can give the users authorizations for only specified sessions in a module or only the sessions in a specified package. The session authorization priorities in the following table show that the session authorization with the highest priority (1) is stated at the most specific level and the lowest priority (8) is stated at the most global level. The session authorizations that you define for a specific company have a higher priority than those defined for all companies:<br />
					All companies		One company<br />
<br />
Session authorizations per session		1 		2<br />
Session authorizations per module		3 		4<br />
Session authorizations per package		5 		6<br />
Session authorizations per company		7 		8<br />
<br />
You can define the session authorizations with the following sessions in ERP LN AMS:<br />
Session Authorizations by Company (ttams3133m000), which defines the session authorizations at company level<br />
Session Authorizations by Package (ttams3130m000), which defines the session authorizations at package level<br />
Session Authorizations by Module (ttams3131m000), which defines the session authorizations at module level<br />
Session Authorizations by Session (ttams3132m000), which defines the session authorizations at session level<br />
<br />
Also refer to the threads - <br />
