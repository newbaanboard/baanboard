<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">30th July 2007, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to upgrade to a new hardware system and are in the process of installing the OS and Baan software on a new and more powerful server (the DB is installed on a separate server).  During the installation of the Windows OS, we assigned a different server name than the one on the production server but we would like to reuse the old one once the data migration has been completed and we are ready to do the switch.  That way our users won't have to do any changes to their client configuration.  When we go live over a weekend, the hardware upgrade should be totally transparent to the users.  Will we run into any problems by changing the server name of the new server?  Are there any other steps required on the Baan installation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">31st July 2007, 08:43</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be best to change the server name before doing the validation process or for that matter, before installing baan. Since you said your database is on another server, make sure that there are no connectivity issues between the servers after the name change. <br />
 <br />
How are you going to move the data? Sequential dumps? Are you going to restore the 000 company? <br />
The problematic files surrounding a name change are License6.1 &amp; tabledef6.1. All in all its highly advisable to keep baan installation to the end after you copied all the files to the new server and changed the server name and do an offline installation..<br />

<br />
I am assuming you are talking about IVC4 with 3-Tier Arc. and you would like to switch your app to new hardware, Is it?<br />
<br />
Its network contraint that you can not have two PCs, having same hostname/IP address on the same network. So as said by Sukesh, you can use new hostname untill validation is balance. While validation you have to change new hostname with old one by removing old hardware from network. Now the question is for what purpose you would like to use your old server? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">31st July 2007, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Using DNS is ideal. I feel though that it should have been used at the beginning. However, If you have a user base in excess of 100s and you have custom applications built around Baan in addition to a reporting application, changes to the coding to reflect the name change isnt something you would want to look forward to. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">2nd August 2007, 01:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The only reason for retaining the old server name is so that we don't have change every user's Baan client configuration.<br />
<br />
It seems that there are 2 options:<br />
1. Change the server name before system validation, or<br />
2. Use DNS with an alias.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">2nd August 2007, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">As a long term solution, its better if you start using DNS. Lets say tomorrow you want to keep a standby server for your live production server and since they would be replicating data and talking to each other they would be having two different names. IF DNS was implemented, then When the Live Server goes down, all you need to do is to change the DNS Alias and the users would be re-directed.<br />
 <br />
So its not bad an idea to use DNS at all!!<br />
