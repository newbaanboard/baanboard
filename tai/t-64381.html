How can we send SSRS reports via Email?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">27th July 2013, 09:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it is possible. Like you can create an Email device and specify it in the SSRS Printer device argument. I have never tried it though.<br />
<br />
-device Device_Name -server SSRS_Server<br />
<br />
Jaap might have the exact answer for this.<br />

I went through what you just told, but I guess it is used to send the report to a single mail Id right? I mean, what if we want to pass the mail id as a parameter and then mail the report to that mail ID?<br />
<br />
I use blat to send my reports. So, a similar thing can be done with SSRS Reports as well I guess. But, just trying to figure out where exactly the reports are stored and how to convert it and send.</div></div><hr />

Is there any way to convert SSRS report into PDF automatically.<br />
Actually I want to save that file on the server automatically .</div></div><hr />

<br />
What if we want to send the mail whenever the report is viewed or like if the the user wants to send this report as an email? By the option you gave, it is just scheduling the mail right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">8th August 2013, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">LN is not integrated with the subscription functionality of SSRS. You always have to run the LN session to get a report, either in the browser, printed or stored somewhere. Of course you can always email the report created by SSRS manually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">8th August 2013, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Jaap.<br />
<br />
I always let my user's go with the option you gave i.e. manually mailing the reports as they always want to view the output before mailing it. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am using SSRS (http://www.keepautomation.com/how_to/ssrs_reporting_service/) 2012, and have a requirement to send multiple reports as PDF in one email. I know SSRS (http://www.keepautomation.com/products/net_barcode_reporting_service/barcodes/code_39.html) lets you create delivery extensions to create custom delivery mechanism. However they seem to only customise individual subscription. In order to send multiple reports in one email, I will need to have one subscription for multiple reports. Can anyone please tell if this is possible?<br />
<br />
Is there any other way to do it? SSIS package is suggested by few. Is there any sample code for 2012?</div></div><hr />

I think its not possible within the standard functionality. But, there are work around's. I used to provide Jump to URL (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms157159(SQL.90).aspx) or URL Access (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms153586.aspx) at the bottom of the original report so that user can view the other reports using the links.<br />
<br />
Some other solutions are to make your own automation's. Check the following threads -<br />
