Is there any possibility to to check, if there are newer software components in the B50U_c_stnd level (caused trough solutions or SP's) than in the customization VRC?<br />

Perhaps you have to create temporary PC which only contains the standard plus the update level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">24th February 2003, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is the problem, that everything in the cust vrc IS DIFFERENT from the standard. But I think I need only records if a object/source is &quot;touched&quot; by a solution after this component is copied to the cust vrc.<br />

Correct me, if I'm wrong<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">24th February 2003, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Spartacus,<br />
<br />
I think I understand your intention now.<br />
Let's assume you have the following derivation structure:<br />
<br />
B40    c4<br />
B40U  c4 stnd<br />
B40C  c4 cust<br />
<br />
and you have the program tdsls0140s000 which resides in <br />
B40 c4 and in B40C c4 cust.<br />
<br />
If now a solution would install a modified version, this would go to B40U c4 stnd and as a result your customized version<br />
(from B40C c4 cust) would still be used.<br />
<br />
So what you are looking for would be a report that informs you about the existence of a modified object in cust that &quot;blocks&quot; the patch from being used.<br />
<br />
Did I get you right so far?<br />
<br />
What I would do is some scripting that compares the contents of the $BSE/application directories  (in case of SP or many solutions to be installed) OR<br />
keep track with every solution installed (the components should be listed) and check whether customized versions exist for the objects delivered.<br />
<br />
regards<br />
<br />

<br />
To speed up things and not check all objects (unless you have few...), after a patch installation you would<br />
- run a print solution history for that day/date (by components) into a file and<br />
- then have a script go thru the components of that report only and check if you have a similar one on your customer layer and report that a new component was installed and needs update in the customization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, now you understand my intention right!!<br />
<br />
norwim, victor:<br />
<br />
I agree with you both. <br />
On the first place I would be sure that there is no Baan standard, which solves the problem. <br />
Now, with your help I think I can we sure ;-). Based on that, I think I can develop something, I think it should be based on the solution h√≠story.<br />
