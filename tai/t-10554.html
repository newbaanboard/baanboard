a) change the $BSE/lib/licence6.1 to point to the origional server, if a licence daemon is still running there. <br />

<br />
This is my situation...<br />
<br />
I have my production &amp; test server sharing the same licence (production), I want that my users use the test server while I upgrade O.S &amp; RDBMS.<br />
<br />
reading some baan documentation I found that upgrading SQL 6.5 / 7.0 you need to relicence the server, here my confusion..<br />
<br />
what happen with my test server when my production server licence be affected ??<br />
<br />
how is the most secure way to do it??<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
as always there are several ways how to handle this.<br />
<br />
The most easy is the following:<br />
<br />
a) change the licen6.1 file on the test server to point to itself.<br />
b) execute ttiex3228m000 &quot;Patch Objects after system crash&quot;.<br />
<br />
Know your users can work on the test system with no restrictions and independend from the life server.<br />
<br />
Even if the life server is shutdown, everything is fine.<br />
<br />
The alternative is to keep your current setup. Then at least during the relicensing, you have a short downtime. Just make sure, you licence the old and the new version of SQL Server.<br />
Also you have to be careful with shutting down the life server or stopping the licence daemon in any other way.<br />
<br />
Go for the first option, its the safest in your case.<br />
<br />

<br />
I was typing at full speed to give you an answer, but Markus beat me to it! :(  Thus, only this last portion of the post remains:<br />
<br />
The reason for having to relicence, is that SQL6.5 and SQL7.0 are two seperate entities in the Tools configuration.  Therefore, having only the .5 will not work when trying to use 7.0, and a new licence is necessary.  As far as I know, this doesn't cost you anything, appart from the phone call and a couple of e-mails to Baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpadilla</div><div class="date">1st July 2003, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I did exactly what you say...<br />
<br />
modify licence6.1 file and run ttiex3228m000 session<br />
<br />
I get the message... you still can use the system under demo licence for -1082 days, but when I run any session, the system ends it...<br />
<br />
I suppose that if I change the server date the problem will dissapear, but all things will be registered with the wrong date..<br />
<br />
any trick??<br />
<br />

Call your account manager at Baan and ask him to organize a temporary licence for your test server.  It is my experience that Baan gladly provides this without costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">2nd July 2003, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">We had the same issue.<br />
First step: we change our license6.2 file to reflect hostname in the separate box.<br />
Step tow: we also changed the tabledef6.2 file to reflect the present sever hostname<br />
Now we started the server àLicense server not started à BW started with message DEMO mode à ran the Patch objects after system crash à change the from &amp; to dates in Print System Config report for 90 days à requested Baan to get DEMO license keys à Baan sent license keys same day and we applied the activation keys à validate tools sets à stop &amp; startBaan àconfigure application we are set</div></div><hr />
