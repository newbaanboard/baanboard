we upgraded porting set(6.1c.07.20) and Tools SP (25) a few weeks ago, and we have noticed performance problems in some reports that used to work fine.<br />
Debugging the problem we see that the program &quot;freezes&quot; in the select. As there are other reports that do the same query, we have tested them and they work fine.<br />
The only difference in the session that &quot;freezes&quot; is that there is a group by sentence. We think this could be the problem.<br />
As this report has worked fine for the last 5 years we think the problem is in our new BaaN installation. <br />
Could it be on the db_resources file parameters?</div></div><hr />

MSQL has some nice tools to investigate queries and also the Call Graph Profiler can help. This should explain you some very bad performning parts. For these tracing utilities read this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7665).<br />
