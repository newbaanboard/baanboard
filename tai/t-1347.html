<br />
As an example, I want the user to use tdsls0101m000 session only in company 100 and not in 101 and 102.<br />
<br />
Revoking authorizations for the tables being accessed by the session in companies 101 and 102 would mean other sessions accessing the same tables in companies 101 and 102 would also not function!<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I dont know if you are using the authorization templates for the end users and keeping them as normal users.<br />
<br />
Try to use the session, ttams3133m000 - Session Authorizations by Company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khushro</div><div class="date">12th March 2002, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys,<br />
<br />
I apologize for not mentioning this earlier - I am on Baan IV c3.<br />
<br />
Hence, there is no session called ttams3133m000 - and secondly, as I mentioned in my first post, revoking authorizations on a table for company 102 and 103 would mean that other sessions in these companies for which the user is authorized but which use this table would not be able to show their complete data as well!!<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't really recommend this approach but if you really, really realllllllly want to restrict users on a session level without available Baan functionality then this is the only method I can think of.</div></div><hr />

There is no way you can do this even thro fd6.1 as far as I can see....fd6.1 merely provides the derivation path of the VRCs for a particular package and package combination. Could you be slightly more explicit in explaining how it can be done thro fd6.1? If I have 3 companies linked to the same package combination, then the components of a particular session will point to the same VRC - there is nothing I can manipulate in fd6.1 on a company basis:(</div></div><hr />

<br />
 It is no use to work so much for this matter. Since what you want cannot be achieved very easily, I think you should have different Baan Users for the same end-user, depending on the company he uses.  You can use the session &quot;Copy auth. between users&quot;, so it is not difficult to set the authorizations.<br />
<br />
  It is not an elegant solution, but it always works.</div></div><hr />

The whole purpose of the exercise was to find if there was an easier way of doing this in Baan IV. Obviously there isn't - and your subject sums it up well...I had done it the way you proposed already, but just wanted to know if there was a better solution for it in Baan IV as there is in Baan V.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all your responses...I think we can consider this thread closed now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">21st March 2002, 01:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for my late response. I have been tied up (without whips or leather involved) and even though this thread was 'closed', I would still like to explain my initial intent that (although ugly as ...something that's really, really ugly) should still work..._unless_ BaanIV uses fd6.1 different than BaanV uses fd6.2<br />
<br />
A normal line in fd6.2 (sticking to what I know now), would look something like:<br />
rtd:/opt/apps/baan/5.0b/application/tdB50o_b_uat:/opt/apps/baan/5.0b/application/tdB50o_b_prod:${BSE}/application/tdB50U_b_stn<br />
d:${BSE}/application/tdB50_b<br />
<br />
So yes, it gives you the derivation path for, in this case, all reports in the distribution module.<br />
However, by adding named users, separated by comma's and in between accolades at the beginning of a line, you can direct Baan to look for objects in a different place...for certain users only.<br />
<br />
the line(s) would then look like:<br />
{user1, user2}rtd:/opt/apps/baan/gotcha/rtdsls:/opt/apps/baan/5.0b/application/tdB50o_b_uat:/opt/apps/baan/5.0b/application/tdB50o_b_prod:${BSE}/application/tdB50U_b_stnd:${BSE}/application/tdB50_b<br />
<br />
rtd:/opt/apps/baan/5.0b/application/tdB50o_b_uat:/opt/apps/baan/5.0b/application/tdB50o_b_prod:${BSE}/application/tdB50U_b_stnd:${BSE}/application/tdB50_b<br />
<br />
Now user1 and user2 will attempt to first pick up their objects in the gotcha directory. Rather than routing them to a non-existing path all together, you could replace the session you don't want them to go, by a simple display window, telling them in most friendly terms to 'stay the &amp;^%&amp;^ in your own &amp;^%&amp;$ company'.<br />
<br />
have fun.<br />
