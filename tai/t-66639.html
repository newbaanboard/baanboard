<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruno989</div><div class="date">13th July 2014, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We’re migrating from unix to windows.  With unix, I would setup multiple print devices for the same printer and the driver would allow me to setup printing preferences, eg:  double sided, legal, portrait).  When the user when to print, he could pick whatever “preference”.   <br />
<br />
With windows, the driver setting, is no longer available.   When I tried to print, eg device data, and asked for legal, it would print on letter.  Portrait or landscape works but not the paper size, even though the print size is set on the device.  I don’t want the route of pointing to paper trays because tray 2 on my printer could hold a different paper size than the printer in the finance dept.<br />
<br />
So, I guess I need to understand what I need to do in the new windows environment to be able to print letter vs legal, single sided vs duplex, portrait vs legal.<br />
<br />
I thank you in advance for all the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">14th July 2014, 11:35</div></div><div class="posttext">The way we have it set is to define printer names in Maintain Device Data.<br />
For example:<br />
ACCTS_A4_LTRHEAD<br />
ACCTS_A4_PLAIN<br />
<br />
then on each workstation, you create windows printers that have the same name but have preferences for the correct tray etc.<br />
example:<br />
ACCTS_A4_LTRHEAD ip address 192.168.20.1 tray 1 portrait<br />
ACCTS_A4_PLAIN ip address 192.168.20.1 tray 2 portrait<br />
<br />
A bit cumbersome as you need to set on each workstation but it works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">14th July 2014, 11:40</div></div><div class="posttext">just to clarify:<br />
<br />
The Device name in Baan Device Data could be anything memorable, it is the Device Queue field that maps to the local workstation printer name.<br />
<br />
that is: Device Queue name must be the same as windows workstation printer name.<br />
In my previous example:<br />
Device could be called DEPT1_A4_LTRHEAD, but Device queue name and windows printer name must be the same e.g. ACCTS_A4_LTRHEAD<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />

I was kinda hoping not to go that way.   I have 60 printers with 4 papertype variants.  That means 240 printer definitions.   Any other way ???</div></div><hr />

It is not that different than the Unix method; instead of editing driver files, you are setting up different Window's printers.<br />
