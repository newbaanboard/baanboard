<br />
We for a long time already have long lists of language errors in the nt-logs, on certain tools enum domains in language 4 (French). I now want to get rid of those messages, so indeed in the table ttadv402 there were no descriptions available in language 4 for those domains. After adding all the enum-value descriptions in language 4 via GTM, and creating runtime dd, we still get the errors.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what else needs to be done maybe in order to get rid of those errors.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Ur convert to runtime DD  works only if there is an indicator logged in ttadv502 for domains. And that happens only when u adopt front end approach. U can check the d&lt;package code&gt;.pd in the dictionary to check for the enum descriptions. It may not have come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said, I didn't do CONVERT to runtime dd, in which case indeed manual GTM changes will not be logged in ttadv501 and thus not be converted, but I did CREATE runtime dd. When running a create to runtime dd, all domains will be modified. <br />
<br />
Indeed when checking in the dtt.pd file, I see that the descriptions are now available in the language 4. <br />
<br />
However, there seems to be maybe something else still missing/wrong...<br />
<br />
Any other ideas...??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th April 2004, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">U r right create runtime will update the relevant package domain dictionary ie dtt.pd.So the problem may not be just enum descriptions. In Baan IV  there are 2 programs viz ttadv0250m000 'Convert standard options .....' and <br />
ttadv0260m000 'Convert tools text ...' . Similar program should be there in Baan V . U can run the same for language 4.Before running the same please take backup of file dtopt4 in $BSE/lib.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see the connection between domain's enum descriptions and standard options or tools texts. However, I've done it anyway, just to be able to say that I tried :p , yet without result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th April 2004, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">In unix the shared memory get re-initialized the moment it's changed. However just try re-starting Baan to see if it helps u eliminates the log messages.<br />
<br />
Other than that , don't have any clue as to what could be wrong. Somebody with Baan V knowledge can answer it better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I forgot to mention, the server has also already been restarted since then, and it didn't solve our problems.<br />
<br />
Any BaanV people who can help me???</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">16th April 2004, 10:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I have couple of questions.<br />
<br />
1. Do u have enum descriptions for user language 1 .<br />
2. Does this happen for super user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">16th April 2004, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">1)  Our system language is language 1 -&gt; Dutch, all the users work with Dutch. The error is &quot;Language 4 error in domain 'ttaad.xxxx'&quot;, i.e. an error on the domain ttaad.xxxx (happens on 4 ttaad domains) for the language 4 -&gt; it's an enum domain, and enum domains have descriptions for their constants which can be available in different languages. <br />
<br />
The translation of those domain descriptions was not available for language 4 in ttadv402. We added the relevant records, created runtime, varified that they exist through the dtt.pd file, but still the errors occur.<br />
<br />
2)  This happens for super users, as well as for normal users.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I logged a call to BaaN but after one month the support person has not yet understood what was the problem !<br />
<br />
So if someone has an idea...</div></div><hr />
