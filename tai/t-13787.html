The ERP includes the Integration Pack but we don't know how it works. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Search the forum for 'Office Integration', there is a lot of info for it in these forums.<br />
<br />
Be aware that there are 2 forms of using that technology.  You can interface to Excel and Word direct, but these are a little slow, somewhat buggy and I am not sure how much these are supported at this point.  This was the earliest use of this technology - it's free. <br />
<br />
New uses for this technology involve using OpenWorld to get the data.  That's not free right now, but seemingly works much better - I have not used it.<br />
<br />
Also, read this Baan solution:  127466 <br />
It has links to get the latest version of this software (at Service Pack 11 level), which also includes installation and user instructions (or so says the description).<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Hi Lisa, you are not right with this statement. The Office Integration based on OpenWorld is also free.  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">2nd December 2003, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">O well, your right, I am corrected - the Office Integration is free, but OpenWorld is not, correct?  That is in flux..hopefully SSA will release a free version or something similar soon - or do you know is that already happened..?</div></div><hr />

<br />
the OpenWorld components you need for Office Integration are also for free. These are Adapter and Adapter for iBaan ERP.<br />
Additionally you have to set up Bclm. During installation you have to order an activation key for these OW components via support but this is also free.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">3rd December 2003, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">So, it seems that some parts of OW are free to integrate with existing technology.   Thanks Andreas, that is news to me.   I would love to see a posting on what parts of OW are available with a support contract, and which parts are extra. <br />
<br />
Sounds like a good Wiki topic :)  I'll start one over there by the end of the day - if you know more about this subject, feel free to add to the Wiki.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bazram60</div><div class="date">4th December 2003, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all.<br />
<br />
Our technical support confirm that we need 3 components (all free): integration pack (server), Integration pack (client) and the open world adapter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harley</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 08:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Lisa,<br />
<br />
This subject is very intersting.<br />
<br />
How to get those components, should I request to Baan Support?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Harley</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Harley<br />
I don't know, we have not done this - it's all (good) news to me.   But from the past with things like webtop, we have contacted support and we get the product, the OW pieces needed, and some papers to sign off on saying we would only use for WebTop.  From the post above, it would work probably the same way.<br />
<br />
Also assuming they will give you full documentation as well.  Bazram can confirm that maybe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">10th December 2003, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Harley,<br />
as i mentioned in one of my previous posts the OW Components to use Office Integration are free.<br />
We get our things directly from Baan (uups SSA Global). In our case we use OW 2.3. The package is called 'iBaan OpenWorld Adapter Suite 2.x Runtime'. In case of 2.3 it is Part Number 6506.0001.<br />
The Office Integration 2.0 is available via Solution 126530 or herein mentioned Solutions for newer Versions on Baan Support Site.<br />
<br />
By the way, installation and configuration of OW is not an easy task depending on your software environment. :confused: <br />
To me it seems like we say in Germany: 'you want to shoot a bird with a cannon'.;) <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
Our technical support tell us:<br />
&quot;Problems with Office integration occurs with Windows XP, 2000 or professional and MS Office 2000 or XP.<br />
With Windows 98, 97, etc. Problems dissapear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Probably he's right<br />
<br />
we'll see it<br />
