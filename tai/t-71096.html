I have a new user that has started that is needing full access to a certain company inside our baan. I copied a user that had most of the permissions in that company but the user is still not able to access somethings. My question is how do I go about giving the user full access to that certain company? <br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Otherwise you just have to hunt down those things they do not have access and grant them those sessions(or permissions) also.  Are there specific things or issues you are running into?</div></div><hr />

I made the employee a superuser and all is fine now. I just was not sure if there was anything in between superuser and just granting access to each session/module that is needed. thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th May 2018, 01:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it depends on your setup.  We use DEM Flows so we can just assign someone the roles they need without going to super user.  If we did give someone the menu (only IT gets the menu now a days and we are all super users) then we had to do the session or modules one at a time to get everything they needed.  I think that was one of the reasons we stopped doing that - it was a pain at times getting that all straightened out.</div></div><hr />
