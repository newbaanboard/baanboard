<br />
Company Setup: Each Business Unit is a separate Company in our LN Environment.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
1. Is there a mechanism to distribute licences based on company number in LN? <br />
Example, 15 out of 70 Concurrent Licences should be dedicated to Company number '101'.<br />
2. Can 2 SLMs point to the same LN Environment?<br />
3. What are the other ways to realise our requirement?</div></div><hr />

https://www.inforxtreme.com/espublic/EN/AnswerLinkDotNet/SoHo/Cases/SoHoCaseDetails.aspx?caseid=9816061<br />
<br />
@Karl Schmal, you are simply genius!!! Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge on call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">15th June 2016, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">and what did karl schmal say ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pillai.ganesh</div><div class="date">15th June 2016, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">and what did karl schmal said ???<br />
<br />
Karl Suggested the following concept (theoretically)-<br />
1.	Install new SLM server software on a separate server; let us call it SLM2_server<br />
2.	a) Request a license for this new server with 15 cc users<br />
b) Request a license change for the old server 70-&gt;55 cc users<br />
3.	Create a separate/second SLM client configuration ...\SLM2\etc\servers.xml &quot;pointing to&quot; the new SLM server<br />
4.	Let started ntbshell.exe processes use this second SLM client configuration by setting SLM_RUNTIME=...\SLM2<br />
For Worktop this can be done in the BW configuration per user.<br />
For WebUI this can be done by configuring a second LN environment (pointing to your one LN instance but with <br />
-set SLM_RUNTIME=...\SLM2 in the Command field.<br />
(You could install a second Tomcat/WebUI server too having one one LN Environment configured with this SLM_RUNTIME setting.)<br />
<br />
*I have given details of the incident in my previous post; you can refer that for more details. <br />
*I'll update this baanboard thread once I have practivally implemented the solution suggested by Karl.:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">15th June 2016, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I really did not know that it is possible to have two different SLM servers for one ERPLN application.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly we can not see your incident. I hope Karl will publish this solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">16th June 2016, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked your incident. There is a disclaimer note -<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have additional questions here.<br />
(Please understand Infor Support cannot take the responsibility for the actual implementation; also I do not know if Customer Care department will accept the license pool being devided.)<br />
In theory, it will work. However, if you have users who have the option to change the company then the solution does not work. <br />
However, using the command line parameter -set BSE_COMPNR=XXX you can force the specific SLM to handle company based licensing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">17th June 2016, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this statement: &quot;In theory, it will work. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">11th January 2017, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I came across a KB today, so it does look like it is possible -<br />
KB 1112384 <br />
SLM client 7.2.0.4 on Windows 2008 ignores env. variable %PROGRAMDATA% <br />
Description: <br />
In document &quot;Infor_Solution_License_Manager_7.2_Inst_and_Conf_Guide.pdf&quot;, on page 57, section &quot;SLM Client&quot; states:<br />
 &quot;The client configuration data is available in the servers.xml file that is located in the directory &lt;SLMHOME&gt;/etc, or %ProgramData%/Infor/SLM/etc for Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.&quot;<br />
 In some cases we need to redirect SLM client to a different server.xml file, located in a different folder, so we tried to set variable PROGRAMDATA to the desired path.<br />
 SLM ignores the setting and always uses path C:\ProgramData\Infor\SLM as it was hardcoded in the software.<br />
 We also tried with version 7.1.0.4, same problem.<br />
 The last working version is 7.1.0.2, in which the variable is correctly recognized.<br />
 But this version cannot be used with a 64 bit porting set.<br />
 Is there new env. variable which we can use?<br />
<br />
Resolution: <br />
<br />
One can use the environment variable SLM_RUNTIME, it will point to the run time path.<br />
From the latest SLM Administrator's Guide -<br />
Backup and restore SLM configuration<br />
The SLM server package stores license information in these folders:<br />
• On UNIX:<br />
$SLMHOME/license<br />
If the environment variable SLMHOME is not set, the default path is used: /usr/slm/license.<br />
• On Windows:<br />
%PROGRAMDATA%\Infor\Slm\license<br />
Note: The %SLM_RUNTIME% environment variable can be used to point to another location.<br />
To back up the license information, simply tar or zip this directory and the directory's underlying files and directories.<br />
In case of a hardware failure that corrupts the SLM installation, reinstall the SLM server and client packages so that all environment settings and registered shared libraries (NT) are as before the hardware failure. Restore the backed up directory after you installed the SLM server package and restart the SLM server process.<br />
In addition, ensure the files are owned by the user who runs the SLM server process, before and after the crash. <br />
The activation key of the license file is bound to the hardware. Therefore, if a change occurs in the hardware, the SLM server can refuse the former license file and stop running immediately. To check if you require a new activation code, run the program SlmId and compare the number the program returns with the ID number specified in the host part of the common record of the license file.</div></div><hr />
