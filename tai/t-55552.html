<br />
    We are facing a strange issue with respect to authorizations between super and normal users.<br />
<br />
     For a normal user we were not able to perform Generate Inbound Advice (whinh3201m000). It gave the error &quot; Wrong usage of DAL etc&quot;. (screenshot is attached). On checking the authorizations we found that the user was not having access to that particular session. We gave him full authorization and still the erroe persisted.<br />
<br />
     We then gave him all possible access that come by default with the system (Startup Baan, Full Table Access, Full Session Access &amp; Full Baan Tools Access). However the error persisted.<br />
<br />
     We finally made him a superuser and strangely then we were not able to succeed. The same error message appeared.<br />
<br />
     However we are able to do the entire process for other super users like baan.<br />
     Could someone provide an idea why such a strange behaviour is happening.<br />
<br />
Awaiting your inputs !<br />
Thanks 'n' Regards,<br />
Thamarai</div></div><hr />

<br />
      Thanks for your reply. We have done reports customization. But will that have any effect in the way the sessions are accessed ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">11th April 2009, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a couple other places to check.  Verify that the user is using the same Package Combination.  If the data dictionary is different (domains and tables) you can not access a company with a different Package Combination.  But if the data dictionary is identical, you will not get an error message and the session/dll path can be different.<br />
<br />
Check the security of the DLL at the OS level.  Make sure it has the correct values.  Verify the user belongs to a group that can access the DLL.  Sometimes when applying customiztions or patches, the files pick up the permissions from the user that are not correct.<br />
<br />
Verify the $BSE/lib/user/u(username) file is being updated.  If the permissioons are not correct, when changing the users values and converting to runtime, the OS file is not updated.   View the contents and make sure that it is being changed.</div></div><hr />
