<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">10th October 2013, 22:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently we started a migration from old Baan IVc environment to new servers. We have ordered two identical IBM servers for test and prod and, to my surprise, during installation both machines got the same SlmID. <br />
Supposedly, SlmId is based on CPU#1 serial number, Mac address of first network card etc. Anyway, it should be unique for every physical machine, shouldn't it?<br />
I wanted to create a SlmCluster with two SlmServers but as long as both servers have the same SlmId, I can not do this.<br />
Anybody had the same situation? What can be wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">11th October 2013, 03:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Never seen that it should be a unique number. Which version of SLM are you using?<br />
<br />
Post the output of the SlmId command with the hostname and number here, along with the output of &quot;uname -a&quot; command on Unix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If on Windows, check your hosts file under C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\<br />
<br />
You will see something like this:-<br />
<br />
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.<br />
#	127.0.0.1       localhost<br />
#	::1             localhost<br />
<br />
Under this:- add a line with the IP address of this server and its fully qualified domain name.<br />
<br />
e.g 192.168.100.20 server_name.domain_name.com<br />
<br />
Now, do a slmconfig -c and try to add a new entry again.<br />
<br />
Restart the slm service. Do this for both the servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't show any fully qualified names. Which OS are you on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">11th October 2013, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on AIX 6.1</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I have no knowledge about AIX, but there is something wrong with the hostname of the servers, and as my little knowledge about AIX, there exists a hosts file in /etc/ on AIX too. You can wait for an AIX expert to help you out with this case. Check if you ping it from a client machine by its Fully qualified domain name.</div></div><hr />

Ideally it should generate unique SLM ID when you have 2 different physical machines. Have seen this behavior once with 2 Virtual Machines (second was copy image of first one) but that got resolved by recreating the second VM again.</div></div><hr />
