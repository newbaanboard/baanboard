<br />
This shows that, the first reconfiguration was not done correctly or might have been interrupted. <br />
<br />
Clear the tables ttadv501,502,503,504 in company 0 and relogin. Try again.<br />
<br />
Check if that works. Also check if there are any R.* files created in $BSE\tmp folder.<br />
<br />
Note:- When you have modified a table definition, you dont need to do what you are doing in the screen shot. You just need to do a convert to runtime for that table using session ttadv5215m000 with the selection of Tables &amp; Reconfig Tables, Your Pack Combination, Your Package and Table Name with Runtime Directories Options.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what you are trying to do with CRDD for all the tables in the package combination. Be aware while doing these kinds of activities as you can mess up with your data.</div></div><hr />

Hello Bhushanchhanda<br />
<br />
Thank you for the quick reply, there are no R.* from the $BSE/tmp folder. I will try your suggestion and will let you know the result.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What kind of table have you modified? Is it a customized tables? Any dependent tables and why you are using session Create Runtime Directories. You are modifying the definition means, your directories are already updated. I hope you have not messed up your directories.<br />
<br />
Please check if you have any .new files in your $BSE\dict\your_pack_comb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, you just need to rebuild your package combination.<br />
<br />
Check this thread. I guess  it will solve your issue.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
First check if there are any *.New files in the dict. If there are any, that means the Convert to RDD was not done properly. Also check table ttadv501 - 505.<br />
<br />
A tip:- Take a backup of the folder named with your Package Combination with DB and BSE Backup. Now, rename that folder.<br />
<br />
Now, run ttadv5210m000 (Create Runtime) for your package combination with full range and all selection. Relogin baan. It will create the folder again. Now, check if there are any .New files. If there are, do a convert to run time for the package combination. Relogin Baan.<br />
<br />
Thats it. But, please take the necessary backup's. And, as jclju1 said, you can try restarting the Shared Memory as well. Again, this problem has a lot of reasons and every reason has different solutions. So, All the Best</div></div><hr />
