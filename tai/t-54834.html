In case ur original file is over-written in repeated  re-configs , u have following option left.<br />
<br />
1. Take table  export in oracle with table definition in oracle .<br />
2. Drop  table in oracle <br />
3. Create the table in baan . Note the difference and bring the dd on par with exported table dd <br />
4. Import the exported data either through exchange or through oracle .</div></div><hr />

I was able to find solution. I have checked table fields in Baan and in Oracle. I have found that there was a extra column exists in Oracle which was not creating a problem.<br />
<br />
So i have just deleted that column from table and then done CRDD and Reconfigure and issue got solve :):D</div></div><hr />
