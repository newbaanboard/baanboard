<br />
How to quickly move the software component from one machine to another without using PMC? There are two sessions to export and import data dictionary but they are not recommended for UNIX environment. Is it true? Is there a third way to do it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I have used ttiex1280m000 &amp; ttiex1285m000 (export &amp; import of DD) on both Sun Solaris and HP_UX with no problems.<br />
<br />
What problems have you heard about?<br />

<br />
Remember that Baan keeps track of this information in company 000.<br />
<br />
So only if you want to copy all your components, you can do this, as long as you also copy company 000.<br />
<br />
I use this technique to synchronize our test and production environment when they drift too far apart.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">18th September 2002, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on what you're importing and how you exported.<br />
Tables, domains, sessions always needs a create RTDD for them (an import does not generate convert flags).<br />
If you exported your forms, menus, reports and scripts with the dumps/objects then these do not need any RTDD related tasks, otherwise you'll need also to dump/compile whatever is needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to contradict you -<br />
<br />
<br />
If you exported your forms, menus, reports and scripts with the dumps/objects then these do not need any RTDD related tasks, otherwise you'll need also to dump/compile whatever is needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please refer to the link -<br />

http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6293&amp;highlight=ttadv6265m000<br />
<br />
If you have imported new sessions and they are located in the menus, until the runtime for the menus have been done, the new sessions will not be visible.<br />
<br />
Please correct me if I am wrong, I observed this behaviour in our installation with BaaN-5.2 and Worktop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to do it with a new session and I had to create runtime DD to make it working. Another problem is that sometimes session ttiex1285m000 does not report an error but components are not imported. How to find what happens?<br />

<br />
I know two reasons for ttiex1285m000 not importing components:<br />
<br />
1. Corrupted intermediate iex-tables (e.g. iex185 or iex186). When these tables are corrupted some components are imported, others are not. This applies to table definitions, domains and help texts. It is caused by the fact that the second or later insert in these tables return a duplicate key error, although it is not a real duplicate. For help texts the situation is even worse: all imported help texts contain the same text then.<br />
To solve this, a delete and create of the table solves the problem.<br />
<br />
2. Due to file name changes during the transfer of the dumpfiles, the import session cannot find the dumps. The dumpfiles are compressed and need a &quot;.Z&quot; as extension. Some transfer protocols rename them to &quot;.z&quot;. When you rename them the import will work fine. I think this only applies to Unix.<br />

<br />
I am sure that the extensions are OK but I have to check the tables you mentioned. Is there any parameter in the system settings to disable this functionality? I do the import as a super user of course.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">19th September 2002, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Marek,<br />
<br />
When you are sure that the dump contains the components you want to have in the other system, I don't see another reason than mentioned above that your components are not imported. As far as I know there is no parameter or authorization setting which influences the import session.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">19th September 2002, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">With ttpmc1285 there is also this setting &quot;import to other vrc&quot; that may cause your compontnes no to become visible:<br />
if you take an export dump from the Baan IV5c enviroment used by PEG, the dump must be imported into the B40U_c4_stnd package VRC to have it visible in the OPER_001 that is on top of the update standard layer, but not on top of the c5 layer. If you look in the application directory, there even may be directories referring to a wrong package-VRC from previous imports.<br />
<br />
RDD information must not be copied between Unix and NT (although it will not per definition deliver errors), but DD information may be exchanged. Actually all solutions and (table)dumps delivered by Baan are created on Unix, and a lot are used on NT.<br />
<br />
It is especially path names that one must handle with care... The Baan objects and files that are all &quot;on top of&quot; the portingset are by definition fully portable.<br />
<br />
It is actually the same thing as what MS tried to do with Windows: make applications portable over different hardware and OS-software platforms: Baan succeeded long ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to generate a patch using ttiex4100m000 and ttiex4110m000 sessions but The System does not allow me to add components to a patch in session ttiex4110m000:<br />
<br />
Undefined symbol dd_name 'ttiex410.cses'<br />
<br />
Is there any patch I should apply to tools? Even if I rebuild DD for Tools the same error message occurs.<br />
