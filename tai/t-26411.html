<br />
We are in Animal Feed Manufacturing industry.  We are in the process of making interface between our Production Control System and BaaN IVc4 Shop Floor Control Module.<br />
<br />
The output from Production Control System consists of quantities produced for finished products and quantities consumed for raw materials. Currently the data is entered manually in the SFC module.  <br />
<br />
We do following steps:<br />
1. Maintain Production Orders (Release from the same session)<br />
2.  Report Operations Completed (By completing the last operation)<br />
3.  Report Production Orders Completed<br />
4.  Maintain and Release Inbound data<br />
5.  Enter Material Issue for Production Orders (Correct for actual quantities)<br />
6.  Generate and Release Outbound Data<br />
7.  Backflush Hours<br />
8.  Close Production Orders<br />
<br />
We are exploring the options for the interface development.  I understand that by using Function Server, we can develop the interface without writing much code.  I am going through the help of DDC module and trying to understand.<br />
<br />
I appreciate if any one can give the sequence of steps to follow in interface development based on the above conditions.  Any exercises for using DDC/function services are also helpful. I appreciate any suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance,<br />

<br />
There are several consulting firms that developed and sell middleware to connect up the DDC, my company is one of these.  These can be fairly cheap if you want to develop the apps on your own.  Of course, all of the apps are also available from most middleware providers as well, and Baan itself released some ddc compatible versions of many sessions - these would be the 'b000' versions of the sessions (such as tihra1101b000).<br />
<br />
The steps to develop your own middleware for the DDC are described in the DDC Standards doc from Baan, but I'm sorry I don't have the doc anymore and it looks like the support site is not responding.  But much of this can be found on your system help, if you look for Distributed Data Collection (tuglobddc0) and related links.  It's very good help, but a complicated process.  Given that model, you need to develop your own c libraries that will communicate with the Baan DDC, sending Requests and receiving Replies according to their structure.</div></div><hr />
