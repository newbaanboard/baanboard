<br />
I'm supporting a BaanERP V System and we are planning to exchange data between several companys. <br />
So my question is, anyone knows where to get informations regarding &quot;Exchange&quot; (whitepapers, powerpoint slides etc)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdbailey</div><div class="date">18th January 2005, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hagen,<br />
<br />
I don't have any advice for quality information sources, but we have created many exchange schemes (including generating an entire test company from an exchange scheme).  We are also on Baan IVc3 which will be different from Baan ERP.  However, the general process should remain similar.<br />
<br />
The main process we use is as follows:<br />
Set up the basic information<br />
---------------------------<br />
     *Maintain Exchange Scheme<br />
          --Gives a name to the batch, date format, seperator, location of files, etc....<br />
     *Maintain ASCII Files<br />
          --Indicate which tables will be used for your Import/Export Scheme<br />
     *Maintain ASCII File Formats<br />
          --Indicate which fields of each table will be imported/exported<br />
     *Maintain Batches<br />
          --Set up how many batches each exchange scheme will have and in which order they are run (this will be important with multi-table exchange schemes since some tables need to be imported before others due to &quot;lookups&quot;)<br />
<br />
Set up the Import/Export<br />
------------------------<br />
     *Maintain Table Relations<br />
          --Set up the file names for each table (and for each batch) that the exchange scheme will be importing from or exporting to.<br />
     *Maintain Field Relations<br />
          --Set up the fields to be imported/exported with the option of modifying the data &quot;on-the-fly&quot; with fixed values, incrementing values etc....<br />
     *Maintain Ranges<br />
          --Allow you to set up any restrictions on what data should be imported/exported<br />
     *Create Import/Export Script<br />
          --Generates the script that will be run by Exchange<br />
     *Import/Export Data (Regular or Non-Regular)<br />
          --Performs the import/export at per your schedule (runs the batch)<br />
<br />
This is a very generic description since I am not aware of your familiarity regarding the exchange process.  I hope this helps to some degree.</div></div><hr />

I have the course material for you used by Baan. I will add it to this reply.<br />
<br />
Good luck with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just a thought .... why don't use bdbpre and bdbpost for the exchange of data? To me at last it is a lot easier to write a script that filters the data to be transferred from one system to another out of a seq. dump than to use exchange to do this.<br />
For me the choice would be <br />
a) bdbpre and post .. then<br />
b) a Baan program (if the exchange of data has to be done on the same system, this would be the first choice even) ... and then<br />
..<br />
..<br />
z) exchange<br />
<br />
*g*<br />
<br />
good luck<br />
<br />
