<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">22nd July 2009, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Do not use the jobs daemon (UNIX) or job services (Windows). You should always use the OS native mechanism to schedule jobs: CRON in Unix based servers and Scheduled Tasks in Windows based servers. <br />
In your case you will use the last one. Then you will need to create a .bwc profile for each one of the companies where you would like to run jobs. The password for each one of the users in the BW config must be saved. When you double click on the .bwc profile it should go directly to the menu browser, no message of any kind should pop up after opening the .bwc profile otherwise this won't work. <br />
<br />
ie. BW_Client_BSE\jobs100.bwc for company 100; BW_Client_BSE\jobs200.bwc for company 200<br />
<br />
All the pertinent paths should be on the PATH environment variable in your Windows server; In other words, if you bring up a command prompt, you should be able to issue<br />
start bw.exe jobs100.bwc (assuming you have a jobs100.bwc created, so this could be the .bwc profile you named something else) and the menu browser should come up on screen. <br />
<br />
Then your jobs will need to have the use external scheduling and periodical check box checked. You will need to make sure your jobs in session ttaad5100m000 have short names or if they include spaces that you replace these spaces with &quot;_&quot; (underscores). <br />
<br />
Then at the server you will need these two .bat files on that path (if you don't have a jobs folder make one)<br />
<br />
%BSE%\jobs\startjobs100.bat<br />
@echo off<br />
<br />
if &quot;%1&quot; == &quot;&quot; goto argerror<br />
<br />
start bw.exe jobs100.bwc -- -set BSH_JOB=%1 -set BSH_JOBOK=%2 ttaad5203m000<br />
goto end<br />
<br />
:argerror<br />
echo Usage: startjob name-of-job-to-start [jobfile-OK] [From-session-number]<br />
goto end<br />
<br />
<br />
:end<br />
<br />
%BSE%\jobs\MYJOB.bat<br />
@call startjobs100.bat MYJOB  &lt;---------the name of the job in ttaad5100m000)<br />
<br />
%BSE%\jobs\MYJOB.bat is the file you will schedule in the Scheduled tasks.<br />
<br />
Then you'll need to test and make sure this works. <br />
<br />
Best luck!<br />

i'm trying to do the same on Baan IV c4.<br />
are the same steps for baan IV c4?<br />
<br />
Because in session ttaad5203m000 doesn't even appear the job that i'm trying to activate.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can do the same for a Baan IV c4 environment. Remember jobs are company specific.  So maybe the job was created for company 150 and you are currently on company 200, if you open session ttaad5500m000 in company 200 you might have a different set of jobs setup for that company. You will need then to change to company 150 and then open ttaad5500m000 to look for your job.  <br />
By the way ttaad5203m000 is only used to activate the jobs. Jobs data ttaad5500m000 is the session where you need to check your jobs. <br />
<br />
