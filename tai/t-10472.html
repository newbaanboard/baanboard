<br />
Al to execute for BaaN a task by cron remains blocked the board that the sesion executed by task uses,  But if the task I execute it by hand, functions perfectly.  <br />
<br />
To that can be proper this?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is what I think you are asking, correct me when I am wrong.<br />
<br />
When you execute a job in 'blocked' status, using cron, it won't run, but it does when you run it by hand?<br />
<br />
If so, then that is what is supposed to happen. Cron (or any scheduler) will only kick-off jobs that are in the 'free' status.<br />
Manually you can start a job in any status.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The question is:<br />
<br />
When I execute a job based on a session and one DLL, the job is executed perfectly, but, when this job is executed by &quot;cron&quot; the job is not execute correctly and, leaves blocked tables...<br />
<br />
As this it can be solved?  <br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
if graphical.mode then	<br />

and when the seesion are executed by &quot;cron&quot;, the session can't  run because the sesion remained expecting the choice.again.if.not.marked()<br />
