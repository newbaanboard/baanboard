<br />
Today we just discovered that user can use windows task manager to end their BaaN connection.  Coming from Unix, this did not work.  I always asked users what they were doing before ending their processes on UNIX to ensure they were not running an update process.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to prevent users from killing their BaaN process?<br />

I haven't stopped them from doing this as WebUi hangs sometimes and this is the only option left for the users. If you really want to stop users from kicking this process, there are policies you can set. You can easily google it. Else, if you are having a firewall, it will be easier.</div></div><hr />
