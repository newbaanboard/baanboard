<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dsp8481</div><div class="date">5th April 2002, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to run two separate Baan and Oracle instances on one server.  They seem to share the same shared memory process.  We set the necessary environment variables (oracle home and sid, bse, bsetmp, etc) and changed the pertinent files (tabledef6.1 ora_storage, rc.start/stop,etc).  We even deleted the shm_param file before starting these instances and still..they share the same shared memory process.  Anyone done this before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">5th April 2002, 22:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We have done this and it works fine. The Oracle instances create two distinct set of processes. The only thing that distinguishes them is the database name or SID. You can optionally use IPC or Net 8 to talk to them, but you have to set up two separate definitions for Baan to identify with and point to only one.  The Oracle instances do not share the same processes, other than the common use of the Net 8 Listener, so I don't understand why you seem to think that they are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dsp8481</div><div class="date">5th April 2002, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the Baan application's shared memory that is being shared between the two environments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">6th April 2002, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like you need to specify a different shared memory address in the shm_param file for the second Baan instance. Look at your current memory address range, then take the next logical sequence.</div></div><hr />

It's the Baan application's shared memory that is being shared between the two environments. <br />
<br />
Do you mean that they share the same shared memory timer process or the same shared memory segments? Can you see this from an ipcs -mb?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dsp8481</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your help.  I've got it working successfully now.<br />
<br />
For sure they shared the same process but I am not sure if they shared the same segments since it is working ok now.</div></div><hr />
