<br />
We have few obsolete companies to delete from production environment. The companies are involved in logical table sharing. We will remove the table share of all obsolete companies before deleting them. After removal and while doing convert to runtime (new tabledef will be created) from the logical table share session do we need to shut down all the Baan processes and connected users ? <br />
<br />
Can you please let me know about the effects if we don't shut down all the running processes (users).<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Beware while doing the Convert to runtime for the shared tables. You might lose your data. Remove the table sharing, take sequential backups and then do a convert to runtime. <br />
<br />
There is no need to shutdown anything. Just logout and log in back. And then create the table with the sequential dump that you had taken (only if required).<br />
<br />
Please make sure you have all the backup's i.e. DB &amp; Application before going for this activity. <br />
<br />
Also, its always better to test it on a Test Environment first.<br />
