<br />
I am new to the forums and I hope someone is able to shed some light on a problem I have.<br />
<br />
We have recently moved our Baan server to a new network in another location.<br />
<br />
The clients are able to connect to the Baan and work normally on the new network except for some report functions.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if this will come out correctly as we are running a German Baan installation, I am however not a native German speaker.<br />
<br />
The problem I am having is that when a client tries to print to Word, Excel, Notepad, Email, nothing happens...<br />
<br />
As an example here is what we have under Email Printer: <br />
<br />
Command: RTF: outlook.exe /a %s<br />
Path: email.rtf<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the Baan device to work, Outlook must open when call from Run program</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for your reply, but I'm afraid that is not the issue. <br />
<br />
Outlook is open on the client computer.<br />
<br />
The same problem occurs if the user tries to print to a Word doc or an Excel doc or a Notepad doc.<br />
<br />
The hourglass comes up for a second and then nothing happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayushk</div><div class="date">2nd February 2010, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes reports do not print if there is no space on the server. Please check if $BSE/tmp on the server has space.<br />
<br />
Also check if any error messages are logged in Event viewer or $BSE/log</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulbis</div><div class="date">2nd February 2010, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">$BSE/log has plenty of space.<br />
<br />
Event viewer shows no signs of any errors relating to Baan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two problems existed. I didn't think this would have caused a problem but we had also moved the client software to new computers and the %BSE% Path was not defined. This fixed printing to word and excel.<br />
<br />
The other problem with the Outlook part was that for some reason the &quot;/a&quot; switch was not present in the printer config. This fixed the Outlook problems.</div></div><hr />

So,I heard about some interesting tools and one of it were especial to my mind and I downloaded it-outlook message viewer (http://www.recoverytoolbox.com/outlook_pst_viewer.html).I was amazed,because application recovered all my old damaged mails in a minute and without payment.Moreover utility showed me how it decrypts *.ost format and extracts your data as a set of files in *.eml, *.txt and *.vcf formats.</div></div><hr />
