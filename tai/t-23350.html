<br />
We are installing Baan IV c4 on new server with windows 2003 server.  The SQL server 2000 has been installed successfully.  While installing baan when we specify the data &amp; log files for baandb with 2000Mb and 200Mb size respectively, the system prompts with &quot;There is not enough disk space.  Available space is 2047 MB&quot;.  The actual available space on the disk is 410 GB.  <br />
<br />
The only point to note is while installing SQL server 2000 it prompts with a message &quot;SQL server SP2 and below is not support by this version of windows&quot;.  In the installation guide the same has been mentioned by Microsoft and a service pack 3a has been provided to handle the situation.<br />
<br />
Can somebody guide me how can I go ahead with the installation??  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

During the installation of Server 2003 the format phase of the install asks how much of the drive you would like to use.<br />
<br />
i.e. you have a 20 gig drive, the problem is that this should be represented as 20048 or so meg!<br />
<br />
The install defaults if your not paying close attention to 2048 meg so if you select this the drive is formatted, the install completed and you now how server 2003 installed using a 2 gig disk instead of a 20 gig disk.<br />
<br />
Time to reinstall<br />

<br />
After installation, I encountered a fatal error during the BW connection. system show me the error message &quot;No primary key specified in table ...&quot; and aborted system. therefore,I could not connect to Baan system at all after Master CD installation completed.<br />

So does anyone know this error? or did anybody install BaanIVc4 on HP 11 with Oracle 9.2 successfully?<br />
