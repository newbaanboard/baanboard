<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bferro</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using a Unix script to limit the number of times a Baan user can log in.  The default is one for normal users.  Everything works fine but I have one question.  Before I used the Unix script and I changed the ipc_info from<br />
<br />
bshell         s    0    0  p  ${BSE}/bin/bshell6.1              to<br />
bshell         s    0    0  p  ${BSE}/bin/script6.1<br />
<br />
I was able to do a &quot;ps -ef | grep bferro&quot; and it would give me the hostname (PC name) of the user.  Now that I use the Unix script, I can't see it.  How can I use find out the PC name of the computer that has logged in from?  Why does it work for bshell6.1 command? See attached file for output of &quot;ps -ef | grep bferro&quot; command.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you can use tools like lsof (with option i) to find out with which IP Adresses a bshell is comunicating. This will give you the same result.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">13th July 2004, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe lsof was first developed for Solaris, I do not know. I actually got to know it from HP support, who use it a lot for trouble shooting NFS issues!<br />
<br />
<br />
You will find it for HP servers precompiled somewhere on the internet. But be carefull the 32 bit version will not run on 64 bit and the HP-Ux10.20 will not run on HP-Ux11i and so on. The version must fit excactly.</div></div><hr />
