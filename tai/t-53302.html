<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kansel</div><div class="date">12th August 2008, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to upgrade my LN6.1 SP2 to FP3 and the installation fails when creating runtime dd. I have found out the reason for this failure is that when installing LN6 wants to install pmc solution 226039 only the problem is solution 226039 introduces a new field in a table which requires a new domain, but this domain is not in the solution. The new domain is delivered with solution 226545 which is NOT being installed. Hence the complete installation of FP3 fails. By the way 226545 is also superseded by 227699 which doesn't get installed either and 226039 is also superseded by 227832 and 227331 but leave that.<br />
Is there any way I can force solutions to be installed along with the solutions for FP3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your input. I know what solution is causing the problem. but I also need a way to get solution 226545 installed when I do the upgrade to FP3. I can not install it before as both solutions is only for FP3 and I can not just install solution 226545 after installing the feature pack as the convert to runtime data dictionary fail with this message:<br />
Domain tfcmg.ddpr not found (VRC B61U a  stnd, Table tfcmg003)<br />
<br />
Any ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">15th August 2008, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also stage 226545 in the StagingArea in the same directory where the FP3 dump is (B61_a3). Note that you must not put the .tar.gz file there, but the unzipped solution dump. If you use the StagingWizard to process the 226545.tar.gz file, this will be handled automatically for you.</div></div><hr />

I didn't know that I could add pmc solutions using staging wizard. I will most definitely try that and let you know when I have tried it.</div></div><hr />

I did a test upgrade and guess what ! It worked like a charm.  ;) Thanks for the help. I will now consider to have some additional solutions installed automatically.<br />
