<br />
could someone help me, i'm using Triton 3.1x (quite an old version) , and running a job, i have setup 2 AP users and linked them to one user only,<br />
<br />
Triton user = A, B, C, <br />
<br />
say C is also another unix user, <br />
<br />
i have setup A to have C as the unix user and B as C as the unix user and C will use C as the unix user, <br />
<br />
when i run the job for A, it says : ba6.1 : Not Authorized to run as user A<br />
<br />
but user C runs very well ...<br />
<br />
now i have modified the file $BSE/lib/user/uA to have the unix user to C, and convert it, and modified the file $BSE/lib/ora/ora_users and set the A entry as<br />
<br />
A:C:&lt;passwd&gt;:triton<br />
<br />
