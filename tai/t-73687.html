<br />
I need to have severak BaaN Users using one System Login.<br />
<br />
I have BaaN IVc4, and I'm configuring pm ttaad2100m000 Maintain User Data, several login with the same System Login, and execute convert to run time.<br />
Example:<br />
BaaN User    System Log In<br />
rf001            invadmin<br />
rf002            invadmin<br />
invadmin      invadmin<br />
<br />
* Using invadmin in BW to login all is working fine.<br />
<br />
* Using rf001 or rf002 in BW to login using invadmin password, I can't login and error massage indicates:<br />
  Error (Authorization failure. Logon for rf001 failed (PamError Code: 13) : Baanlogin failed. Failure executing ipc_boot binary in /baan/bse<br />
<br />
* Using invadmin in BW to login with -- -set USER=rf001 in Command an error when login is shown:<br />
[MR_E_TIME] No Permission to run at this time <br />
<br />
* At Unix command I execute the session with <br />
  ba6.2 -- -set USER=$USERLOG tdinv7237m000 (custom session)<br />
  It returns the error message:<br />
  ba6.2: [MR_E_TIME] No permission to run at this time<br />
  Error [main                     ]: Can't connect to bshell<br />
<br />
On /baan/bse/lib/user/ urf001 is created :<br />
exec_perms:   011<br />
unixuser:invadmin<br />
usertype:N<br />
startprogram_gui: ottdskmbrowser -n1 -mmtccom000000001<br />
startmenu:mtccom000000001<br />
compnr:701<br />
<br />
The overall idea is that I connect to Unix using invadmin user to execute an inventory transaction, but I need the transaction be recorded with the user that made the transaction not the invadmin, so I need to be able to login with a different user than invadmin by using the command:<br />
ba6.2 -- -set USER=$USERLOG tdinv7237m000 (custom session)<br />
<br />
$USERLOG is an environment variable with the real user that entered the transaction<br />
<br />
Any idea what am I missing?:confused:<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

What we typically did was create our own session to log what we needed for when they launched a session.  You mention it is a custom session - so why not add logging into it and then just assign it to the users that need it.<br />
<br />
On our system each baan user had to have an associated system user with it. So we could create different baan users and attach like a unix system user to the account. You can test this by attaching your unix ID to the invadmin account(convert to runtime) and running ba6.2 just to let you see if it works.  In all of our test/dev systems the baan user id did not match the unix user id.  I think they did that as extra security and to make sure you knew which company you were logging into.</div></div><hr />
