http://secure2.support.baan.com/ftpdownload/updates/port/BaanWindows/WindowsPrinter-WindowsServerPrinter.zip<br />
<br />
But, can't get in the site yet (Infor gave me an ecommerce login, but it didn't work, so I'm asking here in the meantime while they fix it.)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in explaining it.<br />
<br />
As I understand it:<br />
Windows printer usesbwprint on your workstation, which means you need the printer driver and the printer set up on the client workstation.<br />
<br />
With Windows Server Printer, there is a plugin for Infor Reporting Service, and you only need the driver and printer on that print server, because bwprint is not used.<br />
<br />
Is that a good explanation?  I have the class manual, and it says &quot;see Windows Printer Devices&quot; but .... there is no information about Windows Printer devices except for the short blurb in the table on one of the pages.</div></div><hr />

I guess I'll have to repost a question with them, referencing the document.  I'll relay  my result here.<br />

<br />
PrinceUK, your answer coincided with the answer from Infor:<br />
<br />
You are correct, if on the field 'device type' within Device Data session (ttaad3500m000) you select Windows Server Printer the driver for that printer should only be required on the server not on the client. You should be able to change that field from probably right now Windows Printer which is why when your users try to print to that device when BWprint does not find it on the local printers (in windows) bwprint will attempt to add it to the local printers but probably you guys have your workstations configured so that users do not have the privilege to add printers. I hope this helps.<br />

Details: I am attempting to understand &quot;Windows Printer&quot; vs. &quot;Windows Server Printer&quot;  I downloaded this document:  http://secure2.support.baan.com/ftpdownload/updates/port/BaanWindows/WindowsPrinter-WindowsServerPrinter.zipI need to know this, specifically:With Windows Server Printer, where are the print drivers installed?With Windows Printer, where are the print drivers installed?I am told that I have people using Webtop, but I am also told that they are getting a prompt to &quot;install a printer&quot; in this case, it tries to load the printer, and then they have a permissions problem, and then, they can't print.  From what I can tell from reading the documentation, this is because they are using &quot;Windows Printer&quot; but the printer isn't installed to their device.Can this problem be alleviated by using &quot;Windows Server Printer&quot;?  In this case, I know that I would be required to install the driver to the &quot;Windows Print Server&quot;.  I need to make sure that the driver will not be needed on the client device.Thanks!<br />
Client's Reference ID: <br />
<br />
<br />
I am happy with this answer.  Now, to envangelize the rest of the IT staff to use Windows Server Printers!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Be aware of the fact that printing in a job works only with windows server printers  :-)<br />
<br />
2. If your server is running on 64-bit Windows you need b4-Bit printer drivers. To find them could be a real challenge.<br />

Not quite right I think, although the effect is the same.<br />
<br />
As Jobs run on the server, client and server are one and the same in that case.  So you can use either Windows Printer or Windows Server Printer.  Either way the drivers have to be installed on the server.<br />
I wouldn't have thought that x64 print drivers would be too much of a problem if you stick to network printers.  You can often use inbuilt drivers for say an HP printer even if the exact model is not listed.  But USB connection and multifunction printers could be more of a problem.</div></div><hr />
