<br />
Hello,<br />
-Clean resets all not yet used (hanging) licences without disconnetting logged in users.<br />
<br />
If you want to release licences, because of more user want to connect to BaaN than lic. are installed, or some users are logged in twice, you can use kill -15 &lt;pid&gt;.<br />
<br />
Other possibility is to use &quot;closeidle&quot; or UNIX script to prevent multiple loggins for a user.<br />
<br />
Search the forum, ther may be some hints !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manojsharma</div><div class="date">24th March 2005, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Closidle is a good utility but it has to install on every user's machine, the other method is unix script which we have done and running successfully.<br />
<br />
This unix script prevent user to take the second login and u can even allow a particular user to take more than one login.</div></div><hr />

to prevent from licence warning, increase your BaaN licences !</div></div><hr />

Try the session_timeout settings to disconnect idle users. Even licmon6.1 -c may not be available to u on B40c3 . <br />
<br />
Licmon6.1 -k /licd6.1 is not a good idea which probably u also know.</div></div><hr />

with this problem. They are all porting set related and have nothing to do with the Baan version. You just have to be on a recent porting set version.<br />
<br />
session_timeout will cleanly kill idle bshells (i.e., people not doing anything in Baan at that time)<br />
<br />
ds_timeout_detect will kill orphaned bshell's (i.e., user logged out but bshell remains)<br />
<br />
licmon6.1 -c removes &quot;hung&quot; licenses (i.e., bshell has terminated and not updated the license count)<br />

<br />
It's correct that all (session_timeout, ds_timeout_detect and licmon6.1 -c etc)  are porting set dependent. But baan tools versions too have dependency for certain porting sets . That's the reason i presume B40c3 may not have the latest porting sets . Correct if wrong .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whilst this may be an SSA support-centre response it is not good advice and can not be defended. It is frivolous to suggest that inactive users should stay logged on (all day, week, till next shutdown) when the agreed licence terms are (presumabley) for concurrent licences. If the number doesn't matter then SSA would remove the restriction. <br />
<br />
We purchased 'colseidle' several years ago after hearing about it on baaanboard and have been very happy with it. <br />
<br />
When we first installed it we did have a few complaints from users but they soon got used to the fact that they would be logged off after a period of inactivity. We do not use the program on all terminals but we estimate that it is saving us at least 25 users our 90 user licence environment. It is also saving a lot of work contacting and/or killing user bshells.<br />
<br />
At the time we purchased this product the then Baan were quibbling over the price of additional licences. They effecively reneged on a previous pricing arrangements and almost doubled the price. As a result of their tactics we have not purchased one cents worth of addtional licences, products or services since that incident. <br />
<br />
We were hopeful that SSA's approach to its established customers would be more amenable but we are disappointed with what seems to be SSA's 'milch-cow' model for existing customers.     <br />

<br />
But - if you've got 150 licenses and you're actually averaging more than 150 (real) users, then more licenses is the ethical answer, no?<br />

Dave<br />
<br />
Not sure what you are getting at Dave.  <br />
(1) I can't see where anybody suggested that Baan/SSA were screwing anybody out of licences.  I did report that Baan had rescinded a pricing arrangement for our company and more-or-less doubled the price which lead us to purchase closeidle (we run back version porting set)<br />
<br />
(2) As to licence counts it depend on the particular licence arrangements (legal agreement). The baan licence software will not allow a bshell start if the count is exceeded it can however disallow new bshells if it loses count. Using a client program such as closeidle does not violate Baan's licence approach as it does a similar thing to using the 'new' session-timeout features. <br />
<br />
As to whether a user is concurrent, connected or whatever the following excerpt from [ http://ITtoolbox.com/hrd.asp?i=847 ] may be useful: <br />
&quot;...A rule of thumb which usually works is that Concurrent Users approximates to 60-70% of the connected Users i.e. those who have access by a discrete UserName and PasswordThe term Concurrent User can also be vague and needs clarifying. I believe most applications software counts Concurrent Users as those taht ar logged in - even if they are currently inactive. Therefore it is perfectly feasible to have say 100 Concurrent Users (logged in) but only 50 are &quot;concurrently&quot; active in terms of pressing keys and transacting...&quot;<br />

Support often is the voice for SSA so just wanted to say that I never got the impression that Baan had built in licensing problems that the answer to was &quot;buy more licenses&quot;<br />
<br />
As for closeidle, etc. I don't have any opinion on those, since I don't use 'em. Baan's internal tools work just fine for me and are free. <br />
<br />
I was just suggesting that if you've got 150 licenses and have 160 concurrent users then don't try to find a way to &quot;trick&quot; baan into letting 160 people log in.. just buy more licenses.. that's all.<br />
