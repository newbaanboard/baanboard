<br />
I am facing a sever problem. When I try to print any report, the select device session (ttstpsplopen) is not started. Print report session looks busy for long time and never comes end, no error message. <br />
<br />
What could be the reason?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Run a session with debug flags to peek at what may be happening and/or have it checked with Baan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We dont have the session ttaad2100m000, I think it is the User management session in Baan IV. Well, I checked the user in the corresponding session in Baan V and user is existed. I tried with the supper user &quot;baan&quot;, but not able to print any report.<br />
<br />
I remember having problem to open ttstpspooloen when user is defined only at the directory level<br />
<br />
I dont understand the above statment, could you please expalin a bit more. <br />

Thought  this may be the case in ur case.</div></div><hr />

I have checked in the user management session and user is existed. I tried to create the runtime DD for the user but its not continue because it try to open the ttstpsplopen session. Yes, I copied the user files in lib folder from the backup. <br />
<br />
Ok, if we assume that the u file  is exists in lib folder becasue I copied it from the backup, then how should I proceed to fix this problem, becasue I am not able to create the runtim DD.<br />

Thanks in advance<br />

Based on your recent threads about clone environment, I can suggest you to check the File Access Permissions of the whole BaaN setup, document what you are doing, and improvise on it.<br />
<br />
Check the directory permissions of $BSE/tools and $BSE/tmp they should have bsp owner and group write permissions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
kathuria: No, disk is not full, there more then 4 GB space available.<br />
<br />
NPRao: I have checked the permission on the directories $BSE/tools and $BSE/tmp , and permissions are ok, everyone has full control and Administrator is Owner as same as on the Live server. <br />
<br />
Is there any way that we can create a new user and test if the new user can able to do printing. Problem is to create runtime DD for user, the session ttstpsplopen is not starting. <br />
<br />
I will appriciate all suggestions to resolve this problem, it is sever problem.<br />

I debugged the report printing session and found that the problem is actually occurs at the following statement <br />
<br />
<br />
tccom.dll0010.report_id(i.report.number, i.curr.language) <br />
       = brp.open.language(spool.report, chr$(i.curr.language), i.sp.device,i.open.mode)<br />
<br />
<br />
in method &quot;tccom.dll0010.open.report&quot;. The program execution stucked at this statement. <br />
<br />
I appricaite all suggestions to resolve this problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">31st May 2005, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi MRF,<br />
don't know if this helps, but i had a similar problem almost a year ago after installing a new solution for ttstpsplopen which was corrupt. The session did not start and i could not install any other Solution.<br />
It was a problem of Runtime Data (table ttadv999).<br />
There i had to change the record for ttstpsplopen (advised by Baan Support)  because it contained a wrong value in the field ttadv999.desc.<br />
Here is the value in our environement:<br />
'0ottstpsplopen  |C0|ttaad306|21|1||01ttstpsplopend......'<br />
The problem was that after the first pipe there was an entry like M0(or N or P, i can not remember) which i had to change to C0.<br />
This fixed the problem.<br />
Maybe you can check your value.<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have checked the entry in table, the value is same as you mentioned. I think this is not the problem because on the Live server there is no such problem, and this new test server is clone of the Live server. All applicaiton objects and data is copied from the Live server. I think the problem is somewhere else but very little. <br />
<br />
Appriciate all suggestions to resolve this problem.<br />

jodijk: I checked the files $BSE/lib/dtopt* and compared with the Live server, these are same. Also copied them from the Live server and try again, but problem not resolved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st June 2005, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a thought - a couple of months ago ttdsk2080m000(Run program) stopped working in our test environment.  Baan found that one of our company 000 tables was missing a row (ttadv211).  You might want to check ttadv200, ttadv211(etc.) to make sure they match the company 000 in your production environment for this session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mark: I checked records in tables ttadv200 and ttadv201, it seems that records are same.<br />
<br />
Hitesh Shah: Yes, I am not able to convert users to DD becasue in in Baan V this open a report and get stuck at select device session. Is there any way that we can create the DD for user and bypass this select device session? becasue, I think it will help.<br />
