<br />
We have recently moved all of our printers from Unix driven printing to using BW Print in prep for our migration to a Windows/SQL platform.  I have one printer I can not move over because the printer has a signature DIMM in it. <br />
<br />
I have tried several different scenarios, but the current situation I am in is that I have to use the pp$ command in the report script (before.layout) to pass the specific escape codes for the signature to print.  Once the signature prints, I can't get the font to go back to what it was.  Normally, I've heard and read that you should be able to an \EE (esc + E) to reset the font, but it doesn't work.  I have tried several different things and I've decided to post the question to all to see if anyone has the same scenario and you know what I need to do.   <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />
