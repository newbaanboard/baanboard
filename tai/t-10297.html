<br />
We are currently looking at a consolidation exercise, moving from a multi-site configuration, to a single site set up. The moving/merging of the financial/logistics company data provides <br />
no serious issues that I can see. However, I was interested in if any of you fellow BaanBoarders have ever tried to consolidate two company 000's. I am aware that the company zero(s) will contain data that will be required in the new configuration (possibly device/job/user data, text data ) AND some information that will not require merging ( application configuration etc ).<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever attempted an exercise of this nature ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">9th June 2003, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I am currenlty merging 3 seperate Baan envs to one.<br />
Also all 3 have/had different versions of personlized/customized software.<br />
<br />
Also other things to note are things like:<br />
1) time zone differences (solved with the setting of the TZ var in the bw config).<br />
2) shared tables (pay attention to text tables as I had to unshare these).<br />
3) Group company functionality would be evident in the one server setup.  I had to load a few Baan solutions that fixed some finance reports showing trans from other companies.<br />
<br />
if you do a company dump to seq file to move the companies note that a dump will also contain the exchange /job / text data. The exchange schemes (source) also reside in UNIX so that had to be copied over.<br />
<br />
users/devices/authorizations are at 000 level and I bdbpre'd /posted the data. The Device data also uses drivers in the $BSE/lib/printinf dir so I had to copy these over as they were tweaked on the different servers to make them work properly (standard driver to not work properly).</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.. but as per usual a good answer always raises more questions !<br />
<br />
The job and text data is taken with the company data when using bdpre ? Have you ever attempted this using Oracle exports ?<br />
<br />
&quot;users/devices/authorizations are at 000 level and I bdbpre'd /posted the data&quot;  .... I haven't looked at this closely yet but I assume you selectively bdpre'd the required tables and then bdposted them into the target company zero. Was this a major task identifying which tables to bdpre/bdpost ?<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

The dump table (open range) to seq file for each company took approx 30 mins, with the create tables from seq file taking around 40 mins.<br />
<br />
Yes when moving the &quot;users/devices/authorizations&quot; data I used Append and sometime Overwrite selectivley.  Here is the tables that are not part of the dump to seq file that I had to move: (you may have to add a few more as we do not populate all tables)<br />
