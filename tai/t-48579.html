<br />
I want to use the homepage feature within webtop.<br />
but in the PMC, I really can find the addtional file which extension is &quot;har&quot;.<br />
<br />
But I cannot find it in the $BSE\application folder.<br />
<br />
I checked again the addtional file information, it said it was expired.<br />
<br />
I cannot understand the reason.<br />
<br />
why?</div></div><hr />

You have to check if the particular additional file exists or expired based on the package-afile-vrc combination. Additional files follow the same VRC derivation rules as sessions, scripts etc. They are typically located in $BSE\application\package-vrc\aVRC\a-filename.extension for application packages and for Tools you have to check under $BSE\tools</div></div><hr />

After installation of homepages in ${BSE}\Application You should find *.hpa files and *.rptdesign BUT if You using Windows, please check the solution 228620 (also 228656) and run ttcorhp_rest after installation.</div></div><hr />
