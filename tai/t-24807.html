<br />
Always make sure that before you install a Service Pack that you carefully  read the installation guide and also look in the Baan knowledge base for the latest &quot;solution&quot; information about the Service Pack to install, the solution nr. is even mentioned in the SP install guide. Latest found problems are mentioned in that &quot;solution&quot;. Always plan in advance!<br />
<br />
So you should check the above first, and only then ask for help, most people do not have at hand the resolution of problems associated with SP's unless they are dealing with such installation at the moment... and SP3 is very, very old, let's see if somebody still has a solution at hand for you...</div></div><hr />

You need to provide more details on the error and your installation steps. a Service pack installation on a demo period does not extend the demo period.<br />
and anyone know there are fast the way to install a lot of Service pack in one short?<br />
Search the threads, this has been discussed already. An example of it is this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=173&amp;highlight=service+pack+fast) .</div></div><hr />
