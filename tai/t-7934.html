<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khushro</div><div class="date">4th December 2002, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to have different date formats for Reports/Forms in 2 separate companies in the same BSE? I am referring to Baan V.<br />
<br />
If I have a company (say 100) that follows the US date format (mm/dd/yy) and want to have the European date format (dd/mm/yyyy) for a different company (say 200), is it possible? <br />
<br />
This is the only way I know in which date formats can be changed in Baan:<br />
<br />
·	You can specify date formats either by Language, or<br />
·	You can specify date formats by domains<br />
<br />
If you go to session ttaad1510m000 (Languages) you will see that date formats can be included by language. However, if we change the date format here, it will affect all companies that use the language  hence it is not company specific.<br />
<br />
If you go to session ttadv4580m000 (Date Formats), you can specify a date format code which can then be linked to a particular domain (for e.g., tc.date). This will also change the format of the date in all places where this domain occurs and can be used for report specific changes too. However, this again is not Company Specific in any way.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions/ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khushro</div><div class="date">4th December 2002, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but what if company 100 in the above example is a U.S company and company 200 is a U.K company. Both use English but require different date formats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">6th December 2002, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">In different programs (platforms like Linux/Windows) do have different languages for different countries with the same language (I always wondered what the difference would be between English (UK) English (US) and English (CDN) and all the other Englishes you can choose...). Baan is straightforward in its basic principle: all Englishes are English. If you want to distinguish, you'll need to make changes yourself...<br />
<br />
Maybe other US/UK companies can tell the standard work around for this...</div></div><hr />
