<br />
What is Transaction Notifications table (ttaud110) for in BaanERP? It seems to store every modification users made to BaanERP database. But after long operation, the table can grow so big without anyone ever bothering to see what it contains. In one of our client, after 3 years of operation the table containes 6.5 million records and takes up half Gigs of hard disk space to back up.<br />
<br />
I can't see any user interface provided by Baan to trim down this table. Of course we can trim it directly at DBMS level, but first we need to find out the significance of this table.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much, guys and girls<br />

Paul, I would suggest not to trim down the table from DBMS level. It holds all the audit transaction data/time/tables/sequence numbers etc.<br />
There is a session Purge Audit Files (ttaad4261m000) to remove the transaction notifications and also the corresponding $BSE/audit files logically. You can also setup to remove every 2 weeks of audit if you like to save space on disk and DB.</div></div><hr />

I didn't know that Purge Audit Files clears out this table as well. In fact, I'm confused what this Transaction Notifications table is actually for. Looking at it gives very little information of what happened. People might as well print out the audit file to know that<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">15th October 2005, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Paul, that table stores the basic transaction information and gives which audit sequence number file its written to. The actually field changed values are stored in the audit files.<br />
<br />
If you really want to do a complete clean up the easiest way is to truncate the table and also remove all the files in $BSE/audit</div></div><hr />
