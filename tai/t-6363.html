Thanks,:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hansbol</div><div class="date">26th September 2002, 11:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Just like on unix you can edit your ipc_info file so that you start an batch file in stead of starting the bshell6.1 directly.<br />
In your batch file you can search for user processes or just search for entries in the output of the license6.1 -w output.<br />
If the user exist in the output then disable starting the bshell6.1<br />
Of not start the bshell6.1<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this product pops up again and it works. Basically you can install this on the users machine and it can allow them to only load one version of Baan up at a time and even drop the users if they have been quiet for a length of time! This is a very quick way of saving licenses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">26th September 2002, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">A problem with CloseIdle is the need to install it on individual PC's.  This is not ideal for large operations.  The ipc_info solution should work well and is easily maintained in one location and... it's free.</div></div><hr />

I found it very useful. I have very limited licenses. Earlier for most of the day I used to just monitor the licenses, but now I just don't have to check them<br />
I have made a file in {/$BSE/lib/defaults} by the name &quot;all&quot; and put one line session_timeout:10 in it. Now any user not working for ten minutes gets BW connection snapped. <br />
You can also do this manipulation for all / somne / specific users too.<br />
<br />
Please check this solution for details.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day</div></div><hr />

I have already done this,  and its very usefull for me.  What i want to do is to limit the users from login in  twice or thrice  in the system.  In unix, i can do this one but in NT i don't have any idea.<br />

I don't know of a way to get the user name from the current process and compare with another user owned processes on the server side, and I searched all kind's of ps and similar tools made available for WinOS'es...<br />
I think you're stuck with a commercial app, and that's why most of the Sys. Admins. still like UX'es compared with Windows - too limited - unless someone out there an prove me wrong and there's a way to do it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some time ago a Baan employee posted actaully a solution here on baanboard to this issue. Unfortunately I could not find the posting anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the solution was a small windows executable to replace the bshell entry in ipc_info.<br />
<br />
The binary was called filterbgsb (or similar) and allowed restriction of users (even by group).<br />
<br />
If you search the archive properly, then you should find it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">28th October 2004, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear fnds,<br />
<br />
I wanted to control no. of logins per user and no. of licenses per coy in one baan server. (B40c4 SP14 /Win2000).<br />
<br />
I just wanted to try if replacing the bshell line with this exe if it works.<br />
 <br />
A)<br />
Created a simple vb application with one button as connectButton and a Shell command to run the ntbshell.exe as below.<br />
<br />
<br />
Private Sub ConnectCbt_Click()<br />
<br />
Dim t<br />
<br />
t = Shell(&quot;d:\baan\bin\ntbshell.exe&quot;, 1)<br />
<br />
MsgBox (&quot;Thank you for using BaaN&quot;)<br />
End<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
<br />
and created BaanLicChk.exe file from the above and placed it in d:\baan\bin folder of baan server.<br />
<br />
B)<br />
<br />
edited the ipc_info file in \baan\lib and replaced the following first line:<br />
<br />
bshell    s    $BSE\bin\ntbshell.exe<br />
with<br />
bshell    s    $BSE\bin\BaanLicChk.exe<br />
<br />
After this when we run bw.exe, the regular baan log-in screen comes and after user name / password entry and continuing the logon, I expected it to start my VB application; It does not; It just hangs at Baan start-up logo screen.<br />
<br />
ANY CLUES, it will greatly help me.<br />
<br />
wishes and best regards<br />

<br />
<br />
unfortunately you have the wrong concept in mind. Your approach assumes, that the ntbshell.exe is somehow transported to and executed on the client. But this is not what is happening!!<br />
<br />
The ntbshell.exe is executed on the server and talks in a properiatry protocol with the GUI. You can use the wraper, but you can not pop up a message or a window or something. Your wrapper must be completely transperant. It can decide to start the actual ntbshell (maybe with special parameters) or not. That's it!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">28th October 2004, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Mark<br />
<br />
yeah you are right.<br />
<br />
there is bw.exe Display Server ntbshell and sessions in baan though. <br />
But I wanted to foloow as guys have done using VB and if the user login is allowed then calling the ntbshell from within VB. Now how to call ntbshell from VB.<br />
<br />
I just used a bas module in VB without any form as below:<br />
<br />
Sub Main()<br />
<br />
    Dim t<br />
    <br />
    t = Shell(&quot;d:\baan\bin\ntbshell.exe&quot;, 0)<br />
    <br />
End Sub<br />
=&gt; BaanLicChk.exe... placed in ipc_info  in place of ntbshell.exe<br />
<br />
now I get a fatal error while logging-in and ntbshell not started.<br />
<br />
The error is Connection with server lost;Boot failed for user xxx server '10.1.1.47!bshell' bse d:\baan boot 'd:\baan\bin\ipc_boot6.1'<br />
<br />
can you tell me where i am going wrong. <br />
<br />
how to call ntbshell from VB (I recollect in NT it seems batch files not supported in ipc_info)<br />
<br />
thanks to you and everyone<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">29th October 2004, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">ok,<br />
<br />
here some guidelines:<br />
<br />
a) you are right, a batch will not work, you have to use a exe.<br />
<br />
b) Your wrapper exe is not allowed to show any dialog or form<br />
<br />
c) Your exe is not allowed to create any output at all<br />
<br />
d) in the end you have to call ntbshell, but do not forget to pass any command line arguments given to your wrapper also to the ntbshell<br />
<br />
e) now maybe a tricky bit, where I am not 100% sure, how it works in windows. In Unix the bshell and the GUI just communicate the via the normal input and output (stdin/stdout) mechanism. In windows you now have to make sure, that ntbshell &quot;inherits&quot; this input/output streams from your wrapper to be able to communicate.<br />
<br />
Hope this helped,<br />
