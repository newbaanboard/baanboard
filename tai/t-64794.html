Today, we were attempting to print a check and received an error that pertains to the audit server.<br />
<br />
I have read on this forum where several others have encountered this problem, but they were running on UNIX.  We only audit parameter files, so I do not understand why an AP transaction is trying to write to $BSE/audit.<br />
<br />
Help please,<br />

I have seen this error, when the audit file and the audit definitions are out of sync.<br />
In the even viewer it will tell you which table its having the problem and check whats the current audit sequence file and if that file exists under x:\baan\audit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">23rd November 2013, 07:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Please Check the Logs of the Error Message.<br />
<br />
I once had the same Error. Commit Transaction Failed in the Audit Server. <br />
<br />
And when i checked the Logs it was saying Maximum Audit Records Reached per table. Finally it was due to the Lack of Upgrade of Porting sets. When i upgraded my Porting Set the Value was gone.<br />
<br />
For example, 32767 is the Value of AUDIT_MAX. After upgrading the Value increases.<br />
<br />
Try Upgrading your Porting Set.</div></div><hr />
