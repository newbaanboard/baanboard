<br />
Nornally, the data is all in the first column with the &quot;|&quot;. Then we manually format it with Text to Column in Excel. <br />
<br />
Now, there are some users just encounter the issue that the data is not all in the first column and it's all mess up. It was working fine before. I don't know what happen. PLEASE HELP!!!!  <br />
:confused:<br />
The Excel Device is setup as follow:<br />
4GL Program: ttstpconv<br />
ArgumentASCII: EXCEL.EXE %s<br />
path: ${BSE}/tmp/file1.xls</div></div><hr />

The device definition seems ok. I should check on the client side configuration. Or, perhaps if the problem are not present in all reports, check the particular report that you users report. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bkkland</div><div class="date">19th March 2008, 00:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is a problem with the latest update for MS Excel 2003. This not happen to all users. I found that it happens to the users who have installed the MS08-014 Security update for Excel 2003. <br />
<br />
I find that there is a known issue with this MS08-014 update, but it does not actually related to Text To Column function. How can I fix this? Any idea?? <br />
<br />
THANK YOU :confused:</div></div><hr />

Excel opens always a tmpxxxxx.txt.<br />
So the problem remains. We have the same problem.<br />

<br />
this is related to the country settings in Windows. Please refer to my post here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=47901&amp;highlight=EXCEL)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">inalfa01</div><div class="date">4th April 2008, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that the separator setting is applicable on a csv file.<br />
But Baan doesn't generate a csv file.<br />
If using UNIX/AIX always a .txt file is generated, so the problem remains the same!</div></div><hr />

In order to review the problem, Can you post here, some screen shots of the information?</div></div><hr />

I belive it is a client side configuration problem. Can you post a sample file?<br />
I will try to import to excel. My first impression is that the client have been defined pipe like separator from somewhere else, bsides excel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">errollindner</div><div class="date">9th April 2008, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the file.<br />
We also have a custom made device that uses a 4GL program :otccomwordexc<br />
In the &quot;argument&quot; it uses a excel template specified on a windows server.<br />
I have rewritten the Macro and filtered out the delimiters.<br />
Now everything is put into 1 cell and our users can use the wizard &quot;text to columns&quot; themselves.<br />
<br />
I don't have an anwser for the device that uses the 4GL program &quot;ttstpconv&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
are you sure that the user chooses delimited as option when opening the file in Excel. The only way i can reproduce your problem in by clicking Finish when the Text Import Wizard starts (Screen 1 of 3) and the default setting for Original Datatype is set to Fixed Width.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">10th April 2008, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I succesfully imported the data of your file to an excel sheet.<br />
Also in your message says, that you are using a macro to do the distribution fo the data acrosss the excel columns, right?<br />
<br />
So, my dear friend, this is not a Baan related problem. Your macro is not working as expected. Therefore, if your macro have not been modified, then, almos sure you have installed something Microsoft patch that modifies your macro! At this point my only sugestion is to try your macro on a fresh Microsoft office instalation.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

bkkland already mentioned this!!! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have solved the problem by editing the macro.<br />
Now everything is placed into 1 cell.<br />
Then the user can use the &quot;text to columns&quot; wizard.<br />
<br />
Everything works fine now.<br />
<br />
Greetings Errol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">inalfa01</div><div class="date">15th April 2008, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Can You share the macro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">inalfa01</div><div class="date">15th April 2008, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Using Excel %s in session ttaad3100m000 with path: baan.csv solves the problem. You have to set your windows list separator of course.<br />
Now the Baan output is directly placed into the columns properly!<br />
<br />
Only disadvantage is that this solution uses a fixed filename (baan.csv in this example) i.o. an unique name in the old way of working. So You can open only 1 excel output at a time.<br />
Does anyone have a solution to solve this (by creating unique filenames at runtime)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richard</div><div class="date">27th April 2008, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
There is a solution in codes &amp; utilities to produce an excel friendly file.<br />
It needs an awk but was also translated by others on windows.<br />
The csv file cuts with 0 starting numeric columns but works fine.<br />
<br />

Yes - can you share this solution and macro?  None of the other solutions will work at our site.  We can't change the list separator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanessa C</div><div class="date">16th June 2008, 05:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
We have also a number of users (including myself last week) where exactly the same thing started to happen. It was OK one day and then the following day when choosing device 'Excel' the Baan reports automatically split into columns (incorrectly) instead of placing the data in Column A. It is infuriorating.<br />
<br />
Reading the previous posts it is implied that the problem is related to a Microsoft update - is this correct?  Some of you have also talked about macros - have you had to edit a automatic Excel macro for importing text files. To me it seems stupid to have to create your own macros.<br />
<br />
So what I really want to know is ..<br />
1 - do we know what has definitely caused this problem?\ &amp; can we avoid it for future users?<br />
2 - Is so what is the quickest solution (apart from sending the report to Wordpad, cutting and pasting into Excel and then continuing as normal with the Text to Columns feature?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
We submitted a case to Baan Support to see if they have any solution. There a patch but not sure it working or not after installing the patch.</div></div><hr />
