<br />
I use Baan IVC4 with NT Enterprise 4.0 and SQL Server 7.0. I already create baan user &quot;baan &quot; ; database &quot;baandb&quot; with database user &quot;baan &quot;. Today I want to create 2 more baan user &quot;ptc&quot; and &quot;isc&quot; with same baan database dan same database user. I already create all by the book, and link it to existing, but I can login with two new login. The message is &quot;510 error database not on&quot;. Can someone helpme ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Do you have other errors before that 510 or just after that 510 error?<br />
Is your database up and running fine?</div></div><hr />

Maybe I must explain about my problem in detail, so you can help me more precisely. We already have Baan user &quot;baan&quot; with Database user &quot;baan&quot; and database group &quot;baandb&quot;. It is work, mean we can login to Baan with this baan user and no error.<br />
For practice purpose, we want to create another 2 baan user which are &quot;ptc&quot; and &quot;isc&quot;. We want these new 2 baan user connect to database user &quot;baan &quot; and database group &quot;baandb&quot;.<br />
So we create in Maintain User data; go to Maintain Link Between Baan user dan database user (Some step convert dan dumb, just write on the book/instruction). After that we saw in session Maintain link Baan user &amp; Database user, 3 of baan user which are : &quot;baan&quot; (the first one) and &quot;ptc&quot; &amp; &quot;isc&quot; (2 new baan user) connect with database user &quot;baan&quot; and database group  &quot;baandb&quot;. When we want to login to Baan use both &quot;ptc&quot; or &quot;isc&quot; the error message pop up. It say &quot;Error 510 (Database not on) on select - can not continue in ottstpstdlib (mess). <br />
If we use &quot;baan&quot; for login to Baan there no error like that.<br />
<br />
I hope you can help me after read this message,<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">h3nry_99</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Today, I add user isc and ptc that already built with administrator access in NT Server. The result is that both isc and ptc can be use to login to Baan. So I think the procedure that I allready done for create isc and ptc and link it are right. But the problem are not solve with this action, because we want to create other users and we don't want to give administrator right to all user. Any suggestion, how to do that ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">This sounds more like a database problem than Baan. If I get this right, you have set up these users as admins in NT and they can now log in, so all admins at an NT level can login but others cannot.. Is this right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">h3nry_99</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 03:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, if the NT user is administrator, the Baan user that I  create have no error like 510 error. So which part must I setup to fix it ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">You should give the users the policy to be able to start a process on the server. It's not necessary to give them admin rights but because admin has these rights it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">h3nry_99</div><div class="date">4th September 2001, 05:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I am busy lately, so I am sorry for that. By the way, can someone give the clue what I should do next, for give the right to user (What right ?) beside give administrator right.<br />
<br />
One more thing,<br />
<br />
When I use new user and want to change company, the Baan don't allow this because I can't change the VRC. When I want to do that from session, there are password must be filled. I try all password that I have, but still can't enter the session. Where should I request for that password ( because as I remember, I never change any password )<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The problem is allready solve, when we check in the NT license. Someone forget to input how many user are allow in per server license. <br />
