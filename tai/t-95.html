<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are some information about settings for bshell (BaanIV).<br />
<br />
1. Start with a bshell6.1 -? (ntbshell.exe on NT)<br />

<br />
2. You can also get debug information from the Baan database driver by using -- -set TT_SQL_TRACE=value (or added values) to get info about Baan SQL queries beeing handled:<br />
<br />
value description<br />
000040 show queries wih their QID<br />
000200 show query exec. times <br />
002000 show calls of internal SQL functions<br />
004000 show query eval. plan (client+server)<br />
010000 show quey ev. plan (server)<br />
020000 show all full table scans<br />
<br />
3. Or use -- -set DBSLOG=value (or added values) to get debug info from the online processing of the database driver:<br />
<br />
value description<br />
0000001 data dict. info of tables<br />
0000002 query info (sql level 1)<br />
0000004 query info (sql level 2)<br />
0000010 row action info<br />
0000020 table action info<br />

0002000 query processing info<br />
0004000 data buffering info (communication)<br />
<br />
4. Then you have other options like:<br />
<br />
-- -set PACKAGE_COMB=package combination  to login into specific package combination<br />
-- -set BSE_COMPNR=company  to login into specific company<br />
-- -set USER=baan_user  to login using a different user that the login one (use 1 system login with several Baan logins!)<br />
-- -set RDS_FULL=value  to define max. nr. rows transfered between client and server as one block (good for imports/exports)<br />
-- -set BDB_DEBUG=value  (like DBSLOG/TT_SQL_TRACE, less used...)<br />
-- -set DS_AS=bshell_name  [for ba6.1 only, to specify a specific bshell name from ipc_info]<br />
-- -set BSE_TMP=temporary folder  to use a different temporary folder 9other than $BSE/tmp)<br />
-- -set BSE_LANG=value  to change language (2=English, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is an excelent thread.<br />
I just have a question:<br />
Is it possible to combine several options?<br />
I tried to do something like this: -- -set TWO_TASK=baanIV -set BSE_COMPNR=803, but it has no effect.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use more than one of these - I have often used these 3 together in the command line:<br />
<br />
-- -set PACKAGE_COMB=B40Cc4XX -set BSE_COMPNR=123 -set BSE_LANG=2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Bogdan,<br />
<br />
That will not work if the company you specified is not on the same package combination of the user or the user has no access to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">13th September 2001, 03:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I found some old info from my emails, which I wanted to share.<br />
<br />
-- -set ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE=VALUE[, -set [ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES]=[VALUE],...]<br />
<br />
Environment Variables<br />
PACKAGE_COMB  --&gt; overrides the package combination in your user data.<br />
BAAN_SCM_GRP --&gt; sets your checkout directory so more everyone that uses the same group can see your changes.<br />
SUPPRESS_WINHELP=1 --&gt; if you choose help the baan help appears instead of the windows version of the baan help.<br />
TEST_RETRY=X --&gt; This variable indicates how often the system must go back to a retry point at the moment of committing. This cannot be used when testing different sessions with retry points parallel.<br />
MAX_RETRY=X	 --&gt; This variable indicates how often the system may return to a retry point as a result of an abort in an update action. Default: 10<br />
CUNO_SRC=1 --&gt; Is needed when exporting Baan components to Scopus</div></div><hr />

<br />
How does one find what the variables are that can be set? Where is the documentation for this? Does it change between versions of Baan?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just found that info from my old back up emails... so I thought it might be useful to post here.<br />
<br />
I did not find any more documentation. But I guess some of those variable which can be set, might be some global external variables from the bshell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 04:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I have recently found 2 more new options <br />
<br />
-- -set USE_BMASK_AS_ABSOLUTE=1 -set BMASK=02<br />
<br />
I am wondering if there is any session in baan where we can set the default masks for file creations like in umask in UNIX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">18th February 2002, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I found few more options -<br />
<br />
-set BAAN_WIN_TITLE=BaaN-ERP-Series would show the string BaaN-ERP-Series in the title of all Baan sessions.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, there are some predefined strings that can be used in the window title string.  They are:<br />
<br />
%C	Company Name <br />
%c	Company Number<br />
%h	Host Name<br />
%p	Package Combination<br />
%S	Session Name<br />
%s	Session Code<br />
%u	Userid</div></div><hr />

<br />
we are working on Unix. But I guess it should also work on NT too so you can test it out.<br />
<br />
You can use those option from the BaaN Configuration File, Bshell environment and Commands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">18th February 2002, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I read on a thread where output from these commands goes by default, but I cannot find it now.<br />

Where on my NT would I find the file to see if this is working?<br />

I used the option Baan_Win_Title with menu browser and it works great but when I tried to use it with DEM browser, the system did not use the information I specified in the Baan_Win_Title. Is it possible to change the title bar in DEM browser just like in the menu browser?<br />

<br />
Thank you for the information. I'll check it out.<br />
<br />
Is there an equivalent of Baan_Win_Title in BaanIV or does it depend on the porting set of my Baan instance?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I have opened a case with Baan support regarding the BAAN_WIN_TITLE variable for BaanIVc4.  Baan's response is that it is not support at this time; however, they have received a couple of cases in the last few weeks about this and have opened an Enhancement Request to backport this to BaanIVc4.  They are attaching any cases regarding this to the Enhancement Request to show that there is a need.<br />
<br />
I am asking anyone with BaanIVc4 to open a Baan case.(It can even be a priority 40) asking for information regarding BAAN_WIN_TITLE for BaaNIVc4.  If there is enough demand then for it then it improves the possibility that Baan will do it.<br />
<br />
We have multiple systems and multiple companies.  We have users that have access across the systems and companies and it can get quite confusing for them.  BAAN_WIN_TITLE would allow us to display the hostname and the company name in the title of each Baan window.<br />
<br />
Originally we were looking to use different colors but BAAN_WIN_TITLE would work just as well and should be significantly easier to implement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-dbgdata : show datainput options (not for fields!) <br />
-dbgobj : show object information <br />
-dbgref : show reference paths <br />
-dbgfun : debug functions <br />
-dbgsrv : show bdb server type <br />
-dbglck : show locking errors <br />

You can use %f to display the filtername in the titlebar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">2nd April 2003, 02:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I found one more environment variable -<br />
<br />
Audit management - Tools Technical Manual <br />
<br />
File security for various audit management files<br />
It is important that the audit_spec file has read permission for all users, and that<br />
write permission is granted only to the administrator user. Otherwise users other<br />
than the administrator can change the security parameter in the file, which would<br />
allow them illegal access.<br />
Audit server debugging options<br />
For debugging purposes, a code is put in the audit server at appropriate stages to<br />
print useful information. In normal usage, this printing is not enabled. You can<br />
enable it by setting an AUDITLOG environment variable. You can print various<br />
types of information by setting this variable to different values. The values must<br />
be set as octals.<br />
0001 General information.<br />
0002 Print audit rows generated.<br />
0004 Print audit-data dictionary for table.<br />
0010 Print data structures such as information header, sequence header, and<br />
transaction header.<br />
The information is put in a log file. The name of the file is audit.log.pid of the<br />
server. This file is created in the current directory of the audit server.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">17th March 2004, 01:46</div></div><div class="posttext">SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
For Financial and Logistic Company functionality is build in, in change company but there are no envirioment variables to influence the startup Financial and Logistic Company.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
2 new envirioment variables are introduced.<br />
<br />
BSE_LOG_COMPNR and BSE_FIN_COMPNR for logistic and financial company. These environment vars can be used simular to BSE_COMPNR<br />
<br />
More Info -<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
&quot;Change Company&quot; (ttdsk2003m000)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
For some customer configurations it is needed to switch to the financial company as soon a financial session is started. And also to switch to the logistical company as soon a logistic session is started. If a user forgot to change the company and does an action in the wrong company then this can have bad complications.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
In the &quot;User Data&quot; session ttams1100s000 there are 2 extra fields added. &quot;Logistical Company&quot; and &quot;Financial Company&quot;. These 2 fields are not mandatory and can stay empty. When empty the new functionality is not available. When these 2 fields are filled then the new functionality becomes active.<br />
<br />
 <br />
The new functionality is that a company switch to the logistic or to the financial company is done before the session is started.<br />
<br />
In the new session ttaad1105m000 &quot;Start Company by Module&quot; you can specify per module if a session should be started in the Logistic or in the Financial Company. If the module of a session is not mentioned then it will be started in the actual company.<br />
<br />
Change Company is also modified for this new functionality.<br />
It shows the &quot;Current Company&quot; and the Logistic and Financial Company. All these 3 companies can be changed.<br />
<br />
If in &quot;Maintain User Data&quot; the extra fields are not filled then the original change company dialog comes up.<br />
<br />
This solution contains a Functional Addition. Please read solution 134994 for the background of Functional Changes.<br />
<br />
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:<br />
To use the new functionality you also need the new worktop Version 2.2.28 See Solution 13964</div></div><hr />

<br />
---------------------------<br />
I found few more options -<br />
<br />
-set BAAN_WIN_TITLE=&#8221;BaaN-ERP-Series&#8221; would show the string &#8220;BaaN-ERP-Series&#8221; in the title of all Baan sessions.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, there are some predefined strings that can be used in the window title string. They are:<br />

 <br />
Solution description <br />
VERSION(S): <br />
BaanIVc, from BW version B40c.052 (Porting Set 6.1c.05 and onwards)<br />
BaanERP, from BW version 7.1a. (Porting Set 7.1a)<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
BW.exe<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
User A saves the password into the bwc file, and User B tries to run this bwc file.<br />
Because User B is not the same as User A, User B will be asked for the password.<br />
This is a correct way of working of BW and implies security.<br />
<br />
But, now User A wants to give away the right to log in Baan to User B, without making his password public to User B.<br />
<br />
To make this possible, a new command line option for BW is introduced: -giveaway=&lt;username&gt; (or instead of the dash sign, you may also use the / sign: /giveaway=&lt;username&gt;)<br />
<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Saving password information &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
When starting BW Configuration bw is started with the option /config. So,<br />
<br />
bw.exe /config<br />
<br />
starts BW Configuration.<br />
<br />
Here you can switch on &quot;Save Password&quot; and type in the password.<br />
After pressing Save (As) the following is done by bw.exe:<br />
<br />
The password is encrypted, together with the current username.<br />
So, when you are logged in Windows as user &quot;baan&quot;, the password is encrypted together with username &quot;baan&quot;.<br />
<br />
The encrypted information is written to the bwc file.<br />
When opening the bwc file using Notepad you will see the following line:<br />
<br />
password64=82XG#^f&quot;Tdt0GYF&lt;+;3fB@]7.2n1&gt;u'K9*I:t^cxx&lt;:vZ{F&lt;+;4fB@]1.2n1&gt;f'D<br />
<br />
for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Reading password information &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
At the moment you run the bwc file, containing the encrypted password, the following happens:<br />
<br />
BW determines the current Windows login and checks whether the current Windows login equals to the username, encrypted together with the password. (read from the line &quot;password64&quot;)<br />
<br />
In case the current Windows login is the same as the username, encrypted together with the password no Login Dialog will pop up, and you can login Baan straight away using this password information.<br />
<br />
In case the current Windows login is NOT the same as the username, encrypted together with the password the Login Dialog will pop up, asking you for the password. (Also when viewing the password field via BW Configuration, the password field is greyed out).<br />
<br />
In this way password information can only be used by the person who saved this password information.<br />
<br />
<br />
Give away your login credentials<br />
=========================<br />
A new BW option is introduced: /giveaway=&lt;username&gt;<br />
<br />
When specifying this option, for example:<br />
<br />
bw.exe /giveaway=baan /config test.bwc<br />
<br />
the following happens when saving password information:<br />
<br />
Now the password of the user, specified in the field &quot;Connect As&quot;, is not encrypted with the current username, but encrypted with the username specified by the /username option.<br />
<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE(S):<br />
<br />
Situation 1:<br />
-----------------<br />
I am logged in Windows as user &quot;jjohn&quot;, and open my bwc file &quot;baanserver.bwc&quot;.<br />
<br />
In fact, bw.exe is started as follows: bw.exe /config baanserver.bwc<br />
<br />
The followng is specified:<br />
<br />
Hostname: baanserver<br />
Connect As: jjohn<br />
Password: &lt;password of jjohn&gt;<br />
<br />
Now, when pressing &quot;Save (As)&quot; the password of jjohn is encrypted together with username &quot;jjohn&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Situation 2:<br />
-----------------<br />
I am logged in Windows as user &quot;jjohn&quot;, and open my bwc file &quot;baanserver.bwc&quot;, and specify the giveaway option:<br />
<br />
so, bw.exe is started as follows: bw.exe /giveaway=psmith /config baanserver.bwc<br />
<br />
The followng is specified:<br />
<br />
Hostname: baanserver<br />
Connect As: jjohn<br />
Password: &lt;password of jjohn&gt;<br />
<br />
Now, when pressing &quot;Save (As)&quot; the password of jjohn is encrypted together with username &quot;psmith&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now, user jjohn has given the &quot;right&quot; away to user psmith to run his bwc file, using his password information, without publishing the real password.<br />
When user &quot;psmith&quot; is logged in Windows, and runs the &quot;baanserver.bwc&quot; configuration, he will not be asked for the password, as he has the right to &quot;re-use&quot; the password information of &quot;jjohn&quot;. (Without knowing the password of user &quot;jjohn&quot;).</div></div><hr />

DAL2 Test Mode<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Overview<br />
By means of the DAL2_TEST_MODE environment variable it is possible to test different aspects of a DAL2 DAL from the User Interface. The DAL2_TEST_MODE environment variable must be set in the BW Configuration file and can have the following values: <br />
<br />
Value  Aspect Explanation<br />
 <br />
0  None  Test mode is off<br />
 <br />
1  Derived fields<br />
 All display maintable fields are shown as input fields. This makes it possible to see whether derived fields are made readonly. <br />
 <br />
2  (Never) applicable, readonly and derived fields and (never) applicable standard and form commands (business methods)<br />
 Same as Mode 1 + All fields and commands stay enabled. In this way is is possible to see if the DAL blocks certain field changes and business methods. <br />
 <br />
3 Same as Mode 2 + updating dependent fields<br />
 Same as Mode 2 + Dependent fields are not updated (no defaulting). <br />

Yes, I just tried it, using the &quot;bshell&quot; entry in the ipc_info file, as it just executes bshell6.1.  Good suggestion; I would never have thought of it.<br />
<br />
However, for all my users, I have them execute one of several other entries that execute another file in the /$BSE/bin folder, like bshellm.  This script sets values for the tmp folder, etc., and sets the Time Zone for the user -- we have 4 locations in 3 different time zones.  It also does some other checking, like UNIX password aging checking and forcing user to change password.  I don't know any other way to do these things, but if there is so I can just execute bshell6.1, that might work.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Okay, now I am really interested. I created a session group, I added two sessions to that session group, I entered that session group to my user data, created runtime, checked my bw configuration and my ipc_info file, loggin in (bw) - and: nothing happens; no automatically startup of any sessions. Hmmh. Could you please show me your bw configuration and ipc_info entry that works? Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">18th May 2007, 02:25</div></div><div class="posttext">BDB_ALWAYS_FLUSH<br />
<br />
Note<br />
Introduced in portingset 6.1c.08, 7.1d.09, 7.6a.02 and 7.6b (March 2005)<br />
This environment variable is intended for test, trace and debug environments only<br />
<br />
Problem <br />
<br />
In the SSA ERP LN environment a DML (Data Manipulation Language like insert, update or delete) action is normally delayed. until the next query is going to be executed. Just before this next query the DML action will be done. This is done to keep the length of the lock that is caused by the DML operation to a minimum amount of time. When debugging, testing or tracing with e.g. Call Graph Profiler this behavior can give unexpected results. Unexpected results in a normal environment could be:<br />
When a DML action hits a locked record, it will do the actual statements on the next query. When that next query is a normal query it looks very weird that the debugger goes back to a retry point on that query Time on a query looks extremely long (as a delete operation was executed before. This delete forced to check a reference in another table). <br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
To force an immediate action on a DML action, the DML action could be extended with a third argument (eflag) but this can influence the behavior of the session and asks for additional coding. <br />
Therefore the variable BDB_ALWAYS_FLUSH has been introduced. When setting the variable to a non-zero value like BDB_ALWAYS_FLUSH=1 all DML actions will be flushed immediately instead of being buffered.</div></div><hr />

TOOLS VERSION(S):<br />
7.6_a2<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Start up of sessions is very slow since FP2 or an higher version has been installed. Performance analysis will show a count which will be done at the start of every multi-occurrence session. This count is needed to determine the number of rows in the session. This is used to determine the position and size of the block in the vertical scroll bar of the session. Since FP2 the scroll bar can be on any position. There used to be only three positions of the scroll bar, namely: first record, last record and somewhere in between. Now you can actual see on which record it is.<br />
<br />
This new functionality could lead to performance problems. An extra query needs to be executed at the start of every multi-occurrence session. The record count on Baan environments containing a lot of data could take a long time. This results in a slow start of sessions.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The record and the new scroll bar functionality can be disabled by adding the next line to the file $BSE/lib/bse_vars:<br />
<br />
SCROLL_LIMIT=-1<br />

On a Windows platform you have to add this variable via the Baan NT Manager (bentman) =&gt; Right Mouse click on LN ERP Icon =&gt; Environment Variables<br />

SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
<br />
These are the symptoms of a situation where memory usage exceeds available RAM<br />

<br />
The variable BC_MEMDIALOG was activated before the tests<br />

0- When the memory of the server is completely allocated, a message appears on the server: Failed to allocate: 65536 bytes in &quot;BCPoolAlloc&quot;. Used: 0 bytes.<br />
1- When you click [OK] a small part of RAM is freed but memory remains allocated at 98%<br />
2- A dialog box appears: &quot;...invalid database file format.&quot;<br />
3- Once the server window is closed memory is freed.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Current customers which use very large databases 200 to 300+ MBytes should have the variable BC_MEMDIALOG exported in the System or User environment. The variable must be activated on the server. This way we get the dialog box on the server indicating the error message &quot;BCMEMPOOL failed to allocate 645556..... bytes of memory&quot;. The activation of the variable allows memory problems to be intercepted with more explicit error messages and without the need to trace the problem in a debug environment.<br />

AFAIK ascii-mode from Baan V on upwards does only work for certain sessions like bdbpost and such for installation purposes. All other menues/sessions are for GUI only.<br />
So I would guess that this switch might work for Baan IV, but will be ignored in later versions.<br />
