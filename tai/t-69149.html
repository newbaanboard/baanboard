<br />
It can be done through Role Based Authorization.<br />
<br />
Just create a role and add this session to the session authorization by session with &quot;No Authorization&quot; flag. Now, attach the role to the user and he won't have the access anymore.<br />
<br />
Similar can be done using session authorization by company. Just give &quot;No Authorization&quot; to the company you would want to restrict the user. So, the switching wont work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then create a role for super user as well. Grant full permissions to all the sessions and all VRC's except for the change company(ttdsk2003m000). Let them be normal users with access to everything except the change company session.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
a LN/BaaN Super-User has all authorisation (No restricts) !<br />
<br />

<br />
I am not talking about the AAD roles. By role, I mean, AMS roles(ttams2100m000)<br />
<br />
For creating a role for super user, you can give full table access, full library access and full company access for the companies they are permissible.<br />
<br />
For this, you may use - <br />
<br />
Session Authorization by Company<br />
Table Autorization by Company<br />
Library Authorization<br />
<br />
Now make the super user a normal user and assign this new role to the user.</div></div><hr />
