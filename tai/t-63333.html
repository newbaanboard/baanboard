Hello, I get problems when trying reconfigure a very big table to add a new index , I get db connection disconnected. The people tell me that the problem is probably due to too slow disk. I don't know if this is relevant but I got the idea that if I manage to slow down the reconfig it may work OR add the index some other way.<br />
<br />
Over the years I have learnt that when loading very big tables with &quot;create table from seq dump&quot;, ttaad4227m000, it is better to NOT check to create rows before index. This is what sets me on the slow down trace.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? For info: in this env, no classical write to file and in again happens, the reconfig just creates the index as far as I understand.<br />
<br />
Can I slow down the reconfig process in the server or can I create the index some other way with the effect of not getting problems with slow disks.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget to remove the conversion flags otherwise the file will be reconfigured again the next time you start it.<br />
<br />
I am not telling you it will work, but perhaps it's solves your problem.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />
