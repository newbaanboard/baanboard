<br />
We migrated from Oracle 9i to 10g. Before migration, we took sequential dump of tables (t1), after migration again we took the sequential dump (t2). We have found that the data present in dump file is the same, but the order of records has changed. :confused: <br />
<br />
Does any one have any idea why this happens? Is this order random? Can any one explain internals of bdbpre?<br />
<br />

<br />
If no index is specified by bdbpre when selecting data, the database might return the data in the order it's stored in the database, which is very likely the order of inserting the data. Note: Baan is not using clustered indexes etc.<br />
<br />
As the origional table was build over time (with inserts, deletes, updates) etc, but the new table was inserted during a load, the order is most likely different.<br />

<br />
How to specify the index for bdbpre? Can it be specified by user? I believe the export command of oracle is used internally by bdbpre to create sequential dump.<br />
<br />
And we have not made any changes in OS or Baan driver or any part of Baan software. Only the DBMS version has been upgraded.<br />
<br />
Also, we took one more sequential dump yesterday and found out that this order is different than the previous 2 dumps...:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">6th March 2007, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no option to specify the index and I do not think the Oracle exp command is used internally by bdbpre. Several reasons:<br />
<br />
- bdbpre works even though the views used by exp are not present i nthe system<br />
<br />
- exp can not be used to create such an output<br />
<br />
- exp is much faster than bdbpre</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaukul</div><div class="date">6th March 2007, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks...<br />
<br />
But I am still not satisfied with our discussion. If exp is not being used by Baan, it must be running select * ...... on the table.<br />
<br />
About exp command, the output can be formatted by Baan driver to look in the sequential dump format.<br />
<br />
I will again try to take the sequential dump and see if the output is same OR not.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyways..<br />
