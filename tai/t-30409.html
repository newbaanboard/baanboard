<br />
I'am trying to upgrade my LN Sp1 machine to Sp3.<br />
What I planning is that i have created a parallel update VRC to Update standard, so that i have two parallel environments on SP1 and SP3 each.<br />
<br />
While doing installations, the tools part has been updatd to SP3 but while upgrading other applications the installation wizard is looking to download a number of solns from B61_a3 directory of BaaN ftp site. The system is looking to download and scan soln 213921, but this soln is not at all available on the directory. This is resulting in the failure of the installation process repeatedly giving the message that soln file not found.<br />
<br />
As a precondition to upgrade I had installed soln 212227 in Sp1 environment.<br />
<br />
Please suggest what has to be done in this case.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

1. Log an inquiry at Infor. State that you need solution 213921 for FP3 (B61_a3). For each solution created for an lower FP/SP, Infor has to supply the same solution for the newer FP/SPs. Either included in the FP/SP or a separately on the FTP server. This solution seems to have been created for SP1 after FP3 has been frozen, so it should be available on the FTP server.<br />
2. Uninstall solution 213921 in your SP1 environment, install FP3 and then install the solution again in the SP1 environment.<br />
3. Let PMC ignore the solutions that were installed on top of SP1. This will allow you to install the 'clean' FP3 in another Update VRC. Note that this is a risky operation. Suppose you installed a lot of solutions on top of SP1. When you transfer your companies to your FP3 package combination, you will get back old problems, and even you may loose data. That is the reason why PMC checks whether all solutions you installed on top of lower FP/SPs, are present for the new FP/SP and are installed in one go with the new FP/SP. To influence this behavior, see solution 209469. But again, be carefull with it.</div></div><hr />
