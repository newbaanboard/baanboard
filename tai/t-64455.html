<br />
One of the Baan Job which is launched by Tivoli, a Job Scheduler installed on the same Server, goes into Waiting Status.<br />
<br />
I checked the details of it. Suppose right now the time is 10:39 and at this time the job is launched by Tivoli and then Next Execution Time gets updated as 10:39 in Maintain Job Data and it goes into Waiting.<br />
<br />
Tivoli is configured as EST/EDT Time Zone and the Baan TZ are shown in MET. But i am not sure as this would be the reason as the same configuration works in the Live Server Environment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">13th August 2013, 09:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Not. The Baan Job is Set Up as any other Baan Job. The External Scheduler just makes use of a shell script which in turn launches ba6.1 ottaad9999 to launch the desired Job.<br />
<br />
Although i am not exactly sure how ba6.1 ottaad9999 works.</div></div><hr />
