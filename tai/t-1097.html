i have the following problem when putting a self-developed session in a job.<br />
The session creates an ASCII-file from a BAAN-Table.<br />
I used the seq.* functions for creating this file.<br />
When i put this Session to a job, the job works fine when i activate it via<br />
ttaad5203m000, but when it is activated via jobdeamon the job hangs. <br />
I think there is no Problem with authorizations.<br />
Logged on as Jobuser i can run the job, and the file is created.<br />
Any hints?<br />
We are on AIX with Baan 5c.<br />

Each jobdaemon must be started by a job user connected to the correct package combination and company, otherwise it doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

The Jobuser has the right package combination.<br />
When I'm logged on as this User I can start the job via ttaad5203 and it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depending on how you start the jobdeamon, you could end up with an other user - if that is the case you have to remove the commments for <br />
<br />
USER=job_user; export USER<br />
<br />
to get Baan to understand which user to start as.<br />

 :) <br />
<br />
Yes, I tried with some other sessions like normal print-sessions.<br />
They are executed by jobdaemon.<br />

<br />
Thats not the Problem, because when I'm logged on as the Job-User, the ASCII-File is created.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In program script I used the seq.* functions to create the ASCII-File. In Tools Help there is a hint under the Header 'Context'  that these functions are bshell functions. <br />
Is it possible that the jobdeamon don't 'know' these functions because there is no bshell used (think I read this somewhere).<br />
