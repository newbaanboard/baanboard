I am a new administrator from Poland and unfortunately I have no one to help me so I have to do it myself.<br />
We plan to migrate from FP7 on Windows and MSQL to 10.7.<br />
I will be grateful for any documentation related to this process. The best step by step what should be done to transfer data from one FP7 server to another with LN 10.7.<br />
If someone can help me somehow, I would be very grateful.</div></div><hr />

I think that I am not the first person to carry out the migration process, but I am the person who does it for the first time :(<br />
Please help me.<br />
What steps do I need to follow.<br />
Could someone describe at least the first step?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">28th August 2020, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We're doing a full flag LN 10.2 (&quot;FP8&quot;) to LN 10.7 migration project with some optimizations. This Project is already running 6 month and will take another 6 month. We're now around 60 persons involved in the Project (technical stuff intern and extern, key users, external consultans). This is our first time we’re doing a LN 10.7 migration, too. We'll it's always first time for any migration. ;-)<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about your question from the time you created it.<br />
<br />
To be honest: I don't know what to answer.<br />
<br />
See: I'm from the technical stuff, but I'm doing migration of addon programming (converting from classic BECS to extensions).  That’ll be one of your steps, too. But it’s only one…<br />
The Installation of LN 10.7 and the data Migration has been done by our Infor Partner. We've created the Server instance before that (Windows Server and MSSQL Installation)<br />
<br />
I never ever thought about handling a migration to LN 10.7 on my own. I knew, I couldn't do it. It's simple as it is.<br />
<br />
So, our first step was to Setup a migration project inhouse and organise the resources (project management, money, people inhouse, external knowledge) needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kacbar</div><div class="date">28th August 2020, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">It's interesting what you say and a bit sad at the same time.<br />
We know that in Poland there were two companies that migrated and the process ran quite smoothly, but unfortunately I have no way of finding out what the process looked like, so I'm looking for help here.<br />
Additionally, I am a new employee without much experience in this field, so I have a more difficult task.<br />
So far I have created a new LN 10.7 application server with demo companies and it all works fine and MSSQL database. I did an export data dictionary by ttiex1280m000 of all packages to my hard drive<br />
We also copied a virtual machine with FP7 environment for testing purposes and we want to work on this machine.<br />
I know I need FP7 in Unicode.<br />
Can you tell me how to check if the environment is in Unicode and do you have any knowledge what next step I should take?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lebowski</div><div class="date">28th August 2020, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
as Andreas stated this is quite a task if you are a new Infor admin.<br />
Generally it is: <br />
- Install the new 10.7 server,<br />
- install two VRC structures on it (one with 10.7, one with FP7),<br />
- export the company data from FP7 (old) and import in to FP7 (new box),<br />
- then change package combination by company from FP7 to 10.7 on the new machine<br />
- run the data upgrade engine and fix all errors it will report (consult the installation guide bhushan provided)<br />
<br />
There are some issues you have to figure out when you face them (e.g. the tools tables have partially a different structure..). <br />
<br />
Good luck &amp; have nice day</div></div><hr />

No, see - I'm an application developer. I can do some db-administration tasks like creating database users to grant access to the LN tables from another (non-Infor application). But I never installed a LN-Server. It may be found in the $BSE/lib directory, but I'm not sure on this.<br />
The Basic steps of an LN Migration (that I know of), are those leboski listet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kacbar</div><div class="date">1st September 2020, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">What tools did you use I mean the sessions and what did you export from FP7 and how to import it to the new 10.7 server To which VRC level. I now have three VRC B61a, 107Ua000 and the third one that comes from 107Ua000 is 10.7demo - here I installed the demo. Which VRC do I have to create and what VRC must come from</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">1st September 2020, 09:07</div></div><div class="posttext">We also a have the a8 VRC (and our customer variant) on the LN 10.7 Server. So I think you will need a copy of your a7 (FP7) and of your customer VRC an the LN 10.7 Server.<br />
So basically you need to have two package combinations on your LN 10.7 Server. The first one is a copy of your live package combination of your F7 Server. The second one is the package combination of LN 10.7.<br />
The idea is to switch your LN 10.7 Company to the copy package combination of your FP8 server. Export the data from the FP8 server and Import it onto the LN 10.7 server. (That’s why you need to have a copy of your &quot;old&quot; package combination on the new server.)<br />
Then you switch back to the LN 10.7 (new) package combination. After reconfig of the data the Migration Tools are executed, to convert your old data into the data needed in LN 10.7.<br />
<br />
That’s the basic thing as far as I can tell. I can't give you any details (like what session you gonna need to start the data conversion; never did that. I guess it should be somewhere in the Infor documentation for the new release.)</div></div><hr />
