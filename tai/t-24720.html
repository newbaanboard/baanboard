<br />
it's some time since I played around with it, so I give you, whatevetr I remember. Also my tests were on Unix, so it might be slightly different in your case.<br />
<br />
What is it?<br />
<br />
Support Eye works like a small Web server on your Baan Application server. It knows where to find your application an can show you offline information about your installation.<br />
<br />
How do you install it?<br />
<br />
If I rember correctly, on unix you just copied the files into some directly and started a daemon as user bsp. That's  all I can rember. In the directory is an install.sh, so maybe you had to execute this.<br />
<br />
How do you use it?<br />
<br />
Connect with a browser to your application server on the port defined (see file PortNbr.txt in install directory). The rest is pretty obvious. The best functionality is, that you can look into an application object to see some details, like which other objects and libraries are used by this object. I think this feature was called object magnifier.<br />
<br />
<br />
To be honest, we installed it, played around with it and then we never really needed it. SSA support never asked for it also, so the benefit seems to be limited.<br />
<br />

to install and run OnePoint Diagnostics.<br />
<br />
Depending on which support plan you have you are probably<br />
entitled to a yearly scan.<br />
<br />
It's what you make of it, ours was really good, SSA came back from the <br />
con-call with really good suggestions on both the technical and functional side - but i've also spoken with people who didn't get much out of it.<br />
