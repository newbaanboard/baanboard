<br />
The message is:<br />

<br />
1. Whether Baan5.2a could be opened by BW? If Yes, why our  BW couldn't work.  Our BW version is : 7.1b.132<br />
<br />
2. As we know, Demo company of BaanIVc4 is 550,  and Baan5.0c is 902.  So what is demo company of Baan5.2a?<br />
<br />
Who would kindly tell us about that?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

I am currently using iBaan Windows 7.3a.133 but I assume there is already a newer one available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am surprised to find a new Reger (5.2) customer here. As Anthono, mentioned you cannot use the BW or Static Menu Browser. You have to get the latest Worktop Client software and then configure your becs files to the wtd (worktop document files) to access the ERP system.<br />
<br />
Our version of BW is 7.3a.01.137 and Worktop is 2.2.19. <br />
<br />
I think there has been a new BW version like 137a or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As explained before, as of 5.2a and later Baan versions you must use either Worktop or Webtop. The old menu browser, desktop manager, process viewer and DEM browser have been removed.<br />
But why would you want to use BW instead of Worktop?<br />
Latest BW version available is 7.3a.02.138.<br />
<br />

<br />
Now I clearly know that we can't use BW to start Baan5.2a.<br />
Using Worktop2.2, we can start the Baan5.2a.<br />
