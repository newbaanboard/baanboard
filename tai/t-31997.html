 I have had a question in a session ttadv5214m000 (Create runtime forms) and I have found answare to to the question, but I can find it.<br />
 I have the folow situation:<br />
 The form tdinv6230m000 in VRC B40U_c4_mcr0 and<br />
 the same form, just the dump, in VRC B40U_c4_bra0 (ok, because the labels had been translated to &quot;portuguese&quot;)<br />
 Now, the question...<br />
 When I run the session, closed VRC in B40O_c4_br0p (My production VRC), the dump has been created in my production VRC, why? I have checked if there are some label in my prodution VRC, that use in this form, but there are no one.<br />
 Some one could help me? <br />
 Sorry for my English, Im a studant yet.<br />
<br />
 Best regards.<br />
 Berti.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">1st March 2007, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Use option 1 in the field called &quot;Dump&quot; from ttadv5214m000.<br />
<br />
Check the field help for an explanation on the options. <br />
<br />
I personally do not see any advantage in using anything other than 1. On the contrary options 2 and 3 can create a lot of head aches.</div></div><hr />

 The option 1 work if you have the component in VRC that you need the dump, but in my case dont work.<br />
 The option 2 is necessary when you dont need a component in new VRC, but need that the component work with a label in another language, for exemple:<br />
 The form tdinv6230m0001 is in VRC B40U_c4_mcr0, but the labels in B40U_c4_mcr0 are in english, but Im in Brazil and need a label in portuguese, therefore I need to generate dump (dont copy the component), in a VRC B40U_c4_bra0, because the labels are in B40U_c4_bra0.<br />
<br />
Tks for your reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">1st March 2007, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I see now. Here goes what I think is the reasoning behind it:<br />
<br />
The dumps are always created in the VRC you are processing. Even though you are in br0p and labels affecting that form do not exist there they do exist in bra0 while the form itself is in standard making the form you need in br0p different from that in standard. The form you need in br0p is a merge of the form in standard plus the labels in bra0 and that's what Baan gives you and it puts it in br0p. <br />
<br />
I have no clue if this works so try it carefully in some test environment:<br />
Try running the create forms to RTDD (try with one form first) with option 2 for standard. Then run it again with option 2 for the next VRC, and so on until you reach your production level. Let me know what happens in case you decide to try.<br />
<br />
The ugliest of options is to always create forms to RTDD with option 3 at your production VRC level. It really is very ugly because you loose track of what VRC each form belongs to at the OS level and you would now need to create forms every time you import dd dumps to a lower VRC in your VRC structure. However if you always create your forms that way you will never end up with invalid forms hiding valid ones. Again, in case it is still not obvious, I do not like that option. A place for everything and everything in its place if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />

 Im realy sorry, because I found a label in my production VRC. Therefore the dump form would must be in my VRC.<br />
 Now I delete unchanged components runing a session ttadv6260m000 and resolved my problem and understand what occurs.<br />
<br />
 Tks a lot Eduardo for discution.</div></div><hr />
