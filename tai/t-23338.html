I would like to collect and to implement maintenance runs (nightly/daily/monthly) for all modules (includes tt) - like close PO, Rebuild Inv Transactions, etc. I'm interested in tf, ti, td, what ever...<br />
Could you post your suggestions or direct my to some thread or document?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I guess the reason, why you did not get many answers is, because the question is too broad. <br />
<br />
First of all most toolies doe not know much abozut the actual application and therefore also do not know which &quot;cleanup job&quot; would make sense in ti/td/...<br />
<br />
Second, what is needed will depend on the modules you use, the localizations you use, the parameter settings etc.<br />
<br />
In Tools alone you do not need much. Mainly a job in Baan, which will delete old entries from the printer queue and another job in your OS to delete old file in the tmp directory.<br />
<br />
Other jobs would also be possible, like deleting unsused texts, repairing reference counters, building statistics in your database. But you would need to look into these a bit more carefull.<br />
<br />
