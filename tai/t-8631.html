See Maintain Key Map Settings (ttaad2109m000).  Does this exist in Baan V?  It's been moved if so...is there an equivalent?</div></div><hr />

I think this option has been moved as a short cut keys in the form commands in the BaaN-5 series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, NP - The form command options are for use from within sessions to call other sessions as zooms, etc.  The Key Mapping in Baan IV would call any session from the menu state according to user defined short cut keys.  Each user could define their own hot keys for their most common sessions.  The Form Command options also existed in Baan IV, but are not what we were hoping for.  I think the Key Mapping has been removed :(</div></div><hr />

Thinking a bit more... I think that funtionality must have been  removed along with the Desktop functionality as the User Interface is now changed from the BECS/BW to Worktop/BW.<br />
<br />
In worktop you can create your own groups of shortcuts, import/export/rename them etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, that's very helpful, thanks.<br />
<br />
Also, in Baan IV, the Key Mapping allowed you to enter a short cuts to hold just regular strings for entry into fields.   Is that also possible with Worktop?  Or, some other method in Baan V?</div></div><hr />
