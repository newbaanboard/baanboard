If so, here's what I do to schedule an LN Job in FP3 and FP6:<br />
<br />
1.  Add the job using LN Job Management and specify External Scheduler and Run Periodically. Let's say your Job Name is TEST.<br />
<br />
2.  Run the job from Job Management to see if it runs OK.<br />
<br />
3.  Setup a TEST.bat file that has the following line: call startjob.bat TEST<br />
     (startjob.bat is provided by Infor and is located in %BSE%\bin)<br />
<br />
4.  Manually run TEST.bat to see if the job runs OK.<br />
<br />
5.  Schedule the job using Windows Scheduler.  <br />

<br />
Thanks for quick response.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am using the window scheduler and already tested as you say. But, when i manually run the report it works fine. When i want to run through the window scheduler, the ERP login is not open and job is not activated.<br />
<br />
Please tell me, where is the GAP.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

It might be a server folder security (permissions) issue. <br />
<br />
Does the user specified in the the Run as: field of the Scheduled Task have the correct permissions on the folders where your .bat files are located and is the user defined as an ERP LN user?<br />
<br />
If no user is defined in 'Run as:', try 'servername\baan'.<br />

<br />
We create the job from Baan (Installation User) and also add the Baan user in the Schedule Task. The 'BAAN' user has all rights.<br />
<br />
Please tell me, is there any other issue?<br />

Do you have controlled that via the joh scheduler the environment variable $BSE is defined and that the path contains $BSE/bin?. When you log with a user these data are filled in the login process but via the job sheduler there is no login and these data are then not filled<br />
