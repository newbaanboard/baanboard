Can you  check licence configuration ? I think so after installation of FP3 you have to relicence you server. <br />

But my server is already validated. The problem is not with SLM, but with Security patch. Baan guys are also working to find out ...<br />

That solution does not seem to have any fixes for SLM. You need to install the solution 206321.<br />

It is never preferred to use the mismatched Tools-FP/Porting Set etc. If there is a Porting Set release with a new FP/SP then you have to install that, else there no guarantee for Forward Compatibility of older porting set to newer Tools ES releases.</div></div><hr />
