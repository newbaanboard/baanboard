<br />
Could someone explain the following behavior of License Server.<br />
<br />
Let's say we have 12 concurrent user licenses. In this case the expected behavior is the 13th user will not be allowed to login into Baan Server and will get an error, No Licenses.<br />
<br />
But we find that sometimes we are not able to open sessions in a specific module say TD but we can open sessions in TF. Does that mean that the license server keeps count of every module's sessions which are opened ?<br />
<br />
Another scenario is that we are able to open other modules' sessions except Tools Sessions, though only 1-2 users use these sessions. Why such an error occurs ? Even when we release a couple of licenses we will not be able to log into Tools Sessions.<br />
<br />
Could someone explain in detail the reason for the above mentioned  scenarios.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support.<br />

ERP LN is validated as set of products. LIcense server keeps count for every product.<br />
