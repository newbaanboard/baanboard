I have a question and I am asking you for help because I am just learning to administer the Infor ERP 10.5 system.<br />
We have a task to create a new server and install a new LN 10.5 system. Creating Server and instalation do my friend from hardware service and now I have my job:<br />
After installation, I downloaded tools from Infor FTP, I mean 10.5_0_tt and 105_0_ta.<br />
All tools were successfully installed but I have only two combinations of packages (screen added). In second step instruction they wrote that i must have base VRC B61 16 but i don't have it. In base VRC a have only this (screen) and I dont have point 3 - Business Objects Documents (bo)<br />
How i can repair this. Maybe I do something wrong<br />
Please help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. portingset<br />
2. Tools<br />
3. Tools Add-on<br />
<br />
To get the LN application 10.6 installed, you need to:<br />
<br />
1. Stage the LN Application Base<br />
2. LN Application Solutions 10.6<br />
<br />
After staging the components run the installer to install the application.<br />
