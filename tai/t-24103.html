<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mokhbb</div><div class="date">21st May 2005, 00:02</div></div><div class="posttext">i have created an exchange scheme to import some business partner data. if a bp in the ASCII file is not a valid bp, the scheme SKIPS it (i.e. if i print log table, it dosen't log the invalid bp). so at the end of import, if i want to know which bp  were invalid, i am not able to get. where can i put a condition, such that after each line is read, it scans bp table and if the bp is not there, the condition returns a false and is trapped as an condition rej (and not under skipped).<br />

Early help would be highly appreciated.<br />

Anyway I have not used exchange for quite a while, but you should be able to achieve, what you want, by using a condition.<br />
<br />
Go to &quot;Maintain Table Relations&quot; and you see as the last field in the form a field called condition. Here you can specify in a text editor the script (which must return a boolean) to be executed. Read the help carefully, it has some good examples and also mentions something called a &quot;stop condition&quot;.<br />
