<br />
what is the preferred and suggested specifications for OS,database, space, size required for setting up Baan (IVc &amp; ERP) of 500 users in a multi site set-up<br />
<br />
Dhruv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Here we have 550 users, for a 2-tier configuration.<br />
<br />
Baan IV c4, <br />
AIX 4.3.3, <br />
8-way / 8 RISC processors with 4 MB cache L2<br />
Oracle8, <br />
Shark Storage - 1,4 TB <br />
12 GB RAM<br />
<br />
 It might be a good idea to have even more CPUs.....<br />
The storage must grow, since you will have more data during the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends mostly on what kind of users you have. Users that constantly use the product configurator require more resources than users who only enter purchase orders. Users that constantly generate outbound advices need to be shot on sight (sorry, personal grievances).<br />
<br />
Third party software (reporting tools, tax software, etc.) also needs to be taken in account.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sizing Baan is a highly specialized job in my opinion. At least if you want it done right the first time.<br />
<br />
I do believe I have a copy of the Baan IV sizing guide here somewhere. Send me an email and I'll toss it your way.<br />
<br />
In addition:<br />
We run about 500 (named) users with the following set-up:<br />
SunE10K<br />
12 processors<br />
12GB memory<br />
Solaris 2.6<br />
Oracle 8.05<br />
Baan5.0b<br />
EMC-frame shared with other servers, disk space on demand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">7th May 2004, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree completely, that sizing is a highly specialized job. Even worse the mentioned sizing guide will not help you much for BaanIVc, because it will not contain benchmark results for recent hardware.<br />
<br />
The best thing to do in my opinion is the following:<br />
<br />
a) Make up your mind about your principal HW choice: With 500 users Windows is out of the questions. This leaves you with the major Unix vendors: IBM, HP, SUN<br />
<br />
I advise you to look into IBM and HP.<br />
<br />
b) Make up your mind about your DB platform: Again with this number of users you are limited: Oracle, Informix, DB2<br />
<br />
I would advise you to go for oracle.<br />
<br />
c) Contact the HW vendors and ask some for a sizing. This will give you an initial idea.<br />
<br />
d) Contact similar Baan clients. Similar means roughly same number of users, roughly the same user profile. Ask them for the HW they use.<br />
<br />
e) Consider, that some baan options (like PCF) will use much more CPU power than others.<br />
<br />
f) With this number of users, you talk about quite an investment. Try to get a performance guarrentee from the HW vendor.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that helped,<br />
<br />
