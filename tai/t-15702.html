<br />
I just now installed B40c4 on SQL2000 Win2000<br />
<br />
I noted BSE\lib\DEFAULTS\db_resource file containing:<br />
db2_minmem:1<br />
db2_bidi:1<br />
<br />
what is this db2 defaults, any idea.<br />
<br />
is it required for a SQL2000 backend too...?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
So in my opinion you don't need it.<br />
<br />

I did so and its fine<br />
<br />
first i had db2 in the DEFAULTS, i dont know if it has a relation,  while i was loading around 30000 items only 19000 got inserted remaining were just coolly igonored without even an error. After i removed (but I had a porting set upgrade as well), it is ok. which one helped to fix this problem....!<br />
<br />
well it worked anyway<br />
