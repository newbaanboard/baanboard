It is not recommended to give access to users for changing their passwords at all.<br />
Baan does not store any passwords, it is on the windows server side.<br />
I hope u won't allow users to access the windows server with Administrator rights.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
even though I am more of a unix person in regards to Baan, here my insight into the subject:<br />
<br />
Baan is authenticating a user by using the OS provided authentication. This is true for Windows and Unix. So if your Baan users are windows domain users and the Baan login is the same as the windows login on the clients, then the users can just change their domain passwords in windows on their workstation and that's it.<br />
<br />
Note: For a domain user to be able to connect to Baan, he must have &quot;local log on&quot; permission. <br />
<br />
Note also: It is a myth, that Baan users must be local users on the Baan windows server.<br />
<br />
Can anybody confirm this?<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I cannot confirm this, for I never tried differently on a Windows-server, I can however confirm that it works the way you said, when window user and Baan user are the same, it is enough to change the windows user passwd.<br />

<br />
Myth, first Baan looks for the user locally in the Baan server and then in the domain.</div></div><hr />

Please refer to link - <br />

I  am sure this will work on both, active directory and local users.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
the link you point to is interesting, but the discussion there goes in the following direction:<br />
<br />
a) How to change the password on the server?<br />
b) How to write a (Baan 4gl) program, which prompts the user for the password and then changes it on the server.<br />
<br />
Even though the last one is elegant, in my opinion it is absolutrely not needed. Just configure your Baan users to be domain users. Finished. In this case the users do not need to memorize a second login and password for Baan and also they can change the Baan password (which does not exist in that sense anyway) by changing there windows password.<br />
<br />
OK, the above abviously only works, if there is not a compelling reason to give users different logins from the windows domain login, or if you do not use a windows domain or if your users are using windows 98 etc. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdbailey</div><div class="date">2nd February 2005, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We actually FORCE our users passwords to change every X days to help maintain a secure environment.<br />
<br />
Baan on Windows authenticates from the Domain server (PDC or AD depending on your Windows version) it is a member of.  Any policies applied to the domain will apply to Baan (even with a Windows 95 client - tested).  So, there is no need for a local account on the client at all.<br />
<br />
One caveat with this arrangement is that printing can get blocked on the day of a password change under the following scenario:<br />
<br />
-User logs into Windows and gets prompted that password must change in 1 day.<br />
-User opts not to change password (not yet forced to)<br />
-User logs into Baan and starts working<br />
-User then decides to change Windows password (in NT or 2000 with the CTRL-ALT-DEL)<br />
-User continues to work in Baan after Windows password change<br />
***Printing does not work<br />
<br />
The reason is that Baan is still trying to authenticate on the print server in the domain (I don't know why it does this for every print but that is beside the point) using the OLD password that it was logged in under.<br />
<br />
The solution:  After the user changes the Windows password, they must log out of Baan and back into Baan with the new password.<br />
<br />
Reasoning: For some reason Baan only seems to check the password on initial logon and for print sessions.  Baan only &quot;remembers&quot; the original password it logged in with which is what creates the conflict.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
