<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">13th August 2004, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just completed archiving and now I am trying to estimate how long it will take to run Reorganize Tables with data and indexes checked.  We are single logistic / multi finance which means that most of our data is shared between companies.  A few weeks back I executed this for the td package and for 5 companies.  The process completed in 4 hours.  Then I ran it again for the tc package which also completed in 4 hours.<br />
<br />
I monitored both executions and observed that the first thing it did was reload the data for the first company and set the reference counters.  When it was done with the first company, it set reference counters for the next company skipping the data load because the data is shared.<br />
<br />
What I want to understand is how the program will run if I execute it for all packages and for the same 5 companies.  Will it reload the data for all packages and all companies before it proceeds to the reference counters?<br />
<br />
The reason that I am asking is when it reloads the data, my system generates informix logs and there are space considerations that need to be monitored while the data is being loaded.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping that I can walk away from this process when it starts to reset the reference counters.<br />
<br />
Any advice will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It reloads the data first, then does the reference counters..<br />
<br />
Since you're using a real database (not tbase) you could just use<br />
an informix export/import to acheive the same thing, only faster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">13th August 2004, 23:32</div></div><div class="posttext">That mostly depends on informix export.. <br />
You'll need to export in a way that will compress the data within the table <br />
(i.e., not export blank rows)<br />
I'm mostly familiar with Oracle, in oracle we would do this with <br />
exp compress=y.  <br />
I would guess that informix would have something similar.<br />
<br />
The upside to using the informix dump, is that the dump itself is faster, and <br />
you don't have to rebuild reference counters after you're finished..<br />
