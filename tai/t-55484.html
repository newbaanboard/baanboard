<br />
<br />
have you tried these solution?<br />
<br />
<br />
TOOLS VERSION(S): <br />
7.6_a3, 7.6_a4, 7.6_b4 <br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: <br />
&quot;Remove high ASCII characters&quot; (ttcor0008m000) <br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
During a Unicode conversion illegal (high ASCII) characters were encountered in the tools tables which were delivered with ERP LN. <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
Session Remove high ASCII characters (ttcor0008m000) is introduced. This session replaces high ASCII characters in Tools tables of ERP LN. <br />
<br />
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: <br />
Unicode know issues and points of attention <br />
<br />
--- High_Ascii issues; error 205 NOHI --- <br />
<br />
In ERP LN 6.1 Unicode environments it is by default not supported to have high-ascii characters in single byte strings. <br />
<br />
In various situations you can be confronted with situations where you receive software or data which does not comply to this rule. This will result in 205 error NOHI <br />
205 ENOTINRANGE - XXXXXXXX <br />
<br />
The NOHI error is a special case error. This error can occur in Unicode environments and environments where high_ascii_tolerence=0 <br />
The error is an indication that a character above 0x7F is stored in a single byte field. Storage of these high ascii characters in single byte fields is in these cases not allowed because it's encoding is ambiguous and depends on the locale. <br />
<br />
Possible situations <br />
1. Software deliveries, like language packs, pmc solutions, demo and master data. <br />
<br />
The cause of the problem is that the software or master data was prepared on a non-Unicode environment. Problems like this can be prevented by setting the high_ascii_tolerance: 1resource for this delivery environment. <br />
<br />
If you run into this problem during an initial install of ERP LN 6.1, make sure you use one of the later ERP Installers, at least version 13.4.4.0 <br />
<br />
If you run into this problem during an install of an additional PMC solution, language pack demo/master data you received from an external provider, contact them and ask them to deliver a Unicode compliant solution. <br />
<br />
2 Migration of existing ERP environments to Unicode <br />
The document Infor Enterprise Server 8.x Conversion Guide Database to Unicode U8887C US and later describes the steps you can take to prevent high_ascii related problems when you migrate an environment to Unicode. <br />
<br />
--- Sorting --- <br />
Environments based on Unicode will offer a linguistic sorting. The Infor Enterprise Server will sort based on the ISO 14651 standard and the more strict Unicode Collation Algorithm. The sorting algorithm used by the database differs slightly per database vendor and they do not all comply to the ICU and ISO standards. <br />
The consequence is that customers can expect different sorting behavior, especially when records with descriptions in various languages are sorted. The functional impact of this is expected to be minimal as a selection of records based on descriptions in various languages is rarely used. <br />
<br />
The linguistic sorting used with Unicode is a more complex sorting algorithm than the binary sort order mainly because of the multilevel weight factor used to sort the characters. This has it’s consequences for the performance of an ERP LN environment on Unicode compared to a classic single byte implementation. <br />
Records falling out of range <br />
<br />
--- Specific SQL Server issue --- <br />
A specific issue was detected with the SQL Server Unicode implementation. The character used for defining the maximum range of the character set was found to be a character which does not fall in the end based on the by SQL Server used sort order. With porting set 8.4a.02 this problem is resolved, so customers are strongly advised to use that porting set as a minimum for SQL Server Unicode implementations. <br />
<br />
--- Limitation --- <br />
<br />
The ‘exchange’ implementation of Enterprise Server 8.4.1 and earlier still uses a native dump format. The consequence is that it is not possible to exchange information between Unicode environments via ‘exchange’ if the information contains descriptions in multiple languages. <br />
<br />

PATH NAME IN DIAL-UP DIRECTORY/WEB SITE: <br />
Below are the supported VRC's based on the Baan standard derivation structures. <br />
<br />
If your Current Tools VRC is: <br />
7.6_a3:(ES 8.3) <br />

<br />
7.6_a4:(ES 8.4) <br />
/ftpdownload/updates/7.6_a4_tt/224133tt.tar.gz   . <br />

Please read solution 100017 for installation instructions. <br />
<br />
<br />
it solved my problem, but i'm on the FP5 env.<br />
