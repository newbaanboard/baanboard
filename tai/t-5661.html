<br />
We have a session Print Extended Trial Balance (tfgld3411m000), the problem is when you run the report it chops off the last two columns on the right hand side along with page and company number.  I have already adjusted the font directly from the print driver which helped, however, to make it truly fit by modifying the driver all my other reports would only take up half the page.  I wanted to see if anyone else is having this problem or what you may have done to fix it, this is a standard report and isn't customized.  There are a few options I could try:  take off some columns we don't use, change the font on the report, or change the print driver.  We are on 5.0c, AIX, Oracle 8.1.6.  <br />
<br />
We use direct printing, which removes the option of using bw print.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
This is one of the standard reports (I guess but check the number of character please) that don't fit.<br />
Calculate the number of character times cpi and you will see that there can't be more than about 190 characters on one line.<br />
<br />
These reports were originally developed for the old matrix printers with broad paper.<br />
<br />
THe only thing you can do about this is customize them or use a smaller font.<br />
<br />
With bw it a bit easier to print them since a specific driver option makes the font fit (sorry but I don't know the solution right away).<br />
<br />

I know finance reports has this problem.</div></div><hr />
