<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ranias</div><div class="date">6th March 2005, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">try to change the date backwards with around 1 month if still says so then move it back more till you get the message of the demo license.<br />
<br />
You need also to check the baanV enviroment to make sure it's not affected with another license error like &quot;too early to run this program&quot;.<br />
<br />
Check this out, hope this will help.<br />

I am not 100% sure but it will not suprise me if this is not supported on Windows.<br />

So I think it is possible to have them all running on Windows machine.</div></div><hr />

The consultant used something like VMWare of MS Virtual PC to run the 2 OS's simultaneously.  This configuration requires a lot of PC resources, however.</div></div><hr />

Thanks -Nikkiz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 01:24</div></div><div class="posttext">it does. you just can't install SLM on a VM box..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 02:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave, we just received a response from Infor that they won't support LN in a virtual environment because we had that intention.  Now we're deploying a standalone server instead.  Does your support contract specifically indicate a virtual environment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 03:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the answer we received:<br />
<br />
&quot;VmWare for Ln is NOT supported on Production environments, customer can have it on test/demo/devp environment but we will not support and handle performance or related issues. Benchmarks have showed that running ERP LN in OS environments directly on the hardware significantly outdistances the performance of ERP LN in a VMWare environment. So in summary, only limited to test non critical environments. &quot;</div></div><hr />

my mistake!<br />
