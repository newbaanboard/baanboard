<br />
we want to move our Baan environment (Baan IV, Oracle 7.3.4, AIX 4.3.3)from one server to another. I have therefor successfully restored a backup on the new server, which hardware is - of course - different. (I have cloned the system on os level and restored the Baan environment from tape).<br />
<br />
When I start Baan on the new server after the restore, a message appears:<br />
&quot;You have no licence to start the bshell&quot;. After a few seconds this message disappears and another message pops up: &quot;You can still run the software under the demo license for -1496 days!&quot;. But when I open any session now, the first message appears again and I will be kicked out of the Baan client after a few seconds.<br />
<br />
I am fairly new to the validation process and although I have read all the official documentation from Baan support page, I am not quite sure how to correctly proceed now to validate the new server. <br />
<br />
Moreover, the new server should get another hostname (which I learned, Baan uses for the validation information).<br />
<br />
So, can anybody tell me a step by step instruction how to validate a new Baan server when it was restored from tape (including a hostname change)!<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for all hints and tips!<br />

<br />
I've been doing this only 2 times for Baan IV and 4-5 times for E-Procurement. The first step is: goto Baan Support (http://www.support.baan.com). On the left side, you see &quot;Validation Forms&quot;, that is where you order a new license. You need to know a lot such as Number of Licenses. The answer might take some time (2 hours was best, 2 weeks the worst case).<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">9th November 2004, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">This would be considered a brand new license. So you need to go through<br />
the doc &quot;How to validate a single host&quot;. <br />
<br />
Before that, you should be able to run ttiex3228m000 (Patch objects after system crash) to allow you to run sessions.<br />
