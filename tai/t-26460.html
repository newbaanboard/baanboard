<br />
Installation started normally. On step creating tables I got error 511 but tables were created. Clicking on OK continued installation but installation definitely stopped on step data import with same error 511.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any idea what was wrong? It seems that everything is OK, I checked BW client version and installation did use own BW client?<br />
<br />
Is it maybe problem that is impossible to have Baan 5.0 and SSA ERP LN 6.1 on the same server?<br />
<br />
Additional information about my environment:<br />
<br />
System:<br />
Microsoft Windows Server 2003<br />
Enterprise Edition<br />
Service Pack 1<br />
<br />
Database:<br />
Microsoft SQL Server 2000  8.00.760 (Intel X86)<br />
Enterprise Edition on Windows NT 5.2 (Build 3790: Service Pack 1)<br />
<br />
Installation Portingset is 7.6b (PA.2902)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure with the installation of multiple baan environments/versions on the same Windows instance. From the Programmers manual -<br />
SSA ERP LN 6.1 Programmers Guide<br />

 <br />
511 EWRONGVERSION - XXXXXXXX<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Description:  <br />
This error indicates that the version of client is not the same as the version of the server.  <br />
Solution:  <br />
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX <br />
For the LN-FP2 you need to have the latest Worktop version (2.4.8) and BW version (7.6b.10)</div></div><hr />

Regarding versions - all SW are from installation CD's.</div></div><hr />

Check your database configuration weather truncate or autogrow selected in enterprise manager, and also look at the dbf file size. I think min required 3 GB database and 300 MB for temp.<br />
LN installation in windows and SQL Server probably the most easiest thing.</div></div><hr />

You are right. This installation is not a big deal if you have a clear situation. But if you have to install SSA ERP LN 6.1 on one server where Baan 5.0 is already installed, Baan IV used to be installed and is deleted now, old version of SLM is already running, there are clients for all Baan/SSA versions installed, there is old version of Worktop, Baan Office integration, &#8230; In one word - if you have to install SSA ERP LN on one server where more people test different things, I think, you must agree that it is not so surprising if you get error &#8220;client version different as the server version&#8221;.<br />
<br />
We solved problem with a new server dedicated for SSA ERP LN only and didn&#8217;t have any problem with installation.</div></div><hr />
