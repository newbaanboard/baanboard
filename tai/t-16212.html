The first original NIC is still on the server<br />
<br />
Do I need to ask for new license keys or can I use the old ones?<br />
If I can use the old ones, what steps do I need to take to validate server again?<br />
<br />
The OS is W2K, SP15, MS SQL Server 2000<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated<br />

thanks<br />

If you can switch those, then you won't need to do anything to revalidate.. if you cannot then you'll have to revalidate using the new nic card.<br />

Probably I changed the security key.. <br />
<br />
I did run Patch Objects after system crash... <br />
<br />
Any other ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">The binding makes no difference the security key is calculated by using the mac address of all cards in the machine. If you take the new card out and use the brand.exe from the command line (there are other posts on the board covering how to do this)<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=15861&amp;highlight=brand.lic<br />
this will  regenerate the brand.lic file</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danielv</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 00:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Darren,<br />
thank you !, I took out the second NIC, restarted server and licensing server started again.<br />
<br />
Now, what do I need to do to add second NIC? <br />
<br />
Is it possible?<br />
<br />
thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 01:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad that did the trick for ya Daniel. But I have to disagree with Darren.<br />
<br />
If you're running NT and you have 2 NIC cards and switch the binding order, the license daemon will fail. If the license file was created using all of the MAC addresses then this wouldn't happen.<br />
<br />
My guess is that if you switched the binding order and made the old NIC primary and rebooted the system should have come back up..  Then you'd run Configure App since you had run Patch after system crash...<br />
<br />
But, that's just how I understand it.. and I've been wrong before..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danielv</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 01:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Darren,<br />
so from what I understand, if I add the second NIC I will need to generate another security key and validate it?<br />
<br />
Dave &amp; Darren Thank you both for your help... I learn something new every day... :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danielv</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 01:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave,<br />
when the security key was generated about a year ago, I did not had the second NIC... <br />
Just recently I decided to add the second NIC ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So according to my understanding .. you would just have to make sure the 2nd NIC wasn't the primary (and then reboot).. then you'd be all set...<br />

Added second NIC and checked binding order.<br />
It did not work.<br />
<br />
<br />
It looks like the Security Key is calculated based on all NICs available. What I have been reading this is only for NT/W2K. Unix is a different beast<br />

<br />
It is not calculated based on all available NICs, just one.<br />
<br />
But he pointed me to some solutions that may help:<br />

Good luck!<br />

<br />
Let me just say that I did not go through the exercise of re-validating the server.. Just tried solutions 131733, 113902. Did not tried sol 111736, since it asked to re-validate.<br />
<br />
One test that came up with positive results was that I disabled the second NIC and restarted licensing service. After that I was able to enable second nic.<br />
<br />
So, looks like re-validating is inevitable after adding a second NIC</div></div><hr />
