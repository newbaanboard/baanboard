Refer to the Worktop's help:<br />
<br />
Information tab<br />
The Information tab displays all the additional information that is linked to business processes and activities. Whenever you want to view one of the types of information listed below, the Information tab automatically appears and displays the right Help text or URL. Since the WorkTop hosts Microsoft Internet Explorer, you can use the functionality provided by this Web browser. The Address bar provides you with the edit field. <br />
<br />
For more information, refer to Address Bar and Internet toolbar. <br />
<br />
On the Information tab, you can display the following information: <br />
<br />
Help texts <br />
URLs <br />

User interface framework <br />
Work Area <br />
Internet toolbar <br />

i want to change the welcome home page on the information tab.<br />
What is the business requirement to make this change?<br />
Worktop refer to the file:///C:/Program%20Files/Infor/Worktop/Resources/welcome.html page in the information tab. You can customize the html but that will affect all the wtd's created.</div></div><hr />

2.5.8 version, that's the one that i've installed.<br />
<br />
Is not a bussiness requirement, actually. We have an intranet page where the users can send their issues and problems. And these are sent to us as a tickets to resolve those problems.<br />
<br />
The idea is to use the information tab possibilty to access the intranet and make easier to the final user to send those tickets.<br />
<br />
I think it might be a possibility to change the &quot;welcome&quot; page for other page, like google or stuff, in this case, the intranet page.<br />
<br />
PS: Sorry about my english. It's been a long time since i didn't write in this language XD.</div></div><hr />

Just be aware of such changes can be overwritten by newer Worktop installations.</div></div><hr />
