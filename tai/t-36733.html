1) If the so called customized session tdcus9450m000 doesnt exist in the vrc you are trying to import into, then you could go ahead and import it and then rename it to tdacp9450m000 after the importing is over.<br />
2) If tdcus9450m000 does exist and if its not used anymore, you could choose the &quot;overwrite&quot; option in ttiex1285m000 session and then once importing is done, do the renaming...<br />
3) Last but not least...if tdcus9450m000 exists and you want to keep it and have this one as a new session then i recommend you create another vrc combination and import this dump into that. Once imported you could create a copy of this session from your new vrc to the one that you desire with the name tdacp9450m000..<br />
<br />
Hope its clear..<br />

<br />
Create a module cus in target VRC on the server on which you want to import that session. Then, import the session on the server. Then, as suggested by Sukesh, copy it to acp module.<br />
<br />
Since the dump created by session ttiex1280m000 is in binary format and you cant edit that dump :p .<br />

After importing, you could. Make sure the module is present in your vrc on the new server(ref. kaustubhs post), then create a copy of the session (tdcus)9403m000 with new name (tdacp)9450m000.<br />
<br />
Bottomline: You can rename an object to any name you want(by creating a copy of it) after you import and not before or while importing..<br />

My experience is that, we can not rename the session b4 importing into a specific VRC, you should create a new module as it is in your session and then after importing you can change or copy with any other name.</div></div><hr />
