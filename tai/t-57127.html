I have a problem with the session ttaad5205m000.<br />
<br />
I'll try to start at the end of a job (TEST1) a second job (TEST2) with the session. But nothing happens. If I start the second job manually or directly by cron, everything works fine.<br />
I understood, that I have to enter the same &quot;jobcall&quot; like in the crontab. Is this wrong?<br />
<br />
I added some screenshots, maybe this helps for ypur help ;).<br />
<br />
Kindly,<br />

Hello Volker,<br />
<br />
try to start as in crontab like http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=57105<br />
<br />
but what is rc.startjob.itt<br />
<br />
Is the user the same as the jobuser ?<br />
<br />
Why job from job ? Put all needed sessions in your first job.<br />
<br />

We have to guarantee, that ther is no overlapping of the &quot;headerjobs&quot; and the &quot;footjob&quot;.</div></div><hr />
