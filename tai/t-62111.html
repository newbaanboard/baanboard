<br />
We testing the Cisco VPN client version 5.0.07.0410 on Windows 7 32-bit. A connection to Baan can be established and normal functions can be performed in baan. However, if you leave the Baan client idle for 10 minutes it closes down. The user testing this for us experiences the problem when using a wireless or wired connection to his home ADSL router.<br />
<br />
The same user has connected his PC to a public wireless network we have in the office, which will take the same route as his home network to reach Baan via VPN, and he doesn't get the same timeout issue. The Baan client will remain even after 10 minutes of inactivity.<br />
<br />
The default Baan system client timeout is set to 120 minutes and works as expected for clients on the LAN.<br />
<br />
Our previous VPN client was from Nortel and this worked without any issues. So it's a problem specific to the Cisco set-up and a users home network.<br />
<br />
Has anybody come across this problem before?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I've been told by Baan support to look at the ds_timeout_detect settings on the BW client.<br />
<br />
I already have this set in my $BSE/lib/defaults/all -<br />
<br />
RTFSIZING:0<br />
session_timeout:120<br />
ds_timeout_detect:150<br />
slm_enabled:0<br />
<br />
If I'm setting this at the BW client end does this override the system setting?<br />
<br />
On the client should I set the value to less than 10 to resolve my issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
One workaround of my users was to open an print session till the point of selecting an printer ... then the timeout parameter was not working.<br />
<br />
But I think the solutions is on the adsl router ... it has to be an parameter of the router settings.<br />
<br />
Had a similar problem working in my homeoffice connected via vpn (netgear box = router). After 15 minutes of inactivity the connection to baan was lost. Permanent pings were no solution.<br />
