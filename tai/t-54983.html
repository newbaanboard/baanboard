<br />
How can I upgrade the tools from (currently) 7.6a2 to 7.6a4? I've upgraded the portingset from 7.6 to 8.4a but I don't know any procedure to upgrade the tools as well. I don't think that I have to upgrade to FP3... <br />
<br />
Any comments?<br />

On the Infor download site there should be an image for Enterprise Server 8.4 (8.5 is also now available).  <br />
<br />
You shouldn't have to upgrade the app to FP3, but you may want to read the documentation.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have any more questions.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">6th February 2009, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Download the enterprise server from infor.subscribenet.com. That cd contains both the portingset and the tools programs.<br />
Via that site you can download the documentation cd as well, it contains a document that describes the procedure how to upgrade your enterprise server.<br />
<br />
Vince was updating the thread about the same time. Consider using Enterprise server 8.5, it contains a lot of improvements:<br />
- supports Oracle 11;<br />
- supported with VMware ESX;<br />
- you can define up to 20 customer defined fields in any table (only supported with webtop);<br />
- form generation has been improved.<br />
<br />

The ES 8.5 has been released, so you can skip the 8.4, 8.4.1, 8.4.2 and upgrade to the latest version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">10th February 2009, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. I know about ES 8.5a, but as we do the upgrade to get the same version of Baan environment compared to our live environment, we need the older version first. <br />
<br />
Btw. upgrading the tools only (without installing SP/FP) works fine. You only have to download the spt/spt files (for example spa76a4.tar.gz and spt76a4.tar.gz) from Infor's FTP server. After moving both in a directory like &quot;Infor Enterprise PMC Solutions&quot; the Staging Wizard recognizes the upgrades as installable units. Then the upgarde can be installed as usual through the Installation Wizard (Feature Pack for Enterprise Server).<br />
<br />
Of course it is not recommended to mix several versions of portingset, tools and feature/service packs but sometimes there is no other choice...<br />
