<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a new enumerated domain which I am using for a form field (it is not in any tables).  I have exported the form, domain, etc. and imported them into the appropriate VRC.  I have attempted multiple variations of create runtime and convert runtime all to no avail (and there are no messages if I check 'print errors').  When I exit and re-enter Baan to run the session, I get a message stating that the field has an unknown domain.  The client's VRC/package combination hierarchy is a bit complex, but like I said, I have tried create on many different levels:<br />
<br />
VRC PkgComb<br />
          A        ---	1<br />
             |	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;	|<br />
             B	---	2   &lt;- production company<br />
             |	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;	|<br />
             C	---	3   &lt;- location of mods<br />
	...<br />
	IVc3<br />
 <br />
The system is IVc3 on NT.  I've never had this problem with domains before.  I also created a test table with just that field just to see if I could get it to work -- no luck.  GTM says no data definition for the table.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">6th June 2002, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">That was my next idea.  They are going to try that tonight.  Since the domain is brand new (as well as the session and form), I wouldn't have thought it would be a problem.  But when you're desperate... :p</div></div><hr />

Do you see it in domain set for the package you are in? What does a diff between the .old and the current set yield?</div></div><hr />
