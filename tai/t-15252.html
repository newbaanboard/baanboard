we use Office Integration.<br />
Versions 1.x were easy to implement, because they worked on so called BAS (Baan Automation Server), which was a little program to be installed on the client and the OI-Software itself which implements some VB-Makros in Word and Excel.<br />
But !! <br />
these Versions had some serious bugs and they are not supported any more by Baan.<br />
The 'new' OI now called 'iBaan Integration Pack for ERP 5 - MS Office' is based on Open World technology. So you have to set up an OW-Environement whith Adapter on every Client that wants to use OI and a directory service (either LDAP or flat file). Furthermore you must set up the central Licensing Tool (BCLM).<br />
We have implemented it with OW 2.3 and OI 2.00.0138.<br />
After implementation we found some more bugs in this Version, which are already solved by Baan whith a new OI-Version (i think the latest is 2.00.0141) but unfortunately this requires a new Version of OW (2.4 is recommended).<br />
I advice you to have a look to Baan Support Site where you can get all required information on this topic.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />
