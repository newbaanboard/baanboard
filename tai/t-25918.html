We have replicated $BSE folder and excluded in them this folders<br />
$BSE/bin/*<br />
$BSE/log/*<br />
$BSE/lib/*<br />
$BSE/tmp/*<br />
$BSE/tools/*<br />

There is any other folder that I have to exclude?<br />

Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />

If you post some details about the issues you're having you might have better luck in getting a response. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">27th December 2005, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for your suggestion. I explain we want to do.<br />
<br />
We have 2 systems with 2 data base. In one of them we have the middle of the users and in the other one the other middle. We want to connect the 2 systems with &quot;High availability&quot;. <br />
<br />
The &quot;High availability&quot; serve for have the data of the machines synchronized, that to say, if I write a transaction in one of the machine, automatically the data appears in the other machine.<br />
<br />
We have no problem with the data collection, but we have problems with the program. We know that if we change a program of if we convert to DD a table we have changes in:<br />
                 /baanERP/bse/application<br />
                /baanERP/dict<br />
<br />
but for example if we change a user it don´t work, because there is something that change in /baanERP/.... (I don´t Know) that we have to send to other machine.<br />
<br />
Somebody know the parts of /baanERP that never change and the parts that change if you make a change in the program?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nandan</div><div class="date">27th December 2005, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">From the list of the previous post.<br />
You should include the following directories<br />
${BSE}/lib<br />
${BSE]/tools.<br />
<br />
Please also share how you are synchronizing transactions at the Database level, based on that you can further decide which subdirs of ${BSE}/lib should be included for FS replication/synchronization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">27th December 2005, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">We use an application whose name is Mimix. <br />
<br />
In AS400 the collections are stored in something called Libraries. In each library there are all the baan tables. The reply/synchonize is made with the changes maked in the data of this object. I think this process is independent of Baan, because after include a register in a table I see the change in the other machine.<br />
<br />
All the table that begin for &quot;tt&quot; is stored in another collection, and this part is being synchonized but the result of the change I don´t see, for example, a change in a user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">27th December 2005, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Monica,<br />
We also using &quot;Mimix&quot; to synchronize the data between two AS/400 servers (570 servers-Production &amp; 840 server - HA sever). Keep in mind never synchronize /$BSE/tmp....you end up with issues in printing. HA is not small task, you need to talk to Baan, Baan customers who are doing and who had a good knowledge about...that is the only way you get through it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">28th December 2005, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi mraguthu,<br />
We have spoken with Baan, but they haven´t said us which of the foder in /baanERP we have to synchronize. <br />
<br />
Can you say us the structure of IFS (WRKDGIFSE) of /baanERP?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advace,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">28th December 2005, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We are syncronizing all folders in IFS expect $BSE/tmp and some &quot;tmp&quot; files. Because tmp files will be locked while Mimix process. (that is not good for production system)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">1st January 2006, 12:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally all the changes to these relevant folders are updated only by techncial team . So  for all technical people we have the a startup session specified in this thread on replication of FS objects (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=10551) .<br />
<br />
Also this will help u exercise some latitude for FS syncronization like user data , remote user data , tabledef6.1 etc .<br />
<br />
As this program has to track only the changes of developers , it's incremental and very minimal load on the OS resources .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">1st January 2006, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We are also using a kind of HA Solution. I try to describe:<br />
<br />
The whole system is a cluster of 7 servers and 2 loadbalancers.<br />
2 Servers are HA for the database and some &quot;hardcore&quot; users, 5 (smaller, SunFire V240) servers are the application server. All severs are sharing the $BSE-path by NFS (it is on a SAN). Normally one of the 2 bigger servers is for the DB and the other one works as application server for &quot;heavy&quot; users (warehouse and jobs). We don't have production, so warehousing and order entry is our biggest thing. <br />
The loadbalancer are distributig the &quot;standard&quot; user to the application servers (two because of HA).<br />
<br />
I think the most interesting part for you is sharing by NFS (or something equal on AS400).<br />
<br />
Maybe it helps<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">3rd January 2006, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much. We finally are synchronizing:<br />
<br />
/BAANERP/BSE/APPLICATION/* <br />
/BAANERP/BSE/LIB/USER/*    <br />
/BAANERP/DICT/*            <br />
/BAANERP/BSE/LIB/DATECURR  <br />
<br />
There were some files more but we don´t change any of this file after installing baan and I think in our system isn´t necessary.<br />
<br />
Apparently it works fine. <br />
Again thank you very much.</div></div><hr />
