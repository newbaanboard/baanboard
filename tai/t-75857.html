iam new here and hope iam not asking a question that someone else has already asked for. We want to export a large table tdilc301 and are wondering, if this can be done during company users are working. Is it leading to Database Blocks for them?<br />

We did small seldom used tables all the time for one reason or another, but large more used ones we would wait until after hours.</div></div><hr />
