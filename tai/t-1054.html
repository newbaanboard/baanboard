They say you should read a certain solution on Baan support BEFORE instalation of the SP. Check the solution.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">15th February 2002, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right . I browsed through the first pages of BAAN IVc<br />
release notes for service pack b40c4.7 and found I should<br />
read solution 110657 for the latest information. I phoned<br />
a teammate who gave me a login, a password and a domain<br />
to check the baan support website, although I wasn't able<br />
to go through. I don't know if it's my fault since this is the<br />
first time I try it myself. Could someone please read this<br />
case and point me what to do next ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

missing a letter typing the domain. I went to check case<br />
110657 as the release notes suggested and entered a<br />
new record for cc using Maintain package VRC's but now<br />
I'm not able to execute Maintain Directories of Software<br />
Componentes (ttadv1111m000) instead I get the message:<br />
<br />
Fatal error: ottadv1115 is expired<br />
Fatal error: Can not continue in ottadv1115 (unknown)<br />
<br />
Will I ever succeed installing service pack 7 ?  :( <br />
