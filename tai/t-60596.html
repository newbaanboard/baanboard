<br />
We are on Baan 5c4 (HP Unix 11.11 with Porting set 7.1d.11 &amp; sp19) , just wondering what's the last porting set for us to go for ?<br />
<br />
Is it true to say that baan releases one common porting set which can be used for ERP LN and Baan 5c ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">30th May 2011, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the update. Yaah we do plan to move from traditional licensing method to SLM as part of our sp upgrade. <br />
<br />
However i don't know much advantages from organization perspective what benefit are we going to get once we move to SLM... do u know any major advantages ?<br />
<br />
Also is there a diff. between bclm and SLM ... is it true to say that through bclm u could license only open world but through SLM, you could license all other infor products too like open world, baan licensing etc ??</div></div><hr />

<br />
BCLM is the 2.5 version and SLM started at 7.0 and is currently at 7.1.0.4. <br />
BCLM stands for Baan Client License Manager and SLM stands for Solution License Manager.  Notice that the latest version of SLM is required by porting set 8.7a.01 if you are going to upgrade to the latest porting set. Always check all the technical notes between your current porting set and the latest one for relevant notes to your environment as there could be OS patches required (usually c++ runtime environment) <br />
<br />
If porting sets lower than 7.1d.11 you only could license Baan via license daemon but Baan could not obtain a license from SLM and as you stated if you had open world it probably needed a license from (at the time) BCLM; moving to SLM is just required in the later porting sets; you can always request a list of bugs fixed in SLM from Infor. <br />
Advantagewise, you can set up SLM outside the Baan server in case your server goes down and have other environments, those environments can always obtain a license. So, it is optimal for failover.  If you have more than 100 licenses you can also ask about High Availability. <br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">10th July 2011, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">what is high availability ? is it a feature of a product ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">11th July 2011, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">High availability is a feature available in both the old licensing method (License daemon) and SLM. It is used when you have more than one license server and over 100 licensed. What it does is prevent your license servers from decreasing the number of licensed if one of your license servers goes down, the server has gone over the grace period (72 hours) and it has not been brought back up. <br />
<br />
Normally in a scenario where you have 4 license servers with 1000 licenses, if one went down and it was not brought back up within 72 hours, licenses would be decreased in a 25% ratio. So out of 1000, 250 licenses would be suppressed until the server was brought back up. High availability makes it so that never happens, as long as one license server is up, if you have 1000 licenses, you continue to have 1000 available licenses from that one server.</div></div><hr />

I went through the documentation and saw that 'HAS' option within SLM software. We do have more than 150 licenses, do we have to pay extra to Info to get this 'HAS' feature ?</div></div><hr />
