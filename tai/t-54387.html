<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davismit</div><div class="date">27th November 2008, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, We are on Baan 5.0c, running on porting set 8.4 with SLM 7.0 (Service pack 23).<br />
<br />
We have recently upgraded the porting set from the 7.1 series and have installed SLM for five products and all seems well.<br />
<br />
I need to add antoher server product to the SLM and am having trouble.  What is the process to do this.  <br />
I am doing the following.<br />
<br />
Running command ./SlmCmd -getlic licence.xml<br />
<br />
editing the licence file to remove the key and add 1 new server product with a status of add, leaving all the rest as active.<br />
<br />
submitted to Infor licencing and got a key.<br />
<br />
I then tried to submit the licence file (with the key empty) prior to activation using ./SlmCmd -newlic licence.xml<br />
<br />
I get the error 'Invalid activation key'<br />
<br />
If I submit the file with the new key in it I get the same error.<br />
<br />
I would have thought I would submit the file without the key and the activate it. <br />
<br />
I think Im doing this right as per the SLM docs but obviously im doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
Anyone elses direction would be grateful.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
My advice for you is - install SLM client on your PC for this task. It is more easier to do it graphically.</div></div><hr />

Its for a MOD client so we are unable to use the snap on tool, its all gotta be done on the unix box unfortunatley.<br />
