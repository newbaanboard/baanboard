<br />
I have  a problem compiling a report where the session crashes out and the tmp file tells me the following;<br />
<br />
Domain '' in report input not found in DD (bdb_errno = 0)<br />
Input field 'tdpsc950.pcon2' has unknown domain ''<br />
<br />
The problem occurs when the field tdpsc950.pcon2 is added to the layouts. The field in question is a customised field but is now in live use within the system and as such the table was converted to runtime many months ago.<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me why the domain is not being picked up.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">20th January 2004, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">The domain is definately filled in on the table definition tdpsc950 and all I'm doing is adding the field to the report input fields.<br />
<br />
At this stage the field is not even defined in the report layouts.<br />

I assume the table definition is not present in the VRC-tree of the package combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">21st January 2004, 11:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks it's ok now.<br />
<br />
Table had a RDD at a slightly higher level in the vrc although the higher package combo was derived from it.<br />
<br />
Created a RDD in the package combo at the same level as the VRC and now it appears to be working ok.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
