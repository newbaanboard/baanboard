I see that the log.bshell6.2 is rolled over to olg.bshell6.2 but how do i increase the size for any of these?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 08:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I have also wondered where the logs are managed.<br />
<br />
I additional question is:  Is there a predefined variable that has the path for the bshell log file and other log files or better still a function/dll that we can use to write additional log messages. <br />
<br />
Whilst is is easy enough to use $BSE/log/xxxxx, the actual log file name is not necessarily 'bshell'. One of our instances it is  'bshell6.1' beacuse we use ipc_info to intercept logon. This would change to bshell6.2 when we upgrade porting set etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The log will not change with a change of portingset from ...6.1 to whatever nr. is the portingset.<br />
The bshell6.1 is strictly associated with Triton/BaanIV and these numbers will not change to 6.2 within those versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">1st November 2002, 01:32</div></div><div class="posttext">The log name may not change to log.bshell6.2 with the change to porting set 6.2 ( I don't knoe because we have not changed yet), but it will change to log.bshell6.2 if bshell6.2 is specified in ipc_info as a result of installing the 6.2 version. <br />
Also the other case I mentioned where we use ipc_info on one instance but not on another the log file will log.bshel on one and log.bshell6.x on another. <br />
<br />
My question was directed at avoiding ' hard coding ' a path name.<br />

<br />
To answer the original question... I don't think it is possible to increase the maximum size of the log files.  I think the size is limited by the Baan software itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dieter</div><div class="date">27th July 2009, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not longer an issue. From the technical notes of the portingset:<br />
<br />
<br />
By default, the size of the logfiles in $BSE/log is 512k. When the log file<br />
exceeds that size, it will move the logifle to type olg and start writing from<br />
scratch.<br />
With the newly introduced resource ‘log_size’, the size of the log files can be<br />
adjusted. The default value is: 512.<br />
The parameter can, for example, be set by adding the following line to the<br />
$BSE/lib/defaults/all file:<br />
log_size:1024<br />
