<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freebie82</div><div class="date">16th July 2006, 13:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All,<br />
This is a very urgent task. I request your help. My organization uses Baan 5.0cversion. We have our own customizations also.<br />
We use PMC to install solutions provided by SSA Global (BaaN Company) until now.<br />
But it is been decided that all the customizations (in house customizations that we do) from here on will also be installed via PMC for proper tracking purpose.<br />
Now i need help on the below two issues.<br />
1. We need to implement SCM concept. A development VRC where we can check out the components for customization.(check out will be done to new development VRC which will be created)<br />
2. Once the components are tested fine, we will check in back to normal VRC.<br />
3. We need to make PMC compatible for installing our customization solutions as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
So can any one of you please help me to configure a SCM setup including a new VRC setup?<br />
How to make PMC compatible for our custmizations also?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also,any sort of documents for Baan erp 5.0c SCM and PMC configuration.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all in advance.</div></div><hr />
