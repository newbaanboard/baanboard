<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rreichenbach</div><div class="date">14th May 2010, 09:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to introduce developing BDE for implementing webservices to connect third party products to ERP LN. As this has to be done with Business Studio, as far as I know, is there a documentation on how to install and configure this Studio and is there also a documentation on how to develop those BDE as basis for webservices? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rreichenbach</div><div class="date">17th May 2010, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to connect a web application that we developed on our own, based on an IIS server and ERP LN running on tomcat. But right now we are getting some license errors although we think we did all the settings correct but I guess it is a problem because our license server is not the same as our ERP server we want to connect. Any idea on this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
you mean the connection between LN and the myday?the license error message should be on the event viewer, but from what i see you're using UNIX right?...i still don't know where to look it on the UNIX.<br />
