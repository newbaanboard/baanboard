<br />
Error -26 during seq.open file &quot;/baan/bse/bin/bshell6.1&quot;<br />
<br />
Does anybody know what is the problem? The error 26 explanation is: &quot;Text file busy&quot;, but I have no idea what could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Some additional data:<br />
AIX 4.3.2.0, bisam, old portingset 6.1c.06.01 and new (installation) portingset is 6.1c.07.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

There was work around. Installation procedure correctly changed portingset and correctly installed Baan tools. After that installation procedure terminated. I solved my problem in that way that I started a new installation and selected only application packages for installation.</div></div><hr />
