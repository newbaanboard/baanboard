<br />
We have created a table sharing set with maximum share of common and finance and we excluded dimensions and bankrelations.<br />
<br />
When verifying this, we get warnings and errors. <br />
1. Can anyone tell me what the difference is between these 2.<br />
<br />
2. Does anyone has experience with setting-up table sharing within LN10.2.1 as we are also facing problems: we are in a &quot;loop&quot; while defining the shared companies:<br />
  * General company data (tccom0102s000): Company no 612 not found in  enterprise modeling management (EMM) EMM company data (tcemm1170m000): Company not found in implemented software components. First create the company in session tccom0500m000) Implemented software components (tccom0500m000): Company no 612 not found in enterprise modeling management (EMM)<br />
<br />
As I am a functional person (so not IT), please be not to technical, although my IT-colleague is also very interested in your answer as he is doing the technical part of table sharing.<br />
<br />
thx in advance for your reply,<br />
