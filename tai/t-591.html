BA interface installed in unix systems to use the BaaN system.<br />
<br />
How to setup BA interface - ba6.1 in SCO UNIX / AIX systems for the BaaN IVc4 server on NT system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">8th December 2001, 11:57</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all you need to download the portingsets for those systems, since they will contain the needed binaries.<br />
<br />
The objective is to build a subset of a Baan installation on each of the UX'es. I have a good document on how to setup this (used to setup bx6.1 clients, should also work with ba6.1) that will help... unluckely, it's on my office, so you have to wait untill monday :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">12th December 2001, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the document but it is a printed version only, so I build a small electronic version of it. So here it is:<br />
<br />
Baan X-Windows client setup<br />
Based on IBM/RS6000 workstation setup, my comments are in blue.<br />
<br />
1. Server setup<br />
For each user that needs bx6.1 access, FILL in the entry Application Server: &lt;server_of_baan&gt;, convert to RTDD.<br />
Use ttaad2101m000 for these users and convert to RTDD.<br />
Notice: users added this way will not be able to run the BW with same username.<br />
<br />
2. Client setup<br />
<br />
2.1. Environment variables<br />
Add the BSE, BSE_TMP and BSE_REM=&lt;server_of_baan&gt; to the .profile of users<br />
Add the TERM=vt100 as well added extra for ba6.1<br />
Add to the PATH the /usr/baan/bse/bin (or where you will install the binaries)<br />
Export all variables mentioned.<br />
<br />
2.2. Users/groups on workstation<br />
Clients need to have bsp user created (UID 125) and group bsp created (GID 125)<br />
All users to connect need to belong to this bsp group.<br />
<br />
2.3. Workstation directories/files<br />
Each workstation needs a directory to store the Baan &quot;installation&quot; and it should be the same for  easy administration<br />
Even best is to use a NFS shared on all workstations I'll use /usr/baan/bse as example from now on!<br />
<br />
Create under /usr/baan/bse, owned by bsp:bsp and permissions rwx for user and group:<br />
- bin<br />
- lib<br />
- tmp<br />
- log<br />
<br />
Copy bx6.1 into bin  for ba6.1, copy this one<br />
Copy ipc_info from server:$BSE/lib/ into current lib, edit it and add in first line:<br />
&lt;baan_server&gt;!bshell  s  0  0  p /baan/bse/bin/bshell6.1   path on server<br />
<br />
Copy the server:$BSE/lib/user into the lib/user locally<br />
You can probably use a better way here, by just copying the u/r files from the users that need to connect this way<br />
The final structure will look like:<br />
<br />
I use _ in beggining to avoid Baanboard to clear the spaces!<br />
<br />
/user/baan/bse/<br />
_______________bin/<br />
___________________bx6.1<br />
___________________ba6.1  (if using ba6.1)<br />
_______________lib/<br />
___________________ipc_info<br />
_______________user/<br />
____________________rbsp<br />
____________________ubsp<br />
____________________...<br />
_______________log/<br />
_______________tmp/<br />
<br />
3. Running Baan<br />
Just type bx6.1 or ba6.1<br />
<br />
4. User changes<br />
If any change is made to these users data, you must copy the corresponding u/r files from the server.<br />
<br />
5. Upgrades<br />
Keep the same version of bx6.1 or ba6.1 as the server portingset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pcolombo</div><div class="date">7th April 2005, 01:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry victor , im not clear in somes aspects of your instructive<br />
<br />
1) What values i must setup in my BSE,and BSE_TMP, server directory or client directory?<br />
<br />
i.e my BSE in server is d:\baan and client is \baan.<br />
<br />
2) When i setup users in baan server , must i also  setup as remote users?. This is the only way i know to generate the r-file. So i suppose that i also must create a system called &lt;baan-server&gt;. Is that correct?<br />
<br />
3) In &quot;Copy ipc_info from server:$BSE/lib/ into current lib, edit it and add in first line:<br />
&lt;baan_server&gt;!bshell s 0 0 p /baan/bse/bin/bshell6.1 path on server&quot;<br />
<br />
Must i leave ipc_info on sever without changes ? , must i enter the path as Windows folder? i.e: <br />
<br />
baanserver!bshell s 0 0 p D:/baan/bin/ntbshell  <br />
<br />
4) My actual directories in client are similar as you described.<br />
BSE=\baan<br />
BSE_TMP=$BSE\bin<br />
BSE_REM=baanserver<br />
<br />
My ipc_info in client shows:<br />
baanserver!bshell<br />
<br />
When i try to execute ba6.1 i receive the following:<br />
<br />
ba6.1: Server 'baanserver' not listed in ipc_info file.<br />
ba6.1: cannot get the hostname of the server<br />
ba6.1: ba6.1 failed to connect to bshell<br />
<br />
Just to test i moved ipc_info to another location , when tried to execute ba6.1 again , i received the same errors.<br />
<br />
What im doing wrong<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and sorry about my english<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
