I was facing a very strange problem last night when reconfiguring new data definitions.<br />
I was running runtime and bdbreconfig6.1 was very very slow...around 100 rows out in 5secs. I was really suffering from this. This is IVc4 with informix (64 bit) and 6.02 porting set (3-tier).<br />
These servers are brand new with very good performance with bdbpre6.1. So I decided to test performance by running bdbpre6.1 with some big table and performance was very good, like it has always been. At the same time i noticed that bdbreconfig woke up suddenly and tables got reconfigured very quickly. I killed bdbpre and bdbreconfig was slowing down immediately. Bdbpre once again and bdbreconfig was back in full strength. So performance of bdbreconfig was tied to bdbpre6.1 process!<br />
<br />
Who can explain this? Porting set?<br />

<br />
That sounds like a real strange problem alright! How did you run the bdbreconfig and bdbpre? Both from a session or command-line or a mix? Did you use the same client/server settings for the bdbpre/bdbreconfig? (e.g. db_resource etc)?<br />
<br />
Otherwise I can only think of some sort of caching issue. Worth checking out with Baan Support I would say.</div></div><hr />

Normal settings (RDS_FULL=5) in db_resource. Baan is working extremely well in overall.<br />
This is absolutely not an I/O or cpu problem. I was very lucky that I tried bdbpre6.1!<br />
