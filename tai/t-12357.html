<br />
I have a problem with Branding a new Baan Environment... <br />
It is actually a clone of the existing environment... <br />
<br />
Solaris2.6, Oracle8, Baan V b<br />
<br />
I have to Validate it now... but first need to generate the System config.<br />
<br />
I can't login to the environment as it says &quot; You have no licence anymore to start the bshell&quot;. Doesn't open more than one session.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't run the session through the command line either.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I run brand6.2 i get the error...<br />
brand6.2: Can't open ${BSE}/lib/licence6.2;${BSE_REM}!${BSE}/lib/licence6.2<br />
<br />
If I do a &quot;Patch objects after system crash&quot; - says illegal tools object oiexpatch_obj (Error type 2)<br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered such problems. Thanks to let me know if you've got any ideas...<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />

Does $BSE/licence6.2 exists and does it contain a hostname?<br />
<br />
If it contains the hostname of the origional server, then you should be able to continue working without validiating  in the first place.<br />
<br />
If it contains nothing, then enter your current hostname.<br />
<br />
For &quot;Patch Objects after system crash&quot; the licence Daemon, where the licence file is pointing to must be down.<br />

<br />
yes...licence6.2 exists and it points to the same server.<br />
<br />
I tried by pointing it to a server running Licence daemon. Allows me to work (In fact that is how it is now since users have to work !). But when I try RSC , it says &quot;Error calling brand6.2&quot; and the log says you need to point it to the same server you are validating...<br />
<br />
cheers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">The follwoing is clear:<br />
<br />
When you run &quot;Print requested sys conf&quot;, you need to have the new server in the licence6.1 file<br />
<br />
When you point the licence6.1 file to your local host, can you then jump directly to the session &quot;Patch Objects after system crash&quot; without using the menu, by specifying the session name &quot;ttiex...&quot; on the commandline?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did run from the command line and afterwards we have the same result... No patching is done.... <br />
<br />
We do not get an error dialog box because the bshell exits immediately after executing the session... but the error seems to be the same.... &quot;Ilegal tools object oiexpatch_obj (Error type 2)&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing recorded in the log.bshell file....except saying that data dictionary not found for tccom020, tccom010, tiitm001 etc.. (Error 513). These tables are not available... <br />
<br />
Funny that these tables do not exist even in our live environments...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going to try the same..;-)<br />

<br />
Now, there was a problem with this session that needed a patch to be installed before you can run it - probably the one you found.<br />
<br />
The problem with us is that we were completely isolated, so could not put the old licensed server in licence6.2 to be able to install the patch and, without beeing licensed, we could not install the patch (even if we played with the object at runtime, but the issue is that the object needs to be patched itself) --- this was a major issue!</div></div><hr />
