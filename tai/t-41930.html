<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mptalaga</div><div class="date">19th September 2007, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We are in the process of migrating our BaaN IVc server from HPUX 10.20 to HPUX 11.23.  We have copied over the application, and the Oracle Database from our existing production, to what is going to be our new Test server.  <br />
<br />
I have contacted Infor and gotten a new license key for the Test Server that successfully registered.  I used the tools key when registering the license.<br />
<br />
When we tried to start up the server, we got a whole bunch of errors in our environment <br />
<br />
srdd_init6.1:No definition in definition file for sopen({package=B40Casup}F_BRDD:dtccom020, dtccom020)<br />
srdd_init6.1: ddtable dump 'dtccom020' not loaded<br />
<br />
So we commented our the offending packages from the configuration file in the lib directory to resolve the errors.  <br />
<br />
Per one of our developers recommendation, we also took an export of the tools from the Test Server using bdbpre6.1 and imported that into the new Test Server.  (I am not sure that was wise, advice?)<br />
<br />
After successfully getting the application up and running on the Unix Server, I am now trying to get the BW.exe application to connect to the server, but I am not having any luck.  The error message shown on the client is:<br />
<br />
1 : process 3 - Fatal error : Illegal object '/baanIV/bse/tools/ttB40_a/ottdsk/odskprogman' (error type 2)<br />
<br />
I tried taking this program and changing the security, deleting it, etc, and have not had any luck getting the application up and running past this error.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The language in this statements confuses me a bit, since registering is not reallz a part of Baan validation.<br />
<br />
Anyway &quot;illegal object&quot; is a clear validation error. As a first attempt, execute &quot;Patch objects after system crash&quot; to see, that everything is working fine. <br />
<br />
then walkl throughthe normal validation procedure, specifically the three steps:<br />
<br />
1) Entering the new keys in &quot;Maintain security code&quot;<br />
2) validate tools set<br />
3) start licd<br />
4) Configure Application<br />
<br />
naturally that bdbpre thing of tools was nonsense, as you already copied the application (BSE) directory and your oracle database.<br />
