<br />
Explain me step by step procedure for taking automatic sequential dump of tables on server (session-ttaad4226m000) as this activity has to be run in night.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">26th April 2007, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a job set that does this every Sunday AM starting at 12:30 AM.<br />
<br />
It will be tricky to setup.  You can simply use the &quot;Make Job&quot; from the tools menu to create the job.<br />
<br />
This will create the job in company 000 however.  I do not have a job service (Windows) that runs on company 000.  So, here's what I had to do.<br />
<br />
After the job was created, I used oracle to move the records from the tools job tables to the company number tables that the job daemon service runs on.<br />
<br />
Once that is done, it's simply another job that is in queue to be run on the schedule provided.  After the job is finished, I have a windows scheduled task that takes the files and copies them to another machine just in case.<br />

<br />
Thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">27th April 2007, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">when the session starts it runs automatically with the parameters that where set when the job was created. but as I said for a sequential dump you don't need to use baan jobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexbaan</div><div class="date">30th April 2007, 07:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you please send me the batch file or shell script for the same?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">2nd May 2007, 01:54</div></div><div class="posttext">bdbpre  -I c:\backup\tables.100 -E c:\backup\backup.err -p OPER_001 -C 100 &gt; d:\backup\comp100.100<br />
<br />
tables.100 has the list of tables in the company which I created by running the session count records by table and dumping the data to a text file. There are other ways to do that you could query the tools tables for example <br />
<br />
once that finishes another script zips it up and moves it do another server and sends an email to say its finished</div></div><hr />
