<br />
Someone in our organization has mentioned that with the download of BaaN's SupportEye  you receive a tool for viewing BaaN source code!  I sorta find this hard to believe that BaaN would open this up to it's non-source client base, but being we are one of the non-source clients, this does sound interesting.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else heard of this or have any information on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

will give you a nice picture of what tables, dlls are being used and what type of actions are being used on them. Plus it will give a nice picture of all the queries being issued as below:<br />
<br />
SQL 1 select tccom000.ncmp <br />
  from tccom000 <br />
  where tccom000.ncmp = :i.cono <br />
  as set with 1 rows <br />

 SQL 2 select tfgld004.gcmp <br />
  from tfgld004 <br />
  where tfgld004.srno = 1 <br />
  and tfgld004._compnr = :i.cono <br />
  as set with 1 rows <br />
  <br />
<br />
 SQL 3 select tfgld003.bcmp <br />

 SQL 5 select tfgld016.* <br />

Do you know if that will work on customized or customer written<br />
sessions,. or just BaaN standard sessions?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">It works on both as the Object Magnifier is lookig to objects. In fact all embedded SQL can be found. Thinks that will be missed are:<br />
- dynamic SQL<br />
- SQL generated from standard program<br />
- SQL generated from DAL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Much of the 'source code' information that Support Eye can give you can be found by running the bic_info.exe / bic_info6.1 command on the object (standard or custom).   This will show you all of the SQL syntax, as well as external variables etc.  It will also show you the path to the current object in your VRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">9th January 2003, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats correct. But I llike the interface and possibilities of SupportEye and the program underneath itself (bboam) more than bic_info. For example when searching for a certain string or combination can be done more easili. Also db commands can be found like db.delete, db.first etc. This is not/hardly possible by bic_info.</div></div><hr />
