It seems you are trying it on a Server with a temporary licence. Check if it works with a Licensed server.</div></div><hr />

You login to webUI admin go to Infor LN - Homepage and import it. You need to choose the environment (LN BackEnd) from homepages will be retrieved. While connecting to environment you need to enter a valid user for that environment and its password, you may not be entering correct password there?</div></div><hr />

Hi Bhawesh,<br />
<br />
I guess its something to do with the licensing. I have faced this issue. The problem was solved by sharing the license of licensed server.<br />
<br />
I guess the problem is with temporary licensing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will need to edit your SLM with the new values for all product ID, i.e. Start date = Current Date and End Date = 15 Days from current date. (As it's a temporary licensing)<br />
<br />
Do it for all the P' Ids i.e CC Licenses &amp; Server Licenses and revalidate SLM with new key.<br />
<br />
The problem will be resolved.</div></div><hr />
