<br />
We've got this strange problem that happens first time in our system (BaanIVc4/NT4/SQL7). Some form fields have display blank, or overlapping another, or field-width reduced.<br />
<br />
Copying to current VRC or CRDD did not help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Chew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">29th October 2002, 08:33</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to do a create runtime for the forms/menu as well as for the sessions for the related package combination and package VRC's, logout and logback in to see the changes reflected.<br />
<br />
You also need to check the VRC tree to see if the labels are also in the same VRC tree or not.<br />
<br />
I dont remember if the option of Labels compilation is present in the BaaN-4 series or not. You might need to do that too.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

It can happen when you customise domain of fields that are used in many forms. Even if you don't customise the forms, if fields using those domain are in the forms, then the visual appearance may be altered. For example, if you change the domain of lot code so that you can have longer lot code, then all forms &amp; containing lot code will have their lot code field overflowing to whatever that happen to be on the right of the field.<br />

We found that the field that couldn't be displayed was because it was overwritten by the field ON ITS LEFT. That 'left-side' field is the 'item description'. The curious problem is that this happens to standard forms (no customisation); and the form field definition and form layout seem correct. <br />
<br />
We can see this in for eg. &quot;Maintain Production BOMs (tibom1110m000)&quot; form 1. The 'Net Qty' is overwritten by the 'item description' field (tiitm001.dsca) when the session is started.<br />
<br />
Checking the standard form definition in &quot;Maintain Forms&quot;, it seems correct:<br />
<br />
    Field Name: tiitm001.dsca <br />
    Domain      : tcdsca <br />
    <br />
  a) the form field is defined with:<br />
          Link/Max. Displ.Len.   16<br />
          Link/Max. Input Len.: 30<br />
<br />
  b) the form layout shows that this field does not overlap the Net Qty.<br />
<br />
  c) in &quot;Maintain Domain&quot;, 'tcdsca' was not  customised.<br />
  <br />
