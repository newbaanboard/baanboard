<br />
I am currently integrating Salesforce with ERPLN data via Informatica Cloud ETL.<br />
The client is on ERPLN 6.1, Fp3, and Oracle 10 database and AIX OS. Both the LN Application and Oracle database are on the same Timezone GMT +1.00. <br />
<br />
We observed that for Sales/Service Order dates, on Application front and on actual oracle database the date shown are different. There is a difference of either 1 hour or 2 hours, based on the day light savings in Europe.<br />
Because of this difference, there is invariable changes in dates as well. For eg. Service Order date shown on ERPLN Application is 01-Jan-2013 00.12.25, but for the same service order the date stored in oracle database is 31-Dec-2012 23.12.25. Difference of 1 hour results in change of date as well. The difference doesnt remain the same over period, since there is day light savings as well. <br />
<br />
So when we pull this data via ODBC connectivity in to Staging Database through Informatica cloud, the date shown is that of Oracle Database. When we push this date in to Salesforce, we want the dates shown same as that of ERPLN application.<br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered such problems before, if yes, than what is the resolution for the same? I understand we change the TimeZone of the ODBC user, but that isnt possible or it doesnt help.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your quick reply. Thanks much.<br />
<br />
Warm Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raikar_raviraj</div><div class="date">22nd February 2013, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand date time is stored in UTC format in the underlying database. My query is what happens during daylight savings.<br />
<br />
Take for an example, a German user has been assigned a Timezone of Europe. He makes a transaction when there is no daylight savings i.e. UTC +0.00. So the date got stored in the database with UTC +0.00. Now when daylight savings are started, he wants to view the transactions, so the same date would be shown to the user with UTC +1.00. <br />
<br />
How do we avoid this? We want to show the user with the exact date and time when the transaction was entered by the user. Also there are cases where in the user has entered record at midnight and the date stored in the database is previous day because of the timezone issue. The daylight savings worsens this situation.<br />
<br />
Can you help me with these?</div></div><hr />
