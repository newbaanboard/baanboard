I receive the error 215 illegal state, and I have logged a case with Baan, but they haven't upgraded any of there DB's to v8 yet.<br />
<br />
Also, I have been unable to find any documentation or information on this process.  Anyone have any thought on what may be the cause of this lock out?  I have followed the steps to migrate the DB as per IBM and I have also looked at the SSA document for a new (freah) install of DB2 v8.1.  All to no avail.<br />
<br />
All suggestions are appreciated.<br />
