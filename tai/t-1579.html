To my knowledge there is no other way but to stop/start the licence daemon.</div></div><hr />

This is what I normally do but I'm always concerned that when you licmon -k there may be working processes that also get killed off accidentally.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

Call the Ghostbusters :) J/k, I am not sure what some of the 3rd party tools could for you in this case. I know they can prevent it happening from licenses getting stuck but don't know if they can actually remove dead licenses as they are. My bet would be that they only work in a preventive way. Killing the license daemon should not have much of an impact of current connections although we have had discussions about that before. I am sure you can search the forums for those!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">4th April 2002, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember, stopping the licence daemon will not affect existing connections.  Only users trying to connect while the licence daemon is down will have a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">4th April 2002, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that killing the licmon does have an affect on some existing processes.<br />

We run our DRP/SIC planning engines over night and 12 months ago the process run kept on crashing out during the night. The only error message seen by the user was that BW lost connection to the server. After days of head scratching I narrowed down the time of disconnection to the same time that we had a cron job running which restated the licence daemon. The cron job was disabled and hey presto the planning engines ran with no interruptions.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input guys<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gallen</div><div class="date">24th July 2002, 23:39</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a known issue we battled for a long time.  We finally got Baan to concede because of our 24X7, 365 operations and no intent to correct it in IV to increase our license count so we could make it between monthly downtimes without having to restart the license daemon.<br />
<br />
I agree in most cases, killing the license daemon and restarting won't cause problems with existing connections, but it is not a chance we're willing to take.<br />
<br />
I believe the Close Idle product is a very good one, but one word of caution.  Someone please correct me if I'm not current, but the last time I checked on it, it worked primarily off what the bshell was doing.  We run in a three-tier client server environment where every user access the db server with the same db user.  It's rare, but some sessions/jobs (year end processes for example) run for long periods of time (i.e. 2days).  All the processes on the application server appear idle for long periods of time and would normally be closed by Close Idle even though there is a process over on the db server cranking away.<br />
<br />
I believe you can exclude certain users if you can manage that way though.  I'm not real good with perl, but a previous administrator for us wrote a perl script that also checks to make sure nothing is being done on the db server before killing a user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">25th July 2002, 01:42</div></div><div class="posttext">True, the existing users would not get disconnected, however if you run sessions that goes out to validate the object like the ott sessions or running an exchange scheme you will get a message referring to the absence of a valid licence daemon.  Note that if your running in a network environment (multiple licd6.1) then licmon6.1 -k kill all licence daemon as opposed to using licd6.1 -k which kills it for that server.</div></div><hr />
