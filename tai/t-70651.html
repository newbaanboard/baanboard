<br />
I was searching in the forum, without any luck :(, a function to be used in a script, to get the time(), to be able to manage it, like a chronometer function, so to exit in case of a loop in a while iteration. For example:<br />
<br />
--&gt; get time(), after 10 seconds BREAK.<br />
<br />
 Other thing that I need to achieve: to add the time to an UTC field in a Program Script. It would be a specific time (8:00 a.m. for ex) to add to an UTC field (tdsls401.ddta, Planned Delivery Date). I'm getting the UTC date from that field, and on the script I subtract to that UTC date, a number of days based on a condition. The problem is that after I subtracted the number of days (I subtract the number on seconds) I need to add to the final date a SPECIFIC TIME.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!!!<br />

use utc.num() to get the current.<br />
Then sprintf$() th format the time,<br />
<br />
%U( format ) Use for UTC times.<br />
<br />
This option enables you to define your own time using the following subformats of the ‘%U’ format.<br />

%H hours in 24 hour format <br />
%h hours in 12 hour format <br />

utc.add()<br />

<br />
function long utc.add  (long i.utc, long year, long month, long day, long hour, long minute, long second, long o.utc)<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
This adds years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds to the input utc value and makes corrections if necessary.<br />
<br />
It processes the parameters from bigger to smaller units:<br />
<br />
First adds only years and the date is corrected (if started from a leap year)<br />
Than the months are added and the date is corrected to an existing one.<br />
The addition of days follow, and the result is so far the same hour, minutes, as it was in the beginning in the actual time-zone.<br />
Finally the hours, minutes, seconds are added.<br />

Hello bdittmar,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!! the function utc.add() worked well.. the only problem is that it's adding time (in the case I define the script like this)res = utc.add( in_utc, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, ou_utc )...and I need the time to be fix (8:00 a.m.) all the time, on all the cases when my condition is met....so for example if the user put on that field 4:00 p.m., once the script runs it will add 8 hours at the final time date, so the new time will be 12 a.m. and that's not good. It works fine when it's the inverse. The user has 12 a.m. on the planned delivery field and then the final time date it's 12+8 (8 a.m.) that is a good time since it's available on the calendar...the problem is that the original time will be always variable, that's why I need to put to my final date a fix time. Even if I rest or sum the time with that function is not good, because it will be always variable.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!!!<br />

<br />
What you need to do here is, take the mm,dd,yy,hh,mm,ss values out of your old date and store it in a new date using mm,dd,yy,8,0,0.<br />
<br />
e.g<br />
<br />
domain tcdate date.t<br />
domain tcdate new.date<br />
long dd,mm,yy,hh,mins,ss<br />
<br />
date.t = utc.num() |# Could be 5-12-2018 20:01:02<br />
utc.to.date(date.t,yy,mm,dd,hh,mins,ss)<br />
new.date = date.to.utc((yy,mm, dd, 8,0,0)<br />
<br />
I hope that is what you are looking for.</div></div><hr />

Hello bhushanchanda,<br />
<br />
Thank you so much!!! It was exactly what I was looking for!!! Now I have the time fixed like I wanted and it worked perfectly!!! thank you so much again!! <br />
<br />
just a little modification on my specific case, since I want to assign the fixed time to the field tdsls401.ddta, I'm sharing in case someone need it like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
utc.to.date(tdsls401.ddta,yy,mm,dd,hh,mins,ss)<br />
new.date = date.to.utc(yy,mm,dd,8,0,0)<br />
tdsls401.ddta = new.date<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you again!!! :):):)</div></div><hr />
