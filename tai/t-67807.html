<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">9th June 2015, 22:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working on moving my front end application server to a VM and it's on a Window Server 2012R2  I was running on Windows Server 2003.  I created all of my tasks just like they were on the 2003 server but the batch files aren't running for some reason.  no errors.  I can manually run the .bat file and it will log in and run the session the job says to but when running through the task, no go.  Any ideas?  I really don't see any errors.  all the steps are there in task scheduler and seems like all is a-ok.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be great.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<br />
Are you giving the Administrator Privileges to the Scheduled Task?<br />
<br />
Also, you can always direct the output of the bat file to some other file to check what was error logged using redirection operator. 2&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">15th June 2015, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the user on the scheduled task is an admin.  Everything is set up just as it was on the current server.  I don't understand directing the output of the bat file to another file.  I've not done that before.  Can you explain further?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">15th June 2015, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I've setup the task to call the job under the Actions tab.  The Action is Start a Program and the .bat file is in the program/script field.  Is that correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">15th June 2015, 21:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I can also successfully open the cmd window and type call c:\baan\bin\job\jobname.bat and it runs.  just when the task has to kick of jobname.bat it's failing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">15th June 2015, 21:52</div></div><div class="posttext">doing this all as the same user that is setup to run the scheduled task.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can redirect the output to a text file from a bat like this -<br />
<br />
tasklist /FI &quot;USERNAME eq &quot; /FI &quot;IMAGENAME eq ntbshell.exe&quot; /NH /FO table &gt; D:\new1\testing.txt<br />
<br />
You can refer this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=64216). There was one instance where I created another bat file to run the schedule task.</div></div><hr />
