<br />
I have been able to run it using a virtual PC (VPC 2007) session running XP from vista, but can't perform all tasks when running Baan in Vista itself.  I can install the client and run sessions/reports to the display, but anything dealing with data files (edit script, print to Ascii file, etc.) fails with a &quot;file not found&quot; error.  The same error is posted when running the application in compatibility mode (windows XP).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there perhaps a local environment variable that needs creating or setting?<br />
<br />
e.g. in XP you have in Control Panel\system\Advanced\Environment Variables a variable for TEMP and TMP of a file path<br />

<br />
I have been &quot;successful&quot; (no problems until now) with running Baan IV on Vista without any tool! I printed a report to a file &amp; I have run complex scripts with no problems.<br />
<br />
What is your BW version (mine is B40c.77)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">7th March 2007, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm running B40c.75 at this time.  The scripts seem to run properly (as well as inquiries, reports, etc), but when I try to maintain a script, it can't find the '.cln' file (using wordpad or notepad).  'temp' and 'tmp' were assigned in the environental variables (local) by the Baan setup.<br />
<br />
**** resolution ****<br />
<br />
The fix was to check the 'tmp' folder for rights.  I was not able to copy a file to that folder without having vista asking for administrative override (permission) to place the file there.  Since this Baan account is not a local (full) administrator, I changed the security (properties) on the 'tmp' folder to allow my Baan user (joined to a corporate domain) to have full access (after having Vista ask me a few times if I accept this action).</div></div><hr />
