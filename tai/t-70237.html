I’d tried to import UTF8 text via Exchange in tdisa001.txts. But it seems its not possible because the text was imported with wrong characters. The import itself works fine but it seems that I have to adjust something in exchange scheme, so LN can import UTF8 characters. For example the character “∞” is not imported correct. <br />
<br />
Does someone knows which settings have to be done that LN can import UTF8- text correct?<br />
<br />
The ASCII- File its like this:<br />
<br />
         000002<br />
{\{txts    2<br />
Row 1<br />
Flask 100 ∞ with grid<br />
Row 2 <br />
}\}<br />
<br />
Thanks for you help.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<br />
One way to give it is to provide in file down below<br />
<br />
D:\Infor\LN\bse\lib\defaults\all<br />
<br />
This Environment Variable<br />
<br />
high_ascii_tolerance:1<br />
<br />
and then try with the import</div></div><hr />

<br />
in exchange schema I used the “Multi-Byte Conversions” already and I tried the “high_ascii_tolerance:1”. Does not work. <br />
<br />
But thanks for your advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
It has to do with the Database also. Check with your Database admin whether Multi Byte haracters are supported..<br />
<br />
Its Ajesh and not Ashley,:)<br />
