<br />
I'm searching experiences with OCR reading of invoices or other paper based documents.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have knowlegde about textscanners working somehow together with Baan or even other ERP-SYstems? <br />
<br />
We are thinking about capturing our invoices with a textscanner. We are interessted in all solutions which, however read invoice-information from paper and end up with this information properly filled in in Baan.</div></div><hr />

We would like to process diff. PO from diff. vendors by consuming their pdf. <br />
