<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">10th June 2011, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">On April 16, this year, we had power interruptions and the UPS issued a halt command to our system.  I have lost data as a consequence of this.  I did not know about the lost data for many days.  The data loss is in &quot;tdsls040 - 045&quot; and I have a sequential dump of &quot;td&quot; from 4/15, the day before the system failure.<br />
<br />
I have a plan to restore the lost data from sequential dump and would like to share my plan and solicit feed back if I'm missing anything.<br />
<br />
My production company is #500.<br />
Informix settings for new archive company 550 was done prior to 4/16.<br />
BaaN suggested that I import the data for tdsls tables into company 550 and write script to put the lost data back into company 500.  I do alot of scripting, so I'm ok with this.<br />
<br />
BaaN also suggested that when I set up company 550, I should share all tables in company 500 except tdsls tables.  I have some uncertainties about the set up process.  Here is the plan.<br />
1.  Session ttaad1100m000 Maintain Companies.  Add company 550.  Convert to runtime.<br />
2.  Session ttaad4111m000 Assign tables to Databases.  Add company 550 &amp; convert to runtime.  Parameter tables for all companies are set up for audit.<br />
3.  Session ttaad4120m000 Maintain Logical Tables.  I imported from DD with physical company being 500.  I deleted td modules and converted to runtime.<br />
4.  Session ttaad4230m000 Create tables for td.<br />
5.  Session ttaad4227m000 (aka bdbpost) and populate tables; tdsls040, tdsls041, tdsls042 and tdsls045.<br />
6.  Session ttaad4225m000 setting reference integrity and repair reference counters.  I plan to use parameters for company 540 and table tdsls040 - tdsls045.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any feed back.<br />
