<br />
I have a script that works in my test environment (new porting set) without coding to prevent the divide by zero.  When we moved it up to production, it failed.<br />
<br />
for x = 1 to 12<br />
  percent(x) = sales(x) / gp(x) <br />
endfor<br />
<br />
I just thought this odd - we're already in the process of reworking several scripts with the &quot;refers to&quot; changes that were made in this porting set.....this was a long upgrade<br />

<br />
Are you sure what you find is caused by portingset difference only? The dataset you use for testing is identical? When you run your live data with an object in debug, you find that the gp(x) part equals 0.0 for sure? In your test environment, may it be 0.00000xyz also? In that case resulting in high values for percent(x).</div></div><hr />

I am not sure which porting set for your BaaN version that feature was introduced.<br />
<br />
Here is the info from the release notes of our porting sets.<br />
<br />
MaintCorelli: # 17839 (BDUX11257): Divzero fix<br />
MaintReger: # 17840 (BDUX11257): Divzero fix<br />
Date: Thu, 3 Apr 2003 16:29:26 +0200<br />
Created on:  DevNewton<br />
Type:        bugfix<br />
Problem Description (Technical terms)<br />
Bshell failed to start  because it detects division by zero event. This was caused a fix where<br />
a common signal were used to detect this event. Unfortunately JavaVM is also using that signal<br />
for internal exception handling.<br />
Test Procedure<br />
Execute Webtop.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">21st October 2003, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">But, that's what's funny - I don't have to check for zero's before dividing any more with this spak.<br />
<br />
I had a rookie programmer show me how it compiled (and worked) in our test environment (on port set 7) --- then when I moved it to production (on port set 02) - I got the bw errors.<br />
<br />
We'll obviously continue to program the correct way....<br />
<br />
btw - is anyone else experiencing bugs like never before on IVc4???  I just fixed a bug in sp12 in sales order pricing that was ridiculous (maybe this isn't the right forum for this....)<br />

<br />
Then Baan has just paved the way to time travel. That should give them the competitive edge in the ERP market.<br />
And I get to fix all the mistakes I make tomorrow yesterday. Yay! <br />
<br />
Weird indeed ;)<br />
<br />
I'm with OmeLuuk. I would check the data before pointing at the service pack.</div></div><hr />
