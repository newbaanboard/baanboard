<br />
We are planning to migrate from multi finance multi logestic setup to single finance single logestic setup. Can somebody help me out. as current setup is as under:<br />
<br />
we are currently have 3 live companies for 3 different SBU's. Well, one of them i sgroup company. Here is the setup<br />
    <br />
                                     800 (group)<br />
                                   /        \<br />
                                 801     802<br />
<br />
now, 801 want to be seprated from this setup and other two will remain as it is.<br />
<br />
So what should be done. As i have worked out a plan. Can you let me know will it be ok.<br />
<br />
1.    I will fixup a cutt off date for all three companies so that they will finalise all batches &amp; integration transactions as tfgld102, tfgld201-205 , tfgld410, tfgld416 are shared.<br />
2.    After ensuring that all non-finalised transactions are finalised. I will take dump of all shared tables as group company is 800 and data will be in 800 company which will be later uploaded in masters of 801.<br />
3. Then i will removing sharing of tables for logical company 801 from the sesion maintain logical tables.<br />
4. after removing sharing of tables, i will upload the dumped master tables in 801 and try to ensure that all master will have rows  equal to 800 tables rows.<br />
<br />
will this process will be enough or need some more things which should be considered.<br />
<br />
please advice and help out in this activity. should i seprate the VRC also. as of now all there companies are on same VRC.<br />
<br />
Please advice as i have to fixup the whole process and authenticate that it will be smooter and trouble less and get it approved from my director opertaions- asia pacific.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I assume they are running the same versions of the software, so this is not required.</div></div><hr />
