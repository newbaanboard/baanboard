These job are successfuly work upto 13.09.2007 but now when we executed the job from session ttaad5203m000, the first session is open, but, after process this session is not closed. This problem is face all of these jobs.<br />
<br />
we see the error on the BaaN server, the error report is attached.<br />
<br />
I, delete the job and prepare a new job with adding new session, also this job is not work properly work. <br />
<br />

Was there anything done on the server after 13th? Like perhaps you installed some solution or changed your porting set etc? Secondly...<br />
 <br />
...the first session is open, but, after process this session is not closed.<br />
Could you explain this statement a bit more elaborately? Does the job get executed properly and then the session doesnt close and you dont get the message &quot;Job Terminated Successfully&quot;? or Does the job doesnt get executed at all and just stalls without even opening or running any of the sessions within the job? <br />
Last but not least, are there as many jobs as there are sessions you run(like PDSO, Post Integration etc)? or Are you including all these sessions into one single job and running? <br />
Is the job daemon service running? Have you tried stopping and restarting the services or better restart the server(which effectively stops and restarts all the services)?<br />
 <br />
sk<br />
 <br />
P.S: I am assuming you are running the job at the server side...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 <br />
Sir, yes all job executed properly, but the first session open and it not closed and not show the message &quot;job terminated successful&quot;.<br />
 <br />
we are not changing in the BaaN server. the job executed but not terminated. I also confirm with the technical staff, they will ensure that there is no any change after 13th sept.<br />
 <br />
We have been make all jobs seperately, like PDSO, Prod, Purch, Cash etc. These jobs are executed on the server in morning automatically. Sales transaction related sessions are added in the PDSO job.<br />
 <br />
we also restart the server, and delete all job and executed that, but the same problem was found. After that we make a new job add new session which was not used in above all jobs and run this job, again same problem.<br />
 <br />
we can not find where the actual problem was, Please suggest how we resolve that problem.<br />
 <br />
FYI, every session also work if they are run manul, but after adding in job they are open and not closed succesfuly.<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance<br />

The other day i came across a thread on Baanboard which talks about automatically making the job session go back into waiting mode, for the next day's execution, once a job has been terminated successfully. In that case there wont be any message but Baan would get the session to be in waiting mode for the next job execution interval. For this purpose one of the checkboxes(dont recall which now) has to be checked in the Maintain Jobs session. You might have by-mistake enabled this checkbox. From your description of the problem this seems to be the likely problem. As for the errors, can you tell me what time the error was logged? Was it when you had to close the session yourself or after the job was executed? <br />
In your attachement the time shown on the error log is 15:02. Its unusual for a job to be run at 3pm which is why my suspicion whether the error was generated when you closed the window abnormally or after the job executed...<br />

Hi Sukesh,<br />
<br />
That check box is  &quot;Job waiting after execution&quot; in session &quot;Maintain Job Data&quot;.<br />

<br />
SK and kaukul, <br />
<br />
Thanks for your timely response, this problem has been resolved.<br />
<br />
This problem is due to the registry failure of the BLAT files. We reinstalled the the registry files and job are now working fine. <br />
<br />
We make these jobs and their output mailed to the concerned user, jobs are making reports files but the mail server not able to through out these reports to the concerned users due to registry failure.<br />
<br />
Once again thanks for sk.<br />
