<br />
I know similar topic have been posted earlier as well..but just getting confused with so many options explained in them.<br />
<br />
Just I need to know is what should be the fastest way to recover my lost LN envirronment (LN / SQL database) and the best way to go ahead.<br />
<br />
option 1: Keep dump of ${BSE}, keep the cold backup of data and index files of SQL, sequential dump of 000, export DD of the customisations.<br />
?? What should be the process followed here<br />
<br />
Option 2: Keep the backup of ${BSE}, Sequential dump of all companies including 000, export DD of custmisations.<br />
?? What should be the process followed here.<br />
<br />
Do we need to keep the backup of registry as well?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

Just I need to know is what should be the fastest way to recover...... <br />
Define &quot;Fastest&quot;. <br />
Do you mean like in one second, one minute, one hour or one day? Based on your answer the ways to recover might vary. <br />
If the answer to the above is in hours then these are the simple ways of recovery..<br />
1) If you are looking to recover your baan environment on to another machine, you could go by the sequential dump way(Dont think sql backup will help). The time taken for restoring a sequential dump will depend on the size of your live company and the configuration of your server. <br />
On the other hand....<br />
2) If you want to recover your baan environment on to the same machine, a sql restore would do good and will get you up and running in a matter of minutes or max couple of hours(again depending on the above mentioned factors). Sequential dump would also help but SQL backup restore is faster..<br />
 <br />
Recovering also depends on what sort of failure you are recovering from. So you got to be specific in what sort of recovery you are attempting. <br />
Last but not least, your customizations can be exported and imported using export &amp; import data dictionary sessions. It is highly advisable to have them(export dd) run at regular intervals depending on how many times your customized objects are updated. This will make sure that at any given point in time, you would be having the latest dump of your objects(customized) pertaining to the vrc they were customized in... <br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Last monday there was a virus attack on our server and it has caused a lot of damage. We are sometimes getting 'Physical Memory dump' errors on our server and thus there is a risk that we might soon have to format our system and reinstall windows and LN.<br />
<br />
So, I need to have an idea as to what should be the best strategy to get LN up and running ASAP after formatting the server.<br />
<br />
Now, what I can think of is:<br />
option 1: install SQL server database in the same location as earlier, install LN in the same location as earlier and create SQL database instances (mdf and ldf) for LN with same name and location. Replace the ${BSE} of new LN with backup and also replace the mdf and ldf files for sql with the old backup.<br />
In this way we will have application and data set in the same place again.<br />
<br />
Option two: install SQL server database in the same location as earlier, install LN in the same location as earlier and create SQL database instances (mdf and ldf) for LN with same name and location. Upload the &quot;000&quot; company sequential dump and then import all customisations through importDD session. Now, import the sequential dump of live companies.<br />
<br />
Which option will be faster and reliable. and does anything else need to be done apart from what I have mentioned?<br />
<br />
Sorry, have never done a restore and since it is a live server, a bit more cautious!!!<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

Both the options looks ok. <br />
As far as speed is concerned, option1 would be faster as SQL Restore of database is faster than Sequential Dump restore. <br />
For reliability i would choose Sequential Dump, just because i am 50-50 on Option1 to work. If you have a weekend to spare where the users are offline(if you are not a 24/7 co) then you could start off with Option1. You would know straight off once the restore is done whether it will work or not. Dont forget to stop all Baan services before restoring the BSE environment from backup. <br />
 <br />
Theoretically, both should work. I havent had the opportunity to try those ways since many of my crashes had to do with hardware and i had to shift the environment to a new machine. <br />
Last but not least, if the LN environment behaves in the same fashion as the Baan4 then i dont think you would have any problem other than a revalidation of Baan license, which again &quot;might&quot; not be needed since the environment is brought back on to the same machine. <br />
 <br />
Good Luck and let us know how it goes..<br />
 <br />

 <br />
P.S: Make sure your all your hardware components are working fine..physical memory dump could be due to hardware inconsistency as well..</div></div><hr />
