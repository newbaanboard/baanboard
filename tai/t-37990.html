<br />
I have just installed ERP Ln 6.1 FP3 on my laptop, but when I am trying to open any session into tools module I am getting following error :<br />
<br />
&quot;The Data Access Layer Denies Access*table:ttadv200&quot;<br />

Did you run session ttadv5213m000 - &quot;Create Runtime Data Dictionary for tools&quot; when you installed LN?<br />

You can also look in the user files under $BSE/lib/user and see if your usertype is super user (=S).<br />
<br />
Hopes it helps,<br />

<br />
I had run that session ttadv5213m000 after installation, after that I have installed the solution till may2007 for tools and again create the run time data dictionary. <br />
<br />
I have checked the file in the path you mentioned, there are two files for the same user, one is ubaan and other is ubaan-. In both the files user type is S.<br />
<br />
I am attaching the both the file for your information. Thanks for help. Hope you invest some more time to resolve my issue. <br />

<br />
Every thing looks alright in the u-files I compare them with ours and it is the same. Look at the permission settings under $BSE? Maybe there lies your problem. <br />
<br />

<br />
I checked permission under $BSE also I could be able to open all the files under $BSE. I have installed LN on XP with the user of administrator role but other than the owner of the computer. This may be the reason of not allowing to open the tool's data.<br />
<br />
But If this is the case then it should not allow to open all session. But I am getting error only for tool's session. Also when I run the session ttams1201m000 ( Roles and templates by user ), System is not updating the role to the concerned user. <br />
<br />
I tried to update the roles from GTM but when I convert it to Runtime system removes all the roles from ttaad200. <br />
<br />
Thnks,<br />

<br />
Can you please check permission of database folder  and database role permission.<br />
<br />
You have to also check tool tables in shared memory. You can also check your shared memory configuration. In mean while  I am also looking here.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhavinkumar</div><div class="date">29th June 2007, 09:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi sanjay,<br />
<br />
I checked the permission under database folder and database role. All the session except tools are opening without any error so probably this might not be the problem of database accessing but I checked both. <br />
<br />
How can I check tables in shared memory ??? I did only one wrong thing, not as per post installation task, that is I have selected all dll files into shared memory table instead of selecting as per document. But I can delete it also. <br />
<br />
I created one demo user also. But through demo I can access some session and for some session I am getting the same message. For some session I am getting No permission for standard message. <br />
<br />
Do I need to reorganize the table once again ?? I did it just after installation. I have installed all tool's solution but I didnot run reorganize after that (I think not required, but I had run create data dictionary for tools). <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, <br />
<br />

<br />
I created one demo user and tried to open tool's session, Its working... I have installed on oracle server. Now when you create user u need to attach it with oracle database group. Now while installing system has linked baan user with baan oracle database group. Oracle will not allow same database group name and user name, it will give error. <br />
<br />
So what I did is I created demo user and oracle as a database group. Linked both and dumped it. Now I will try for baan user. I will change the database group for baan also. <br />
<br />
Cheers....<br />
<br />
Thanks for your co-operation and help.</div></div><hr />
