NT 4.0<br />
<br />
I am trying to run a daily job using the NT Schedule Task, however the result is &quot;Could not start&quot;. I have already created the job plus the bwc to run the job and modify the startjob(batch file as follow:<br />
<br />
<br />
@echo off<br />
<br />
if &quot;%1&quot; == &quot;&quot; goto argerror<br />
<br />
start bw post.bwc -- -set BSH_JOB=%1 ttaad5203m000<br />
goto end<br />
<br />
:argerror<br />
echo Usage: startjob user-config-file name-of-job-to-start [jobfile-OK] [From-session-number]<br />
echo        where user-config-file is the name of the bwc file (leave the .bwc off)<br />
goto end<br />
<br />
<br />
:end<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
the batch file looks quite O.K., perhaps you have to enter the full qualified path (Like&quot;start C:\Program files\baan\bin\bwc.exe post.bwc ....)<br />
<br />
And you have to provide a job as a parameter in order to get this file running.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Make sure you monitor the task status even now and so.<br />
We have several tasks in our server and randomly they lose security credentials...reading through Internet forums I found several users with the same problem (some suggesting server reboots others daylight saving time as the cause). Microsoft seems to have confirmed this is problem with Windows NT 4 and Windows 2000. Unfortunetly, and as far as I know, there is only a hotfix for Windows 2000 operating systems.</div></div><hr />

                    I have gone to the thread you suggested, try what was suggested but still not working. I will really appreciate if I can get more advice since I have to run several jobs manually daily.I think the scheduling is the best way.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

We had the same problem, putting in a fully quallified path for the .bwc file also fixed it (like below)<br />
<br />
Make sure first that the job can be run from the command line before you add it as a acheduled task.<br />
<br />
@echo off<br />
<br />
if &quot;%1&quot; == &quot;&quot; goto argerror<br />
<br />
start e:\baan\bin\bw e:\baan\baan071.bwc -- -set BSH_JOB=%1 -set BSH_JOBOK=&quot;%2&quot; -set BSH_FRSES=&quot;%3&quot; ttaad5203m000<br />
goto end<br />
<br />
:argerror<br />
echo Usage: startjob name-of-job-to-start [jobfile-OK] [From-session-number]<br />
goto end<br />
<br />
<br />
:end</div></div><hr />

<br />
e:\baan\bin\startjob ? starting the task on the baan server or the client pc which is better?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andrew.page</div><div class="date">23rd May 2003, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the path right? Where is the file startjob.bat on your server - that is where the path should be pointing to.<br />
<br />
Normally it is in %bse%\bin (in my case BaaN is installed on drive E: but it could be different for you.)<br />
<br />
I prefer not to run the jobs on the server, but just to allow the server to serve. (just my personal preference)</div></div><hr />

    I have tried to run the the startjob file from the command line and it is giving an error that it can't find the job - &quot;post.bwc&quot; file and its componenets. Please see attachment.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I am able to run this on clients (windows 98), but can't get the scheduler working on NT server. In fact I didn't tried it too hard as it serves my purpose by running it on clients.<br />
<br />
In the batch file which I run through windows task scheduler, I type as <br />
<br />
c:<br />
cd\<br />
start C:\baan\lib\USER\amar.bwc<br />
exit<br />
<br />
In the BW config command line I put<br />
<br />
-- -set BSH_JOB=pdso ttaad5203m000<br />
<br />
where my job's name is pdso. U can change it with the job ur trying to run.<br />
<br />
I found this is the easiest way to run a job through a scheduler.</div></div><hr />

           But I am still getting the same above mentioned error can't find the post.bwc &amp; its components. However, I can run the job from the command line. I am using Win 2000.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

                     I had install two environments which were causing the problem. once I deleted the second BaaN enviroment, it's working fine now.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

If so which ones and what were your conclusions ?<br />

<br />
I have good experiences with Macro Angel, a freeware tool that is much more reliable than the standard windows scheduled tasks.<br />
It runs on our server since 2 years and works fine.<br />
