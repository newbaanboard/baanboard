Its Baan4c4 on SP18. This module was added to Baan while applying Service Pack 18. Its seperately licensed and so would like to know if anyone has gone ahead and started using it...<br />

We started looking into triggering functionality. It seems to be OK. It has its own limitations. What exactly are you looking for?</div></div><hr />

  Thank you for the response. We see a lot of application for triggering as an action in Baan and we been ruing the absence of having it in Baan. Now that they have provided it, with the catch being that its seperately licensed, we want to see if it really worth going for it. The triggers that we have in place for certain tables, vanishes when a re-organizing or service placks are applied and its annoying to say the least. Apart from that the triggers we placed right now have some limitations and it cant do most of the action without crashing the sessions. So thought the Baan Triggering module would take care of all that..Need someone to verify it....<br />

They are stored in Baan and extract the information out of the Audit Files. The triggers are not instantaneous as the ones from the DB, unless they are build in the script of a session. You will not lose them when the table re-org happens.<br />
