After that I inserted a company, then CreateRDD.<br />

Than logout and login again. Now I tried to create tables with ttaad4230m000. This session doesn't shows any message. But also generates no table at all. <br />

Trying to access tables in this packes with ttaad4100 results in a crash of ttaad4100 and the BW Message: <br />

I can think of following errors:<br />
<br />
1. Check files ora_storage (for either *.* entry or for the specific company entry)<br />
<br />
2. The User attach to the required package combination &amp; company and then try.<br />

<br />
I think the correct sequence is supposed to be: create new package combination -&gt; rebuild DD -&gt; restart bshell -&gt; create new company connected to the new package combo -&gt; create table for the new company<br />
<br />
Since you created new company at the time when its new package combo's DD has not been rebuilt yet, Tools probably can't create the table then. But if you tried creating tables now, it will work (because by now the DD for the package combo is already rebuilt)<br />

<br />
Check the RTDD at OS level to see the permissions and if the files are there, if not, re-run a CRTDD full for that package combination.</div></div><hr />

We found the prob.<br />
<br />
Unbelivable: seems that we have had &quot;stpsplopen&quot; object which doesn't work right. Due to this object there was no buttons visible on the printer selection mask, which pops up, after the start of &quot;create tables&quot;. We found, that the missing buttons are a knowen problem in Baan and installed a solution for that.<br />
<br />
Now everything works fine :) <br />
