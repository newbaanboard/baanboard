<br />
We are considering consolidating our Baan environments and the question of licencing has arisen.<br />
<br />
The servers are UNIX running BaanIVc and Baan IVb.<br />
<br />
We currently have approx. 15 Baan environments with five servers acting as licence servers, which will be consolidated to two ( possibly three ) servers.<br />
<br />
The questions I have are :<br />
<br />
1. can only one Baan licence daemon be running on a particular server at a time ?<br />
<br />
2. we have a development licence on one of our current servers. If we consolidate these environments on to two servers... we would only be able to run two licence daemons ( one on each server ) ? Would one of them have to be running as a development licence server, specifically to support the development environment ?<br />
<br />
Any comments around server consolidation and licencing would be welcomed !<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
assuming the same.  If you have 20 licenses on one and 5 on another, why not have only ONE license server that has the total license for your corporation (in this example 25), with a failover license server if that was to ever go down.  <br />
<br />
The license server does not really use much CPU or really need to be anything big.  For Win installations, we have used a small PC to use as a license server that feeds a production and development server.<br />
<br />
Yes ,there can only be one license server pointed to each Baan instance, and one license service running on a license server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure how consolidating two categories of licences are going to work (development and non-development) but we've gone through a similar exercise whereby we've consolidated all of our licences using Network Licences and High availability. This is at no cost.  The licence file has all the servers listed where we have a licd6.1 running. Baan recommends that no more than 3 run at a time since it generates lots of network traffic. It works well but you need to have the latest licd6.1 binary.   If you run just the Network licence then you run the risk of cutting your licence pool in half after 72 hours if  any failed licence deamon is not restarted.</div></div><hr />
