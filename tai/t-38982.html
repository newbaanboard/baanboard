Is it possible to have a 3-tier setup for Baan using Windows 2003 Standard and SQL 2000 Standard as the OS/DB combination?<br />
What i mean by 3-tier is by having Baan application on one server and Database on another...<br />

Hello,<br />

by using a RDBMS like Oracle it is the normal constellation.<br />

Application on Unix and DB on W2k3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">15th July 2007, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the input.<br />
So here is what happened.<br />
I have successfully(partially) configured a 3-tier system with the help of two servers both running on windows 2003 and sql2000 in a crosswired network config. The app talks to the database using odbc connection which is defined in the db_resource file. <br />
The config was partially successfull because i am only able to login using the default baan user that gets created at the time of installing. All the other new users i created are getting thrown out with the same error message. <br />
Error 510 (Database not on) on ttadv002000 in db_first<br />
Can not continue in ottstpstdlib(mess).<br />
 <br />
I have searched the board for this error message and found out that it could be caused by a missing db user or a mismatching password. Both of which arent my case. User creations goes well. The u&lt;username&gt; file gets created on the APP server and at the database server, the user gets created in the baan database as well. Even the login is created. <br />
 <br />
Username baan gets connected without any problem. The only difference i could see is that username baan has an extra file created r&lt;username&gt; (rbaan). Inside this file, there is the name of the app server, bse and an encrypted word.. <br />
 <br />
Can anyone help me out here. Where am i going wrong? Is there any change in user creation procedured in a 3-tier compared to a 2-tier?<br />
 <br />
Looking forward to your replies..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">16th July 2007, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Thanks to all for the replies..Here's my response..<br />
 <br />
Rao: Did you create the Remote User Data for the other login?<br />
=&gt; Yes and No. The document that i was referring to never mentioned anything about creating remote user data and so the first attempt was without a remote user. Since it wasnt working, i created a remote user login. For this, first i had to create an entry in the Maintain Systems where i created the database servername and entered the BSE path. After this i created a remote login name and connected it to this system i created. Upon running the Convert to Runtime DD, it sure created a r&lt;username&gt; along with the u&lt;username&gt; file but threw out the same error message while logging in.<br />
On another note since we are talking about remote users, i deleted the rbaan file and baan still connected. So does this mean i dont need a remote user? <br />
 <br />
Nandan: Please also let us know how what parameters you have put in db_resource file.<br />
=&gt; Since i was using odbc connection to let App server communicate with Db server, i added one extra line at the end of what already was there in the file..So it reads likes this<br />
db2_minmem:1<br />
db2_bidi:1<br />
dbsinit:01<br />
lock_retry:0<br />
msql_dsn:&lt;ODBC connection name&gt;<br />
 <br />
In the tabledef6.1 file the entries are in the following manner:<br />
cpcom000:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=&lt;remotedbservername&gt;):Y ----First Line<br />
...........<br />
*:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=.):N ------ Last Line<br />
 <br />
I even changed the MSQL_SERVERHOST part to MSQL_DSN:&lt;odbc con name&gt; for all lines except the last line without any success. This file was created from the database server name and copied to the app server. When i tried running the Create Runtime Database Definition on the APP server, it replaced the above lines to the following<br />
cpcom000:*:&lt;dbservername&gt;:N <br />
........<br />
*:*:&lt;dbservername&gt;:N<br />
This even stopped the user baan from logging in. So i copied the file from the db server to the APP and baan user was able to connect again..<br />
 <br />
Hitesh: Have u mapped data in this session(ttdba0110m000) for subsequent users .<br />
=&gt; Yes i did. Its one of those mandatory steps one needs to undertake while creating users in baan, and so yes it was done.<br />
 <br />
Another interesting event is that when i had a System(db server name) defined in the session Maintain Systems, when i tried deleting a database user, it threw a message at me saying <br />
Cannot open 'dbservername!D:\Baan4c4/tmp' file, Error 0<br />
Once i removed the entry from the Maintain System session, this error message didnt come and i was able to delete the user..<br />
 <br />
hope i answered all your queries enough to help me out in my cause..I am attaching the document that i used to setup this config to further explain the route i took..<br />

BSE_REM can be used to have an application server which uses a BSE environment on another server. In you case you don't need it and it will make your configuration more complex.<br />

<br />
You say Baan user is able to logon successfully. Its a problem with only the other users.<br />
<br />
Please try logging on to database server (from app as well as db server) using query analyzer of MS-SQL and see if you are able to logon. (of-course the Database user taken from the msql_users file for the corresponding baan user)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">16th July 2007, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Han,<br />
Part of the installation procedure(refer attached doc) requires this variable BSE_REM, which gets created when installing User Interface and Logic, to be removed from the environment variables. Therefore removing it was the first step i took after the installation procedure was done with. I even went to the registry and made sure there was no mention of BSE_REM variable under Baan. <br />
 <br />
Nandan,<br />
Yes user baan which gets created at the time of installation is able to successfully log in to baan and carry these administrative tasks i talked about in my previous post(remote user creation, database user creation, maintain systems etc). My problem is only with the other users(be it super or normal user). Any new user i create in this 3-tier setup throws up the error message i was talking about. As you mentioned, i even used the newly created user to login(SQL Server Authentication) to Query Analyzer from both App and DB server and on each occassion it successfully logged in. <br />
 <br />
If not for this new users problem, the installation is a success as any record i add to the app server is getting recorded in the DB server. Any user i create, the u&lt;username&gt; file gets created in App server while the database user gets created in the DB server. <br />
 <br />
Anything else? <br />
Appreciate all your inputs..<br />

The error message i had mentioned in my first post used to repeat twice. In the same fashion there are two log entries created when user &quot;user1&quot; tries to log in..Is it trying twice to log in? IS this log of any help?<br />

Can't think of any possible cause. Maybe someone on this board suggest the solution or way to figure out what is causing this error.</div></div><hr />

I turn on the services on DB server and tried to login with the newly created user and it works. But when i switch them off and turn on the app server services and try to login from the app server the same user fails...<br />

I would suggest that you first try to include a normal user in Windows administrators group and try to log in to Baan. If this works then you almost certainly have a problem with user rights.<br />

The user that i tried logging in with, belonged to the Administrators group. Its got identical permissions as user baan. Both at OS and at baan level..<br />
I have logged in a case with Infor and this problem was looked into and they considered what was happening as &quot;weird&quot;. My sentiments exactly from the start...<br />
Will be getting back to me with some sort of solution by tuesday...<br />

Thanks to all of you for your help. The document i was referring to (TFH-006) for setting a 3-tier system had the ODBC Driver to be created under the User DSN tab but it should be created under the System DSN tab. <br />
