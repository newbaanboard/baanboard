<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssamuel</div><div class="date">1st February 2007, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">In a Unix environment, I had a device set up to send e-mail.  The output was sent to a file, and a sh script containing &quot;mailx &quot; command was executed to send that file.  The device was set up as follows:<br />
Output to file<br />
The device argument field: ASCII\/ mail.ksh %s<br />
The device path field: /output.txt<br />
The mail.ksh script executed the mailx command and the output.txt was sent via e-mail according to the script.<br />
That was Unix!<br />
<br />
Now I am in a Windows environment, and not windows savvy.  Is there a method to send BaaN output via e-mail (Exchange)?  <br />
I would like to send reports from jobs to various users to avoid hard copy printing and eliminate the manual effort of attaching and sending files.<br />
Other suggestions?<br />
Thanks,<br />

Obviously you need to find the right way to create a windows version of your mail.ksh. Check on  Outlook's documentation for the available flags.<br />
<br />
What about enabling IIS and SMTP on your Baan server? I've never done this but what you do in unix is use unix's smtp server. If you have smtp working on the Win server where Baan is running you should be able to do the same...<br />
Maybe one of our Guru friends at Baanboard had experimented with this and can share the experience with us.<br />
<br />
And last (for now ;) ) if acquiring some software is a possibility check on Nazdaq's B2Email</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you are on the LN version you have all the BaaN standard CMF (eMessage Connector overview (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_emessage_connector_overview)) functionality available for you to use. You have to build your own programs for email interfaces, else get Nazdaq Tools.<br />
<br />
Use the keyword CMF to search for the existing discussions on this forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A little more basic this one but to replicate what you had in unix and without buiyng external software you could just find yourself a DOS type mailer. This would in effect replace the mailx command. Presumably this could be run form the Baan shell jobs in a windows setup.<br />
<br />
We have MAILER.EXE which we picked up several years ago to alert users to EDI messages which are processed on the windows side of our network. The version we run is the DOS version but I'm sure later versions of it exist out there as shareware.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you require any more info.<br />
