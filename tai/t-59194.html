<br />
Really basic question here. How do you change companies in BaaN? Here’s what I've got. I did some development within my dev environment and I want to switch to my test env. so I can set up my changes for the users. When I go to Change Company, it tells me: Package combination of company is 40Cctest; package VRCs in package combination are different. <br />
I’m new to Baan so it may be a stupid question but I need to know how to make the combinations the same. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">14th September 2010, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;Package Combination&quot; is used twice. Once as an attribute of the company number, where it defines the data model that company uses. Once in the user data, where it defines which software version a user uses. Of course, both has to match somehow (the user cannot use software that operates on an other data model than that of the company he's working in). That's why this check is done, when you just switch the company.<br />
<br />
To remedy that issue, you will have to switch the package combination of your user (&quot;Maintain user data&quot; in Tools). In the same session you are also able to enter your start company, which would be the test company. Change it there, do a convert to runtime. Logoff, logon, and you should be able to test.<br />
<br />
Last note: Don't confuse the package combination of your user (which you set in the tools user data) with the &quot;current package version&quot;. The latter defines in what (package) version you are developing, but that can be different from the (package combination) version your *using*.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a litte<br />
