1. Delete the Link Between LN User and DB User(If exists) from session ttdba0510m000 and do Convert to Run Time<br />
2. Delete DB User for that user(if exists) from session ttdba0515m000 and do Convert to Run Time<br />
3. Delete the User Id from LN User Data from session ttaad2500m000 and do Convert to Run Time<br />
