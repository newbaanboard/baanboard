 <br />
Failed to create menu bar<br />
Failed to create sub menu<br />
Failed to create menu item , <br />
<br />
The below is what comes in the event viewer:<br />
<br />
Event Type:  Error<br />
Event Source:  Baan<br />
Event Category:  Bw<br />
Event ID: 1000<br />
...<br />
Description:<br />
Env Baanivc4 (c:\program files\baan)<br />
Prog BW file U:\ui\bw\ts\win32\p_bmnimp.cpp #183<br />
Keyword<br />

Message Failed to create a menu bar<br />
<br />
<br />
Similar messages come up for:<br />
Failed to create sub menu<br />
Failed to create menu item<br />
<br />
One odd thing to mention, that U:  directory does not exist..and is not put into any of the parameters that are known...wonder what that is referring to...?<br />
<br />
This does not occur until the client is running and starting the DDC for some period, it does not pop up right away.<br />
<br />
We have vast DDC experience and have not seen this before.  This is on a Windows 2000 Server.  The error clogs the event viewer and eventually the PC running the client locks up.<br />
<br />
It seems to be a BW Client / Baan issue...?  Baan Support did find the error and had them upgrade their porting set, BW clients, but still the error persists.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen anything like these errors...?   DDC related or not...?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes it can be resolved by increasing the Windows Desktop Heap size.<br />
<br />
Basically Windows limits 20,000 user objects per server or 10,000 per user.  Once this limit is reached you can start to see this error message.<br />
<br />
If there was another resolution, please let me know.  Thanks</div></div><hr />
