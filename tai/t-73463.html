I have a problem with making project costing [tipcs3250m000] in job.<br />

<br />
Did you setup the session in the ttaad7520m000? <br />
<br />
Also, try to trace the parallel processing to get more information from the help manual.<br />

Parallel Application Processing Debugging<br />
By default the server processes run in a Bshell without a UI. This is a Bshell started with the –server option. For debugging the server side application, a server Bshell can be started through a new BW instance. This allows you to debug the server side application in the classic Bshell debugger. To enable this mode, take the following steps:<br />
<br />
Set environment variable DS_AS to value &quot;bw&quot; (-set DS_AS=bw) for the client Bshell <br />
In BECS on the client system, mark the correct .bwc file as the &quot;default&quot; <br />
From Enterprise Server 8.7 onwards, debugging of Parallel Processing Applications is also supported by the Application Studio. See the application studio documentation for a description of this feature. <br />

Parallel Application Processing Tracing<br />
Error reporting and tracing is an important aspect of a product which is usually run without any user interface. Therefore two mechanisms are used: error logging and tracing. Below the characteristics of these two mechanisms are described. The characteristics of the error logging mechanism are: <br />
<br />
Serious errors are logged unconditionally <br />
A single error log file is used in which all serious errors related to parallel processing are logged. <br />
The name of this file is: ${BSE}/log/log.parbshell <br />
The maximum file size of this file is: 512 Kb <br />
When this size is reached, the current log file is named &quot;olg.parbshell&quot; and a new empty &quot;log.parbshell&quot; file is created. <br />
The characteristics of the trace mechanism are:<br />
<br />
A single trace file will be generated per parallel session run <br />
All bshells started for this run will send errors and trace output to the same file. <br />
The name of this file is: ${BSE}/log/trace.parbshell.&lt;pid&gt; in which &lt;pid&gt; is the process id of the client Bshell <br />
Tracing is enabled by setting the environment variable: TRACEPARBSHELL in the client environment. This variable can be set to the following values <br />
0 - no tracing <br />
1 - trace API calls <br />
2 - trace communication <br />
3 - trace API calls and communication <br />
Each trace line is constructed as follows:<br />
<br />
[date time] &lt;user&gt;:&lt;session&gt;(pid), &lt;component&gt; (bshellpid): &lt;message&gt;<br />
<br />
In which &lt;component&gt; is one of:<br />
<br />
ClientAPI <br />
ServerAPI <br />
SupportAPI <br />
ServerCOM <br />
ClientCOM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">9th December 2020, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we do have this error a lot in our LN 10.2 environment. It is common in our planning Job and often happens in cprrp1210m000. Jobs are executed by the Infor job demon.<br />
We do not have a working solution, nor do we know what's the cause of the error. But the error will happen on the start-up of the session only. (I don’t remember it happening after some minutes). That’s why we implemented a very simple workaround, nothing fancy. This is because we cannot solve the error but handle it.<br />
<br />
You can define/modify the reaction on an error for every session in ttaad5101s000 (the three fields bottom up).<br />
Default is ending the job, when an error occurs. But you can chance the setting to continue and how many steps in the job will be skipped, if an error occurs and how many if all goes well.<br />
<br />
We’ve changed that to continue if an error occurs and repeated the step cprrp1210m000 4 times in the planning job. <br />
If the first try goes well, the job will skip 3 steps/sessions in the job. The second step (will be started, when the first one fails, will skip 2 steps). The third step will skip 1 step. You get the figure.<br />
<br />
This may look to simple to work, but it works. Most times it will run successfully in the first or second step. We’ve had very view errors where the second step failed too, but the third worked.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: We've had our service partner and Infor on this case. The multi bshell setup has been checked, too. But the error simply ignored all invested work and time. He just continued to happen. That's why we created the &quot;It's to stupid to work - ok, let's try it!&quot; workaround...</div></div><hr />
