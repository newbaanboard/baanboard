<br />
The exporting seems to work fine but the import immediately jumps to 70% and completes the process in under 5 mins (for 20Gb of data, I dont think so).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how this is supposed to work but it seems to not be doing the SQL loading bit at the end, but there's no error message and on the SQL Server tab of bctls0100m000 it doesnt matter if I enter valid or invalid SQL details there is never any kind of error<br />
<br />
I've tried scenario 1 (disconnected servers with dumpfile in the middle) and 3 (all in same env) from the manual and neither work.  They both appear to do something, but the result is nothing changes<br />
<br />
HELP!</div></div><hr />
