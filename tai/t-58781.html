<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">7th July 2010, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">does the user have the proper authorization?  Login to security as the usersadmin and check the roles assigned to your myday user. See the guide for the details on the role names.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hardei</div><div class="date">7th July 2010, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply. With which user should I login? Do I need to create users in Windows. I tried to login with Administrator user, but got the same message.<br />
<br />
Also, I tried to login into MyDay with UsersAdmin and the password which we mention while installing MyDay. But got the same message.<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">7th July 2010, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">During the installation you had to specify a usersadmin user and password. Use this one to login and create additional users or assign new user roles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hardei</div><div class="date">7th July 2010, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We had created login and password that time. But still with the same password we are not able to login.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">7th July 2010, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">which tenant code are you using? it needs to be 'infor' for the usersadmin. It needs to be 'system' for the manager role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hardei</div><div class="date">7th July 2010, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using the same tenant code.. While installing MyDay we changed the manager and usersAdmin password. I am using UserID as &quot;usersAdmin&quot; as given in the installtion guide and password as we mentioned during installation.<br />
<br />
What UserID should we provide. Can we retrive the password? <br />
<br />
Do we need to do something at ERPLN level as given in the integration document. I am trying to do MyDay stand alone installation.<br />
<br />
Am I missing anything during installation? <br />
Do you have any other MyDay installation guide other than standard installation guide? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">7th July 2010, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I don't know what is happening.<br />
In the Install log file the user ids and passwords can be found specified during the installation.<br />
<br />
Can you login to security? with the manager user id on the 'system' tenant?<br />
<br />
There is no configuration required in LN for login into the multiple applications. Only for the drillback from MyDay to LN that setup is required.<br />
<br />
Did you already raise a support issue?<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for all your help. At last we installed MyDay successfully. Now main problem is to integrate Myday with ERP LN.<br />
<br />
We are referring to the Infor document, still incase you have any idea, then please share.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
