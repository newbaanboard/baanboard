<br />
some years ago I worked for HP as an employee and I actually spoke to someone, who was officially maintaining the source code for the tar implementation within HP-Ux. He said, that the 2 GB limit was programmed on purpose into the tar code for compatibility reasons!!!!<br />
<br />
Anyway there is a simple solution: User the GNU version gtar. You can find it precompiled and as a SW install package on the porting archives for HP-Ux and it has no such limit.<br />
<br />
Also I think cpio has also no such limit, but I am not so sure about that.<br />
