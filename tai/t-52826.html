No matter what I try I cannot get it to print. According to the baan device queue it printed succesfully but never makes it to the printer queue. The printer is installed locally on the client pc. All other applications can print fine.</div></div><hr />

   Could you try installing HP LasterJet 6L driver for this printer and try printing again? I use LaserJet 1022 &amp; 1300 and it works ok on default drivers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">25th June 2008, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We can get around it by using a different driver, at least for a few days, then the printer stops working for other applications and we usually end up reinstalling it.<br />
<br />
What does baan have against this one printer?</div></div><hr />

For a permanent solution, what we did then was to use different printer drivers. We created two printer setups in Windows. <br />
First one, the default, based on the correct drivers and will be used by other applications. <br />
Second one, based on HP Laserjet 6L drivers, would be installed by the name &quot;Baan Printer&quot; (for e.g). This same name will be given in the [Device Queue] field of &quot;Maintain Device Data&quot; session in Baan. <br />
<br />
This did the job for us at that time...<br />
