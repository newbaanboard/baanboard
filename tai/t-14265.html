<br />
I have recieved a finance dump ( standard patch ) from baan , upon extraction on local pc i found that it contains scripts and objects for Library, then i imported this dump in my PROD package combination on demo server, but problem is still existing for which i reported the case to baan , my doubt is that do i have to run session Create Runtime Data Dictionary for my PROD Package combination so that a entry goes into ttadv999 table ? or this table only holds records for session and not for libraries ??<br />

<br />
a &quot;Patch objects after error solving&quot; should be enough.<br />
After that you can compare the output of &quot;bic_info -w &lt;object&gt;&quot; with the output on your PROD server.<br />
If the outputs (compilation date) are different, contact support again.<br />

So in your case it is clear: No Create Runtime.<br />

The Patch objects after error solving will have no influence on your situation. thir is a purely validation issure.<br />

Well i did the import of this patch through normal IMPORT DATA DICTIONARY session , instead of PMC.<br />
<br />
should i import it through PMC ???<br />

You might use &quot;import patch&quot;, but the recommended procedure is tu use PMC. <br />
<br />
I you did you &quot;import DD&quot;, then the import just might have failed and nothing was imported! :-)</div></div><hr />

Well after the import data dictionary  i checked it in my PROD Package combination, by printing the standard report &quot;Print Libraries in Production PVRC&quot; it gave me the output, and saw that whatever objects were there in dump.l file , they all got in my respective <br />
tf B40c c4 prod vrc.<br />

following was the path of the dump which baan told to install.<br />

Yes we r on sp13 and i used this session only ttiex1284m000 to do the job, the solution no. which i installed is 138455<br />

i am still clueless whether the objects r being refered from Production vrc or not  or do i have to use PMC ??<br />
<br />
or whatever i did is correct ???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 09:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course you have to use PMC. PMC installs the components in the Update VRC. I assume your PMC setup is OK, because you could install SP13.  If you use PMC for SP's and ttiex1284m000 for normal solutions you will make a mess of your dictionary.<br />
If you install with ttiex1284m000, you have to specify yourself the VRC in which to import the components. If you didn't specify a VRC, the components are imported in tfB40_c5. Because this VRC is not in your package combination, you will not see the new objects at runtime. If you specified a VRC, the objects are installed there. Depending on your VRC tree and the package coimbination you will either see the new objects at runtime or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 10:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
yes, i imported this solution in my Customized PVRC when it was asked in session ttiex1284m000. now the components r kept in<br />
B40C c4 PROD<br />
<br />
<br />
Reason i thought is if the solution creates a problem then my live users r not affected, since my customized vrc does'nt fall under package combination to which the normal users r attached.<br />
<br />
so as the above reason I mentioned do u still feel that i should have imported this soltion in standard update vrc through PMC ???<br />
<br />
if yes, then let me know,  i will do  it.<br />
<br />
also let me know about the situation where the standard update solution creates a problem after installaing through pmc, what i feel is that if we import these standard updates in customized vrc then it would be easy to do testing without affecting live environment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">The best way is to create a second Update VRC in PMC where you can test solutions.<br />
<br />
Steps:<br />
- Create new Update VRCs derived from current Update VRC (ttadv1111m000 + ttadv1115m000)<br />
- Register this Update VRC in PMC (ttpmc2140m000)<br />
- Copy PMC registry (ttpmc2290m000)<br />
<br />
Now you can install solutions with PMC in the new Update VRC. Keep in mind that this does not work for tools solutions; they go into your live environment immediately.<br />
<br />
If you don't use PMC, you will not be warned about dependent solutions, which may cause an inconsistent environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for all the help.<br />
<br />
I will do as u said, when i imported this solution i din't received any error because i did it using ttiex1285m000 Import data dictionary &amp; this solution was having just dll objets, moreover the solution was not having extension as .dump<br />
<br />
I specified session code ttiex1284m000 , instead of ttiex128m000 in above post.<br />
<br />
Thanks all of u.<br />

<br />
I agree with these guys, you need to fix your PMC setup, you should never import Baan solutions into your production VRC. <br />
<br />
But in this case, check to see if the object is loaded in shared memory, you are on NT and that isn't automatically flushed, so while your physical object might be correct, you may be pulling the old object from shared memory.<br />

<br />
Yaah i agree, but does that means that for Application PMC dumps we should create a test vrc as suggested by JAPP JD<br />
<br />
Steps:<br />
<br />
- Create new Update VRCs derived from current Update VRC (ttadv1111m000 + ttadv1115m000)<br />
- Register this Update VRC in PMC (ttpmc2140m000)<br />
- Copy PMC registry (ttpmc2290m000)<br />
 <br />
<br />
and once it is confirmed that the solution suggested by BaaN doesn't create any problem , we should import through PMC in our Standard Update VRC.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">27th January 2004, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't derive the test update VRC from your current update VRC, I would derive it from the standard. That makes it a little bit more complex, but I think its a cleaner setup.<br />
<br />
<br />
And remember no matter what you do, Tools solutions go into tools (for which there is no update VRC), So it is impossible to test them In Baan 4, they just go in.<br />
