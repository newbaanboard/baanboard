<br />
having a problem getting the scheduler to start jobs on our win 2003 server using the startjob.bat method.<br />
<br />
We've set up a user job003 with a bwc that stores the password. The bwc works. Then theres a batch file that starts the job with the .bwc. this works fine too. Then theres the scheduled task which is set to run the batch. The task starts but won't run.<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem to matter which user we run the task as (including the domain administrator). All we get is the following in the event log<br />
<br />
Event Type:	Warning<br />
Event Source:	Baan<br />
Event Category:	Bwconfig <br />
Event ID:	1000<br />
Date:		22/09/2004<br />
Time:		1:08:42 p.m.<br />
User:		OURDOMAIN\job003<br />
Computer:	OURSERVER<br />
Description:<br />
Env	 Bse (d:\baan)<br />
Prog	 BWCONFIG file \ui\bw\config\bwconfig.cpp # 284<br />
Keyword	 BwConfig<br />
Username	 baan	type S	language 2<br />
Process	 0x11f8<br />

Message	 Current user is not allowed to re-use password information from 'd:\baan\lib\user\job003.bwc'<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Can you pass the password as a variable through the batch file, is there an option somewhere to allow stored passwords, or is it a windows 2003 'security enhancement'?</div></div><hr />

So, it should be possible to make it work that way. I've never seen the error message you have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Log on on you console as user job003. Store the password in the bwc file.<br />
<br />
Make sure that your job is running as user job003 (properties in scheduled tasks).<br />
