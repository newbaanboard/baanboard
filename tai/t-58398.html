<br />
The authorization groups define what the authorizations are for the users who are linked to the role for data in particular table fields. For example, the following authorizations are available:<br />
Write/read<br />
Read<br />
Not authorized</div></div><hr />

Hi, most customers already have their item code standardize so is not possible to get them change it. <br />
<br />
however i have figure out the way to do it using the roles<br />
<br />
1st use table field authorization for the tcibd001.item to read only<br />
2nd than only you unblock the table field date authorization for manufactured type.<br />
<br />
in this case any normal users with this roles can view all item code but can only add new item which is manufactured type. <br />
<br />
this work but however is a bit troublesome as the item general always start with the item type purchased first. <br />
<br />
still fine tuning</div></div><hr />
