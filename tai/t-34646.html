<br />
first the situation is after installing a patch 3 tables were modified namely tdind000, tfacp954 and tfacp953 but changes where visible at the session maintain table and not in ttaad4100/4500 , as per procedure logged a case with Baan ,so they tried lot by delete, CRDD and create but no success so they decided to rollback the patch loaded and go to previous state, for that they suggested to <br />
<br />
1) restore baan\dict and baan\application folders from old backup by <br />
    renaming current one and CRDD for the related tables<br />
    but still the new defs of tables tdind000, tfacp953/54 again crated and<br />
    also the all the components session, form, domains etc. recreated in the<br />
    respective directores and s/w started showing errors at every stage<br />
<br />
and there is no any mistake in restoring the backup<br />
<br />
so pls guide what is the correct process of rollback ?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
Umesh</div></div><hr />

If you use backupTrestore for rollback, than you also need to restore company 000, as it will contain some parts of the patch.<br />
<br />
Actually what you should have done is to use simply PMC to uninstall the patch.<br />
<br />
But a normal application patch should not create trhis problem at all. If all is done right, than a CRDD should work in 99% of all cases and if not the 1% of errors can be successfully debugged.<br />
<br />
I assume all of this is happening on a test system and not on the life?<br />

<br />
Have you tried to restart your server after patch installation? Your profile says that you are on Windows. On Windows servers, table definitions in shared memory often do not refresh after creating RDD. In such case you will see the changes in Maintain Tables, but not in ttaad4100/4500. All you have to is a server reboot.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for quick reply, but restore company 000 means to restore from <br />
sequential dump of 000 is it right. and is the CRDD for Menu and forms also<br />
required or not?<br />
<br />
pls. help me out as it is my live server.<br />
