<br />
I have attached the screenshots the steps I did to copy company data. The strange thing is that, I did these steps in my Live Environement and they worked by not working in my Test Environment.<br />
<br />
1. I run session ttaad4226m000 to create sequential dump of company 700.<br />
2. I run session tccom0214m000 to replace 700 company with 900.<br />
3. I run session ttaad4227m000 to create tables from sequential dump.<br />
<br />
And at this time, the problem arises. I have searched all the forums here but not able to find the problem.<br />
<br />
Please help!!</div></div><hr />

The online help of tccom0214m000 contains a detailed description of the procedure. Did you noticed that?<br />
<br />
Within tccom0214m000 you should replace ALL 3 companies if they are related. So use 800&gt;900;801&gt;901;802&gt;902;<br />
<br />
You run this for each company, start the session in the original company!!!<br />
ALWAYS check the sequential files if the modification has been done! E.g. in ttccom170*.S<br />
<br />
IMHO: the error you get has nothing to do with the above process. Probably you have still users working in that company? Check the eventlog or logfiles, they should contain more information.<br />
<br />
Please test this first in a separate BSE if you have never done this. Check if the application keeps working, especially if you don't have bookings in the wrong company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I have gone through all the steps explained in the online help of the session on how to copy company data.<br />
<br />
I have followed the same steps. . The thing is that, when I do it in Live Environment, it works. But when I do it in Test Environment, it fails and gives this bdb error. I am afraid that it should not happen in future with the Live Environment as well, so I have to close this issue.<br />
<br />
I have check if there were any users logged in and found no one. So, I think the case it not that. I have attached the bdbpost log file. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felipe_Saavedra</div><div class="date">28th March 2013, 02:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Error 510 (first error on your log)  This indicates that the database has not been started. Start the database to correct the problem.<br />
Error 506 on your log means taht the table do not exist.<br />
<br />
Try to delete all tables from company 900 then create all tables for company 900 toi be sure all tables had been created properly.<br />
<br />
Once done it repeat the load process with the flag &quot;Append if table exist&quot; turned on. This should fix your issue.<br />
<br />
