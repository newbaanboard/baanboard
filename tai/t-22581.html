<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">10th December 2004, 04:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I have searched all the posts on the board related to password aging and found lots of good suggestions/solutions that could be used in variety of situations. We have successfully developed a solution (usin ipc_info) that seems to work fine when we are using BW client but it doesn't work nicely when we try to use it through WorkTop (due to ttdskbrowser vs. ttstpoledaem).<br />
<br />
Was wondering if someone else has implemented any password aging solution while accessing Baan using WorkTop?<br />
<br />
If someone is interested, I can provide more information on what we have done so far.</div></div><hr />

Initially it also had problems with Worktop. Now there is a baan solution for it. I won't remember the number I am afraid.<br />
<br />
Would you mind sharing your password aging solution for BaanIV with us?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<br />
We have implemented password ageing in Worktop/BW using 3 GL session which is part of BMS Mask (ttadv4188m000) with boot option selected, this starts when BaaN is invoked from client. This sessions checks last login stored in custom table for user and invokes passwd if required ( based on our ageing policy). <br />
<br />
Was developed for BW, but also works like a charm for Worktop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is exactly that, what we also want to do, but it don´t work with worktop. I have also tried to do this with &quot;session startup&quot;, but all this metohods only work for ascii or bw client, but not for worktop (vers. 2.4.1).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

See attached img, it works for me with worktop.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure which porting set for your BaaN version has this fix. Here is the info from my case -<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
Startup session groups not working<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
1 Make sure &quot;Session Groups&quot; option is checked when &quot;convert changes to Runtime DD&quot; for the user datra.<br />
2 Get the latest portingset (sol. 134945). It has the fix for the Startup session defect.<br />
3 Please note that, Startup sessions usually only work when the Bshell Name is &quot;bshell&quot; in the BW configuration. If you use something else, here are 2 workarounds:<br />
<br />
When doing a conversion to runtime the following entry is created in the userfile by the 4GL (Tools):<br />
bshell.sessions:&lt;name of the session file&gt;<br />
so, the Bshell name has to be &quot;bshell&quot;. If not, the startup sessions are not executed.<br />
The idea behind this is, that normal users have Bshell name &quot;bshell&quot;. And administrative users might have another bshell name, and don't want to have the startup sessions.<br />
Further it seemed to be a problem for the 4GL to retreive the Bshell name.<br />
<br />
The workarounds if they use something other than bshell in their BW is:<br />
==================================================<br />
workaround 1.:<br />
<br />
Suppose the Bshell name is bshell_corelli;<br />
1. Create a file $BSE/lib/defaults/bshell_corelli<br />
2. Put the following line in this file:<br />
<br />
bshell_corelli.sessions:sta_sessions<br />
<br />
3. Create a file $BSE/lib/user/sta_sessions<br />
4. Put the sessioncodes of the startup sessions in this file, eg.:<br />
<br />
ttaad2100m000<br />
ttaad2500m000<br />
<br />
workaround 2.:<br />
Another workaround is (but this one has to be applied per Baan user):<br />
After creating a Session Group, Assigning Startup Sessions to this group, and linking this Group to a Baan user + Convert to Runtime,<br />
the following entry is created in the file $BSE/lib/user/u&lt;baan user&gt;:<br />
<br />
e.g.: bshell.sessions:sta_sessions<br />
<br />
Now modify this line to:<br />
<br />
bshell_corelli.sessions:sta_sessions<br />
<br />
Solution : 134945 Portingset on Baan ERP B52a (7.3a.03) - Covering Letter.</div></div><hr />

We stopped working on our Password aging solution due to some other priorities and actually somebody informed me that SSA is coming up with a standard password aging solution for BaanIV, but I could not confirm it yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw your post and we are interested in knowing how the set-up for password aging is done on your system. We would like to know how this is achieved without the use of Worktop, since we are having Windows 2000 server and do not have this functionality as of know.<br />
<br />
Please share the same with us.<br />
