<br />
Because we are going to move from HPUX to a linux environment, we've to export the 000 company.<br />
<br />
For me, the best option is the bdbpre6.1 command with the following arguments<br />
<br />
bdbpre6.1 -x -o /home -C 000 -q cia.000.dmp -E error.000.log <br />
<br />
I would appreciate some piece of advice from anyone who has dealt with this situation.<br />

<br />
in $BSE/lib/ora/ there is a shell script or a .sql script that will create an I file for a company. (or you can just write you're own sql to extract it..)<br />
OR you can just use export tables from within Baan.<br />
<br />
You can do that and then do<br />
bdbpre6.1 -I&lt;filename&gt; -C0 &gt; 000.dmp<br />
<br />
pre files are surprising relsiliant especally when moving from one flavor of unix to the next. just make sure to xfer with scp or binary mode ftp. I also  usually gzip it just to be 100% sure that there is no character conversion on xfer.<br />
<br />
Another option would be to do a db style export<br />

I finally decided to only do that selectively only for the stuff I knew I was going to need like users &amp; authorizations via the provided objects for it (the name of the object slips my mind right now) devices via bdbpre, etc. <br />
<br />
Joan, I am curious to know why you decided to do the whole company 000. Not that it is wrong but on the contrary because I am still on time to re-evaluate.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
