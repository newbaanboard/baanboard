<br />
Did anyone use this command to kill the bshell processes?<br />
<br />
bshcmd6.2<br />
Usage: bshcmd6.2 [options] &lt;bshell_pid&gt;<br />
<br />
-v              : Print version<br />
-p              : Show process list<br />
-m              : Show memory usage<br />
-d &lt;dbglvl&gt;     : Set DEBUG_LEVEL to (octal) &lt;dbglvl&gt;<br />
-k &lt;pid&gt;        : Kill bshell process id &lt;pid&gt;<br />
-e              : Kill all bshell processes<br />
<br />
I tried to use it, it didnt work. I have created a unix shell script which can kill a particular user or all the users for a particular bshell BUT it has to be executed only as the ROOT on Unix Box.<br />
<br />
Any idea???<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
U can use this command as follows<br />
<br />
bshcmd6.2 -k  &lt;pid&gt;  &lt;bshell_pid&gt; <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">USAGE: <br />
<br />
-w &lt;sec&gt;        : Wait &lt;sec&gt; seconds for bshell to execute command<br />
-u &lt;sec&gt;        : Send SIGUSR1 to bshell (wakeup). Only to be used in<br />
                  combination with -w option. Waits &lt;sec&gt; seconds to<br />
                  see if the command is executed.<br />
-s              : Show entire contents of logfile (if accessable)<br />
<br />
 For example :<br />
<br />
bshcmd6.1 -s -u5 -w5 -p 32300<br />
<br />
Shows all bshell processes of the bshell with PID=32300.<br />
It is necessary to use options -w and -u, to &quot;wake&quot; the bshell.<br />
<br />
bshcmd6.1 -e 32300 <br />
This command kills all bshell processes of the bshell with PID=32300.<br />
<br />
 The bshell PID can be seen using:<br />
 licmon6.1 -w<br />
 ps -aef |grep bshell<br />
<br />
 I hope this information is helpful. It is for BaanIVc4, but it should work in the same way for you (I hope ) if you replace 6.1 with 6.2.<br />

I am pretty sure most system admins are using a custom built script to do that job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
thanks for all your suggestions.<br />
<br />
To give you the complete picture of the situation -<br />
<br />
1. I have my own shell script which can kill all the users, based on a bshell... BUT I need to be a root to kill all users or use the setuid bit for that shell script.<br />
<br />
2. we are working on the version-6.2 the latest baan release. I tried the bshcmd6.2 and it does kill the bshells. The new BaaN BW is using the Worktop than the old static browser. I had few sessions opened and I used the bshcmd6.2 to kill my bshell and I was expecting all the baan windows to close and logge out. Instead they were just present, while I noticed that the .bwc file from the startup was closed. So I guess the bshells are closed, when I click or close on of the baan windows all the baan windows are closed. But the main menu or the work top document remains open, which gives us a feeling that we are still connected/online and our bshell is not killed. When I click any session from my menu, then the worktop shows a status message, reconnecting and gets back online.<br />
<br />
Since we are working on a new release I guess most of you might not be aware of these features.<br />
<br />
3. We had an alternative idea so make a wrapper around the shell script that it executes as a root, more security for our unix admin guys and we can modify the script ourselves, than if the script is owned by the root.<br />
<br />
any more ideas to share are welcome!</div></div><hr />
