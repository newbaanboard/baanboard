<br />
I really need some help here. When printing from Baan I get this message: <br />
<br />
Sorterror -11: The sort process can not start.<br />
<br />
Nothing is printed. The printer daemon is running, and so is lpd. Printing manually from Unix also works. Rebooting the server did not make a difference.<br />
<br />
The spool file in $BSE/tmp is generated, but it looks like it's not sent to the printer queue. When I check the queue with lpc it stays empty. <br />
<br />
What's wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help,<br />

Perhaps is number of processes in system or number of processes for user too small.</div></div><hr />

This is what I got from baan help - hope it helps.<br />
<br />
error 11  - No more processes The system tries to create another process, but there are no more processes available. <br />
 <br />
<br />
-	This means you should increase the kernel parameter NPROCS. (No. of processes.) By default is should be 64 * BAAN User License. But still it can be, that there are not enough processes available, think of other application running on your system, requiring processes as well. In this case you have to increase the parameter NPROCS via the system administrator. <br />
	-	In case the used database is BAAN Base or BAAN Base TP, you might change the configuration file $BSE/lib/bisamconfig. The first parameter in this file, PROCESSES, represents the maximum number of processes. By default it should be: <br />
<br />
         In case of  BAAN Base          :  18 *<br />
         BAAN User License<br />
         In case of BAAN Base TP        :  30 *<br />
         BAAN User License<br />
  <br />
<br />
If you want to change this parameter, remember to shut down the database by running $BSE/etc/rc.stop before you do so, and run $BSE/etc/rc.start after the change. You should maintain the file $BSE/etc/bisamconfig by tbase6.1 or tbase_tp6.1. Before you do so you should always make a backup of this file. How to use tbase6.1 or tbase_tp6.1 is described in BAAN Base.<br />

<br />
On top of that, /dev/null changed into a regular file, and was no longer a character special file (crw rw rw).<br />
<br />
After changing the permissions back into 666 the problem was solved. But /dev/null has still to be changed into the character special file - by using 'mknod'. So if anyone of you has a clue?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what caused this. Some output redirection to /dev/null, done in the wrong way, but by root for sure. Has anyone seen this before?<br />
