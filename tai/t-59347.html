   We just cloned a server from our production server and setup the database and everything just as production.  When I try to access a particular table in GTM, I am getting &quot;File ttcmcs006 does not exist&quot; error.  But when I checked on the database, the table exists with rows!  Could you please tell me why I am getting this error or what I am missing.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">10th October 2010, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">the most likely explanation is that the entry in your tabledef6.1 for that particular table is messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">10th October 2010, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">oh, or it could be permissions on that table.<br />
<br />
make sure that your group user has select,insert,update,delete on that table.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have triggers on or around that table you should check into those.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trchandra</div><div class="date">10th October 2010, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply Dave!  I have gone through your website and the information on tracing was invaluable!  <br />
<br />
Regarding the issue, I am more willing to go with your first comment. Because I have other tables tdsls400, tdsls401 etc exist in that company and I am able to view them in GTM.  Its only few tables, though they exist at database level, it is giving error when trying to open in GTM.<br />
<br />
Here is little more background about the situation.  This issue is coming when I am trying to browse some tables in Baan Archive Company.  We have companies 109 &amp; 110 (production) and 409 &amp; 410 (Archive).  Production companies and archive companies are created into two different databases and I have included entries in tabledef as shown in the attachment.  There is also logical table definition to some of the tables as defined in the attachment.  <br />
<br />
As you mentioned, I think it is issue with either tabledef or compnr.  Could you please help me to fix.<br />
<br />
PS: I added .txt extn to attach files.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">11th October 2010, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, so you don't have a specific entry for ttcmcs006<br />
<br />
so it should be falling through to this line:<br />
*:409:oracle8(ORACLE_SID=baanarch):N<br />
<br />
<br />
which means it should be connecting to the baanarch DB.<br />
<br />
can you validate that?<br />
<br />
rm dbs.log; DBSLOG=01570 qptool6.2 -q &quot;select count(*) from tcmcs006&quot; -c409<br />
<br />
then have a look at the dbs.log file. make sure it's  connecting to baanarch. and look around or other errors.</div></div><hr />

While cloning the server, I copied tabledef from qa instance and I totally forgot to update it.  Now after I fixed entries, everything seems to be working fine!  <br />
