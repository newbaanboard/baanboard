<br />
We have encountered with an issue wherein whenever user changes his password he is not able to login to BaaN. Getting attached error (username or password not correct) though the password entered in BECS is correct. Moreover, same user is able to login via ba6.1 method. I think the problem is with blogind6.1 because in log.blogind6.1 I can see error &quot; Errno 112 (No attribute found)&quot;, no other error found in other log files.<br />
<br />
Can any one help here? :)</div></div><hr />

And I actually just did this on purpose on our system.  It specifically tells me the password is incorrect(in the bw messages).   And then it gives me the same message as yours.  Maybe you need to convert to runtime on the user bsp - I am assuming the user id is bsp and not a normal user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">12th November 2013, 08:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark.<br />
<br />
Thats what I am wondering too. Even by putting correct pwd in BECS, its throwing out and for ba6.1 no issues.<br />
<br />
I ran CRDD too, no use. Even general tracing not happening. Can you help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th November 2013, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry - no I can't really help.  Those were just the things that popped into my mind when I read the original post.  I am not really an admin on our baan systems. To me it seems like the bsp user lost the ability to launch bw - bw startup program.  Or maybe since the password change the bsp user lost connectivity to the database - what that authorization failure message makes me think of.   I am not sure how all that works together.  Sorry not much help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is one remark in rc.start_blogind file:<br />
# be sure that USER environment variable is NOT set, otherwise each user is mapped to the same baan USER...Can you try to kill baan login daemon, check if variable USER is set, if yes run command unset USER and then start baan login daemon again?<br />
After that check if you can login to Baan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you on windows? Have you tried changing the password from active directory too? Also, have you ran command gpupdate on your domain server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">13th November 2013, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">@ jclju1 - Yes, changed password is causing the error. Other users are able to login!<br />
<br />
I tried unsetting USER variable but not use.<br />
<br />
@bhushanchanda<br />
I am on AIX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">13th November 2013, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm,<br />
<br />
Not much help then. What kind of mapping do you have for user's? Single DB user and multiple other users? I mean is it 1 - 1 or 1 - many?<br />
<br />
If its 1- many then, you will need to run a few commands. I hope some AIX expert would help you. Also mention your DB, so that people can understand the issue better.<br />
<br />
Also do have a look at the related threads, may be you will get some hints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">13th November 2013, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I will assume that the message about the invalid password comes up as soon as the BW client is fired up ( not even getting to the window to enter the User ID and password).<br />
<br />
This explanation is for BAAN IV c3. The BW Client has the facility (unfortunately cannot be disabled) to save the entered configuration, which unfortunately also includes the password. SO, when the configuration is saved like this by a user, and his password expires due to policy, resetting the password does not help because the password saved in the configuration supercedes the changed password. As soon as he double-click the BW Client icon, he will be ejected.<br />
<br />
The configuration is in a file under  C:\Program Files\Baan\lib\user, and it can have any name the user wants to give. Usually, it should be default.bwc<br />
<br />
<br />
In that file, in the entry for password, simply blank out the password and save the file. <br />
<br />
The saved password entry would like:<br />
password=EyzHy1PlIu0O6<br />
<br />
Just have to blank out the characters after the = sign. <br />
<br />
Possible to edit the file using notepad.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, copy the file from a different computer and replace the bad one with that.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
p.s. request user not to save the configuration with the password.</div></div><hr />

I tried your way but unfortunately it didnt worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">14th November 2013, 23:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I was not correct to use the words 'blank out' - actually, you have to delete the characters after the equal sign so that if you are navigating using just the right-arrow key, as soon as you pass the = sign, the cursor goes to the next line.<br />
<br />
But if that does not work, I have no other suggestion as to why this happens for you, other than it is a bad keyboard where some characters are not typing correctly. Reset the password again to something simple, all lowercase, to at least check if it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">15th November 2013, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes..I tried that too but didnt worked. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th November 2013, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I am confused - is this issue a BWC file on a PC client?  Or is it the actual server that has the issue?  Does trying to connect as BSP fail on all clients or just a specific client?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">16th November 2013, 12:46</div></div><div class="posttext">@Mark - The issue is whenever user changes password, he/she is not able to connect BaaN using BECS method, however, ba6.1 is working fine. Even 90% users who didnt changed password are working fine but we have 90 days expire policy so I suspect this would create problem for other users too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If possible log a case. I guess in the recent porting set released, a bug has been identified which I think is similar to yours. What porting set are you on?<br />
<br />
The problem was seen in P.S 8.9a. So, a recent is available 89a01.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">18th November 2013, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Team<br />
<br />
Got a clue atleast!<br />
<br />
Due to long password encryption algorithm its creating problem which is mentioned here-<br />
<br />
a.<br />
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/Uma/entry/password_encryption_algorithms83?lang=en<br />
<br />
b.<br />
http://user-techdocs.blogspot.in/2011/06/support-for-passwords-with-more-than-8.html<br />
<br />
Due to long passwords, blogind6.1 or BECS is not able to understand new password but same is working with ba6.1.<br />
<br />
Please let me know, what settings to I need to change or install patch because Infor is still searching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">18th November 2013, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">You must have also tried the following:<br />
- Create a short-cut of the BW.exe file on the desktop<br />
- fire it up and set up the configuration again (host, BSE directory, etc. [except, of course, the password])<br />
- save the configuration in its default place and exit<br />
- double-click the icon and see if you can enter the password to let you in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th November 2013, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - maybe I be simplistic, but can't you reset the password to something shorter?  If nothing else to make sure you get in.<br />
<br />
I know at one time our unix servers did not take anything after 8 characters, but somewhere along the way they got fixed to accept longer passwords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">20th November 2013, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Suhas,<br />
<br />
Did you tried getting a trace of login?<br />
<br />
You can try this command. <br />
<br />
&gt;blogin6.2 –p 7150 –ssl security/ssl.properties –d &gt; ${BSE}/log/blogin.log <br />
2&gt;&amp;1<br />
<br />
Check what it gives in the trace file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">21st November 2013, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">@ Mark<br />
No..even I change short password, because of pwd_alogorithm setting, the password's length is too high. Not considering for login.<br />
<br />
@Bhushan<br />
<br />
For your trace, I am getting-<br />
blogind6.1: TCP bind() to port 7150 failed, error 67<br />
blogind6.1: Could not create listen socket<br />
<br />
<br />
To All-<br />
<br />
Now I am sure, the issue is due to pwd_alogorithm = ssha512 in our login.cfg file which our system admin changes due to compliance issues but problem is why BaaN is not reading longer password. Can any one tell how BaaN reads password? Can issue would fix upgrading PS? How to trace it?<br />

Here is the same discussed earlier-<br />
