<br />
I've tried to import a demo company from a sequential dump.<br />
Therefore I created a new company. Then I created a new package combination and copied the needed *.pd and *.pd.old files in in %BSE%\dict\dd{name of package combination}.<br />
After that I used session &quot;Load mandatory tables for audit&quot;. While creating table from sequential dump (session ttaad4227m000) in the next step an error in bdbpost occured and the attached errorfile was created. The data I need is given in a dumpfile.<br />
<br />
Thank you for helping me!<br />

<br />
I don´t understand why you didn´t do an export data dictionary (ttiex1280m000) from your old package combination and import it in the new one (ttiex1285), but you will have your reasons for that....<br />
<br />
The Error-File says that there´s a problem with the data dictionary. You should rename the dict-directory of your new package combination to &lt;package_combination_new&gt;.OLD.<br />
After that create an empty directory with &lt;package_combination_new&gt; and copy all the contents of the dict-directory of the package combination of your source company in it. <br />
If you use a windows system you might have to reboot the server before you start the bdbpost again.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

By doing a package combination copy thru the OS, you will only be able to access/change data, no domain/table development since there is no application data definitions entries at app. level (only the RTDD ones).</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you very much for your help.<br />
Despite your hints which I implemented, there was still the bdbpost error, but nevertheless the democompanies are working more or less. So that will do.<br />
<br />
Bye,<br />

<br />
Please complete your user profile with regards to the Baan software version, Database software and OS version. This will help other members when diagnosing your problem. <br />
<br />
You can ignore the bc (BaaN Conversion package) and dc (Development Control System-Internal Tools package) errors.<br />
<br />
You would not be able to use them until you install the bc, dc, and cc(BOI) packages.<br />
<br />
I would be more concerned abou the &quot;tg&quot; (Orgware/DEM) package errors.</div></div><hr />
