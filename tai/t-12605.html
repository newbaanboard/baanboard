<br />
since yesterday it is not possible anymore to create new tables in BaaN V 5.0c. I wanted to create a new company and tried to create tables but the system stood still. I don´t get an error-message and there is enough space in Informix. Since I am not a database specialist I would be much obliged for any hint/help on that.<br />

I had a similar problem on my system. After I tried to create a new table, the message was: &quot;0 create tebles&quot;.<br />
Then I started ttaad4100 and tried to look at my not-yet-created table. I've got an error 1217. More it was written in log.informix .<br />
have you got maybe that error, too?<br />
<br />
ps - I haven't saved that problem yet :-(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do the table definitions, then the convert to runtimes for all tables referenced in the new definition, including the definition itself. (All package combinations)<br />
<br />
Then I do a create runtime for all package combinations as well.<br />
After that I do the create tables by company.<br />
<br />
Is that the sequence you follow?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">15th August 2003, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Please post any entries from log.informix and log.bshell.<br />
<br />
Also, you might also consider setting DBSLOG or TT_SQL_TRACE environment variables as this debugging might help you to understand what is happening via the SQL statements being used.<br />
<br />
Regarding database errors reported by Baan, I believe you need to substract 1000 and then lookup the code in Informix.  On my system that command is &quot;finderr &lt;errnumber&gt;&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Are you sure, that this is Informix error, I've checked Informix documentation and there is no such error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">23rd October 2003, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked my informix documentation for the error code 11001 and got the following:<br />
<br />
-11001	General warning.<br />
<br />
This Informix CLI error code is the same as SQLSTATE value 01000. The<br />
following functions can return this error code: all Informix CLI functions<br />
except SQLAllocEnv() and SQLError().<br />
<br />
The function returned SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, which means that the function<br />
completed successfully, and that a nonfatal error occurred. For more<br />
information, call SQLError().<br />
 <br />
<br />
But: Did you reduce the baan error code by 1000 (because that is the informix error code!).</div></div><hr />
