Can any one can explain what are the major differences in between these two, like log on to the bshell6.2, run sessions, add crontabs etc.<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">29th December 2001, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">What a question :) I think you can write a whole book about this topic. To put in a couple of lines: any type of action that is done within the Baan application - that is running sessions etc - should be similar on NT and UNIX platforms. As Baan is supposed to have a 'platform independant' front layer. However when you are talking about everything 'around' the Baan application - e.g. system administration, database maintenance - you are facing a completely different ball game. Compare it with the following analogy: if your UNIX system was a highly customizable, programmable PC at which you can add, tweak, mess around with at much as you like, then your NT system would be the average kitchen refrigerator where you can control its operations by pushing a few buttons only.<br />

Have I now invoked the wrath of NT guru's? :p</div></div><hr />

For your direct questions: if I remember correctly, you also have on NT the option to start a 'shell' from the Run Program menu only this will not spawn a ksh (Korn Shell) but rather an MS-DOS-like box. From this you can use the standard MS-DOS commands to view, edit, manipulate files and objects. Additionally there is a what6.1 binary available in your $BSE/bin - again if I am not mistaken - that replaces the default UNIX what command under MS-DOS.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some.</div></div><hr />

So after an update of the software you have to make sure that your environment is stopped and started again in order to make sure that the latest table definitions and objects are loaded.<br />
Futher a reprint is not possible. (at least a few month ago it wasn't).<br />
<br />
All other issues can be solved.<br />

This is a pain when you want to run things like bic_info that errors if you don't have shared memory available.:mad:</div></div><hr />
