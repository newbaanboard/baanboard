<br />
We are looking to upgrade from client version 47 (BWPrint version 6.1c04) to 88 (BWPrint version 6.1c07.17).  However, we have a font that displays the company logo at the top of our reports.  In version 88 the font receives a full line relative to its size.  Version 47 does not do this.  The font receives one line regardless of how large it is.  If the font is larger than that one line it spills over to other lines (see attached examples).  <br />
<br />
Our problem is this: with client version 88 the font pushes down the rest of the layouts, moving the bill to address etc.  The address is moved so much that it is no longer displayed in the envelope window after it has been folded.  <br />
<br />
Is there a work around for this?  Has anyone experienced this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ben</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as a matter of interest why are you upgrading to 88 ?<br />
<br />
Have you tried any of the later clients and their behaviour ?<br />
<br />
Cheers Neal</div></div><hr />

On the Change position window, there is a checkbox that says Legacy Mode.  If you select that, all of the reports should print like they did on your old client.  Unfortunately, this does have to be done on every client.  There is a corresponding registry key, but I don't remember what it is.<br />
