<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I do know of a few places that are running XP Pro on some machines and they have had no problems as yet (apart from a few font issues with the skinning options, but that can be switched off)<br />
<br />
I would think that as the Baan client is updated there will be less problems with it and new operating systems</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">12th April 2002, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no official mentioning from Baan that the BW is supported on XP, but since this one &quot;should&quot; be backwards compatible with 2000/NT, you should not have any problems  BUT  with MS you never know:<br />
<br />
I tested BW on my Baan days on 95, 98, 98SE, ME, NT, 2000 even when ME/2000 was not released yet and had a few problems with ME (font smaller, buttons not shown!...).<br />
<br />
There's just one way to find out, install it and check by yourserlf, if everything displays fine, then you have 99% of sure it will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nizamudeen</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using BaaN client under Windows XP since 1 month and noticed the below<br />
<br />
if we leave the system idle, there will be a BW error message<br />
<br />
WIN32 API Function BitBlt  failed, error =6 <br />
Failed to draw first part of upper shadow half <br />
<br />
But, BaaN will not abort. You can continue work. Did anyone has come across this problem ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">This sounds like a error between the BW client and the graphics controller. A similar problem occured in earlier clients with animated cursors.<br />
<br />
If you have skin loaded try removing it, or if you are using the XP shadow cursor, try turning it off. Due to the handling of the windows/ Baan client graphics there has always been some problems, fonts, gifs or DEMs not looking right or fitting correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason of mouse scroll feature not functioning may be proper driver. I think, you are using it through plug-and-play feature.<br />
<br />
Already discussed earlier.<br />
