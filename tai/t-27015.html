We have a number of users existing Baan. To trim this data we need to identify the active users say for the last 6 months. Does anybody has utility (shell script) to extract this data.<br />

Hi there,<br />
<br />
to extract which data? If you havn't collected any, there is nothing to extract I'm afraid.<br />
You might have a look at table ttaad320 in company 000, but here you will only find printjobs and most probably these won't reach back far into the past ... (if the tablename hasn't changed with LN, this is Baans spool history table in Baan IV)<br />
Isn't one able to turn on monitoring on a M$ system, so all user activities will be logged?<br />
Or start a batch job calling licmon6.2 every few minutes and collect the output.<br />
Even on a unix box I couldn't think of any trick to access such data (which user was online at what time having run which program) for the past 6 month.<br />
<br />
But I am interested if anyone has an idea :-)<br />
<br />
good luck<br />
<br />
Norbert</div></div><hr />

Couldn't you run ttaad2402m000 - Print User History for the past six months and just identify users that didn't appear.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
easier is to:<br />
grep &quot;registered&quot; $BSE/log/log.licd6.X<br />
<br />
this can only go back as far as your log.licd6.X goes though</div></div><hr />

In LN the new licensing mechanism is handled by SLM (SSA License Manager) and there is no licmon6.2<br />

This works under the assumption you have turned on the user history in the user data templates and have not purged it.<br />
Alternatively, since you are on Windows'2003 machine you can refer to these links to get the last user logon info -<br />

We have a lot of users who are no longer working with us. We create a user at the OS (W2000 Server) and then also at the DEM level. Run User Dialog, link to role. And dump user to Database.<br />
<br />
I have been told that a user cannot be removed.<br />
<br />
Can anybody advise me ?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
As your profile reflects, you're on MS$, there's no &quot;shell script&quot;.<br />
On Unix you may use last or lastb ?<br />
