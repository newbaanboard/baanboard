<br />
You need to generate the XML file for the standard LN report which is generated when you print the report using SSRS Designer Device and then provide the XML file name with .rdl extension while designing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So do I have to redesign every standard report on BIDS, for it to Open on SSRS device?<br />
I was wondering if Infor has already done this job; for all the standard reports.... And we can get them just by installing some standard solutions. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

And it didn't clicked me as the users requirements are mostly not available that easily e.g. Print Bill Of Material (tibom1401m000) So, you are left with BIDS only :) So, follow the solution Bhawesh mentioned and alternatively, you can check in session ttadv3530m000(Reports) as well, to get the reports for which the External Report Design Present checkbox is checked.</div></div><hr />
