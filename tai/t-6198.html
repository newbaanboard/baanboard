I'm looking for a possibility to setup special baan-user writing no messages in the log-files in $BSE/log. Or to setup a own logfile for a user and to have no messages in the standard-logfiles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">13th August 2002, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea of the log files is to record ALL activity. It is obviously not correct for one user to go about in stealth mode.<br />
<br />
Probably for that very reason there is no way in Baan that you can stop or redirect logging on a user level. Of course you could write an external utility that would bend the log files a little, but this kind of creativity normally doesn't go down well with QC or auditing officials.<br />
<br />
Another thing you shouldn't be trying is putting the user in a group that has no write permissions in $BSE/log (I have actually no clue how Baan handles that, I have never tried it myself).</div></div><hr />

<br />
-- -keeplog -logfile &lt;name of your file&gt; <br />
<br />
in the command line (BW) or ba6.1 -- -keeplog -logfile &lt;name of your file&gt;<br />
<br />
Logfile save in tmp directory under NT and user directory if you don't specified the path under Unix</div></div><hr />

-- -nolog<br />
-nolog : stdout and stderr will go to the controlling terminal <br />
(if possible - on remote connection no output will appear)<br />
<br />
Another option is to remove your logged lines afterwards via some kind of OS script...<br />
in vi you can use command :g/logname/d<br />
will global perform command d (delete) on all lines that contain logname...</div></div><hr />
