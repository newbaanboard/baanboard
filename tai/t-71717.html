<br />
I call two standard form commands with a user form command in extension.<br />
<br />
The session Purchase Proposals (whina3110m000) has the two standard form commands &quot;Confirm&quot; (function, confirm) and &quot;Transfer&quot; (function, transfer).<br />
<br />
I created a new user form command &quot;Confirm and Transfer&quot;. Now I call the standard form command confirm and then transfer.<br />
I can not compile the extension as the both functions commit() and transfer() are not known if I do not declare the object &quot;whina3110&quot; with #pragma used dll in the declaration section. The standard commands like &quot;add.set&quot; or &quot;modify.set&quot; are availabele without this declaration.<br />
<br />
Declaration:<br />
<br />
|global declarations for extension script.<br />
<br />
|enable standard form command with loading object whina3110<br />
#pragma used dll &quot;owhina3110&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
User Command Hook &quot;execute&quot;<br />
<br />
function extern void function.ext.custom.function.1.command.execute()<br />
{<br />
|* Use this hook to perform the real command actions.<br />
        confirm()<br />
        transfer()<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this the right way, or is it not allowed to do?<br />
Can I solve it different?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Lakoon</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your Solution looks good on paper, Is it working?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lakoon</div><div class="date">20th February 2019, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it's working without any issues till now.<br />

<br />
Also as an alternative you can use, load_dll,get_function and exec_function in sequence also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">22nd February 2019, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">This should work without any issue most of the time. A form command is nothing else but a function call in the standard UI script (there are other types, like the option to start a session, but clearly that's not what you want to put in sequence).<br />
<br />
However, if the form commands somehow operate on selected records in a grid, I'm not sure what the selection does after the first form command is executed. That may depend on the actual implementation. If the selection is lost after the first command is executed, the second has nothing to operate on.<br />
<br />
[Edit] Ok, now I see the real problem: Is it allowed to load the standard UI script as a DLL? I'd say yes, since this concerns only the compile time. On runtime, both objects will be linked anyway, right? The 4GL engine calls into the standard script or(!) into the extension script. I see no issue when the extension calls into the standard script. That should behave exactly the same as if that same standard script code was contained in the extension.</div></div><hr />
