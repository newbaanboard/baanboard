<br />
Does anyone have experience in migration from Informix 9.40 fc3 to Oracle?<br />
<br />
At the moment we are going to switching to Oracle from Informix.<br />
If there is in detail document with all steps to migrate from Informix to Oracle.<br />
<br />
Are there any known problems regarding Baan IVc4 and Oracle? <br />
<br />
Any problems with the migration? We are planning to move on a new server <br />
with the new database. <br />
<br />
We are grateful for every small reference.<br />
<br />
Thank in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">4th April 2008, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I made one such migration. Major steps are as follows:<br />
- validate Oracle database<br />
- export all companies data into ASCII files<br />
- install Oracle SW and create instance on a new server<br />
- copy baan directory from old to a new server<br />
- manually change $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1 on a new server<br />
- run ora8_install6.1<br />
- import company 000 data using bdbpost command<br />
- import all others companies data from Baan session<br />
- change database definition in Baan table, create all needed users in oracle, ...<br />
<br />
I thnik there exists one old document for migration from bisam to Orace database. It will help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">4th April 2008, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We did this last year, using bdbpre and bdbpost for all the import and export, company 000 and all the other companies.<br />
<br />
We had better success with the ASCII export and import than we did with the binary. So use bdbpre with the -t'|' option. We found that over the years, the old database had gained some data that violated the table definitions (fields that were too long, etc). Oracle is less forgiving. Using the ASCII export allowed us to clean up the data. bdbpost was usually pretty good about telling us where to look for the corrupt data. <br />
<br />
Be sure to follow the Oracle install guide in Infor Document number U70281US. <br />
<br />
Leave yourself lots of time for tests. You may want to load the data a few times and run various tests to make sure Oracle is configured properly. Once you have done a load, make sure you have lots of disk space for the data, the backup recovery area, the Oracle temp files (I've seen our Oracle temp files grow 15G overnight for no good reason I could find). Since Baan is database-independant, some of its queries and some of your custom queries and table defs could create a lot of temp activity in Oracle.<br />
<br />
Develop and test your backup system. If you are going to use archive-logging, make sure you have a way to clean out the old logs so your recovery area does not run out of space. <br />
<br />
Its harder to configure Oracle once you've gone into production, so try to sort all this out before hand.<br />

I exported data with this option as well for all companies except company 000. Maybe I was not clear enough, with &quot;ASCII files&quot; I tought files ttable_name.S</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">4th April 2008, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I was more commenting on the fact that you used bdbpost for company 000 and the sessions for everything else. This is probably just a matter of taste: I don't know much about those sessions. I liked using bdbpost because I could pipe its output to a file to review later. <br />
