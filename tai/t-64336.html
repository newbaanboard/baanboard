<br />
I wanted to install new windows printer as an option to the print queue in infor ERP LN. because for every report &quot;P&quot; will direct to the default printer on the client side. <br />

<br />
If yes, then you can create a device as Windows Printer type. See the attachment.<br />
<br />
If you want to print the report using other printer, you  can check the &quot;preview&quot; option, then you can select a printer different from the default device.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acefalcon2k</div><div class="date">23rd July 2013, 02:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's say I have 2 printers on my client side and when I print out a report I wanted to send the print outs to printer 2 however the default windows printer is printer 1. Thus when I choose option &quot;P&quot; it would print to printer device 1 and not to the desired printer. Is there a way to add a device within LN without the need to do your 2nd suggestion? <br />

<br />
I am not sure if there is any such option in Baan. It selects the default windows printer. We use just a single windows printer device, then, the user can select the printer he wants to use by using the view option. Its simpler way and yes, the user can verify his report as well. <br />
<br />
The second thing you can do is, change the default printer and print the report.<br />
<br />
Thats all I know, if there is any third option to print directly from non default printer, I would like to know as well.</div></div><hr />

I am no expert on this and have always just told them to use the default printer, but we have windows printers setup where it looks like this \\printserver\printername in the device queue.  As a test you could install two windows printers on your desktop one called a and b - then set up two devices.  One to a and one to b - see what happens.<br />

OOPs we are on 4c4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That could be a way. Went through few thread's and found some info about the same.<br />

What you can do is, you need to install all the printers on a server say Printer Server, and then you need to share those printers with all the client machines. Now, on client machines install the printer using options like install network printer. Now, you can specify this printer path in the Device Queue field.<br />

I remember one situation where I had to create a specific printer for a manager.  This way they could print to their personal printer.  I remember the printer name created on her machine always had to be named the same.  I think in the print queue name I used her name - example the printer name was markh and I just put that in the queue name.  I think that was how it was done - I can't find the setup since we do not use windows printing that much.</div></div><hr />

then it prints to this ...also if it is not your default printer locally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acefalcon2k</div><div class="date">25th July 2013, 03:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys I will try this today. Hopefully it will work. <br />

I just worked out how to print directly to my own local printer, I selected the Baan Windows Printer option in the device window, this message appears: Printer 'local' not found, print to default printer? then I pressed OK &amp; it printed to my local printer.</div></div><hr />
