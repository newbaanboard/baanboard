<br />
I would like to seperate the presentation- and application Server.<br />
LN6.1: User Template<br />
IV: User Data<br />
<br />
There you can set up a so called &quot;Apllication Server&quot;.<br />
So in theory the User is logging in and then connecting to this application Server starting the bshell. <br />
<br />
But nothing works - the bshell is running local and nothing happens on the &quot;Application Server&quot;<br />
<br />
Does anybody know how this configuration is working ??<br />
<br />
regards<br />

So you already have split the application and presentation layer.<br />
<br />
Not sure what this mentions in the user data template, but before you could set up a application server which contains only the bin and some other directories like lib. The application itself could be retrieved from the second application server. This setup is usefull if your application server is loaded by e.g. pcf calculations.<br />
<br />
I have done this in the past for BaanIV having two application servers and one database server. The advantage of this setup is that you only have to update the application on one server. However portingset installations must be done on each application server.<br />

What I would like to have is that the User logged in Server1 but the bshell is running on Server2. The database is running on Server3 - that's working perfectly using OracleNet (TWO_TASK ...)<br />

<br />
That's not possible - unless you're refering to the user being logged into Server1 and that's their BW / webtop / Worktop.<br />
<br />
With BaanNET the bshell starts on Server 1 but fs6.1, the oracle driver (and others) start on server 2. <br />
<br />
You do this when you want multiple application servers for load balancing so that you can keep your objects up to date on a central server.<br />
