<br />
I have 3 problems with the new environment.<br />
<br />
1) Modifying the title Bar.<br />
In baan 4c3, the to mod the title bar, I use general table maintenance to modify table ttadv450000. The record holding the message code dsks0046<br />
can be modified to personilise the title bar.<br />
I tried this in my new Baan5c environment and it didn't work. <br />
<br />
2) Default currencies.<br />
In the maintain company session, the default currency field (for each company) allows you to zoom. When I open the zoom, I expected to see a list of currencys but the list is empty.<br />
I checked the currencies table using session tcmcs0102m000 &amp; found 6 currencies set up. I would have expected the above zoom to see these.<br />
<br />
3)Is there a way of automatically populating the session ttaad4111m000<br />
(tables by database) to include all the audit tables?<br />
<br />
Thanks - Mick</div></div><hr />

i will try to answer your questions.<br />
<br />
1. refer to this (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=95) thread. There's a post from N. Prashanth Rao which explains the use of environment variables to change the windows title string in Baan Sessions.<br />
<br />
2.Do you mean ttaad1100m000 (Companies in tools)? In this session the Zoom works on ttaad1106m000(Generic Units) which should be filled with predefined Currencies.<br />
The currencies in tcmcs0102m000 are used for defining your reference Currency and up to two report currencies for the companies in tcemm1570m000 resp. tcemm1170s000.<br />
<br />
3.In session ttaad4111m000 you can load mandatory tables for audit via Specific menu.<br />
This is populated by a file called tables_audit in $BSE/lib.<br />
Initially this file contains not only all parameter tables but also some tables which are used in a high frequency. Refer to Solution 113613 on Baan Support.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Thanks for the response.<br />
All 3 problems are now solved - almost.<br />
<br />
I was still getting an error because the datecurr file in $bse/lib didn't contain uny 'u' records.  <br />

<br />
These are for UTC times.<br />
I had to enter these manually by copying from another system. This solved the problem.<br />
The other system (also baan5) generates these ('u' recs) when doing a create runtime in ttaad1107m000. <br />
My problem is -<br />
I cant work out where these 'U' records are picked up from to create the entries in the datecurr file.<br />
The tables ttaad106000 &amp; ttaad107000 are identical on the problem system when compared to the working system - so they're not coming from there.<br />
Any ideas which Baan session is used to create these UTC Time records?<br />
<br />
Thanks again - Mick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">27th October 2004, 08:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mick,<br />
have a look at ttadv486000; Session ttadv4586m000; one entry per record per language.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks once again.<br />
After copying the entries (in the ttadv session) between environments I found that the datecurr file included the U records.<br />
<br />
Think I must have missed something when performing the Baan 5 install that resulted in the date &amp; currency stuff not being set up. Otherwise, the environment now seems fine.<br />
<br />
