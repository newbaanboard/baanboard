<br />
We have new printers in our company from Nashuatec / Ricoh<br />
<br />
http://tiny.cc/e9kl3w<br />
<br />
I added them in our Baan IVc4 as printer like our old HP Laserjet 4000 printers, and also on the new Windows Server 2012 printserver.<br />
<br />
Printing with Office (Word , Excel etc) and other Windows Programms from User Computers is no problem, everything works fine. <br />
Also the Baan Windows Server can print with Notepad etc. on these new printers. <br />
<br />
My problem is that Baan itself can only print when i use the &quot;WIN&quot; printer in Baan. I print over &quot;WIN&quot; in Baan and Baan prints on the local Standard printer of the client computer. This works fine for the old HP Printers and the new Nashuatec MP 201SPF printers.<br />
<br />
When i use a printer queue Name in Baan as example &quot;Export&quot;, so i want to print on the printer in the Export Department, there is no Output on the printer. <br />
<br />
Print Job that does not work:<br />
Baan generates two files in the $BSE\temp Folder when a printjob doesn't work. There is a file with no ending and a *.bpf file<br />
These .bpf file i can print with bwpint.exe but Baan should print directly !<br />
As example: Filenames are  &quot;tmp090070881&quot; and &quot;tmp090070881_30709.bpf&quot;<br />
<br />
the file without ending and the .bpf have the same data inside, but the .bpf File has this extra data in the first line:<br />
<br />
@ -p &quot;\\SRV-04\EDV&quot; -c  2 -f      1 -t      3 -l  66 -m   0 -L ISO-8859-1 -a      1 -r rttaad240001000 -w 200 -d P  -B &quot;EDV&quot;@<br />
<br />
in every .bpf file there is an other first line (Printername, printservername and printerqueuename changes, but that is ok because i tried on several Printers.<br />
<br />
what i dont know is what are the other informations ?<br />
@ -p &quot;\\SRV-04\EDV&quot; -c  2 -f      1 -t      3 -l  66 -m   0 -L ISO-8859-1 -a      1 -r rttaad240001000 -w 200 -d P  -B &quot;EDV&quot;@<br />
<br />
when i compare the file with no ending which was generated when Job don't work and the file with no ending that was printed out, they have the same data inside. But the Job that doesn't work generates this extra .bpf file.<br />
<br />
What i also see is, for evey print Job that doesn't work, there is a bwprint.exe process on the Baan Server. These processes do not go away automatically, i have to terminate them manually.<br />
<br />
Our infrastructure:<br />
<br />
Baan IV c4 on Windows 2003 Server<br />
old print Server with Windows 2003<br />
new print Server with Windows 2012 (with installed x32 and x64 Drivers for existing and new printers)<br />
<br />
Windows 7 x64 and x32 Clients<br />
Windows XP x32 Clients<br />
<br />
Baan Client Software BECS b40c.104<br />
Infor Worktop 2.5.12<br />
<br />
some very old HP Laserjet 4000 / 4050  (they work in Baan)<br />
Nashuatec MP201SPF, Nashuatec MPC305 SPF, Nashuatec SP5200DN (only print in Baan over &quot;WIN&quot; (local printer on client Computer)<br />
<br />
i would be very thankfull if someone can help me with this Problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muckimaxe</div><div class="date">18th September 2013, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">meanwhile i found this Explanation of the first line of a -bpf file<br />
First Line meaning of .bpf file <br />
<br />
<br />
Baan provides the client based utility called BWPRINT.EXE for printing and which makes use of file having extension as .bpf.<br />
When the files viewed using this and saved (as .bpf) and then opened as a normal text file. We see first line of the text similar to this:<br />
<br />
<br />
@ -p &quot;&quot; -c 1 -f      1 -t 999999 -l  48 -m   0 -L ISO-8859-1 -a      1 -r reportname -w 120 -d P -a 1 -B &quot;WIN&quot;@<br />
<br />
<br />
What this line represents?<br />
<br />
<br />
-p is for printing device<br />
-c is for font name as per registry<br />
-f &amp; -t means from - to page<br />
-l is for lines per page<br />
-m is for left margin<br />
-L is for character set<br />
-r is for report name<br />
-w is for paper width<br />
-d is fopr Orientation (Landscape  L or Portrait P)<br />
-a is for number of copies<br />
-B is for baan device name<br />
<br />
<br />
Using this we can make our own bwprint file having the features we need. Like no. of lines per page, paper orientation, left margin, top margin....etc<br />
<br />

KB 953637 Baan on an 32Bit Server can not Print over Printers which are attached on a x64 bit Windows Server. Trying to print will crash a process called splwow64.exe<br />
<br />
there are Workaround with portingset but our Consultant says &quot;this is an evil Topic&quot;</div></div><hr />
