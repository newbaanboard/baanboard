I have seen however some people install these on Linux without any problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I too hear about some people install on linux or any other flavour on unix without any problem.  So, i tried to install with 'wine' software. Installation was successfull but while opening to configure user name and other details, the application is hanging. <br />
I think someone can help me.<br />

<br />
Guess that if you don't want to store a password in it that you should be able to 'create' bwc files manually, it's all ascii data.<br />
<br />
My experience is that you need a pretty up to date wine version.<br />
<br />
On the other hand why bother at all? If you use webtop than even your unix/linux users can use ERPLN via the browser. That works for sure and is also supported!<br />
