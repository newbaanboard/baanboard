<br />
We notice that in some specific standard Baan reports header lines on the first page are missing. The second page does contain the lines.<br />
<br />
If you print with bwprint, use the preview option the lines are shown. The first print out of the preview has this problem, the second print is ok.<br />
<br />
We have this problem since we migrated our clients to XP. <br />
<br />
According to Baan this problem is due to the HP printer driver. PCL5 or PCL6 drivers have both this problem.  They have reported a problem to HP already. <br />
<br />
Only our 6MP printer is working fine.<br />
Using the standard MS driver doesn't have this problem (but others in office applications). Our Xerox printer is working fine as well.<br />
<br />
Does any one of you did have this problem as well and solved this already?<br />
<br />
We like to make use of the standard HP drivers for all our applications/users.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Han</div></div><hr />

I think you would be surprised to see, how few clienmts went to XP (and are using bwprint)!<br />
<br />
None of mine did, sorry!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We also noticed, some specific standard as well as customized reports cuts from 75 to 80 right side column. I studied this and conclude this is happening only, If the printer is selected to HP LasertJet 5100 PCL6 and the client BWPRINT file version is latest i.e. 6.1c.06.06, please note if we replace client or BWPRINT file to file version 6.1c.03.01 (comes with BaaN CDs) then it works fine.<br />
