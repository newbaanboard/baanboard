<br />
I have to upgrade our Baan IVc4 system:<br />
<br />
1) MS SQL 7 database to MS SQL 2000<br />
2) Windows 2000 Server to Windows 2003 server<br />
<br />
Has anybody with any experience of either upgrade got any advice, tips or warnings which may be helpful?  I am guessing that they should be straightforward, but somehow these things are rarely as simple as they should be ......<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">8th December 2005, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently upgraded from a NT4/SQL7 box to W2K Advanced/SQL 2000 Enterprise.  It was relatively painless.  Here's the basic process I used:<br />
<br />
Stop SQL<br />
<br />
Do a backup<br />
<br />
Start SQL<br />
<br />
Execute sp_helpfile for the baan database (baandb in my case).  This will tell you the physical locations of the file<br />
<br />
Detach the baan database with sp_detach_db<br />
<br />
Do a backup<br />
<br />
Install new OS (this was on a new machine for me, so was already completed).<br />
<br />
Install SQL<br />
<br />
Install Baan<br />
<br />
Install current portingset<br />
<br />
Restore Baan ($BSE) directory from old server over newly installed $BSE<br />
<br />
Restore detached db files from old server to the location you want them at on the new server<br />
<br />
Attach the Baan database with sp_attach_db<br />
<br />
In theory, you should have a good system at this point.  Of course, in these types of processes, small things always pop up that you have to deal with.  If at ALL possible, I strongly suggest that you do several test runs of this process prior to going live.<br />
<br />
Last step is revalidation.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

This is slightly different.  It is an in-place upgrade on existing hardware, but thank you anyway.</div></div><hr />
