You may see a couple that relate.  Probably check for aad4226.log ...other ones of interest are aad4225.log and bdbpost.log, maybe others.   When you get errors during this process you should check the log directory right away and view any logs that were updated at the time of your process.<br />
<br />
Also, if you dumped data and did not get it into the target company, you may see a S.tttxt030808 or R.tttxt030808 or something similar in the dump directory that was specified during the process, or maybe the user's home directory if none was specified.  This would contain the data that did not make it.  There are recovery methods to get this data back from the R. or S. files as well...</div></div><hr />
