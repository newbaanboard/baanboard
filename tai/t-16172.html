<br />
We are currently trying to assess the usage of our customised sessions. <br />
i.e. are the customisations we have peformed being used ?<br />
<br />
In order to acheive this I am considering running bshcmd6.1 <br />
every, say, 10 seconds over a period of several weeks, formatting<br />
and collecting the output. Then comparing that output against our ( huge )<br />
list of customised objects, to find out with objects are not accessed.<br />
<br />
Has any one else done an exercise like this ? Any tips ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

sessions used and compare them with your list of custom sessions.<br />

<br />
The only reservation I have about turning on the User History ... is that I thought it had a performance impact. <br />
<br />
We have apprx. 700-1000 users on the environment at any one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">3rd August 2004, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">BWU Performance subcommittee swears to me that it doesn't, i guess<br />
baan must have fixed it in a 6.1c.06 series porting set.<br />
<br />
One way around this would be parse, and truncate the logfile every hour or so...<br />
<br />
Also, if it did hurt, it would affect startup of the bshell, if you're doing<br />
a bshcmd on 700+ bshells every 30 seconds or so, then that's going to come with its own performance hit, and give you spotty data as well...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest like Dave, that you use the history. We turn the history on at all our clients by default and partially we are talking here about installations with up to 700 users.<br />
<br />
The history entry is only written, if a user ends a specific session. So this is not so bad.<br />
<br />
If you would go for bshcmd, then you would have to send one command to each bshell every other second. This would create much more load.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">torwin</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the comments.. as a follow up to this.. is there a quicker way of <br />
enabling &quot;user history&quot; for all users rather than going into each individual <br />
user and putting a tick in the box.<br />
<br />
I know that each users $BSE/lib/u&lt;username&gt; file contains a history parameter <br />
which is either set to 0 ( off ) or 1 ( on ), is there a quick way of setting <br />
all users history on either through UNIX or oracle ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">off the top of my head... something like<br />
<br />
cd $BSE/lib/user<br />
for a in `ls -1 u*`; do<br />
   grep -v history $a &gt; $a.1<br />
   echo &quot;history:1&quot; &gt;&gt; $a.1<br />
   mv $a.1 $a<br />
done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">torwin</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Dave, but ... altering the ufile doesn't turn on the user history and I don't want to run create runtime on all users because there could be major ( unknown ) problems. As well as the history variable in the ufiles there is a history field in table ttaad200000. I am just taking a look now to see if the history can be enabled by setting both these values ( ufile and ttaad200000 field value ). If anyone knows anymore about this I would be glad to hear about it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 19:39</div></div><div class="posttext">You can just enable on the user data template. If you change the &quot;u&quot; files they can be overwritten whenever the users make change to their user data and do runtimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Dave, but ... altering the ufile doesn't turn on the user history <br />
<br />
<br />
Sure it does.. ttaad200 is just used to build the ufile, nothing else uses it. the ufile determines everything.<br />
<br />
NPRao!<br />
Looks like you missed the glory of user management in Baan IV!<br />
no templates, etc.. all single user settings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 08:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with dave. The ufile is all there is!!<br />
<br />
To make it complete change the setting of the history bit with General tablke Maint. and use Davs's approach for the ufile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As u said, u want to check the usage of your customized session. U can create on table in BaaN with fields like User, date, time etc. and insert new record as soon as user open your customized session or after processing the session. <br />
<br />
From that table u can create another report and get the necessary information of usage of report.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">3rd September 2004, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I like AVM204's approach.<br />
I have considered creating a baan table to do this as well.<br />
One of the things I like about this is that you can sort \ retreive the data much easier than a log file.<br />
<br />
I have thought about taking this approach one step further than just session usage. <br />
<br />
A)  For our customized reports, I am curious how users are using them, so logging the form selections that users have chosen would be interesting.<br />
<br />
B)  For auditing purposes, in Maintain \ Update sessions, you could easily audit who did what when into a history table.<br />
<br />
I worry sometimes that our users do not know the 'best' way to run particular sessions.  After analyzing the detailed logs of how users utilize a particular session, it would be easy to target specific training by user \ session.<br />

<br />
How can I log Baan GUI users? (like &quot;last&quot;)  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=16271&amp;highlight=bms)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sikima</div><div class="date">7th September 2004, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">You can create quick Baan program to enable or disable history.<br />
<br />
Select table ttaad200000, change flag and insert new record in ttaad400000 (this is trick). <br />
When Baan convert in Runtime DD, it reads all records from there.<br />
<br />
Convert in Runtime DD.<br />

Entire process = 30 min  :o</div></div><hr />
