<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">My company desires to change the length of two fields in tiitm001.<br />
tiitm001.item (domain tcitem), tiitm001.dsca (tcdsca) in our production PVRC (though obviously it would be done in development first).  I need to know the best procedure to accomplish this as well as any ramifications/issues and other information you might feel pertinent.  Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
afaik there was a documentation about changing the domains for cuno and item, as there have been lots of customers that wished this (at least here in germany). Someone here should have this doc, unfortunately I havn't got it.<br />
<br />
I remember having changed cuno accordingly and there where no problems.<br />
<br />
Go through your DD and look for &quot;item&quot;, to see whether there are tables that use an item-field with a different domain. (Especially if you have customized tables/sessions).<br />
If you find such domains, change them too.<br />
Then the reconfigure should work and change all tables concerned.<br />
Probably you will find forms and reports that have to be changed/recompiled as their fields don't match the data's new length.<br />
<br />
But as you have a development system, the whole thing doesn't sound dangerous. It might only turn out to be a some work.<br />
<br />
Good luck and please give us a note whether there where flues.<br />
<br />
regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BBailey</div><div class="date">28th January 2003, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We changed our cuno and suno domain lengths to 7 (from std 6) and had LOTS of trouble at first.  A number of Baan sessions had the field length hard-coded in the script rather than referencing our domain definition.  It took quite a while to get BGS to provide appropriate patches. Now all is fine with the Baan program, but we still do run into problems when adding 3rd party apps to Baan (which also may presume std domain lengths). Knowing what I know now, I would have never changed the domain lengths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BBailey</div><div class="date">28th January 2003, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">...one more thing to mention as well. <br />
Because we increased the field lengths, we had to modify MANY reports and forms that included those fields in order for the info  not to be truncated when printed/displayed.<br />
...lots of work and maintanence!</div></div><hr />
