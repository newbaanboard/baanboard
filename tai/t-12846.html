Connecting with the PROD machine is very fast ( 1-2 secs ), but when we try to connect with the TEST machine we experience a delay of 1-1.5 minutes. <br />
This delay applies both with bw and ba interfaces and regards only the first connection with bshell; when the connection is active, calling a session is fast and also the unix connection is fast in both machines.<br />
Note that I experience the same delay type when call the licmon6.1 binary from the TEST machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the speed of a ping from TEST to PROD and vice versa?<br />
<br />
And what is the speed when transferring files between the two?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanlover</div><div class="date">5th September 2003, 07:32</div></div><div class="posttext">From where it is reading DataDictionary in test server ? is it  from Shared memory or Disk ?<br />
<br />
write this command in Command option of BW config <br />
 -- -dbgsrdduse -logfile trace -keeplog  &lt;session code&gt;<br />
<br />
the above command will create a file called trace in $BSE\tmp folder. Open that file u will get the info about the place of DD.<br />
<br />
If it is reading the DD from Disk the spead and the first connection will be slow. Load the DD into shared memory to make the speak faster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">5th September 2003, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">The speed of pinging is almost the same from PROD to TEST and vice versa. There is no appreciable difference using FTP.<br />
Isn't a problem of DD. The same delay happens when I connect to licmon6.1 from the TEST machine - and this doesn't open the RTDD.<br />
I suppose that is something that has to do with the licence deamon.<br />
The main problem is that I cannot use the OLE from VB because the connection timeout and I cannot use worktop too for the same reason.</div></div><hr />

from TEST and see if any faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">We had problems similar to what youre seeing and it was licence related.  If you try running licmon6.1 (assuming youre using a network licence) on the server that has teh slow responce to connect to the bshell you may also notice a slow response in getting licmon6.1 to respond.  If it is you may need to get the latest licd binary from Baan. Also check your OS's message queue to see if it is maxing out. Somtimes your would have already connected to the bshell but the user interface does not come up.</div></div><hr />
