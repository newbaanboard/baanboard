<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanpuff</div><div class="date">7th October 2002, 08:07</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a line printer(Printronix P5000) and configure it to Baan as windows printer previously it was setup as direct printer, but we have a problem. <br />
1. Every time there is a paper jam I need to clean up the device queue in unix {lpc clean}, so its time and effort consuming so what I did is I install scripting tool to the user that can clean up the queue in unix. (User: root)<br />
<br />
2. Another problem... we need to disable the scripting tool for security purposes bcos the logon is root.<br />
<br />
3. So to solve the problem in security we planned to changed the configuration from direct printing to windows printing.<br />
<br />
I configure it but I got another problem I CAN'T GET A READABLE OUTPUT in reports using the standard fonts (small and 17 cpi).<br />
<br />
Please Help!!!! :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
For W95 and W98 we are using the Printronix LP+ Driver, version 1.00P and all is working well.<br />
<br />
You can download it from www.printronix.com.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brugmanrad</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using bw version 62, and bwprint version 0602.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to make a readable testprint from windows?<br />
<br />
Can you try to change fonts by using the preview?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanpuff</div><div class="date">16th October 2002, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I updated my bw version from 063 to 066 and still got the same output.  <br />
Characters printed in baan is different from characters printed in Microsoft Word.  I changed the font through bwprint still.... the font is not enhanced.<br />
<br />
I do not know what will I do now..... I wana jump in a window.<br />
<br />
If I can't configure the printer in Windows please help me to configure it in unix differently from our existing setup in unix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sorry, but we work on NT, and I do not know how to configure the printer in unix.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">What's exactly the problem? If the paper jams you can hardly blame unix for that or ?<br />
<br />
It should be possible to start the lpclean command via a sticky bit so that the user gets temporarily the authorization to run it without having all the time root permissions.<br />
<br />
On the other hand it should work from Windows as well.<br />
<br />
By sending the output to bwprint with the preview option you can change the used fonts to any of the installed fonts. So if word prints fine bwprint should be able to produce something readable as well.<br />

<br />
Yes I agree that if word prints fine bwprint should be able to produce something readable as well, on other printer it works , like in epson fx1050, lq1120 but not in Printronix P5000 and that my big problem, If I'll stick with my unix setup I don't know the command to access the lpc clean by normal user.<br />

thanks,<br />

<br />
This means that the user gets the rights of the owner during the execution of the program.<br />
<br />
This means that you users must have shell access. I don't allow my users to have that. You could write a little script and link that in to the owners menu to cleanup the queue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 14:02</div></div><div class="posttext">So you need to add /usr/sbin to the PATH variable...<br />
<br />
Best way is to hang a script in the menu of the user. The script should contain as one of the first lines<br />
<br />
PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin<br />
<br />
lpc clean &lt;printername&gt;</div></div><hr />
