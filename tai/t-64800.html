I know that I can choose a windows server printer device in jobs.  Are there other reasons?  What about using brp.open, brp.ready and brp.close commands.<br />

I have been living in UNIX and now we are migrating to a Windows platform.<br />

<br />
From one of the documents:-<br />
<br />
Device type &quot;Windows Server Printer&quot; is specially introduced to be able to print from Webtop. When logging into Baan using Webtop, you do not have locally Bwprint installed. In that case printing is done from the Baan server.<br />
<br />
It comes with special &quot;silent bw print&quot;.<br />
<br />
To know more about devices, try KB 22838233<br />
<br />
About, brp.* commands, they act same like rprt.* functions, where you can specify which will be the default devices, which report will be printed at run time.</div></div><hr />

You just specify the Windows printer in Device quite (like \\&lt;Print-server&gt;\&lt;Printer&gt;.<br />
If this printer is installed on the client, Baan will direct the print job there, if not it gives you the option to install the printer and then print to it.</div></div><hr />

Check the script to start jobs in %BSE%\bin. It uses ntbshell.exe --server to run the job, there is no bw used. <br />
Reason is that you don't have a desktop available if things are started from the taskscheduler. <br />
<br />
I am not sure but before webui downloaded bwprint to the desktop and this was used to print.</div></div><hr />
