<br />
There are several things you should convert to RDD before they can work. There are two sessions for doing this, convert to RDD and create RDD.<br />
<br />
I have some questions about the RDD process.<br />
1 ) When should I use convert to RDD and not create RDD<br />
2 ) When should I use create RDD and not convert to RDD<br />
3 ) Where is registered what should be converted to RDD, what ttadv tables are involved?<br />
4 ) When I want to &quot;fool&quot; the system and force a new RDD to be created, for Tools for instance, how can I do this? Removal of $BSE/tools/*/dd does not work ;) <br />
<br />
Someone to clear this up a bit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">There is an ongoing discussion here: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=7303#post7303 (and you already add a reply to it?) and here: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1642&amp;highlight=runtime<br />
<br />
1 ) When should I use convert to RDD and not create RDD<br />
The need to convert tables are populated by Baan, so you run a convert you have updated something that has been changed in the application data dictionary (APDD) thru usual Baan sessions.<br />
The sessions where changes need to be converted have an option for doing it, so if the people working with them know what they are doing, there would be no need to run a convert :)<br />
<br />
2 ) When should I use create RTDD and not convert to RTDD<br />
When somethings has been changed not thru a Baan APDD change session (eg, from an import or a patch installation that includes domains or table definitions).<br />
<br />
Note: this will be changed for PMC imports, there is a new PMC that now includes convert to runtime information for tables and domains (the old one already did a convert for sessions automatically).<br />
<br />
3 ) Where is registered what should be converted to RDD, what ttadv tables are involved?<br />
ttaad400 for users conversion indicators<br />
ttadv500 for conversion indicators (non tables/domains)<br />
ttadv501 for reconfiguration indicators (domain/tables)<br />
ttadv502 for conversion indicators (domains/tables)<br />
<br />
4 ) When I want to &quot;fool&quot; the system and force a new RDD to be created, for Tools for instance, how can I do this? Removal of $BSE/tools/*/dd does not work ;) <br />
You don't fool him, you just run a create instead of a convert:<br />
A convert will look into the tables mentioned above for need to generate runtime, a create will look at what you want and run, wheter it needs or not to be converted.</div></div><hr />
