<br />
I have an odd problem with just 1 user and session tfacp2421m000 - Print Purchase Invoices. The user runs the session probably about 10 times a day and their computer will lock up at least once a day running this sesson. There is no error message at any stage.<br />
<br />
I have given the user a new PC and also upgraded their part of the network to 1GB but the problem still occurs. <br />
<br />
My system is out of date in respect of SP's etc and I intend to update it during the next few months but I was wondering if anyone has ever experienced anything similar to this or could help me with establishing a root cause.<br />
<br />
Cheers Neal</div></div><hr />

I think there was the same problem in a company in 2008. after creating runtime data dictionary the problem disappears.</div></div><hr />
