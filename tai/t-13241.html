<br />
Users can't login because the maximum number of users reached but when I check using licmon6.1, it shows 35 out of 70 licenses used. I have to restart the license server to solve this.<br />
<br />
I've heard that if you hit the maximum number of license so many time, the license daemon starts behaving strangely. Is it the case here?<br />
<br />
<br />
We are at portingset<br />
Portingset  : 6.1c.06.04<br />
Port no.    : PA.1975<br />

Thanks in advance<br />

Quick Guide QG1819 - Licensing and Validations: Frequently Asked Questions.<br />
<br />
The Baan license can change the max users if your using more then 1 server.<br />
<br />
What is Network Management?<br />
Network Management allows a number of servers networked together to run 100% of the users for 72 hours when one or more servers fail.   For example, suppose you have a network with two servers and 100 users.  You can run all 100 users on the one remaining server for 72 hours, allowing you time to repair the failed server.  After 72 hours, if the failed server is still not running, only 1/2 of the users, or 50, can be accessed from the second server.<br />
<br />
(We say 1/2 in this example because there are only two servers.  The denominator of the fraction will be the number of total servers, and the numerator is the number of servers still running.  So, if you have a four server network, the number of licenses would be divided by 3/4 if one server went down.)<br />
<br />
Network Management is automatically activated for every network request.<br />
<br />
What is High Availability?<br />
HA allows you to run 100% of users indefinitely when one or more servers fail.  This option is restricted.  Please contact Baan Company for details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We don't have Network Management nor High Availability but we do have two names in licencex.x. It may the reason why I have only 1/2 numbers of user after 72 hours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjl7666</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't have a High Availability license, then two names in the licencex.x could definitely be causing the problem.  We had a similar problem and I think we had to relicense but it was a while ago and I cannot remember for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minhle</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 22:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to remove the second server from licencex.x and re-validate.<br />
