<br />
&quot;Error 515 (License error: probably unpatched binary)<br />
<br />
We are running BaaN 4c2 3 tier on Unix servers.  We cloned<br />
the database from our production box for the database server<br />
and copied over the entire /baan directory for the apps server.<br />
The license file and brand files were never changed from the previous 'branding'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">26th March 2002, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to re-patch/re-license the newly copied objects, your current .brand file does not agree with the information that come from the other server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">26th March 2002, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a little confused as we have done this before (cloning the<br />
database and apps info), on our test boxes and never had to re-license?  If we were to copy the .brand file from the production server (where this was cloned from), to this server, would that maybe resolve the problem as the database and .brand file would now be in agreement?  (no permenant solution, but just one to get on to BaaN to do the re-licensing).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response and help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets try to clarify things:<br />
1. you have machine A running Baan licensed<br />
2. you have machine B running Baan licensed [?]<br />
3. each machine has its own license daemon [?]<br />
4. you want to make a copy of A into B (full clone)<br />
<br />
IF 2 and 3 are correct, then your license information is no longer valid (license in the objects/DB no longer matches the B:/.brand file). You must re-license B again (no need to ask for new keys, just re-license with previous ones and path objects)<br />
<br />
IF 2 is right but 3 is not (you are sharing the license daemon, 2 sets of vaildation keys), then you need to check how you had them working before (2 sets of keys, same keys but only one server for the license, ...)</div></div><hr />
