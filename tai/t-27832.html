<br />
I am new to Baan Admin, I need help with the setting up VRC's in Dev/Test(same) Environment Vs. Production Environment. We currently have the following VRC Structure in Dev/Test and Production:<br />
<br />
B40U_c4_dtst -&gt; B40U_c4_prd -&gt; B40U_c4_stnd -&gt; B40_c4<br />
<br />
Whenever we require modification, I copy the latest component from prd or stnd to dtst and do the changes in dtst (In Dev/Test) and promote to prd in both Production and Dev/Test.<br />
<br />
Since the VRC structure is same in Dev/Test and Production, whenever a data refresh is done all changes in dtst is lost. <br />
<br />
I need help in setting up the VRC's correct so that software components are not lost during refresh. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

How are your package combinations set? A data refresh is company related an has nothing to do with software development.<br />
<br />
A simple set up for development / production could be:<br />
<br />
B40_c4                                              <br />
B40U_c4_stnd<br />
B40O_c4_prod  ( PC OPER_001 )     <br />
B40O_c4_test  ( PC TEST_001 )<br />
<br />
In this case your production environment runs on package combination OPER_001 and is derived from package VRC B40U_c4_stnd.  <br />
<br />
Your test environment runs op package combination TEST_001 and is derived from B40O_c4_prod. All the customistions you made are before are released to production therefore are available in the test environment.  <br />
<br />
As you can only connect 1 package combination to a companynumber you should create a copy of the data from live to a testcompany. This gives you the possibillity to test and debug without disturbing the users. If your customisation is testen ok you can transfer it from B40O_c4_test to B40O_c4_prod.<br />
<br />
The data in the different companies ( no tools tables ) can be refreshed periodically without interfering the developed customisations in test of production. <br />
<br />
If something is not clear pls let me know<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. We do a full database restore (including tools table, Company 000 data) information from live to test, which is causing the customizations to be removed in test. I need to know how we can restore all customizations or is there any alternative to copy data from live to test without interfeing with customizations.<br />
<br />
There are other postings mentioning to take a sequential dump of company 000 - how to do this and why is it required.<br />

<br />
I assume in that case your test environment is on a different server or you have to seperate Baan environments ( $BSE ) on the same server.  If the production and test environment are on the same $BSE there's no need to do a full restore of company 000!<br />
<br />
Company 000 contains all the tools stuff including developed sessions, reports, user settings etc. <br />
<br />
To most easiest way in your case is to create a sequential dump of the production company using the database utilities in Baan ( tools ).  Just select the production company and no company 000. <br />
Afterwards import the sequential dump into the test environment. Using this method this will not effect the tools environment and it will leave your development as it was.  The database utilities in the Baan tools - database menu do use the bdbpre and bdbpost commands in background.  Be sure to correct the companynumber afterwards if your testcompany is on a different company number then your production company.<br />
<br />
If you have questions just let me know!<br />

Good Luck,<br />
