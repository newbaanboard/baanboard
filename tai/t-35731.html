I am asking very basic question. What is the difference between Application developement &amp; Application Customization ? <br />
<br />

<br />
The difference is, like the titles state:<br />
- development menu is for devlopment, which includes customisations AND new development. This is only operative for customers who have a development license. In this menu the sub-menu's Program Script/Libraries, Functions, Compact Development menu (and PMC) are available.<br />
- Customizations menu is for the technical Baan administrators who do not develop and/or who do not have a development license... Therefor the abovementioned sub-menu's are not available here...<br />
