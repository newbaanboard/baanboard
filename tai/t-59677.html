<br />
I am trying to create a new company from sequential dump. Everything works fine except for table tccom100. Import terminated with error:<br />
Exception C0000005 (Access violation)<br />
Minidump saved at C:/Infor/ERPKN/bse/tmp/dbserver_dll.13420.dmp Can't generate stacktrace: unable to initialize symbol table<br />
I tried many things (copied file to other location, changed some data, run bdbpost from session or with command, ...) but always got the same error. Only one trial was without error, when I deleted all data from file except header!?<br />
<br />
Does somebody have any idea what could be wrong here? Thanks in advance.<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

Make sure you send along at least the minidump and the Porting Set version info (e.g, the output of bdbpost6.2 -U).</div></div><hr />

<br />
ERP LN in some cases gives unreadable messages (like yours) instead of &quot;skip corrupted record&quot;, moreover it stops import.<br />
so I suggest you to copmare DD of tccom100 and your dump (start with counting fields in DD and separators in the file or ask developers about changes they made recently)</div></div><hr />

Some records must be corrupted, because when all deleted all records from file except first five lines I was able to insert that records. So, I have to find corrupt frecord(s).</div></div><hr />
