<br />
I guess SESSION_TIMEOUT doesn't work for bsp (for super users !).<br />
Pls. correct me if I am wrong...!<br />
<br />
I tried and it doesn't work for me.. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried setting it in the /defaults/all file, in the user profile, in the user BW configuration....doesn't work..!<br />
<br />
Are there any other configuration to be considered...<br />
<br />
Thanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">14th January 2003, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure your porting set is not too old (I the minimum for 4c4 but not ERP).  Also, I think your Tools package need to be up to date as well (patches).  I am of course assuming that sesssion_timeout works with ERP to begin with:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ericthomas</div><div class="date">14th January 2003, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">all file must contain session_timeout:60 or the time you want plus<br />
portingset 6.1c.06.02 or above. it works with our system.<br />
<br />
no tools update required. but if you have ttstppollmess object for messaging then it would not work. it refreshes the connection with client and reset the timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pushpinder</div><div class="date">27th September 2003, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi baanjour,<br />
<br />
Could you please confirm that it has worked for you. Because I am also having the same problem. My 4c4 is on sun solaris 5.8 and it is not working. the porting I am having is little old i.e. 6.1c.06 and the size of my object &quot;ostpvtemul&quot; is 13382.<br />
<br />
Can you or someone else, advise, what is required to make session_timeout work on sun solaris? I have tried defaults/all, user file and environment variable, but it do not work.</div></div><hr />

Try this:<br />
<br />
Login as bsp... (or any other user that does not have the ability to have his bshell closed...). Start Baan and open a ttstpshell.<br />
Then check what processes do get processor ticks (and thus remain active, disallowing the session_timeout to timeout because there is session activity.)<br />
<br />
Then check the bms_mask file (session ttadv4188m000) to see what files are started when bshell starts (bootflag on).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks , I checked the running processes, but could not identify any, which can send message from bshell to keep it running. I have posted a case to BGS and have been advised to upgrade the porting set to 6.1c.06.01 onwards...<br />
<br />
Thanks once again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, that is the point. It is implemented in 6.1c.06.01, but after some solutions finally the last major fix on this point has been released in 6.1c.06.03. My advice would be: take the latest.</div></div><hr />
