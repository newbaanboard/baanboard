<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">16th March 2004, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All;<br />
<br />
Running Triton 3.1 (port 6.1b.05.01) on a HPUX 11.0 box; <br />
<br />
I have logged a case with Baan support on the issue and while they have provided me all the &quot;latest&quot; objects, I am still having problems with the job daemon hanging from time to time.  Their last resort answer is &quot;upgrade the porting set&quot;.<br />
<br />
Typically, I'll get a couple weeks out of the job daemon before it'll hang again.  When it does hang, stoping/restarting doesn't always work, and it's likely to die again within a week of restarting it (if it does restart properly).  <br />
<br />
For example, it died last Friday, I rebooted the server on the weekend, and it died again last night.<br />
<br />
At baan's insistance, I have replaced the rc.startjobdm &amp; rc.stopjobdm scripts.  rc.stopjobdm never works.  I've asked baan to investigate but they haven't been helpfull - &quot;upgrade the porting set&quot;<br />
<br />
I have also replaced the objects with the latest (according to baan):<br />
<br />
ostpsplopen<br />
ostpsplclose<br />
ostprepdll<br />
ottstpconv<br />
ottaad5203 <br />
ottaad5206 <br />
<br />
I may have loaded others, but off the top of my head I can't remember what.  I believe these are the core objects required.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas other then &quot;upgrade the porting set&quot;, I would greatly appreciate it.  When the job daemon dies, it mucks the entire day up since the night jobs (ie DRP/MRP/PRP) take 4 times longer when users are in the system.<br />
<br />
*************************<br />
<br />
I am also curious about running sessions from the command line (ie: ba6.1 trdrp0212m000).   <br />
<br />
I wonder if I could invoke sessions like DRP/MRP/PRP from crontab - except I can't find any documentation on how to pass the arguments required to complete the form fields.  <br />
<br />
I searched the forum yesterday and found there was lots of information on ba6.1 but no examples of passing the form fields.<br />
<br />
If anyone could help me with this - I may investigate replacing jobs in the job daemon with sessions manually invoked from the crontab since it's more reliable.  (and apparently multithreads better)  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your help &amp; ideas; anything suggestions is greatly appreciated.  If there is information I have neglected to include, please let me know and I'll post it asap.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

Is your job daemon hanging/stopping or the session you schedule?<br />
<br />
if it is the session is the session running normal  out from the  job?<br />
<br />
Deleting application locks of the job daemon can cause to stop the daemons.<br />

Thanks, I neglected to mention:<br />
<br />
Yes, the sessions run fine outside of the scheduled job.  <br />
<br />
It's definately the job daemon hanging - it hangs on various jobs and not always the same job.  <br />
<br />
Typically the jobs that hang contain sessions that take longer (30mins to 1 hour) to run.<br />
<br />
We do not delete the jobdm application lock until we run rc.stopjobdm and it fails.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

Defenetely using cron to schedule Baan jobs is way more reliable that the jobdaemon.<br />
- Disable the jobdaemon<br />
- Keep your existing Baan job setup as normally but set the period to a smaller value than the jobdaemon schedule (you can even set it to 1 minute)<br />
- Then setup the rc.startjob (or similar like mentioned in the previous reply) and set them in the cron of the job user.<br />
<br />
The cron will do the same as the jobdaemon, the rest is the same as previoulsy, just have to remember to keep that period small than the old schedule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">16th March 2004, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok:<br />
<br />
I checked my rc.startjob script to find it was the same minus the USER temp variable (so I added it)<br />
<br />
I also picked a quick simple job to test with and changed the period to &quot;1 minute&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I stopped the job daemon and tried invoking the script from the command line.  (to test prior to adding it to the crontab)<br />
<br />
It seemingly did not work.<br />
The $BSE_TMP/rc.startjoberr reads:<br />
<br />
Connecting with bshell...<br />
Connection established.  <br />
<br />
The job did not run according to history (ttaad5511m000). <br />
I have tried invoking it with the job both &quot;In Queue&quot; and &quot;Free&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any ideas of what I might be doing wrong?<br />

The status of the job was 'Free'.   It hadn't executed yet.<br />
As I said, the 'Period' was set to &quot;1 Minute&quot; and 'Periodical' was set to &quot;Yes&quot;.  The job daemon is deactivated.<br />
<br />
I received that message however the job does not seem to run or appear as if it had looking in job history.<br />
<br />
If the job daemon was active, and I called rc.startjob, the job would activate and then go to status &quot;Waiting&quot; when it was complete.  I couldn't get it to run otherwise.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm missing something here; Ideas?<br />
<br />
What about Automatic Repeat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nneilitz</div><div class="date">18th March 2004, 00:54</div></div><div class="posttext">You can run ttaad5203m000 from the main menu (this is what the job does&quot;.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">18th March 2004, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok;  <br />
<br />
I realize calling rc.startjob is the same as running the session ttaad5203m000.  I also knew that that's how the job daemon invoked a job.  My problem isn't with this.<br />
<br />
According to what I've caught off this thread, the steps for running a job from the command line or a cron job are as following:<br />
<br />
1. Deactivate the job daemon completly.<br />
2. Set desired job as &quot;Free&quot; with Periodical = &quot;Yes&quot; and Period = &quot;1 Minute&quot;.<br />
3. Start the job - by calling rc.startjob or running ttaad5203m000.<br />
<br />
When I was piloting this, I found that trying to start the job, it would appear like it should work, but then the job doesn't seem to execute (I can't see it as &quot;Running&quot; when looking at the job), and there's no history of it running in ttaad5511m000.<br />
<br />
Trying to invoke the job by calling &quot;rc.startjob XMLOUT&quot; appears as if it is working, however, looking at $BSE/log/log.startjob, the last entry is:<br />
<br />
+++031804091115 Job: XMLOUT   root<br />
Job XMLOUT does not exist         <br />
+++031804091115 Job: XMLOUT   root<br />
<br />
Now - the problem is, there IS a job in ttaad5100m000 called &quot;XMLOUT&quot;:<br />
<br />
 ttaad5100m000                                  single-occ (1)      Form 1-1    <br />

<br />
so - I guess, since it's obvious I'm missing something, what is it?<br />
<br />
Now that the job daemon is de-activated, if I goto ttaad5203m000 and pull up the specific job, it runs, goes to waiting and runs again on it's own after a minute.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">18th March 2004, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally, some progress;<br />
<br />
This is what I've found.  I set &quot;Automatic Repeat&quot; to no. <br />
ttaad5203m000 then executes the job and returns it to &quot;Free&quot;.<br />
<br />
As *myself* (or our job user jobdm), I was then able to invoke rc.startjob xmlout;  It ran as if I had called ttaad5203m000 from within a bshell.<br />
<br />
When I change to superuser and try to invoke the job (since cron invokes jobs as superuser), the job does not run.<br />
<br />
Checking the log file /triton/bse/log/log.startjob I see:<br />
<br />
+++031804105948 Job: XMLOUT   root<br />
Job XMLOUT does not exist         <br />
+++031804105948 Job: XMLOUT   root<br />
<br />
So I tried changing the USER variable in the rc.startjob script to the jobdm user (same permissions as myself).<br />
<br />
Again, as superuser calling rc.startjob xmlout, job again doesn't run, no message in /triton/bse/log/log.startjob this time, but checking /triton/bse/tmp/rc.startjoberr:<br />
<br />
Connecting with bshell...                                 <br />
Connection established.                                   <br />

Ideas?<br />

Success!<br />
<br />
Since the root user can't invoke the job using rc.startjob for whatever wierd reason, I created a crontab for the jobdm user (which could).<br />
<br />
It seems to be working from the cron scheduler now.<br />
<br />
I have moved over all my jobs and will begin watching to ensure everything transitioned smoothly.   (They've already started running)<br />
<br />
On another note, I created a document explaining my actions so that the others in my team who create jobs will know how to make new jobs now.  If someone is trying to get this working, please contact me and I can pass the document over.<br />
<br />
One more cron related command (probably a stupid one)<br />
<br />
One of my jobs was set to run every 4 hours instead of on the minute/hour/day.  Any ideas of how to set up a revolving cronjob?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding MC/SG clusters I build a /etc/cmcluster/run_if_local.ksh with parameters &lt;package&gt; &lt;script&gt; to run scripts only if the package is running and locally. chmod 755 on it to be usable by all and setup the same entries on all nodes crontabs, thus, when the package switches, all works without manual intervention. Like that you avoid making [most of] your scripts cluster aware.</div></div><hr />
