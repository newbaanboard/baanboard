<br />
Is anybody using the multi-site control functionality that is available in the Exchange module for replication of data between companies? Is it simple to set-up? Our requirement is transfer of data between two companies on the same Baan server. It looks like it provides EDI type of functionality, eg. sending messages etc. Is the module really useful for continuous transfer of data? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

When I made a careful reading of the baan exchange document, it says during a regular export it generates the message. Bloody hell. It would have been so simple had I paid the attention that some of the Baan documents deserve. I am reading the good old exchange document U7137A US.<br />
