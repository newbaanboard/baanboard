<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmdesai</div><div class="date">12th September 2023, 06:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been tasked with upgrading Infor ERP LN 10.3 instance to 10.8. My query is what are the steps to carry out the upgrade activity ? Since I have a lot of customizations, Is it possible to do an in-place upgrade i.e. upgrade Infor ERP LN 10.3 instance to 10.8 on the same physical server with a downtime of not more than 24 hours?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are some pretty big functional and table changes between those versions, especially if you're looking at site functionality.  I would expect that a lot of your customizations will need to be revisited.<br />
<br />
In-place should be possible with the data upgrade engine, although I've not done from 10.3 to 10.8.  I have done FP5 to 10.4 and 10.4 to 10.7 with minimal problems.<br />
<br />
There are too many variables to blanketly say whether it could be done in 24 hours.  I believe we did a &gt; 1TB environment in less than 36 hours.<br />
<br />
For transparency, I am a consultant, but feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss us helping you with this process.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
