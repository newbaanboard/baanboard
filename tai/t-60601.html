<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">2nd June 2011, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I would check for license 10365 in the SLM snap in; make sure it is active. <br />
Also, make sure you have the latest SLM (7.1.0.4) if you are using WebUI 8.7 regardless of what build of 8.7 you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">3rd June 2011, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Product 10365 is active.<br />
You are right, I need SLM version 7.1.0.4, my version is 7.1.0.2. I need to upgrade it, but first I have tu upgrade OS and C++ libraries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">3rd June 2011, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone throw some light on upgrading OS &amp; C++ libraries... i am guessing these might be essential for latest slm / porting set to work. Can you point me to the document no. or solution no. where this is listed. We also plan to move to SLM and higher version of porting set on HP Unix 11.11 so just want to avoid these surprises.</div></div><hr />

There is a solution in Infor365 about upgrading porting sets, please review it: 719596<br />
<br />
Basically, you need to look at the porting set technical notes, between your current porting set and your target porting set. You can always find them at the ftp site. For instance, for 7.1d.16 you would go to ftp://ftp.support.baan.com/updates/port/7.1d.16 ; for porting set 8.7a.01 you would go to ftp://ftp.support.baan.com/updates/port/8.7a.01 and download the technical notes pdf. <br />
<br />
For 8.6a.03 patch HP aC++ A03.85 is required. IN HPUX, you would check for that requirement with the following command:<br />
<br />
swlist -l product 'PH??_*' | grep aC++*<br />
<br />
In a test system I have the output was...<br />
<br />
 PHSS_38140                    1.0            aC++ Runtime (IA: A.06.20, PA: A.03.85)<br />
<br />
So I should be able to install that porting set.<br />
<br />
If you are in doubt check with Infor support.<br />
<br />

But in SLM installation guide I did not find information about required OS level or C++ libraries version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">6th June 2011, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Nestor for the quick info. Looks like we too are running latest OS Patches, executing the swlist command gave me following output<br />
<br />
<br />
 PHSS_33946  1.0   HP aC++ -AA runtime libraries (aCC A.03.85)<br />
<br />
<br />
We are currently on Portingset  : 7.1d.11 and intend to go to 8.7a.01. Do you think that i need to read each &amp; every technical notes for porting set in between these 2. <br />
<br />
I hope not, and i can just read the target porting set tech notes to migrate to latest.</div></div><hr />
