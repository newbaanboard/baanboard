What kind of access is good enough for a 'Job' user.  The general tendency is to make them Super User and let them have a wide access. Do we have among us who don't do it this way and create them as 'Normal users' with required priviliges by means of appropriate roles and maintain them as constrained users? Please note that the jobs these job users run are externally scheduled. <br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Its always better to have full scope of access as there is no manual intervention so you don't have to worry about any security loop holes. Also, it prevents you from additional testing of each job to be scheduled.</div></div><hr />

Again.... it is exactly Security loophole I like to cover by not making a Job User as 'Super User'. So, is it technically possible for creating a Job User normal user in Baan (Ok if the user has elevated privileges in OS level) and schedule jobs externally using them?</div></div><hr />

Yes, you can create a Normal User and make it as Job User with appropriate authorizations required to run the job. And off course, you need to take care of the OS level security setup.</div></div><hr />
