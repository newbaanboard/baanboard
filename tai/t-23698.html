<br />
One of my client was sent all kind of service pack CDs over and above the ones they have installed. To prevent ourselves from sitting and waiting for download in case we find a new bug, we've scanned every single one of those CDs so that, theoretically, we have all the needed solutions stand by for installation when need be<br />
Now we do find a bug that we'd like to correct and would like to install just one solution (along with all its dependencies) out of so many that came with those service packs. And as you know, by default, you can't do that; you have to install the whole service pack. But no one should want to do that in production server, as those &quot;solutions&quot; sometimes actually just introduce another bug somewhere else<br />
I noticed that the difference between individually downloaded solutions and ones loaded from a service pack is just one field in the PMC solutions table. But I can't imagine having to make this field blank for the solution we want to install and all its dependencies. It can be done, but simply too tedious. Anyone ever solved this kind of problem? Could you share what you did, please? Thanks very much<br />

i had the same problem some times ago. I solved it the following way:<br />
In tables ttpmc100 and ttpmc201 i cleared the patch field (ttpmc100.gsol and ttpmc201.gsol) from the solutions which should be installed (and sure for dependencys).<br />
Because this happend before introduction of B-Language Support in pmc there might be some more tables to fix (check this out). <br />
Then i was able to install the solutions individually. After install i inserted patch code again.<br />
<br />
Since that time i didn't scan service packs to have the newest solutions available on my system but only scan the weekly dumps. So i am able to install only selected solutions. A SP scan is only done on a general update of the system.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
For example in several service packs it was necessary to install beforehand some tools patches, because either the printing or the pmc itself was modified. If you scanned the service pack or the following first, then these single patches were also part of the service pack and could only by installed first with some tricks and hurdles.<br />
<br />
So: Simply don't do it. If you want to install a service pack, then read first the installation docs for it and follow them closely. If you just want to bring individual patches into the system, then stick to the weeklies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">13th April 2005, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">PMC only refuses to install an individual solution if the patch (Service Pack) to which it belongs is also present in the same Update VRC. So, if you scanned a patch in an Update VRC, you cannot install an individual solution of this patch. The following steps with the standard PMC sessions can help:<br />
<br />
1. Disconnect the patch from the Update VRC. This will disconnect the patch and all not installed individual solutions.<br />
2. Connect the individual solution, you want to install.<br />
3. Check the individual solution to install and install it.<br />
<br />
Note 1: Because of the dependencies of the individual solution, you may need to connect more than one solution. You can use the Multi-level Download Tool to connect the solution, including all dependencies. Because the solutions are already scanned, the MLD Tool will only connect them.<br />
<br />
Note 2: Be sure that your PMC software is not too far behind.</div></div><hr />
