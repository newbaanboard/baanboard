Anyways... we are using LN61 on a solaris server in the US east coast. We just put up our Shanghai office.  The WAN traffic is high on the tcp connection resulting in slow response time. <br />
Most users are using worktop installed locally.<br />
Do the graphics get sent along with the data on the connection?<br />
I saw some older posts on packet shapers.  Anyone have some updated experience with WAN management?   Any way to improve this? (already looking at upgrading wan)<br />
Anyone working in a global environment with LN ?<br />
Any other insights would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had the network architects looking at it and basically we are maxing out the bandwidth.  <br />
<br />
I'll check out the solutions on the support site.  I searched the documentation area for information on how the GUI worked but not in the solutions. I know when we went up ages ago and the gui was x-windows, we did not use it because of bandwidth issues. <br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

Try using the webtop?<br />

Sorry if the worktop and webtop are the same, but I haven't worked with LN61 yet!</div></div><hr />

You could probably look at the application accelerators provided by Riverbed or NetScaler for a solution.</div></div><hr />
