<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">14th September 2007, 11:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We use the systemmess functionality (as described in many threads on BB) to display a message to the users on login. The systemmess file gets regenerated each night with a summary of the previous day's business performance.<br />
<br />
However, we now have a situation when the information displayed is totally inappropriate for certain users. Ideally we would like to display a different message but I don't believe that would be possible so instead I'd simply like to surppress the message for specified users.<br />
<br />
Any clues?<br />

Hi,<br />
You can search on Baanboard for utility &quot;bshcmd&quot; which is used to send messages to individuals / groups...</div></div><hr />

<br />
We sometimes use bshcmd for sending broadcast messages, but systemmess is what we are using to display the login message.<br />
<br />
Would there be a way to use bshcmd to send a user a message as they logged in? But only if they were in a specific group?<br />
<br />
For info our user community use a combination of Worktop and BW.<br />

On *nix this wouldn't be a big issue using a bshell wrapper.<br />
I haven't tried it myself but perhaps it's possible by using a custom program and load this with bms_mask automaticly as the user starts baan?<br />
<br />
Someone ever tried to do this?<br />
<br />

Havent tried this, as we are on Unix. But, using batch programming could this be possible? One can put a batch program in place of &quot;bshell6.1&quot; executable in file $BSE\lib\ipc_info in front of &quot;bshell&quot; entry. Inside the batch program, &quot;bshell&quot; can be called and even &quot;bshcmd&quot; can be called.</div></div><hr />
