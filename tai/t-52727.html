<br />
Does anybody have a idea what is going wrong?? :confused:<br />
<br />
Recently we've installed BaaN (SP25) on a new server.<br />
During migration tests, we couldn't start the BaaNJobDaemon<br />
If we check the properties of the JobDaemon within BaaNMan, the<br />
command of jobd.bwc is set to -- ttaad5206m000. <br />
If the service is started, the command spontaneously changed to <br />
-- ottiexdbup e:/baan/tmp/ottiexdbup.0 45 and the service won't<br />
start. We have to restart the server, because the service stays 'starting'<br />
If we changed the command to ttaad5206m000, it changes again when <br />
the service is started. <br />
<br />
I was wondering why the command is set to &quot;-- ottiexdup ......&quot; :-?<br />

<br />
The command should be -- ttaad5206m000 as you have above.<br />
<br />
I have seen durring the startup where the command gets changed durring startup.  In eather case, I always keep a jobd.bak file for the jobd.bwc file.  When the JobDaemon doesn't start, I always just issue the command &quot;kill jobd.exe&quot;, delete jobd.bwc, copy jobd.bak jobd.bwc.<br />
<br />
I then start the jobd service and it always starts OK.<br />

<br />
Now I understand a bit what happend. BaaN clears out the password, when set.<br />
If you check the configuration of jobd, there is no password set. But if you check the file jobd.bwc with a editor, the password is needed otherwise it will not work. Restoring the .bak file including the password will do the trick. :D<br />
