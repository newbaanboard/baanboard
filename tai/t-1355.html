  My customer has Baan IVc4 on HP-UX with BISAM(it's a training environment!)  They have the english version and the latest PMC patches are installed.<br />
<br />
  They want to add the french language.  The problem is that when we do the update, table definitions in package 'tt' are overwritten.  Since there is no &quot;patch&quot; layer for Tools, the french update goes directly in the standard.<br />
<br />
  The problem is that most of the tools patches(tables, forms,...) the have been applied before the update are overwritten!  <br />
<br />
   If I do the upgrade without choosing the 'tt' package I don't have the problem, but the tools forms are still in english.<br />
<br />
   Anyone encountered this problem?  We don't want to go through all the patches and reinstall them(which would not make sense!)<br />
<br />
   I am also testing the possibility to add a patch layer to tools by unlocking the system with ttadv0201m000...  But I would prefer to avoid this.<br />
<br />
   Thanks in advance,<br />

I haven't come across this myself for the simple reason that language selection (should) be done at the concept and installation stage of your Baan environment (before any patch application). I think the only clean way of doing it is to indeed rollback your patches and then to re-apply them after the language installation. I would definatively not mess around with the ttadv0102m000 settings (allow changes to Standard/Tools). They can cause some ill effects on your environment if you are not careful :(</div></div><hr />

They got a messed up tools environment (because they had to install from master tape) and the application directory now has some holes in language dependent components...<br />
<br />
I think rolling back all patches is a hell of a job... maybe setting up a new BSE would be best option and then start from mastertape and add all patches in the new environment until back at the same level as the English version would be preferrable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">makiju</div><div class="date">18th March 2002, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it's enough if you make an external VRC branch and after you have added another language (full update), you uppgrade this new VRC to same level (SP's) than your production VRC. I have done this several times with success. Remember also what changes with porting set updates (backup whole BSE)<br />
<br />
Another possibility goes like this:<br />
<br />
If you have baan mastertape with language you want, you can read it to filesystem.<br />
Then you have a directory which contains many subdirectories like<br />
line.0000, line.0001...depends what you have selected.<br />
Now you can use Import Software to import these packages into std level. This is good if you can live without tools-part for this new language. Of course step one is the only official method...and this one is quick and dirty and not recommend, but this might also work. You can also take a look what is going to be installed! Maybe it's same thing if you don't select tools part when reading tape...I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />
