This is usually caused by Excel !!<br />
More to explain, while entering data in baan, if data is copied from an excel spreadsheet cell to a baan field like description field, it also copies the end of cell charecter from cell and paste into baan field as a new line charecter ! Now, if this field is available for editing, when you browse through the fields of this session (using tab), and reach this perticular field (lets say description), value in the field disapears. And when you press tab and move away from this field, value in the field apears again. When this field is used in a report, the new line charecter adds a new line in the detail layout and causes more lines in the report than expected. Thats why you get this error. Having known this, please check if this is the problem you are facing and try to find the fields and correct them. It can be any field printed on the report and record will be within the selection criteria of the report.<br />
<br />
With Due respect to one of My Senior who identified this problem,<br />
Best Luck, Shree</div></div><hr />

That's the only one to find out (at least I do it that way). However if you are fast enough you can perhaps intercept the tmp file in $BSE_TMP.<br />
