i have a situation that i'm trying to find an explanation about it.<br />
we're using the Baan client (in windows) to connect to Baan (ver: B40c.102).<br />
<br />
for some users, the application will open a second option dialog after opening many windows (see doc).  And i do not know why.  This is a problem for Finance because sometimes, they have a batch open in the first windows set and when Baan close after a while, the batch is blocked.<br />
<br />
I just do not know if it's a client issue, a windows issue or a memory issue.<br />
Asked the question to Infor but got nothing.<br />
<br />
Any idears?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th August 2022, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a new one - I know I can get 2 option dialogs open by logging into baan and then trying something OLE related(and then I have issues).  But I do not know how to do it with just the bwc.  It sounds like they log in normally.  Start running sessions and boom a second Option dialog appears.  Have you run a PS in the option dialogs to see who or what might be controlling it?  Are there anything in any of the log files for the users it questions when it happens?   Can you duplicate it?  Can they just launch sessions and duplicate it on demand?<br />
<br />
Right now I have no clue what it could be - I do know when we had band width issues our users would get disconnected and get stuck with multiple option dialog boxes - but not like this.  We were unlocking PO's, items, etc on a daily basis.</div></div><hr />

i have no clue also.  25 years in Baan and it's the first time a user flag this to me.  <br />
I never saw this with the ascii interface (reflection) so that's why i'm wondering if it's not a ''window'' thing. í ½í¸‚  <br />
Tried to duplicate it but can't do it.  But my system has 16 GB where her's has only 8 GB.  Maybe a memory thing.<br />
<br />
Good advice about the PS, i'll check it out next time the user as the issue (because it's not doing it all the time).<br />
i'll keep baanboard posted if i find anything.</div></div><hr />

That a session is starting a separate bshell for processing in the background? See Parallel Application Processing Overview in the programmers manual...</div></div><hr />
