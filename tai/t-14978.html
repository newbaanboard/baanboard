<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toaaron</div><div class="date">7th April 2004, 09:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently, my company start the implement our new ERP system - Baan 5.0c.<br />
<br />
Before the implementation, 25 licenses is prepared according to the estimation. But we never expect that this will happened!<br />
<br />
At the initial phase of Baan implementation, the demand of license highly increased due to every user perform the data entry and data checking. It is not pratical to buy in more license at the initial phase, because eventually they would become extra.<br />
<br />
So, could anyone provide a suitable solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">7th April 2004, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">you can always drop Licenses, you just let Baan know how many you need and they will send a new license key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 04:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not clear on whether: <br />
1) you already have 25 licences but do not need that many now or<br />
2) you will need 25 licences to start the project but will not need that many when fully implemented.<br />
<br />
If (1) is the case then there is no penalty keeping the 25 licence key and perhaps reducing the annual support cost licence number.  If you upgrade at some time there may be a need to get new licence key then. You can check with baan on this before making the decision.<br />
  <br />
If (2) is the case then there is not much that can be done other than schedule the users and developers to particular times.  Perhaps have multiple shifts and/or work wekends etc.<br />
<br />
In any event you have to pay for what you use.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toaaron</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 07:12</div></div><div class="posttext">My situation is case (2), we don't need that much licenses after Baan fully implemented, because we can see that there are not that much user use Baan at the same time after the system is fully implemented(due to the data entry and data checking tasks are done at that time).<br />
<br />
We still thinking how to resolve the maximum user problem at the initial phase(please don't suggest me to buy more license!).<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">In 2nd case u should plan ur implementation strategy to make maximum use of exchange schemes using legacy data and rule based data upload. Also u can use AFS to do data entry automatically. <br />
<br />
And as Terry suggested u can always plan more hours , more shifts, weekend data entry etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">from the legal point of view, check wether you have concurrent or named licences.<br />
<br />
Baan likes to sell named licences. That means, even if only 20 Users will work in the future at the same time, you need to get a licence for all 50 users, which are configured in the system.<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of customers do not care for the difference, but Baan/SS in Germany is making a big thing out of it in regards to licence audits and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why don't you just ask Baan for a temporary key of 100 users for a test system? They might cooperate, you never know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">10th April 2004, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I would try the route of Markus, check with Baan.<br />
Maybe they can work with you to generate a license for more users that is only valid for one month or so. After that you would need to re-license again with the current keys for the 25 users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil</div><div class="date">12th April 2004, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">In case of concurrent users, You can Use -- -set SESSION_TIMEOUT = 5 in BW command, if users are idle for 5 minutes the baan will get automatically logout and Baan license is available for other users.<br />
<br />
We are managing 90 users with 30 users license by using session timeout.  No problem of Maximum number of users reached</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toaaron</div><div class="date">13th April 2004, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Shorten the time out timing would be a good suggestion, but users might face problem when they are downloading or updating the data.<br />
<br />
Because after the downloding or updating being started, user would not sitting there and wait for the whole process completed, they might leave their PC continue the process but they are performing other tasks without using their PC. Thus, sometime the system will assume that they are inactive user and time out them. Eventually, the data downloading or updating process would terminated illegally.</div></div><hr />
