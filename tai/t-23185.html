<br />
 Apart from the BaaN user licenses, server &amp; database licenses. What are the pros and cons of either centralizing the BaaN server or decentralizing the BaaN server on a global scale and at a regional level. Any one who is doing this now or has any thoughts on this subject. Much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">16th February 2005, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Several of our bigger customers started with a decentralized approach and over the years migrated back towards a centralized setup.<br />
<br />
The decentralized setup was usually the result of rollouts towards branches and a weak central IT infrastructure at the time.<br />
<br />
The benefits for a central setup:<br />
<br />
a) Often it is difficult and not econimically sensefull to hire and keep qualified Baan/DB admin personell in small branches.<br />
b) All locations can easily benefit from the experience gained in other locations.<br />
c) All financial resources can be used to build a high available and secure HW environment in one location.<br />
d) SW and also data consolidation can be done more easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
But there are disadvantages:<br />
<br />
a) If your locations are spread in several timezone, then you might need to have 24*7 people working in the central location or at least have something like a hotline/standby.<br />
b) Again in regards to timezone, BaanIV stores local (server) time as timestamps for example in history tables. But this can be solved by manipulating the TZ environment variable at least in Uinx.<br />
c) Your requirements in regards to HW and SW availibility increase.<br />
d) Your admin and downtime window is reduced.<br />
<br />
Still as I said most bigger customers migrated towards a centralized setup. These customers tend to have a high available cluster of Unix based servers anyway, so they can handle the disadvantages.<br />

Since 1992 I am working in other company, they are running 6 divisions on Centralized Baan setup. I did see lot of difference in centralized vs. not centralized. Good benefit and easy to maintain centralized Baan. (Resource accept/ technical accept/ functional accept). This is just my opinion.<br />

So admin people has to work proficiently, otherwise centralised setup is good in my opinioin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">19th February 2005, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to extend Suhas statement:<br />
<br />
Yes, dependency is an issue. I allready mentioned the time window for admin activities in an earlier posting.<br />
<br />
But even, if you go for a centralized setup, this does not mean, you have to put all Baan companies in one BSE or even on one single server. You might just mive your physical servers to one location. This way you gain the benefit of optimal human resource sharing by maximising single downtime windows.<br />
