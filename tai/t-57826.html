<br />
Need to get rid of creation of the hash field and indexing of the field by BaaN.<br />
As I understand that these can be achieved by converting the data from level 1 to level 2.<br />
<br />
Do we need to carry out the data level conversion at DB level?<br />
Can anyone pls tell us the procedure of converting the level 1 data to level 2?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you do the conversion at Baan level.<br />
<br />
The steps are:<br />
- make sure that your portingset supports L2 (has to be 6.1c.07.04 or newer)<br />
- make sure that you have a license that includes MS SQL L2<br />
- bdbpre all data (Create seq. Dump of Table)<br />
- change db_resource: mssql_level1:0<br />
- bdbpost all data (Create Table from seq. dump).<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<br />
One alternative though, if you find that you can't export/import in a reasonable amount of time - is to use Infor's Level 2 conversion service. They convert the database inline which is usually significantly faster than if you were to do the export/import method.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skr@ushamartin</div><div class="date">16th February 2010, 09:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Lebowsky / Dave-23,<br />
<br />
Thank you guys for your prompt response.<br />
I immediately tried out the steps provided by Lebowsky and confirmed by Dave.<br />
<br />
Following is what I did:<br />
1. Took sequential Dump.<br />
2. Changed db_resource to: msql_level1:0<br />
3. Changed the tabledef6.1 from msql_level1:1 to mssql_level1:0 using       ttaad4110m000.<br />
4. created tables from sequential dump.<br />
5. Exit baan.<br />
<br />
Then when I tried to login, it is giving error : ERROR 515 (LICENSE ERROR) ON SELECT - CANNOT CONTINUE IN ottstpstdlib (mess).<br />
<br />
Then on manually changing the tabledef6.1 file to the earlier mssql_level1:1, baan starts working. But all the tables are having hash as usual.<br />
<br />
Thus we are back to the earlier state.<br />
Any further suggestion(s)? What can be the cause of the error?<br />
<br />
best wishes, <br />
<br />
SKR</div></div><hr />

<br />
you missed step 2:<br />
<br />
<br />
- make sure that you have a license that includes MS SQL L2<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to get a new licence key with the commercial function &quot;MS SQL L2&quot;.<br />
Check Solution 142802.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day,<br />
