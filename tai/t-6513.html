<br />
We have baan c3 with 6.1c.6.02 porting set and march standard on Oracle 8.1.7.2 and HPUX11.<br />
<br />
1. Can we install just files in include6.1(bic_*) and go with open world installation?<br />
<br />
2. Should we compile all existing objects or not? <br />
<br />
3. If need compiling then should we do a major testing of objects/sessions?<br />
<br />
4.Is there any hidden problems if we stick to the c3 tools set?<br />
<br />
5 Can we just update tools alone to c4 and Is it supported or standard practice?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for all the help.<br />
<br />
Eric.</div></div><hr />

reCompilation should not be necessary, the bshell that processes remains the same.<br />
About tools update to c4 alone, I have seen that on several installations c4 tools was put under c4- and even b installations. Do not ask me how.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. <br />
<br />
1. What bic_* is used for ? Is it just for reports or other objects too? What I mean by compile is later no going back because of incompatibility? Is it the safe side to compile everything.<br />
<br />
2. Is this c4 tools change alone is supported by baan?<br />
Are there any known issues with such change?<br />
<br />
thanks,Eric.</div></div><hr />

1. What bic_* is used for ? Is it just for reports or other objects too?There are bic_files for reports, but also for a lot of other functions. They are more or less comparable with dll's and includes for portingset level bshell functions.</div></div><hr />
