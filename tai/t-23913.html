<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srilal</div><div class="date">29th April 2005, 09:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I was installing series of individual solutions thru PMC. And suddenly system got stuck and users were complained that the Select device  ttstpsplopen is not appearing when trying to print/display. I later discovered that the Select device  ttstpsplopen is appearing 15 minutes later once execute printing/displaying session. <br />
<br />
When getting this problem I was installing solution number 143683 and prior to that I installed 143542, 143508, 143492, 143475, 143311, 143299, 143230, 143165, 143162, 142981, 142936, 142925, 142805, 142581, 142290 respectively.<br />
<br />
Reversed all the installed solutions and restart Baan and DB but problem was still there.  Finally recovered the binaries ($BSE) from the previous day backup. Now the system is working fine.<br />
<br />
Any of you guys came across this sort of problem? And how did you resolve the problem?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
