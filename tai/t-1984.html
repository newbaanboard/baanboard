<br />
I installed a new system and create the tables from a dump that include all of the data in a company. After I ran the reorganize table and tfgld9004m000, I can't find anything in the tiitm0101m000. I can find the item data in the other session.<br />
<br />
Anybody can tell me how to solve it?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />

What were the exact steps you did?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hankfu</div><div class="date">14th May 2002, 05:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I have checked it again. I found some error message in the log file &quot; C:/Baan/dict/ddB40Sc4/dtiitm/dtiitm001 not matching with the dump&quot;.<br />
And some other table also have the same error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">14th May 2002, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">This message means that the data definitions of the table of the dump is different from the data definition of your current package combination, thus Baan skips the import, and no data is imported.<br />
<br />
You only have two options:<br />
<br />
1. create exchange schemes to copy the data (but you need to know what fields you need and possibly how they are linked to other tables)<br />
<br />
2. export your data definitions from the original system into your copy system to make sure that there is no mismatch between the data definitions, create RTDD, then re-do the import for those tables. The best thing is to check only those tables that were not imported and copy their DD. Also check the domains, just in case...<br />
<br />
Copying a company means that the table definitions/domains should be matched between origin and destination package combinations, otherwise some tables will be skipped.<br />
_________________<br />
<br />
Regarding the other errors,<br />
- &quot;Can not read table definition (error 0)&quot; means that the data definitions of that table does not exist at all<br />
- &quot;Can not commit transaction (error 520), creat error 2&quot;, the problem here is the creation error (506 probably) - check where this table is (probably it is in another company?)</div></div><hr />

Thank you ever so much!<br />
