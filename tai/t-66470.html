<br />
I have an issue with devices for Notepad and Excel on the new system where both work perfectly on the old system.<br />
<br />
When printing to either Device, I get a message ttadvq1151 &quot;Create directory d: ?&quot;. Answer No returns &quot;Conversion cancelled&quot;, answer Yes returns &quot;Cannot create d:&quot;.<br />
<br />
In the device settings for Notepad, the Path is &quot;notepad.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
FYI If I change that to specifically be &quot;${BSE_TMP}/notepad.txt&quot; the file is created on the server but Notepad fails to launch.<br />
<br />
I've battled with this for days and I can't work out what's missing!<br />
<br />
Any help will be much appreciated.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th May 2014, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I am wondering why there is anything in the path?  We do not use notepad, but for excel the path is empty.  What version are you upgrading to?  I know on our version of 4c4 we had to make sure on our c drive we had permissions to the installation directory where baan created the temp files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">30th May 2014, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark, thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
We filled the path on the device just so a file name defaults in there, users usually just accept that default. <br />
<br />
I now realise why Notepad doesn't launch when path is set to BSE_TMP : file is created on the server which notepad would have no access to.<br />
<br />
With no path the files should go into local c:\program files\baan\baan iv\tmp, yes it's for some reason trying to put it in D:<br />
<br />
Is there some setting/variable in Baan to say where the LOCAL Baan tmp folder is?<br />
<br />
I also wondered about permissions, but I'm trying it on the same PC, live server works, new server doesn't.<br />
<br />
We're on SP15.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th May 2014, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Bhushan posted some good links.  For some reason I assumed you were upgrading Baan also not just the server.  So okay the old server works and the new server does not - in bhushans post the third link might be the best. Is it only those two devices not working? If so it might be the $HOME that bhushan mentioned.  So for example when I run a report and send it to excel - it first writes in the $BSE/tmp directory the report, then it creates a ASCII copy in my home directory, then it downloads to the desktop into the c:\program files\....\baan\tmp directory.  Then it launches excel with the file on the local desktop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Bhushan/Mark,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice, however still no luck. Sorry Mark I probably wasn't clear about the server/software upgrade - long term plan is to upgrade software, this interim step is to get us onto a newer and thus more resilient hardware platform before taking the upgrade plunge.<br />
<br />
We have no bse_vars file on either server, I tried creating one to set the HOME variable but it made no difference.<br />
<br />
The problem only occurs with Devices that require the file locally with the exception of B2WIN which I assume handles things differently.<br />
<br />
All other Devices behave as required including ASCIF/ASCIT.<br />
<br />
Somewhere there must be a setting that tells Baan where the LOCAL temp directory is i.e. &quot;c:\Program Files\Baan\tmp&quot;. Surely this must be Server side, not client as from the same Client PC the old server works, yet the new doesn't.<br />
<br />
Anything else I can try, or any further info I can provide?<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your efforts so far...<br />
<br />

<br />
Can you verify if any tmp file is getting created when the report is printed on $BSE\tmp folder?<br />
<br />
If the temp file is not created then you need to give Full Access to Everyone. Also try giving Full Permission to $BSE\bin.<br />
<br />
Also, you can check the $BSE_Temp Env. Variable. Use this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7329) for info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Bushan,<br />
<br />
Yes the file gets created in BSE/tmp. It is after the creation of that file I get the message &quot;Create Directory D: ?&quot; (see image attached)<br />
<br />
FYI everyone has full access to BSE/tmp and BSE/bin<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok,<br />
<br />
Now check the permissions on your machine. Basically, what you can do, remove permissions for Everyone from all the Baan related folders from client machines and give it again.<br />
<br />
You can give full access to C:\Program Files\Baan and other such directories. I guess there might be more in C:\Users\User_name\app_data\..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I tried that, but still no change. I wouldn't expect it to be permissions locally though, as all works fine connecting to a different server from the same client.<br />
<br />
We're on XP by the way....<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Are any logs generated? Can you check in ttstperrlog?<br />
<br />
Also, does client2server() function works? May be there is some problem executing notepad.exe on your system. Can you check permissions for C:\Windows\System32 folder and give full access there? <br />
<br />
With Baan you are really not sure sometimes. And with Windows its a different world of problems ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly no logs either server side, or locally. We don't have ttstperrlog at all. Nothing shows in the Event Viewer either.<br />
<br />
Notepad works fine, permissions on c:\windows are also ok.<br />
<br />
I've just written a quick program script to test Server2Client, and Client2Server and both are working.....<br />
<br />
Yes I agree, we have a common phrase that we use with our users when unexplained issues occur .... &quot;It's Baan&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">One more thing, check the environment variable value for Home and Temp on the server using set env_variable_name to check whether its properly assigned.<br />
<br />
I guess you can try a Server Restart too when the work is down. May be that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Temp was set but Home wasn't, it is now but even after a restart nothing has changed.<br />
<br />
Mark mentioned something earlier about how his Excel Device works ...<br />
<br />
&quot;it first writes in the $BSE/tmp directory the report, then it creates a ASCII copy in my home directory, then it downloads to the desktop into the c:\program files\....\baan\tmp directory&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm now wondering at which point my Device fails - is it during the copy from BSE/tmp to the Home directory, or from there to the Local machine?<br />
<br />
Even more odd, I decided to perform the action to see where the error occurs, and I didn't get asked the question about Creating D:, instead the file was created in BSE/tmp. Notepad didn't launch.<br />
<br />
Sigh.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not able to find the client home folder. Now, I have started to think, the issue is with the ttstpconv. May be you are missing any patches or something like that.<br />
<br />
If you are able to use the server2client (where we need to mention the source as well as destination) it is working. But, ttstpconv is not able to find the local home directory which is assuming some invalid path &quot;D:&quot; to be the destination and which is resulting in the error message.<br />
<br />
Is this happening when you are trying to run the report from server? I guess some tools patch is being missed. A few posts above I have mentioned a link where NPRao has given a method to create bse_vars file and maintain the environment variables. You can give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">When I run directly on the server, I don't get the error message. The file is created in BSE/tmp but Notepad fails to launch.<br />
<br />
The install is up to the same level as our old server, the original install disks were used, but I guess there's a chance a patch is missing. How could I tell if that is the case?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You can take a report of all the tools solutions installed in both the environment and compare them. Also, if you still have Infor Support, it will be a good idea to log an incident.<br />
<br />
I don't want to put you in the pool of confusions but it could be a registry issue as well. I remember a similar issue happened with some other Infor Product where the issue was an incorrect value in registry. <br />
<br />
But, I ll prefer to go with the first way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'll do the comparison between live and new servers and see what it comes up with.<br />

We do have support so I'll also log a case with Infor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Bhushan mentioned this but you could look in the code and utilities forum.  Sample code you can use to simulate this by writing your own device driver like ttstpconv.  Then each step could be looked at.  The server2client as he mentioned would do the part of moving to the local client. Post a screen shot of your device maybe we will see something in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">3rd June 2014, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps I shall look into creating my own driver while I'm waiting for Infor to respond.<br />

you can compare the size of the ostpconv file ($BSE/tools) between the two servers. Maybe they differ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">5th June 2014, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion. I did check that yesterday and the sizes were the same.<br />
<br />
However, to be sure I've just copied ottstpconv from the working server to the new server and guess what? It works!<br />
<br />
So .... from the same install disks and applying the same service packs, I get a slightly different version of ottstpconv. How, I have no idea. As Bhushan said eariler &quot;With Baan you are really not sure sometimes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mark, Bhushan, Lebowski - thank you! I shall get Infor to stand down.<br />
