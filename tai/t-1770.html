<br />
We are running BaaN under HP Unix / Oracle 8i. For the daily backups we are doing the below<br />
<br />
1. creating sequential dump of tables through BaaN Session (activated through Job)<br />
<br />
2. Exporting the Oracle Database through Oracle export utility<br />
<br />
exp full=y file=/d02/bkp/expfullsys.dmp compress=y grants=y indexes=y rows=y constraints=y log=/d02/bkp/expfullsys.log triggers=y<br />
<br />
3. Complete UNIX System backup (through SAM)<br />
<br />
Because of these jobs, the system is not available daily between 11 pm and 6 am.<br />
<br />
<br />
My question is<br />
<br />
1. Is these three types of backup is necessary everyday?<br />
2. If not what alternative is recommended?<br />
3. Can Oracle export and BaaN Job run at the same time?<br />
4. If it runs at the same time, will the data be backed up properly (by BaaN dump &amp; Oracle Export?)<br />
5. Which of these backups is most reliable?<br />
<br />
Now since the data is growing up fastly and more time is taken to complete the backups, i need to revise these backup schedules<br />
<br />
hence, I welcome your suggestion<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are on HP-UX  / Informix IDS <br />
<br />
1-We are creating sequantial dump of tables once a week because we have only time for backup on sunday nights and it takes over 12 hours. If I had the time would do it more than once a week.<br />
<br />
2-every day a full  backup of informix (ontape -s)<br />
3-once a week fbackup  (fbackup -f /dev/rmt/1m -i /)<br />
4-once a month make_recovery backup (make_recovery -v -A -d /dev/rmt/0m)<br />
5-and export data dictionary from baan (depending on created new sessions, reports ..)<br />
<br />
what I can offer to you is taking  make_recovey backups .You can recover your UX os for OS crash<br />

<br />
is it also not important to run &quot;Reorg. Tables&quot; on  a regular basis? if yes than what should be the frequency?<br />
<br />
Actually, I am in a process to define a backup-recovery process for my company and ur post has helped me..<br />
<br />
we are also on HPUX/informix. Could u suggest any thing for HPUX-Informix tuning may be ur personal experiences or any book .. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
One question about re organise tables..<br />
<br />
Will running the session reorganise tables with BaaN running on Oracle database / Informix database  has the same desired result as running the session on Tbase tables ?<br />
<br />

<br />
From what I see, I would probably recommend the following backup strategy.<br />
<br />
1.  Daily hot, incremental Oracle Backups.  As time and days permitting do cold backups.<br />
<br />
2.Weekly - Shutdown the database and Baan Envionrments, and do a cold backup of the system.  Do your Oracle exports and Baan bdbpres, if truely needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am a little bit confused about your backup-strategy.<br />
Why don't you use the feature of oracles archived logfiles :confused: <br />

Yes, I agree that the backup of oracle archived logfiles is good. but i fear that it will reduce the performance since each transactions will be archived (we have remote loactions and hence the access speed from those locations will be affected if i enable the archive log feature)<br />
<br />
also i am worried about the disk space.<br />
<br />

<br />
It will depend on your environment sizing whether archive logging will impact performance dramatically or not. Disk space should not really be a concern as you can move the archive logs to tape at any time you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PBforBaan</div><div class="date">22nd April 2002, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
oracle loggs each transaction all the time at the redo-logs. <br />
The only diffrence by using archivedlogs is the archiving of the full redologs by copying the redologs into new files.<br />
By using the archivedlog-Feature you can use your last offlinebackup in addition to the saved archived logfiles to recover the oracle database up to the last transaction you saved.<br />
This makes you able to have an uptime as long as you need before your next offlinebackup.<br />
Example:<br />
- offlinebackup every Sunday, <br />
- continous (or daily)backup of the archived logfiles<br />
...if the system crashes on wednesday you put in the last offlinebackup and all logged (and saved) transactions. The result is a database which is as close as you need to the livesystem.<br />
<br />
You can backup the archived logfiles to any device you need.<br />
One important thing you should look for is the mean time to recover (MTTR).<br />
<br />

Thanks for all your inputs. It will really help me in re desiging my backup strategy.<br />
<br />
If i have any queries, will come back here<br />

<br />
I'm also planning for a backup strategy to improve operation of our Baan system. We're running on NT platform.<br />
We plan to do the following:-<br />
<br />
Baan live server db (Archiving turn on)<br />
   |<br />
   |---&gt; SAN/NAS (Archive logs, disks are now relatively inexpensive)<br />
                 |<br />
                 |---&gt; Standby Baan Server (DB Created from archive logs)<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantages<br />
========<br />
1) Increased operating hours of Baan Live Server (no downtime for backup processes)<br />
2) Improve backup process (ie hotbackup/online backup)<br />
3) Improve backup/recovery process (ie to poin of failure)<br />
<br />
Disadvantages<br />
===========<br />
1) Requires a little hardware investment</div></div><hr />
