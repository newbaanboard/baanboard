Our clients can sit at every thin client computer and log on. Since we use LN some users every time need to install printers locally even on computers they already have worked and printed on, normally you need to do this just ones. At this moment I can not find why this is.<br />
<br />
Now I am testing to use device type: Windows Server Printer, which eliminates the problem of installing the printer locally. However now I am not able to Preview my report at print time and I am not able to setup the bins or other settings like fonts.<br />
<br />
How does this work with Windows Server Printer?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

These kind of printers work like the 'old' unix printers. You need to configure them on the server. I suppose you should be able configure the bin options, don't see a reason why it should not work. <br />

Thanks for the reply. I saw that the printer uses the BWPrint on the LN server, it was added in the registry. I configured the Bins for this pritner in the registry and it worked OK. Strange that you have to do this through the registry. Maybe there is a better way, which I do not know.<br />

Kind regards,<br />

If I remember correctly you can set this up by printing it first by using the preview option, than right click in the preview window. There you can setup the bin's, fonts etc.<br />
