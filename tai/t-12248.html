<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philpom</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone noticed a serious problem when going to 6.1c.05.02 or higher porting set in connection to 'refers to' statements?  We are concerned that we may have hundreds of illegal statements and heard that if you compile a script that has one of these 'not allowed&quot; refers to in it that the compiler would give a &quot;predicate&quot; error.<br />
<br />
We are unable to recieve a close message and now we are wondering if the problem isn't that big or that we have something wrong in our configuration.<br />

How concerned should we be?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The rule has changed somewhat to be more consistant with standard SQL.   All the parts of an index must be defined for the refers to to work.  Also, the as referred by and path constructions are iffy now.  Here's a link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9223&amp;highlight=index+parts)  to the board discussion on the refers to changes, and the Baan explanation.<br />
<br />
This link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5707&amp;highlight=referred+by) (last thread) also has relevant information.<br />
<br />
As for upgrading your custom code - that depends on how heavily you relied on these statements.  I can say that when this hit us, having developed a LOT of custom code over the years for people, this only effected a couple sql statements, and was easy to fix after understanding the changes.<br />
<br />
The Baan code has been upgraded to conform to these standards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone suggest how we can analyze the scope of program changes prior to a porting set upgrade?<br />
 <br />
And, has anyone seen a white paper from SSA regarding this change?  I have found some detail on this forum but nothing on BaaN support web sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I will modify the above after these years to say that the major change is on the 'referred by' clause, I have not see the 'refers to' to cause the error.  So, if you search for 'referred by' in the scripts, you should see pretty quick the ones affected.  <br />
<br />
Here's a Unix search that I use to find pieces of code:<br />
<br />
find . -type f -print | xargs grep referred by<br />
<br />
. = starting directory - start this from $BSE\application <br />
-type = type file<br />
-print = print results<br />
xargs = use grep command on the files found<br />
grep = find something<br />
referred by = what you want to find.<br />
<br />
(Thx to Doug R :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">26th February 2005, 00:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to BaaN solution 156806.  On page 2 of this solution, they state that this same error applies to &quot;refers to&quot;.<br />
<br />
This solution pertains to an upgrade in porting set.</div></div><hr />
