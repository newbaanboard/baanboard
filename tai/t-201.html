<br />
We are using BaaN c4 / SQL7.0 / NT4.0<br />
<br />
Currently we take the backup from BaaN using create sequential dump of tables. <br />
<br />
But we are informed SQL backup is faster and reliable.<br />
<br />
Could someone tell the procedures involved - how the backup is done and restore is done from SQL in the event of a calamity. And i want to know selective restore particular table / company data; incremental backup; job procedures.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 01:15</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to use sql backup I think the best solution is to do a full backup on the weekend ( assuming you have that downtime window) then backup the transaction logs each night.  To do this setup a dump for the database and schedule it run weekly, then do the same for the transaction logs but set to daily or create a dump device for each day and set weekly. <br />
If you are backing up the transactions logs then the truncate log on checkpoint option must be set to off.<br />
You cannot restore individual tables/companies with this solution unless you use third party backup tools, these also allow you to do online backups. You should also be backing up the master and msdb databases as these contain information on the databases on the system and backup records, replication information etc.<br />
<br />
I am also running BaaN c4 / SQL7.0 / NT4.0 and my backup system is to use an sql dump devices to backup baandb plus master and msdb on the weekend and every night sequential dump of live company and record to tape. Also dump tools company any time that I have installed a patch, new user, altered menu, report etc.  We have also setup archiving so our live company doesn't take all night to dump.</div></div><hr />
