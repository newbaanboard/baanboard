I just don't get this. :mad: <br />
There is a report session created by someone. If the session is executed in a non-job mode, it will give the output. But, if the same session is executed through job (using job daemon), the status would change to Running from In Queue, and then hang. No change in status, no file generated, no error, nothing!! :confused: <br />
Also, if I do not put the status into In Queue, and activate the session through baan session, then I'll get output. And, this user is able to execute all the jobs, except this one.<br />
Any idea what am I overlooking!?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

The Job printers cannot be 'Windows' printers, as defined in Maintain Devices, as that uses the bw print.  Bw print is not active when you are not running through the BW Client, such as Unix jobs, but the user would have no problem later trying to run this manually with a BW Client open.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.<br />
The device I am choosing is ASCIF, and the same device is used if executed in non-job mode. It works fine in the latter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">15th June 2004, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, well, I would not think the ASCIF would have an issue.   I noticed you said it was a custom session.  The sessions can hang if the coding is not correct for Job processes.  The job process does not call the form sections as no form becomes active.  This post may give some ideas:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amac14</div><div class="date">16th June 2004, 00:02</div></div><div class="posttext">What are your setting within the job itself?  Is periodical checked?  What is the Period values and what is the value in the next execution date?<br />
<br />
Sometimes the job will hang if the next execution date is too far in the future.  Change the period to be every minute and change the next execution date to be today's date but a earlier than the actual time.  For instance if it is 16:00, I will change the time to 15:55.  This way when I schedule the job it should execute right away, as the next time it was supposed to run is past.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

Lisa: There is a form, but without any input field. The criteria is hard coded in the program script.<br />
<br />
Amac: It is a periodical job, with the periodicity of 05 minutes. I changed it to 01 day also, but no success.<br />
<br />
Mraguthu: What is the criteria which makes some of the sessions not work in job mode?<br />
<br />
John: The same user is able to create the file if the session is executed in the non-job mode!!</div></div><hr />
