I agree with Markus, that it should be possible with a second program using shell() to change the filename and I am quite sure this will work on M$ system too.<br />
Another nice attempt would be to modify ttadv(aad?)501(?) in company xxx (can't look up table name atm, sorry) .... in this file the input parameters of a program in a job are stored, field by field. If you use the Baan session 'create seq. dump of table', you enter the filename and these inputs are stored in this tools-table. So the trick would be to create another mini proggy that changes the filename right there and include it in the job as step before the dump program. <br />

I do the trick on windows scheduler to run a datename.bat (which I found on http://www.fpschultze.de) with a schedule time much far from the completion time of a daily backup.</div></div><hr />
