But the Package VRC which I am going to use, say &quot;B50C_b_dvp&quot; belongs to a different Pacakge Comb (doesn't belong to the Package Comb of my User ID).<br />
<br />
Baan allows this and I can insert/compile. Want to kknow if this is alright  or can't be used?  What are the effects and where I may face problem.<br />
<br />
Apreciate your answer.</div></div><hr />

In that way you can develop in different VRC's by changing your developer PVRC (using Change PVRC in most tools sessions) without the need to convert and exit, etc.  <br />
<br />
When you run what you developed in another VRC, through, say, run sessions, you will run the session, but with a view from the company your user is assigned to, not that of your developer.  This is generally where people get confused, and see data and runtime errors.  The session may be fine, but you are not seeing the database in the VRC you may be thinking.  To sync them up, make sure you User (Under Maintain Users) is signed onto the same VRC as your developer (as in Change Current PVRC of Developer), and you won't get messed up.</div></div><hr />
