<br />
I tried to install webtop 1.1 and I'm still trying...<br />
<br />
Baan ERP 5.0c SP 8 / Oracle <br />
Portingset 71c05<br />
<br />
IIS and ServletExec 4.1<br />
<br />
all on an Win2000 Server<br />
<br />
My problem was/is that the ASM did not work:<br />
<br />
error -2 in the DiagnosticsServlet<br />
<br />
So I decided to upgrade on Portingset 71d, because the ASM is no longer included in the NT / Baan &quot;Logic service&quot; [with Portingset 71c05 you have to change the Protocol of the Logic Servic to BaanLogin on Port 7150 and check ASM - this is'nt mentioned in the Installation Guide - you can only change the port if Rexec is enabled. Be careful: your users must login with the new entries from bwconfig]<br />
<br />
OK: Portingset 71d<br />
<br />
- with this protingset 71d I'm only able to log on with &quot;BaanLogin&quot; to the Baan System - don't kow why<br />
<br />
My Problem:<br />
<br />
ASM 1.0 - the Service Starts on Port 7250 its defauft one, but I'm not able to configer the Service via MMC. I have no possibilitiy to save an &quot;New Host&quot; and use the <br />
<br />
asminsdef.xml <br />
or <br />
asmtypedef.xml file <br />
<br />
because they are not there :-(. In my opinion the problem is that there is no .xml file to initialize the mmc for an &quot;New Host&quot;. In the installation guides to webtop etc. (wich are written from hardcore baan developers for hardcore baan devlopers of the same developing project who are on holidays) are no examples for such files.<br />
<br />
Has anybody an idear? Or can somebody send me the xml files?<br />
<br />
I'm sure, that is the only problem I have with the installation. I think when the ASM works everything is fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
