<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">3rd June 2006, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like you've got some custome tables in there so i can't tell you 100%<br />
<br />
But you're outer query is using tdsls045 Index1 however you're not really limiting index 1 by much, so it is likely doing a full index scan.<br />
<br />
Your query on rpl100 should be &quot;ok&quot; but it's stilly to using the _index9. You should use _index1 which is orno, pono, srrb. You should also order by<br />
_index1 just to make sure you're sending the index hint.<br />
<br />
You're also using a &quot;not exists&quot; from 2 subqeries. which is fairly bad design, I'd see if i could try to join the tables in another way. It might be better to send them in your selectdo or selectempty<br />
<br />
The only other thing you could hope for is to do &quot;analyse table &lt;tablename&gt; compute statistics&quot; on each of the tables in your query (at the oracle level) and hope the optimizer can figure it out.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
(Display or Print Session ????)<br />
as i suppose, you wanna select all salesorder deliveries without the additional positions above tdsls000.cspn.4 (Sales parameters) and without replenishment orders and all deliveries where is a deliverydate.<br />
I don't know the structure of own tables (issls930).<br />
Try to work with variable and functions, not all in one select statement.<br />
If parameter cspn.4 is set to 960:<br />
<br />
select tdsls045.*, tiitm001.ctyp, tiitm001.csgs<br />
from tdsls045, tiitm001<br />
where tdsls045._index1 inrange {:orno.f, 0, 0}<br />
and                                      {:orno.t, 950, 99}<br />
and tdsls045.ddat &lt;&gt; 0<br />
selectdo<br />
  order = tdsls045.orno<br />
  position = tdsls045.pono<br />
  serial = tdsls045.srnb<br />
  <br />
  check.tdrpl100()<br />
  if condition is ok then <br />
<br />
selectempty<br />
  maybe do something<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
function check.tdrpl100()<br />
{<br />
select tdrpl100.*<br />
from tdrpl100<br />
where tdrpl100._index1 = {:order, :position, :serial}<br />
selectdo<br />
selectempty<br />
  here a repl. order does'nt exist<br />
endselect<br />
}<br />
<br />
Try to avoid &quot;full table scans&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Your problem can be in different areas:<br />
- how much is the &quot;not exists&quot; on tdrpl100 filtering?<br />
- how much is the &quot;not exists&quot; on issls930 filtering?<br />
<br />
If one of these is filtering more than 50% of the records, I assume that this is causing your performance issue.<br />
<br />
If thsese filters filters less than a 10% I advise to do a SQL_TRACE and share the tkprof formatted output.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">9th June 2006, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All, I also check it . I saw something on SQL. <br />
issls930.dlnk = isdelink.active <br />
if DLNK domain type is enumareted then you should use corresponding integer number for your enumareted type.In sql query this is must on Baan Tools. However , timing for your sql may be normal if there ara so many records. Because your query is a bit complicated. Check DLNK domain type.For example if 1 is used for your isdelink.active then change it in  your code like <br />
issls930.dlnk = 1  .<br />
<br />
Good lucks</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMHO this statement is not correct. <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">9th June 2006, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure ? In baan sql <br />
For example <br />
select *<br />
from table<br />
where [condition part]<br />
selectdo<br />
  [operation part]<br />
endselect <br />
<br />
In condition part of Baan sql you should use int value for enum. Am I right ?<br />
In operation part of baan sql you should use directly your enum like issls930.dlnk = isdelink.active <br />
<br />
ok. Dikke Understand it ?  If it is not correct me !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">12th June 2006, 10:36</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not correct Suleyman, you should use the constant name, rather than the constant number. The debugger will by the way not even accept the constant numbers (at least in BaanV)..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">12th June 2006, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean constant number for enum.<br />
<br />
anyway , I said that because in our system , When I compile my code with enum name , it didn't compile it. But I said that for SQL condition part. Except that you are right. as soon as possible I will check it agin .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you been able to make some progress on this topic? I like to hear what the problem was and how you fixed it. Or where we can help you to get it fixed.<br />
<br />
