Baan Device - Windows Printer<br />
Queue: \\servername\printername<br />
<br />
Printer resides directly on &quot;servername&quot;, a Win2k Server box.<br />
Printer using Generic text driver. <br />
Every line from Baan report looses the first character on each line.<br />
<br />
Printing a document on &quot;servername&quot; directly to &quot;printername&quot; does NOT have this problem. <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this or have a clue what's happening?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of our reports did loose the first two lines of the header on the first page only. This happened after we had changed our printer drivers (latest HP ones). The problem is known, however it seems to be very specific so it looks like that Baan is not able to convince HP to solve it.<br />
<br />
By using the driver that MS supplies the problem does appear. Disadvantage is that now the prints are up to 10 times larger than before.<br />
<br />
So perhaps changing the driver will help?<br />

Thanks for the reply.<br />
It seems that for generic text, there is nothing EXCEPT the Microsoft UNIDRV driver.<br />
<br />
Also, it seems that this is a known problem that Microsoft reports that started with Win2k SP3.  They only offer the perverbial &quot;Load the latest updates&quot; as a solution, but an up-to-date SP4 as of today's date till does not fix it.<br />

Workaround: In the Printer Properties for the device, change the Printer Properties - Unprintable margins - Left from the default of ZERO to ONE.</div></div><hr />
