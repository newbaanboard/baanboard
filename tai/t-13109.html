<br />
I am a newbie for BaaN Tools.  I have Baan 4c4 installed running on sql server, windows 2000 on my test server.  I am learning user management.  I try to create a new user.  I have created a new user in windows.  Then in session maintain user data, I create a new user as a super user and link the above windows user here.<br />
<br />
I have already created database and database group.  Then I go to ttdba0115m000 to maintain database user.  Then I maintain link with baan user, in session ttdba0110m000, dump users and upload user files.<br />
<br />
After all this, it is not allowing me to log in the new username.  It is giving a message like &quot;database not on&quot; among other things.<br />
<br />
Anybody out there to help me?  Thanks<br />

<br />
Did you converted all your user maintenance tasks to runtime (like also in the Maintain user data)?<br />
Make sure that you show an example with all sessions and whenever CRTDD was run, like that is easier to point where the fault may be, if no help was found (but search first).</div></div><hr />
