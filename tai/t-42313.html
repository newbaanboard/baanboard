Does anyone out there have a testing plan document?  Other than just having some key users log onto the new system and go through their every day functions/sessions and see that it all works good I'm not being told much else.  My users are concerned there isn't a documented plan with steps to take to ensure we test all that needs tested.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts??<br />
