<br />
I am having a problem with printing from clients running on Windows98. I select a windows printer, and select preview. The report does not display in preview, nor is it printed to the selected printer. However,  there is a bpf file placed locally in the tmp file.<br />
<br />
Porting set 6.2a.03.03<br />
<br />
I searched the board, and saw this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2155&amp;highlight=windows98). <br />
NP, what happened with your Baan-case? Is there a solution available? Did you resolve it since 2002....? <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

And in my case it has been tied to multiple versions of the BW client being installed in various directories.  The solution is to remove the installations, edit the registry removing all occurances of Baan, reboot the machine, and then re-install the proper version of the client.<br />
<br />
Every time I have done this procedure it works, then if the user calls back with the same problem; when I look at their machine and they have multiple-installs of BW all over again.</div></div><hr />

It is an HPDJ895c, and there the 'effect' tab and fit to paper size option are not available. I've tried on a different printer which does offer the options (HP8150), but with no effect. I anyway don't see what it could have to do with it. My problem seems to be that the bwprint doesn't work... The report is generated ok, the bpf-file is created and stored locally, but cannot be viewed locally. If I however open the same file on a different pc, it is opened correctly, and with the correct formats and layouts.<br />

Indeed I found some folders from an old Baan installation on this pc. There was no actual Baan installation, yet there were still bin/log/tmp folders. I removed them, but that doesn't seem enough. You tell me to remove anything to do with Baan from this pc; does that mean including becs/user files etc.??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan_James_Baan</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">You might be able to scan the registry for any pointers to the old installation, then delete them.  Though, I have always simply backed up the bwc files (if you want), and uninstall BW, then delete all registry entries that mention Baan.  What I found is that when the bwprint client is called it loses its mind if two or more installations of Baan are found in the registry, and it always seems to choose the old/bad one, and can't find the dll's or executables to launch bwprint.  If you were to check the Baan\tmp directory on your pc, you would actually see that the report was sent to your pc but bwprint couldn't be found to open it.  Thus by removing the old/bad pointers in the registry and leaving just the good ones then it should start working again (once you have rebooted).<br />
<br />
I have had this problem occur when an old version of BW was installed (which used to default to C:\Baan) and then a newer version was installed later (which now defaults to C:\Program Files\Baan).</div></div><hr />

I removed screen shots that were specific to the client and did some other quick clean up work this AM to it; but I think it should help.  Drop me an email, and I'll send it to you.</div></div><hr />

I tried your suggestion: uninstalled Baan, removed all baan-keys in the registry, and re-installed Baan. Rebooted the pc after each handling.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it did not solve my problem. Any other suggestions anyone??</div></div><hr />
