<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ravin_singh</div><div class="date">12th October 2013, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, I have developed a customized print session. I wanted to add it in users specific menu of tdsls4101m000(Sales Order lines). So, I copied the session tdsls4101m000 to my customized vrc and added the session as a form command. I have full authorization so I can see the session in specific menu. But, the user has only print/display authorization for tdsls4101m000 session, so he is not able to see the session in his specific. What should I do? If I give full authorization to him, he can view it.<br />
<br />
I think its a big problem with authorization.<br />
<br />
Please help.</div></div><hr />

It is not an issue with authorization but your session design &amp; role settings.<br />
<br />
Refer to the threads -<br />
<br />
Group Authorization (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=54483&amp;highlight=form+command)<br />
<br />
Authorisation group of form command? (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8511&amp;highlight=authorization)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you have full authorization at form command level but the user is not having full authorization for that session, that user is not able to see that form command. The authorization group at form command is the minimum authorization that user should have to be able to see/use that form command.<br />
<br />
Make the authorization group to Display and the other user should be able to see it.</div></div><hr />
