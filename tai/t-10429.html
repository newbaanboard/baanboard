But, BWPrint is too slow to print many pages. Can a Device / Print query be set such that BaaN prints the report to my PDF writer directly like printing to a printer.<br />
My company BaaN server is overseas and runs on Unix.<br />
Please advice. Thank!</div></div><hr />

I have not right to change server setting and my server administrator has said that could do nothing. Thus, I have to use a &quot;client-side&quot; solution. I have tried some buddies' suggestion that setup a device to call client-side application; however, it fails (poor! don't not why....). An error message is returned &quot;Conversion to ascii:c: is not supported yet&quot;</div></div><hr />

Try to use this -<br />

I have copied and pasted your arguement. However, I still get the error &quot;Conversion to ASCII:notepad in not support yet&quot; :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I can call notepad directly in DOS prompt. My desktop OS is MS XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th June 2003, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually ~Vamsis' solution is a client side solution.  What you do is write a conversion device like ttstpconv.  The new conversion tool creates some batch files on the client, launches them and creates the PDF file.  So it does require you to develop a tools program.<br />
<br />
And for you other error are you running the current tools patch? I created the below attached device and it works for me.<br />
