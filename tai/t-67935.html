<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">14th July 2015, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone tell me all the tables that are affected by running the initialize parameters session (tcmcs0295m000)?<br />
<br />
I want to copy parameter settings from one company to another and my idea is to do a seq dump of just the parameter tables, edit the files for the handful of changes and them create tables from the dump in the new company.<br />
<br />
My assumption is that any table ending in 000 will be included but I am sure there must be some others as well.<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th July 2015, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you wanting to move only parameter tables or company 000 tables?  That is not the same thing to me.<br />
<br />
For parameter tables like tdilc000 - I would export and import those myself.  These tables actually reside in the schema with the company.  Like tdilc000123 - where 123 represents an actual company number.  When we refresh a test/dev/patch company we only refresh from the production company tables - not company 000.  So all of the parameter tables come along at the same time. I have never run tcmcs0295m000 so I am thinking it updates tables like tdilc000 - ilc parameters, and not really company 000 tables.  <br />
<br />
For company 000 I would just export and import (well the oracle dba's would) company 000 tables.  Of course keep in mind if you are importing into an existing company 000 you would lose any development work that might be in progress.  Once company 000 was built then you could make additional changes in the tools tables to point everything to the correct spot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, parameter tables in the company itself , not company 000.<br />
<br />
tcmcs0295m000 fills all the parameter tables with default values when you create a new company from scratch. You then have to go through and &quot;adjust&quot; them to suit your requirements. A long and painful process.<br />
<br />
We have a company that was created a while ago but only used for finance (manual journal) entries. We are now going live with the logistics side so need to do all of the set up that we skipped over originally. My idea is that because 99% of the parameter settings will be the same as our other companies rather than edit each one manually, I import them from a seq dump, then fix the few little differences.<br />
<br />
In parallel with this I got a list of tables updated by tcmcs0295m000 from someone with access to source code so am going to try my experiment.<br />
<br />
For anyone coming across this in the future the table list is below (note this is for baan IVc4 sp 30)<br />
