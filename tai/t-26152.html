<br />
I tried to login with the default user &quot;baan&quot; having administrator rights on the local machine. Yes problem is with all users. <br />
<br />
let me tell one more thing, this problem started since I restored the database. The Backup was of the other database server and I restored it on this server. May be there is some database server side setting is different, but make it sure that the directory structure is same, only the server name is different.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
