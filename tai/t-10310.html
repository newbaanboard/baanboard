<br />
from my experience, baan handles better by auto-growing in megabytes (eg 100 mb) rather than by %.</div></div><hr />

If file growth (db and transaction log) is restricted, it will cause table locking once it reaches the max. On the other hand, you will have the same problem if the transaction log becomes too big and it reaches the limit of your db space.<br />
You really need to watch out first how your db behaves before deciding on these things. The autogrow by megabytes could also be applied to the db itself, not just the log files.<br />
The space allocated is also very important. I recommend at least 2 to 3 gb above your actual db size. again please note how your db grows.<br />
Also run the SQL utilities to reduce the size of db and transaction logs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never had any problem making the change on my live environment anytime during the day.</div></div><hr />
