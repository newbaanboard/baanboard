<br />
We have installed the latest Webtop release (8.5) to test the homepage functionality. We have done all necessary steps such as installing the latest solutions and installing the language patch. After homepage import the homepages are visible but there seems to be a problem with the charts if other user-language is chosen than English. Then the homepage is displayed for the user but the chart cannot be displayed. Instead the java-exception-error shows up in the window where you expect the chart to appear.<br />
<br />
Changing the user's profile to English solves the problem (the homepages are displayed correctly). Although, we're not an English speaking company - so it should work for our &quot;home&quot; language as well. <br />
<br />
Maybe it is a problem with the Report Viewer, because the translated homepages are displayed correctly - only the charts come up with an error if a foreign language has been chosen.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what could be wrong with that?<br />

Here's the error message displayed in webtop: <br />
<br />
Can not generate the requested chart/report<br />
<br />
reason:<br />
java.io.CharConversionException: Not an ISO 8859-1 character: ?</div></div><hr />

the error message indicates a typical character code problem. Most likely there is a german umlaut or a Euro Sign in the translated chart.<br />
If you are not familiar with the underlying model and there is no hint in the docs on internationalisation i would advise to log an incident with Infor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">26th February 2009, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is a character code problem. All known (at least for me) language settings have been defined correctly on the server - also the homepage translations have been installed. There must be something wrong with the reports or/and the report viewer application. <br />
<br />
Is there someone who uses the homepages in German language without any errors?<br />

<br />
I think could it be a problem with Tomcat settings also but there are a lot of places where you can configure character codes.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has resolved?.</div></div><hr />
