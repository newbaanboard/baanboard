<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 09:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
Look previous postings on this board, there are just a lot. Also somewhere the PDF document is located by Baan Migration Competency Center (Baan authorized company) where they discribe the guidelines of migration. They don't solve their metology though. We also planned to migrate but still using 4c4. Future shows what it is :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maxime</div><div class="date">5th February 2003, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you mean conversion or Migration?<br />
<br />
IF Migration, then you should take into consideration a lot of factors which would also include customizing Baan V (In accordance with your exisiting Baan IV).<br />
<br />
I had been involved in a Baan IV to Baan V Migration effort.If you can give me more details may be I can help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">5th February 2003, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience is migration from Baan IV to Baan V, is more like a re-implementation. But again people follow different approach, <br />
<br />
1. To carry forward ONLY the Master data to Baan V.<br />
<br />
2. To Carry forward Master as well as TRX data.<br />
<br />
In first case (only Master), the efforts are not very high in data conversion and mapping.<br />
<br />
In Second case (Master + TRX data), the efforts are definately huge. But there are definately lot of tools available for this (partners developed)<br />
<br />
Apart from this data mapping/conversion, one also has to take into account the efforts required for re-training the users. Specifically if company is using Logistics module very much.<br />
<br />
Pl let me know if you need any more specific help on this..!<br />

I have done several of these upgrades now and each have varied greatly both in cost and duration. The most significant question is the motivation or business driver leading to you question?<br />
<br />
I would be more than happy to share my experiences (to much discussion required to post) if you wish to email me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyalenav</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a tough question. It's very hard to estimate the cost of such migration. I've seen on previous postings that some suggested to look at this kind of migration as new implementation and I tend to agree with them. There are enough functional changes and technical differences between the two versions that it has to be treated as such. The major benefit of such a migration is that you worked with the software before and that you know the look and feel of it (if you know what I mean). Our group is working on some, and the first lesson learned is that the functional and the technical should be working together. <br />
As of for the cost, what kind of data you want to bring over? which pieces of Baan are you using? what is the time frame that you need it to be done? what are the reasons for the migration?<br />

<br />
Have u developed the tool for TRX data as well? Does the tool take care of data extraction from Baan IV and then converting to Baan V format (if required) and then loading?<br />
<br />
If so, which packages you have taken care of?<br />
<br />
in terms of efforts, can u give some benchmark with respect to database size?<br />
<br />

Our Tool covers TRX data as well and we have covered the Baan IV Manufacturing, Distribution and Finance packages. This means that tRX data from these Baan IV packages can be migrated to Baan V without losing he historical perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We just did a BAAN IV_c3 to BAAN V_c migration in less than 4 months.<br />
We built a new Migration Tool that takes into account all the references before the data gets loaded into BAAN V.<br />
The advantage is that you can correct all the bad data before it goes into BAAN V and do not have to deal with this after the fact.<br />
We had to take into customizations as well as the A&amp;D extension in BAAN IV.<br />
We migrated BAAN IV Distribution, Manufacturing, Finance and Common Data.<br />
With our new version coming out in August we will also be able to handle Service, Project and GRINYA (Goods Received Invoice Not Yet Approved)<br />
<br />
Not only did we migrate the customer but also did all the training, implementation and business process re-engineering in the same time frame.<br />
<br />
If this entire package (migration, training, implementation and BPR) is going to cost you more than $250K you know you are being overcharged.<br />
If no customizations are present in BAAN IV the implementation time can be faster. It will become a matter of weeks instead of months.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you are interested!<br />
<br />
