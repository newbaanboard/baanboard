<br />
While planning to test the procedure for Disaster recovery, we would like to copy the file systems and necessary data from live server to test server. After all the process we would like to see Baan working fine on the test server, and it is fine even if it works successfully in a demo mode, where the license can be obtained in due course.<br />
<br />
We would like to know the following;<br />
<br />
1) Will such a solution work for a disaster recovery<br />
2) What are files and directories that we need to copy from live server to test server<br />
3) What are the configuration changes that need to be done after copying, on the test server<br />
<br />
Please remember that we are have the ascii mode for Baan. Let us know about this in detail as we are doing this for the first time.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Yes but it depends how much data you can afford to loose. You could go for setting up a standby server on which your bse environment is copied/synced each half hour and on which a standby database is running which will receive the oracle archived log files. By this you should loose no more than about half hour of work;<br />
2.$BSE, and your database files;<br />
3. If you install the license daemon in cluster mode you can use it on both servers. Only thing to do is to activate your standby database and start baan.<br />
