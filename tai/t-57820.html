<br />
we use Baan5c with SQL 2005 in our Company . I am a new hire and i started with Baan a few month ago.<br />
<br />
I wanted to install Baan in my Testenviroment but it seems to be that SQL 7 is a prereq (mandatory) to install Baan successfully. I tried with SQL2000 and SQL 2005 but did not worked.<br />
<br />
Is there a workaround avaiable or is the only possibility to install sql server 7 and migrate after installation of bann to sql 2005.<br />
<br />
Any help are much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />
Marco</div></div><hr />

<br />
unfortunately i got this errormessage:<br />
You are not authorized to execute this function. Please contact your Flexera Software Account Representative or Flexera Software Customer Support to resolve this matter.<br />
<br />
We have a login/customer id for infor365.com, but it seems to be that this customer id is not the same to authorize on  infor.subscribenet.com.<br />
<br />
Can someone clarify where i can register a login ?!<br />
Is this a free service for Infor Customers ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">13th February 2010, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">You can create an inquiry to get access to subscribenet. Another way is to ask your account manager if Infor can sent you the software but than you probably have to wait a couple of days/weeks.<br />
<br />
On the other hand why do you want to perform a fresh install? I guess your test environment should be the same as your production server. So I would rather copy the environment. But of course that's up to you.<br />
