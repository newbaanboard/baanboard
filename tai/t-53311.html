Perhaps a custom table too? Check the Baan log files for the table number that is causing the error and make sure everything is converted to runtime and that the table has been created in this company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if Baan name conventions were followed, this should be a session to print history sales order positions. To my experience &quot;can not continue&quot; very often occurs when references can't be resolved - a price unit or whatever specified in one table can't be found in the corresponding table containing e.g. price units. On unix systems these errors are easy to be found in $BSE/log directory (e.g. log.bisam or here log.oracle file) .. BUT I have very often seen unpopulated $BSE/log directories on M$ systems.<br />
If your session crashes regardless of the ranges choosen in the input mask your problem should be located somewhere else - did this session ever work? Have there been changes in your table descriptions since it last run? Have a look at the date stamps of your DD and the object that crashes.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />
To set that is a session (don't have baan infront of me right now..) in the finance parameters.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
the error says : the table tdsls051 in company 000 does'nt exist.<br />
<br />
Maybe the user points to wrong company.<br />
Use function &quot;read.own.company.data()&quot; (itcmcs0005 )<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">13th August 2008, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">If the programm script uses the company of a table field (e.g. in tdpur045 there is a field &quot;comp&quot;) and this field is not filled, therefor is 0, then the select points to the wrong company.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
select ...<br />
from<br />
where ...<br />
and t$comp = :var.company<br />
<br />
Sometimes this error happens in finance sessions if the document is not filled correctly.<br />
