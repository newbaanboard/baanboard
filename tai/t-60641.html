<br />
Is it possibe to put authorisation based on what user inserts ? for example not inserting a row in sales line table if sales man puts a discount bigger than 35 %.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to put conditional restrictions on session's comands ? for example block confirmation button if a discout of more than 35 % is inserted. <br />
<br />
when the user enters an item's code, the system extracts the default item's discount. it seems either that it applies the condition at this time. <br />
once the sales line is created, the user can change the default discount rate.<br />
my need is to make the restrictions tests after the user makes his modifications. for exampe when the focus goes off the discount field or when user wants to confirm the sales order. <br />
<br />
i'm actually using AMS but if needed, i can use DEM too.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

We use another method to control this issue by customizing the session. Copy the standard one then perform the customization you need then link the session to the users with new customization and keep the standard one as it is, and use the Authorization Management System to control the other Authorities.&quot; Data, Sessions, Packs...etc&quot;<br />

Can you please explain me the details of your idea a bit more ? i'm a functional.<br />
