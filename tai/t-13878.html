<br />
For some reason it failed.<br />
I followed documents from the Microsoft web site but could not continue.<br />
<br />
I have now created a new SQL 2000 instance and attached the BaaN databases to that instance.<br />
<br />
I can access the BaaN data using SQL enterprise manager but can not log into BaaN<br />
<br />
I have made the SID in the master database and baandb database the same.<br />
<br />
I had a similar problem (after a system crash and restore) where I had to set the new encrypted password in a baan table - but I can't remember which one.<br />
<br />
Can you help?<br />

We are do it same but we are make upgrade from MSSQL7 to MSSQL2K not new clear install of MSSQL2K. We use Baan IV c4 witch can't be installed directly on MSSQL2K. Upgrade don't rename directory mssql7 in baan directory and other files and data so baan thinks that work on MSSQL7.</div></div><hr />

I performed same installation last week. My client bought new server and we moved all data to new server. I have upgraded SQL Server7 to SQL Server 2000 on Win 2003 Server + licensed new server with same name.<br />
I have completed entire process with SQL Server 7 and finally I updated to SQL Server 2000. If you prefer go direct to new version, first install SP3, SP3a for SQL Server 2000.<br />
<br />
As you mentioned, you can use 2 methods for upgrade database: attach or restore backup from LIVE server. I have used second procedure but nothing is wrong with first.<br />
<br />
After performing this step, you should fix all users ID due to you didn't export master DB.<br />
<br />
After that, fix each users (put correct ID)<br />
<br />
I'll give you a call tomorrow and find out where is a problem <br />
<br />
You need 2 hours working and 35 hours waiting (during migration).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andrew.page</div><div class="date">12th December 2003, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem I ended up with was that I had users in the baandb database which didn't exist in the SQL masetr database.<br />
<br />
I fixed this using the following command:<br />
<br />
sp_change_users_login 'Auto_fix', 'login', NULL, 'password'</div></div><hr />
