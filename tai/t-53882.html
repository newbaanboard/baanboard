If there is documentation on this, please let me know!<br />
<br />
I have a subsidiary that uses Baan LN 6.1. We currently are using Baan IVc3 for our main business.  Therefore, I am able to login to both applications, and compare things side-by-side.<br />
<br />
(1) What things can I look for, that are different between the two?<br />
<br />
(2) Will it require lots of user re-training?  <br />
<br />
(3) Are some sessions almost exactly the same from Baan IV?<br />
<br />
(4) Did certain sessions get relocated?  <br />
<br />
(5) Is there any change to the underlying logic?<br />
<br />
(6) Are there any new features that Baan IV users will love?<br />
<br />
(7) Are there any new features that Baan developers will love?<br />
<br />
I have very limited experience with either one, to tell the truth, and I have logged into Worktop for Baan LN, and it looks different at first glance [looks better] but, the application is still menu-driven, and once you launch a session, it looks about the same.  There appears to be a slightly different printing screen, but that is all that I notice, at first glance.  <br />
<br />
In order to better check, I'm going to gather information from end users on what they are doing with the application [how they do such-and-such task].  I'll do this for users at the main office, as well as the Australia users.  I'm asking  my developer if we already have this, and/or I'll just poll end users to find out.<br />
<br />
If someone has experienced any migration from Baan IV to Baan LN, your input is desired, thanks!</div></div><hr />
