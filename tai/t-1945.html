We are on Baan IV c4, SP9, IN5<br />
At lots of places in our system, we do not get help when requested for. For e.g., in the menu browser, when selecting &quot;BaaN IV Distribution&quot; and clicking &quot;Help -&gt; Find Help On&quot;, no help pops up. The corresponding menu used for &quot;BaaN IV Distribution&quot; was &quot;mtdinv0000m000&quot;. Opened the menu in &quot;Maintain Menu&quot; session, help text code attached to it was &quot;MNinv0000m0001&quot;. But, there was no such help text code in session &quot;Maintain Help Text Codes (ttadv1160m000)&quot;.<br />
But, we found out that the help text existed in the table &quot;tttxt002000&quot;. We searched thru keyword 1 as &quot;MNinv0000m0001&quot; and found a record (text no 19637 in our case). The contents of the text are as expected.<br />
<br />
Hence, problem here is that even though 'help texts' are available with us, we are not able to use them as no corresponding 'Help text codes' are existing in the system.<br />
Session 'Create Runtime Help' is not solving the problem, as this session creates runtime help only when there is already a help text code in the table.<br />
<br />
This problem exists in a lot of places, Hence, it is not practically possible to manually insert all the missing help text codes.<br />
<br />
Please help<br />
