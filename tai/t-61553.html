Here are the setup of both enviroments:<br />
     Old server                          New server<br />
         AIX  5.3                             AIX 7.1<br />
         Informix 9.40                       Informix 11.7<br />
         BaanIVc4 SP15                    BaanIVc4 SP15<br />
         Porting set 6.1c.14               Porting set 6.1c.16<br />
On the attache file please find two error messages: the first is the one I´ve got when I try to login via BW or ba6.1. The second one comes up when I´ve tryied to do a table dump on the new sever.<br />
The steps I performed to migrate were:<br />
    1 - Copy $BSE from old server to the new one.<br />
    2 - Install a new portingset.<br />
    3 - Export of the database &quot;unload to &lt;tabe_name&gt;.unl select * from &lt;table_name&gt;<br />
   4 - Import of the database &quot;load from &lt;tabe_name&gt;.unl insert into  &lt;table_name&gt;<br />
<br />
Could anyone help me on this problem?<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I am not very familiar with Informix so I can't really advise on what the settings should be.  I would review your $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1 file and the files in the $BSE/lib/inf directory to make sure they are referring to the correct locations/variables.<br />
<br />
Also, based on your error message, I would google &quot;informix 1829&quot; to see what that error means.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Homer-J-</div><div class="date">5th December 2011, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">are the user and the passwords also copied??<br />
informix dont habe a own user administration. it tooks the user from the OS system. sho i think the group dosent exist. <br />
<br />
another way: have you created the database (for exampel baandb) with dbaccess ?? you must grant also permissions to the database (for user specified at $BSE/lib/informix/ user and group)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmendes</div><div class="date">5th December 2011, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I´ve also copied the users and passwords from the old system.<br />
<br />
As per Iconnect,  it has not been installed when the installation of informix, but only after the error occurred. Could it be a problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">5th December 2011, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">-can you use dbaccess with the user you're connecting to Baan? <br />
-can you read any tables with that user?<br />
<br />
If you're not the dba, you can always issue this command to test: <br />
$BSE/bin/qptool6.1 -q&quot;select * from ttaad200&quot; -c000 <br />
<br />
Most likely, you will get a similar error. If you don't, this command should query the users table with the baan database driver.<br />
<br />
I fear that for the error message you're obtaining, two things might need to be checked,<br />
<br />
1) The encrypted password for the user ($BSE/lib/inf/inf_user)<br />
2) In Informix, make sure the db_user to which your Baan user is linked exists as well as make sure the user has the appropriate roles assigned to it. <br />
<br />
Best luck!</div></div><hr />

lrwxrwxrwx  1 informix informix 18 05 Dez 18:35 server -&gt; /informix/iconnect and now I´m able to access the database.<br />
<br />
Thank you for you help.</div></div><hr />
