<br />
All archive sessions will be run by super users and no normal users will have permission to run the archiving sessions.<br />
Many of them will have permission for the archive company though and we need a simple way to prevent them from editing any data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">27th May 2013, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have thought there would have been option under the &quot;Company Authorizations&quot; selection, however I do not see it where it tells us we may restrict users to read only. I only see two sessions: ttaad2120m000 : Maintain User Authorizations by Company and ttaad2121m000 : Maintain Company Authorizations by User. But nothing that states - read only access or write access.<br />
<br />
You can however combine the use of these two methods with the option ttaad4130m000 : Maintain Table Authorizations by Package and specify the different packages plus the authorization indicator set to &quot;Read&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">28th May 2013, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Chris, i was hoping to avoid having to use that session. 15 companies and a couple hundred users makes it a lot of work.<br />
We have our archive companies in a separate DB instance so maybe something can be done at the DB level instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">3rd June 2013, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Gary,<br />
<br />
I have been interested in doing the same and so would love to know how you managed to get the archive companies on seperate DB's. I know that you have to create another sequence of SQL, how do you tell BaaB to see the new instance and create tables for the new instance?<br />
<br />
Sorry that I cannot offer you any other advise on the Archive restrictions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">3rd June 2013, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to add two new database definitions in baan (ttaad4110m000). One for the mandatory audited tables and one for everything else. In the parameter field you specify the path to the &quot;secondary&quot; db instance. I believe for this to work correctly if the db instance is on the same server as the primary db the secondary instance has to be a named instance.<br />
In the assign tables to database session (ttaad4111m000) you specify the company number for the tables you want to use the new db.<br />
Ultimately it all ends up in the tabledef6.1 file in {bse}/lib</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">12th June 2013, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, my only concern is how the setting of the named Instance should be set within the BaaN parameters, let us say that we have a server named BaaN, I have my default instance named mysql1, then i setup another instance and call this mysqlArchive, what should the actual System Name be set to and what should the Parameter setting be set to. What would happen if I add the instance name to the System Name field as opposed to the Parameter field?<br />
<br />
I just do not wish to damage my life system.<br />
<br />
Also, how would the usernames and passwords be linked to the new instance?</div></div><hr />
