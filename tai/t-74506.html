<br />
Would like to remove application locks for previous date, If I put the session (ttadv9298m000 - Remove Range of Application Locks) in job, it kills all the locks including today's.<br />
<br />
Is this bug in standard session? or is there any other way to solve this issue?<br />
<br />
thanks and regards<br />

I was wondering if you could run job at like 1 minute after midnight - then I would think most of the locks are from the previous day.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish could do it but &quot;they&quot; want me to run at fixed time i.e. 10pm.<br />
<br />
Just FYI, For me its Infor LN 10.5.<br />

thanks and regards<br />

Thanks Jaap.<br />
<br />
You are right, this is a bug in standard session. I am in touch with Infor but was looking quick alternative solution.<br />

<br />
Hope you have received solution. if not - you could write an script with set.timer() and trigger the session in AFS . and keep the cust. session running in server 24/7.<br />
<br />
so that the session is triggered at 10:00 PM. run the session at 10:01 pm for set.timer(86400000)</div></div><hr />
