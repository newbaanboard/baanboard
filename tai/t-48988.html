<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vktonk</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm implementing BaaN for a Saudi Arabian establishment. Requirement here is to have system accept field value in baan session in arabic e.g. customer name, description etc should be entered in arabic. No need of form, labels etc to be in Arabic.<br />
Actually the Arabic language is being set at the OS level. When keys- alt+shift is pressed the text language is set to Arabic. When the mode is Arabic, then in baan session, when user types text, the text being entered is not shown in Arabic rather system is showing some other codes/characters for the text entered. Although if we enter text in non baan application e.g. excel, the text shown is Arabic.<br />
<br />
how can i display the entered text in Arabic language?. Is this setting is set during installation of Baan?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Thanks markus. I have an issue related to multibyte installation. <br />
Actually in the new installation setup of BAANIvc4 with porting set 13, there is no multibyte locale for ARABIC. In single-byte there is option ISO_BIN6 for ARABIC. In case  i reinstall then which option is to be used?<br />
<br />
Any how in the current installation of singlebyte with ISO-8859-1, i changed the NLS settings to ARABIC in BW configuration. Then the system started showing right arabic text when entered, but it when i tried to print that same text using any device orientation of the words automatically changed.<br />
<br />
Please help whether i'm on right path if i continue to use single byte?<br />
Is there any way out to show date in arabic and right orientation of arabic words if i use current single byte installation ?<br />
<br />
And if single-byte  installation with NLS settings is not to be used then for multibyte instalaltion which particular option i have to use for the ARABIC?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
You need both the multibyte installation (so in your case a new installation) and the NLS setting in bw config. Additionally you need the right locale in the user setup. In my Baan system there is none for arabic, but you might contact baan support for this.<br />
<br />
So how do you get a mulitbyte installation? Baan simply asks you in the installation procedure. So this is actually quite simple.<br />

Thanks for your kind help. I've contacted the INfOR regarding showing the text in ARABIC. Multibyte installation is not supported for ARABIC.<br />
I've changed the NLS settings to ARABIC and found that now the baan is accepting and displaying correct arabic script and characters.<br />
<br />
But now the problem is that when the same displayed text is printed on any baan printing device, it is not showing correct arabic words.<br />
I have tried to change BWPrint settings for the font also to select arabic script. But the problem remains?<br />
<br />
Can u please help so that arabic text can be printed correctly?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

The problem has been solved. The solution steps are:<br />
1. Install database with collation designator:- Arabic<br />
2. Install baanivc4 with singlebyte installation with locale ISO-88596 for Arabic.<br />
3. If your system after installation is not showing all the Locales then download solution # 101830 Locale information.<br />
4. Change NLS settings in BW configurations to ARABIC.<br />
5. Add same locale ISO-88596 in Maintain Device Data.<br />
6. Install solution # 118733 for BW Print settings.<br />
<br />

I have got new problem now... I 've installed new test server with database collation designator - Arabic and single byte installation with arabic -ISO88596locale as Multibyte-Installation for Arabic is not available. Now when a baan report is being printed on this server, English data is not printed properly, and there is also problem in report layouts etc. <br />
My simple requirement was to have arabic data to be printed correctly as in English locale ISo-88598-1, the arabic text was displyed correctly when NLS settings are being changed.<br />
<br />
Please help me as INfor has told me that they have no solution for printing arabic text. Infor has confused me with this.....<br />
Is there any wayout so that both arabic text and English text are displayed and printed correctly?<br />
<br />
We will be entering Arabic text in few of the descriptions and reference fields.<br />
Around 90% of the work will be in english.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
