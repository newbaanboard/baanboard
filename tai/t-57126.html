<br />
I'm currently at a customer's site. They switched the system (HP UX) to unicode some days ago, and now printing to files (Printer ASCIF and similar) became terribly slow. The ttstpshell shows the ttstpconv process consuming a lot of ticks. It also shows the session and the report itself are done with processing. Printing to display also works fine, so the issue seems to be with ttstpconv.<br />
<br />
I could find nothing on the Baan support site. Do you have any ideas?<br />

what do you mean by switching to Unicode? Have you converted Infor LN to Unicode? What DB are you on?<br />
<br />
We are just in the process of migrating our 5.0c to ERP LN.<br />
The OS is AIX. The LN-Installation (FP5) is a Unicode Installation on Oracle 10g.<br />
We had some issues with oracle specific problem of collating (problems with segmented domains ). There is an Infor Solution (221481) for that problem.<br />
<br />
I just did a Test:<br />
Printing all Sessions of package tc with all options ticked to ASCIF device takes about 30 sec for a generated file of approximatly 3.5 MB.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
The environment is still not optimized regarding performance.<br />
