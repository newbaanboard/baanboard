<br />
There is big bug with bdbreconfig6.2 job of this porting set : fatal error, impossible to reconfigure. According to baan support there is no solution for this bug, they only propose do downgrade to 7.1c.<br />
<br />
this bug is present on all platefroms.<br />
<br />
So if you have to upgrade your porting set, upgrade to 7.1c instead of 7.1.02.<br />
<br />
After some discussion with support they send us a 7.1b version of bdbreconfig6.2 program, so i think that bug is also present in 7.1c portingset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">5th December 2001, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I am running Baan 5.0b on porting set 6.2a.03.03<br />
There are several problems which as always will be solved by a porting set upgrade (I remain gullible).<br />
<br />
The main reason for wanting to migrate though, is our wish to upgrade Oracle to 8.i which according to the tech notes is compatible with porting set 7.x (however, Baan Global Support tells me it is not....I am remaining calm).<br />
<br />
Reading the tech notes on 7.1c.02, I notice in the small print that Safari is replaced by Crystal reporting. Although that in itself is probably a good thing, they could have made the announcement a little more prominent. Yes, we are using Safari, and yes, we have several custom Safari reports that would have to be re-developed (Not to mention the fact that the Crystal software of course needs to be purchased, etc.....I still remain more or less sane)<br />
<br />
Looking for a way out, I turn my scope on porting set 7.1c. Safari intact, compatible with 8.i (maybe), and suited for 5.0b.<br />
Well...that is, as soon as I upgrade our tools module to 5.0c first.<br />
Another issue that gets a full one-liner of attention.<br />
<br />
So how the *&amp;^&amp; am I going to upgrade a tools module?<br />
<br />
That was a retorical question. I am sure I'll find the answer, but this upgrade is becoming a royal pain in the lower back and I needed the vent.<br />
<br />
Is there anybody out there who attempted this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though the question was indeed the rhetorical, the intro that led up to it was in my opinion good for alot of chuckling for those not involved :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Commandeur,<br />
we had the same problem with bdbreconfig in Porting Set 7.1c.02.<br />
Baan-Support told us just to copy bdbreconfig6.2 from Porting Set 7.1c.<br />
Solution will be delivered soon. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess what?<br />
<br />
The ONLY 7x portingset compatible with 5.0b is now 7.1c.02.<br />
<br />
I am sure that is not what they told me before. Oh well.<br />
<br />
When I ask Baan for clarification on the Safari issue, they tell me that it is &quot;strongly recommended&quot; that we switch to Crystal.<br />
<br />
That is fine, but strongly recommended does not mean &quot;No way, no how will you make that piece-a-junk reporting tool work anymore&quot;, right? If I run it through the Baan interpreter, it comes out as &quot;You're on your own, buddy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Another thing, in SP11 they already replaced the Safari FRS by the Crystal FRS. And currently Safari is still happily bringing down my system performance.<br />
<br />
I am going to take the plunge this weekend and spend my time on ground zero, trying to get this baby up and running.<br />
<br />
One question to those of the congregation who already installed 7.x. Do any of the script extensions change? i.e bdbreconfig6.2 remains bdbreconfig6.2 and does not change to bdbreconfig7.1? That would be one load of my back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The script extensions stay the same ---</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Commandeur</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan support did send us the 7.1b version of bdbreconfig6.2 and it works now very well. We have done 3 complete reconfigurations with it. So it seems that it works well with a 7.1b version of this program and a 7.1c.02 version of the rest of the program.<br />
<br />
Solution come directly from PEG so i think they know what they do.<br />
<br />
But we have asked for a &quot;final&quot; solution... (Ã  7.1c.03 version?) :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Commandeur</div><div class="date">12th December 2001, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Support told me that solution will be included in version 7.1c.03. So it means that there will be a 7.1c.03. But i expect that they will deliver some solution for 7.1c.02 too. We don't want to migrate porting set each month!</div></div><hr />
