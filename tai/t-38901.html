<br />
I have a strange situation where I get error 215 when starting certain sessions with few logins. But I do not get the error when I start the same session(s) with few other logins.<br />
<br />
What I was doing that time when users got the error:<br />
========================================<br />
1. I was importing a patch without asking users to logout of the system.(A MISTAKE)<br />
2. Did create runtime (some users were still working with the system) - hope it should not be a problem)<br />
3. Did reconfigure tables<br />
<br />
Did anybody come across this situation any time ? What might be the reason? What should I do to resolve this? <br />
<br />
Please share if you had faced the same problem.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Refer to the different threads with Tools patches and Porting Set info for this error code on the Knowledge base at the Baan support site.<br />
<br />
Tables reconfigures should be done without the users online, so you avoid the table/records locks by users/processes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason could be as u identified ur mistake of reconfiguring table online . Errors due to this will get rectified with logout / login . If it still comes , check the error logs / event viewer  for more details and analyse the same .</div></div><hr />

<br />
NEVER - install solutions, portingsets, or reconfigure tables with users on line</div></div><hr />
