<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">15th February 2011, 13:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Our licences are about to expire (message: license will expire in 13 days). I created new request and hope will get new license key in a few days.<br />
But before I get a new key I have problem with jobs. Every job requires intervention to continue to work after it get message about expiration of licenses.<br />
Is it possible to avoid this problem?</div></div><hr />

Once you get a key for it do NOT forget to change the licence6.1 back to itself so you can complete the revalidation process. Otherwise, you have to keep monitoring your jobs or put them on hold and have someone manually run them.</div></div><hr />
