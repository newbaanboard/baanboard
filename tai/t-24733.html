Start already on this one (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=6372&amp;highlight=citrix+client) for example</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the response.<br />
Perhaps you couls answer this question-<br />
We have hundreds of pc's (running NT &amp; XP) located across 2 sites<br />
If we install the citrix client on some of our PC's &amp; these pc's still have the Baan client loaded, will a user be able to choose to run Baan from either the Citrix client or the client located on his pc?<br />
<br />
How would you stop a user the client on his PC &amp; force him to use Citrix?<br />
Is there a way of doing this without deleting the client from the PC?</div></div><hr />

As yet, this product has not been certified so we cannot install it on our desktops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marine</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">since you want everyone to use the citrix connection - and you controll the BW client on the citrix server - change something about the bshell connection that would in effect &quot;shut down&quot; all of the BW clients installed on everyones PC.</div></div><hr />

You need to install a utility in any pc through which you can restrict some applications in all the PCs of your network.</div></div><hr />
