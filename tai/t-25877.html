<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gigaman</div><div class="date">13th December 2005, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, baan IV supports multi-language, but does not support more than one multi-character language at one time. For example, a large Japanese company has a lot of companies where separately locate in Japan, Korea, Mainland China, and China Taiwan. The company want to establish just one baan application server in Japan headquarters for managmental reason. So it needs the perspective software can support Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and English at the same time and at the same server. We know Japanese, Korean, and those two kinds of Chinese are all multi-character languages. So, I think it is impossible through baan iv to reach customer's goal. Is it right?<br />
<br />
PS. All users want to see the baan screen by their mother language.<br />
<br />
Another two questions,<br />
1. If it is impossible through baan iv, how about baan v or ssa erp ln?<br />
2. If it is impossible, why? I think it is not a very difficult thing to realize it.<br />
<br />
Any replies will be highly appreciated.<br />

This is possible in the LN tools with the latest Porting Set 7.6b (released last week) and the new Feature Pack-2 (expected to be released by end of Dec'2005).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This morning, I asked a baan expert from ssa, who told me baan began to support unicode since ln. Unicode supporting enables supporting more than one multi-character lauguages, for example, Japanese and simplified Chinese, at the same environment.<br />
