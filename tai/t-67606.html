<br />
When they click on &quot;Edit Text...&quot; it does nothing.  However, long-standing users on other computers have no problem.<br />
<br />
And on their computers, under my credentials, I have the same problem.<br />
<br />
So it appears to be some sort of local issue on the computer itself blocking Baan from invoking Notepad and allowing the user to edit the texts.<br />
<br />
I have tried using Baan profiles in local and public modes without success.  This has left me completely baffled and frustrated.<br />
<br />
I'd greatly appreciate the assistance of anyone who knows this section well enough to know what permissions may be missing on the local PC that would block text editing.  And whether there's any way of preventing this issue in the future.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th April 2015, 22:24</div></div><div class="posttext">When our company changed the baan install they had to push out new permissions to the program files/baan/tmp directory.  The standard install did not include write permission to this directory.  Not sure that is the solution, but it is something you can check on the new ones.<br />
<br />
Of course I am assuming you have these users setup with the same text permissions as the older users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phydeux</div><div class="date">10th April 2015, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe I've given everyone the same text permissions, but with the rather disjointed permissions system in Baan I'm not entirely sure.  Could you direct me as to where to look for such permissions so I can be sure which I need?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Mark said, check the file permissions on the client machine. <br />
<br />
If on windows, set full permissions to the temp folders, baan folders, program files folder, and check if you need to explicitly set permissions for notepad.exe which is in Windows folder under C drive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">12th April 2015, 03:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We had similar issue when moving from XP to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Main thing is to allow Authenticated Users Group full permissions on the folder equivalent of C:\Program Files\BAAN\tmp - not sure if I have the path correct here.<br />
<br />
Also, if your System Administrators refresh the Windows Group Policy by a 'push' then you have to get the folder permissions included in that Group Policy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phydeux</div><div class="date">13th April 2015, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the tricky bit.  We're using the Infor version of Baan and I can't find the tmp folder properly.<br />
<br />
The BECS executable is at: C:\Infor\ERPLN\commonx86\bin\becs.exe<br />
<br />
The public config file is at: C:\Users\Public\Documents\Infor\BW\Baan IV\config<br />
<br />
But there doesn't seem to be any tmp folder anywhere.<br />
<br />
However, on my computer I found the tmp folder at: C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Infor\BW\Baan IV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th April 2015, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I am thinking when we first went to windows 7 we had problems getting the programs to use a tmp folder in c:\users.  We had them change the rollout to create tmp folder in the same location as the baan install directory - plus give the users rights to that directory.  If your machine works for text you might want to setup another user like yours.  It just seems to me(and this was many years ago) there were a couple of things that just had C:\install path\Baan\tmp directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phydeux</div><div class="date">1st May 2015, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">After talking with Infor support we found that the folder missing was C:\Program Files (x86)\Infor\BW\Baan IV\tmp.<br />
<br />
I believe this is because public users don't have permission to add folders under Program Files folders, so when Baan tries to create the folder for the user when they hit &quot;Edit Text&quot; its blocked from doing so.  But that's just my educated guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">11th May 2015, 04:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Did INFOR have you to adjust the permissions on the tmp folder?<br />
<br />
Even if the folder exists, unless the user has full read and write and delete permission in the tmp folder, text management will silently fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phydeux</div><div class="date">12th May 2015, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the issue is that when you use the public profile from the Infor launcher and the users aren't administrators, Baan doesn't have the permissions required to add the tmp folder.  And since it's not created at installation in the version of the Infor installer we're using, that's where the problem stems from.<br />
<br />
So we've mitigated the problem via a GPO that manually adds the folder to each new computer added to the network.</div></div><hr />
