<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">12th February 2003, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
we would like to customize our tiitm0101m000 &quot;Maintain item data&quot;<br />
<br />
We found an object in &quot;B40S_b2_con&quot;. According to our sessinfo this object is used.<br />
<br />
We have also a CD with Baan sources, from which we can encrypt our sources, if we provide a password.<br />
<br />
But on this CD is only a &quot;B40_b2&quot; version of this source. With help of the ID's we found on the object from &quot;B40S_b2_con&quot; and the encryted Source that the source is older than the object.<br />
<br />
Now I have the following questions ?<br />
<br />
1. Is it normal to find a part of the &quot;itm&quot; module in a controlling VRC, or should there be a problem?<br />
<br />
2. If realy necessary, should Baan be able to provide us with the source? If yes, why they didn't provide the source via the &quot;Source-CD&quot; ?<br />
<br />
3. What means the &quot;S&quot; in B40S_b2_con ?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
Spartacus</div></div><hr />

<br />
using youre problem:<br />
<br />
Inlcude function is copied up and modified in the &quot;B40S_b2_con&quot; layer to fix something.<br />
<br />
Then all scripts that use the Inlcude function are re-compiled in &quot;B40S_b2_con&quot; (without copying up the source script).<br />
<br />
The result is objects in the &quot;B40S_b2_con&quot; layer that now use the fucntionality of the modified Include Function.<br />
<br />
To see if this is the case with youre object, look at the vrc's of the include functions that are listed via the sessinfo report. You will prob find one present in the &quot;B40S_b2_con&quot; layer.  If not then maybe its an Include Function used by an Inlclude Function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if I understand right, you think that there is perhaps an include in B40S_b2_con, which is changed. Then they compile all scripts which use this include in there origin vrc ? <br />
But I think in that case you shouldn't have an object in a VRC where is no script. The object should be in the same vrc like the script.<br />
<br />
An other thing: in the sessinfo I found the ID's in object of B40S_b2_con  more up to date then the ones in the delivered source (hopefully noone forgets to add a &quot;start of xxx&quot; in an include).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">13th February 2003, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">To clarify the include will be modified in B40S_b2_con, then you would compile the objects in the B40S_b2_con layer.  This then creates the objects in B40S_b2_con layer so that the modified Include fucntionality is present in the object(s).  Meanwhile the program script source(s) is still only in the B40_b2 layer.<br />
<br />
This may not be the case in youre problem. But this does happen.</div></div><hr />
