I was going to install the weekly collections.  ( I've never done the weekly collections before.)  Do I need to download and install for each week, or does the latest collection have every solution up to that point?<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">24th September 2002, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">you can better install SP10: no download time since available on CD after installation of weekly dumps you will be up to date, but SP10 will not be installed also SP11 already available weekly dumps do not have that high quality standards as a service pack has: SP has been tested and known bugs have been eliminated; weekly dumps may include solutions for known bugs from several weeks back (in the mean time: you can have a problem) a SP installation is well documented (pay special attention to pre-requisites) a SP installation needs only one time RDD for tools / application; patch objects etc, where when installing weekly dumps this may be more frequently needed</div></div><hr />
