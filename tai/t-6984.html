<br />
When trying to set up company parameters, can't because of no Group Company and no transaction types.  Can't set up Group Company Parameters and Transaction Types because no Company Parameters.<br />
<br />
Get a warning on the Fiscal Period but seems to accept 0000 as an acceptable year.<br />
<br />
Also gives warning on Group Company but accepts Company Number (901).<br />
<br />
Have run Intitialize Parameters successfully.<br />
<br />
Am using B40c.62.  Any suggestions?  Don't want to resort to table maintenance unless absolutely necessary.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Did you create the new company from &quot;scratch&quot; or did you create it from a dump?<br />

The company was created from scratch, all files empty.  I can get into Company parameters but can't get into Group Company Parameters or Transaction Types.<br />

Im primarily finance, not tools, and Im running on memory gasses because its been a while since Ive set up a test co from scratch instead of from a dump. <br />
<br />
To create a new finance company (in Baan IV), the basic sequence of following sessions is:.<br />
 ·	Maintain Companies (ttaad1100m000 <br />
 ·	Maintain Table Directories (ttaad4115m000) <br />
 ·	Maintain Logical Tables (ttaad4120m000)  optional.<br />
 ·	Convert User Data to Runtime Data Dictionary (ttaad4200m000) <br />
 ·	Create Tables (ttaad4230m000) <br />
<br />
I assume the above were done correctly since you are past this point.<br />
Next:<br />
 ·	Maintain Company Data (tccom0100m000). <br />
 ·	Maintain Company Parameters (tfgld0103m0000)  but you cant enter values in any fields requiring master data such as ledger accounts &amp; transaction type. <br />
 ·	Maintain Group Company Parameters (tfgld0101m000) <br />
 ·	After these sessions, the other parameters and master data for BAAN Finance can be entered.<br />
<br />
I assume that you entered data in Maintain Company Data (tccom0100m000). When you first run Maintain Company Parameters (tfgld0103m000), the Group Company number should default to the [new] finance company and you should be able to save without going to any fields requiring finance master data. <br />
<br />
Im working blind (not looking at a system and my notes are offline) but if the Group Company field is hanging things up, you may be able to Maintain Group Company parameters from the special menu. If not, try to run Maintain Group Company Parameters separately to create the Group Co parameters before saving the company parameters. <br />
<br />
You should not need to enter a transaction type (Curr. Diff. Transaction Type) but I did hit this wall before. In that case (Baan IV-b2), there were additional problems due do customizations that the client had implemented. I had to get around it by entering a transaction type via GTM. <br />
<br />

<br />
The more that I think about it, in the case I mentioned, I did have to insert a &quot;blank&quot; record in Group Company Parameters via GTM. I was sure that our &quot;catch-22&quot; was due to the client's customization of Maintain Company Parameters. <br />
<br />
As an expedient solution, GTM worked fine. It was just a dummy record and all field maintenance was handled via the standard sessions. So if you only want to get the test company off the ground &quot;now&quot; and sort out what went wrong later...<br />
