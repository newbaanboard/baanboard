Suppose I had installed a solution (say A) thru PMC that in turn contained about 400 dependencies, and I wanted to uninstall everything afterwards....what would be the best way to proceed? <br />
<br />
Moreover, if I try to proceed top-to-bottom in order of installed dependencies or vice versa, some of the dependent solutions do NOT change to &quot;To Uninstall&quot; status....they continue to remain &quot;Installed&quot; even after running &quot;Check to Uninstall&quot; on them.  Am I missing something somewhere? Can PMC provide me with the &quot;roadmap&quot; to uninstall?<br />
<br />
Would it best (and easiest) to just restore application and tools objects and tools data (pmc) from backup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">17th September 2003, 12:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I never tried this... because why would one want to uninstall solutions...<br />
<br />
Print solution history...<br />
see what solutions are installed during the update.<br />
<br />
Select some of the early solutions with &quot;check to uninstall&quot; and uninstall whatever is allowed.<br />
<br />
BTW, you did &quot;Save Components&quot; on installation did you not?<br />
<br />
And next time: use your test server / BSE ... / Update VRC and test before releasing solutions to production...</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few clarifications.<br />
<br />
1) We have of course, done this on the test server. <br />
2) Components are all &quot;Saved&quot; <br />
3) Yet when I try to uninstall the solution's dependencies, it does not allow me to do it. (It merely uninstalls the solution itself...not the associated dependencies that were installed with it - and on trying to uninstall the dependencies individually, it does not allow me to do so)<br />
<br />
Please do not ask why I want to uninstall....various reasons can be attributed to uninstalling a solution (for e.g., it may mess up some other functionality)....else Baan wouldn't have provided the functionality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Uninstalling is merely a panic reaction... if then you find that it does not work the way it should / you expect, then you will choose for a restore of backup: this wil be much quicker...<br />
<br />
On the other hand: downgrading can never be a solution. It is a temporarily workaround. Better is to determine the causes of the problem and then solve them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In BaaN 5.b there isnÂ´t a VRC of &quot;tt&quot; and this can be the problem to desintall them.</div></div><hr />

You need to think on the reverse of the installation. If A was dependent on B, if you uninstall A, B will be left. If you uninstall B, then A will be selected to be uninstalled.<br />
<br />
Now, the process of installation may not be so straightforward as that, if a solution is not going to uninstall status, check the uninstall report for a cause. You need to find the solution that did not went to uninstall and run an uninstall on it first, and keep repeating the process untill all are uninstalled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There could be 'n' no. of reasons to uninstall the solution. I will possibly try to explain 1 of a practical example which we too face.<br />
<br />
lets say u r having some issue with a particular functinality or u r facing a bug in baan session, and BaaN suggested u to install solution &quot;Y&quot;, now via pmc when u installed solution &quot;Y&quot; it brought &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;, because these were the dependancies.<br />
<br />
Now after testing the functionality u found that actually even after this installation u r still facing the bug, so baan suggests u to install solution Z which doesnt have any dependancy &amp; it solves ur issue as well.<br />
<br />
So in this case,why would u like to keep/install solution &quot;Y&quot;,&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot; into PRODUCTION Server when they r not serving any purpose to u ??? <br />
<br />
Hope this clears ur doubt.<br />
<br />

<br />
A baan solution w/o dependencies? you're living in a dream world!! :D<br />
<br />
seriously though, it's fairly unlikely that you'd run into your example. because at some point Baan has to touch the session you're seeing the problem in<br />
which will cause the dependency.<br />
<br />
Since 2003, when this thread was active, Baan has implemented PMC &quot;Runs&quot; which will allow you to uninstall all solutions for a particular PMC run. I know it's on by default in LN and it may be a licensed utility in Baan 4/5<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">The Installation Run functionality is available in Baan4, 5 and ERP LN. For Baan 4 and 5 it is added in solution 139594. In LN it was present just from the beginning. Session ttpmc2503m000 shows the Installation Runs and you can decide to uninstall all solutions that were installed together in one run.</div></div><hr />

If any one is sure that along with solutions, dependecies can also be removed and system can be cleaned then kindly share the same, I will be highly thankfull ...<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

Did you tried the session ttpmc2503m000 suggested by Jade in this post ?? Although i havent got an oppurtunity to try this session , but looks like this might solve the issue .... :)<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for the prompt reply :)<br />
<br />
Due to system and time unavailability I can not check it by the time being, but I will check it out and if it helps then nothing is better than this... :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
