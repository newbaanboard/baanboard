<br />
We have a old version of Baan (Baan 4b2) and it is extremly customized. We contact Baan (Infor) to get new Baan porting sets (3 to 4 times a year). Because we are in a highly customized and old version of Baan, we do not get any other support from Infor.<br />
<br />
My question to you is, What benefit does installing Baan porting set buy us ? what happens if we dont go for it i.e. we never do another Baan porting set installation.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have experience or thoughts on the above. Greatly appreciate your input and feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
If you don't upgrade the os and portingset and don't have run into bugs you could keep the environment like it is right now.<br />
<br />
At a certain moment you will need a newer portingset if your rdbms is no longer supported or if you migrate to a new server with a newer operating system. <br />
<br />
However don't give up your support contract. If you don't have support you will not being given a new license key which you need if you are going to migrate to a new server!<br />
