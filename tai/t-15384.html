<br />
We are currently at Baan IVC4 SP13 on HP-UX 11 environement running on an Oracle 8 database. You previously outlined the steps below but we are unsure on the initial steps to install the Italian localisation.<br />
<br />
The CDs we received from BaaN for this are<br />
<br />
(1) BaaN 1Vc4 Master for Unix (BD0024.2805)<br />
(2) BaaN IVc4 Update for Unix (CD) incl Italian localisation (BD0024.2427)<br />
(3) BaaN IVc4 Update for Unix (CD) incl Italian localisation (BD0024.2429)<br />
(4) Service Pack Batch Installer for BaaN IVc4 up to and incl SP12 Unix (BD0024.2474)<br />
(5) Service Pack 13 for BaaN IVc4 for Unix (BD0024.2813)<br />
<br />
Current Structure<br />
B40U c4 stnd 			    Derived From       B40  c4 <br />
B40L c4 cnt0 			    Derived From	     B40U c4 stnd <br />
B40C c4 IRA                       Derived From       B40U c4 stnd  <br />
B40C c4 IRC                       Derived From       B40C c4 IRA     <br />
B40C c4 IRD                       Derived From       B40C c4 IRC   <br />
 <br />
<br />
Explanation :<br />
<br />
IRC is our main package combination , customisations at this level. We have some control extensions as it is , e.g. cnt0 derived from B40U c4 stnd We don't use B40C c4 IRA, but is part of our derivation structure B40C c4 IRD is for development.<br />
 <br />
Basically, with SP installations , we have a documentation on what is required, Italian localisations are part of this. We hoping for instructions on setting up with Tools Baan Italian localisations similar to the cnto extension above.<br />
<br />
What should we do?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">20th May 2004, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">You should have a document in the italian localisation CD explaining all steps and what should be a propper VRC/PC chain, depending on your needs (if italy will use or not cnt for example). Italian VRCs will be B40L_c4_itl0 and update B40U_c4_itl0.<br />
<br />
From a tools point of view you need to:<br />
- create the italian language so that you can have all labels, domains, etc. in italian<br />
- create the VRC's and PC's (and corresponding update ones) and import the italian dumps (there's a tt dump that contains the specific italian tools langage components) <br />
- setup PMC to cope with the italian layers<br />
- start applying [all] the SP's for italy - you also need to apply the langage SP's for each corresponding SP after each SP: RTDD needs to be run for the italian layers only so, online for other countries.<br />
<br />
Look for the doc in the italian CD's for more details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you say makes sense, we currently do not have an English version of the Italian Localisation document. Do you know where can I get this.<br />
We logged a case with BaaN on this but are still waiting for feedback<br />
<br />
Once I get documentation, I might comeback to you with some more specific questions on the installation steps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">21st May 2004, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the doc is solely in italian - don't recall anymore when I did the same because I can read italian - I think each country localisation doc. is written on the corresponding language.<br />
<br />
Anyways, even if it is in italian it should be more or less straightforward to understand the steps, or you can paste the text in an online translator to get a better idea when it's not so clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rochus</div><div class="date">22nd May 2004, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">victor is right for the way to do that.<br />
<br />
in my installations i did setup the itl0 parallel<br />
to cnt0, derived from U_c4_stnd.<br />
as i remember, there was written something in the installation document to do it in this way. i will search for <br />
the document (english).<br />
did you check baan-page (documentation) ?<br />
<br />
do you use cnt0-extension (controlling) ?</div></div><hr />
