Hi ,<br />
Nowadays during  installation of baan the databse needs to be installed separately (SQL,DB2,ORACLE,INFORMIX)<br />
Earlier there was a database  TB , which was used to come with baan software only.Can  anyone tell me  whether the TB databse also needed to be installed separately or there was used to  come by default (like the orcale database is inatalled by default while installing oracle apps)  .   If some body like to use other database (INFORMIX/SQL ETC), the database needs to be cloned from oracle database<br />
Thanking  you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">1st September 2004, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan IV on UNIX tbase is part of the Baan product and therefore installed by default. But tbase was and is not supported for Baan in Windows platforms.<br />
<br />
So if you install Baan on Unix, you have the option to directly install into tbase, oracle, informix etc. In the case of tbase, Baan will install the actually database binaries and the database data files by itself. In case of the other databases you have to install the product yourself and create the database files before installing Baan.<br />
<br />
For Baan on Windows it is a bit different. Tbase is not an option. You have to install the data base product first yourself and then Baan. For some databases Baan is able to create then the data files automatically.<br />
<br />
In my experience, the windows case depends a lot on the date of your installtion CD. I tend to install into SQL Server (because that always works well) and then copy the data to my actual target database.<br />
<br />
I know, the situation is a bit of a mess, but that's the way it is.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />
