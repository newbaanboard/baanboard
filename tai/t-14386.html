<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an issue with an external appliction that requires one baan license to run. This external application will only use the license when the application sends data to baan. We have this application login using a specific user id. How can we keep one free licence always available for this extrenal application?<br />
Currently, when there are no more licenses availble, the data sent is lost. It holds it in the buffer, but this accumulates too high that it crashes the external application.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In your case, you would direct all users to a script that references the licensedaemon and will start a bshell only if the number of available licenses &gt; 1.<br />
The other application can then be directed directly to the bshell, where there will always be a scrumptious license available for it to consume.<br />
<br />
Of course the more obivous answer would be &quot;add more licenses&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 03:51</div></div><div class="posttext">How is the script executed? Does this happen as they try to login?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, ipcboot will start whatever script or executable is defined in ipc_info.<br />
<br />
By not directing the connection to the bshell executable but to a custom script (say mybshell.ksh), you can run a series of test before an actual bshell is started.<br />
<br />
In your case, the rough version would look like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
#!/bin/ksh<br />
# mybshell.ksh<br />
# wrapper script to test available licenses<br />
# this script is called by ipcboot<br />
<br />
USEDLICS = $(licmon6.x -u)<br />
AVAILLICS = $(licmon6.x -b)<br />
<br />
# the above will not work, its just to give you the general idea!!<br />
<br />
if (($USEDLICS &lt; AVAILLICS - 1)) then<br />
    ${BSE}/bin/bshell6.x $*<br />
else<br />
    print &quot;No more licenses available.&quot;<br />
fi<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure there are already several other threads on this subject. Do a little searching for more ideas on how to tackle this problem.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

rather than paying for more licences, take a look at <br />

www.closeidle.co.uk (http://www.closeidle.co.uk) <br />
<br />
CloseIdle will help you make the most of the existing licences by timing-out idle users after a pre-defined time.  It can also prevent multiple Baan logins per PC.</div></div><hr />
