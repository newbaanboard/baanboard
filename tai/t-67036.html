Are you sure that you have all your data in the table?<br />
Perhaps something is wrong with the indexes?<br />
<br />
With bdbreconfig -N ttdpu041170+ you can redo the reconfiguration however that will load the data again. If it has changed in the mean time you can't do that.<br />
Check with your database software if all indexes exist.  If not that you can create them with gcommand.</div></div><hr />

I can simply checked the indexes for tdpur041170 between live and test system for tdpur041170, but didn't find out obvious question.<br />
maybe I need to check more indexes, it's not easy for me.<br />
