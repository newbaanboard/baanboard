Thanks for the reply, but that dint worked.<br />
<br />
It was rwt for .oracle folder, then we have changed it to rwx but the problem is still there. And it is the same error as Error 13546 during creating table ttaad000.<br />

Any other inputs please?<br />

Maximus has a point we also faced with that error and after adding oinstall to user's group set the issue was solved. Try it and let us know if the problem is solved?<br />

presently  we are facing a new problem.. we are able to login in oracle database using a windows client but if i try to login thru root user under unix i get error ORA 01034 and ORA 27123.  same error I get when I install baan or execute ora8_inst6.2.  <br />
<br />
In this envoirnment we are having around 10 databse running some on oracle 9i some on 10g. and our DBA has installed oracle 10g we were not involved in that so I dont know what all permissions are missing from root user. <br />
I think root does not have some permission to go to database. <br />
<br />
What if I install baan on a different server and install  oracle client on that server and acess this oracle server from this new server basically prepare a 3 tier architecture. wot r ur thoughts plz share and wot all i need to do this ...<br />
<br />
during baan installation or while running ora8_inst6.2 it asks whether database is local if i give it remote it asks for sql*plus service name then it does not ask for oracle home and sid. can i do that way?? <br />
<br />
but it ask oracle home and sid while gathering information for company 000 and others wot should i mention there???<br />
<br />
thanks <br />

Hi<br />
I could install Baan at last.<br />
We had so many errors during installtion.<br />
let me explain all errors and their resolutios.<br />
<br />
1. baan was not able to create oracle users baan,root and bsp because sqlplus was not available to user root and bsp. so we set the envoirnment variables.<br />
<br />
2. now user root was not able to login to oracle thru os user root and bsp. giving ORA user 01034 and ORA 27123 so unmounted the filesystem and mounted it again with suid option.<br />
<br />
3. now user bsp cannot login to oracle thru OS sqlplus. because in BSP .profile ORACLE_HOME had extra last /. we deleted extra last / and started listerenr again. it worked.<br />
<br />
no we could start sqlplus and login to oracle. <br />
<br />
4. Now we got error ORA 17205 NLS value not specifed. we set the NLS_LANG parameter in .profile of root.<br />
<br />
5. now users are created in oracle and installation started but then it gave error BDB 402. checked log and found NLS characterset value of database and OS user root is different. so we changed the NLS_CHARECTERSET of database to the User character_set as per DB_RESOURCE.<br />
<br />
6 Then we got error (I forgot the no.) but in log it sayas index tablespace not in database. and foundout that table space is not same as in database because of string length. so changed ORA_STORAGE and ORA_STORAGE_PARAM and all the files where tablespace is specified.<br />
<br />
after that we could start and finish our installtion...<br />
<br />
I thank all of you guys to help me...<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Gaurav</div></div><hr />
