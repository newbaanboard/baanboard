<br />
We stop and start our Baan system every week and reboot the server regularly. Luckely printing is not a problem; can anyone explain to me how this is possible? <br />

In the program field of the devices we use something like: lp -c -dp15 -n%d -s %s. Where lp is the Unix print command.<br />

<br />
The printer daemon in baan is used for two things:<br />
<br />
a) If a printer is of type &quot;Printer&quot;, then the printer daemon actually forms the unix command needed for printing. If the type if of type &quot;direct&quot;, then the command is directly configured with the printer.<br />
<br />
b) The printer daemon checks, whether temporary print files in $BSE_TMP exceed the &quot;delete delay time&quot; (configured in user management of baan) and delete files accordingly.<br />
<br />
In a lot of installations the printer daemon is disabled, because it was buggy for a long time and took too many system ressources.<br />
<br />
As long as you clean up your $BSE_TMP with other means, then you do not need the pdaemon at all.<br />
<br />
Is it not nice, that a whole daemon might be down and Baan keeps on working?<br />
Try to kill shmtimer6.1 and see what will happen ...<br />
<br />
<br />

if [ ${licd_pdaemon} -eq 1 ];then<br />
        ${BSE}/etc/rc.start_pdaemon<br />
fi<br />
<br />
and everything worked well after that.  The reason I changed rc.start (and possibly the reason it not used at your site) is the original pdaemon stop script did not work and therefore rc.stop would not finish (# of attach eq 1).</div></div><hr />
