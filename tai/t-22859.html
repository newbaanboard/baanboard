<br />
After adding a few new fields to a table I need to run the session &quot;Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary&quot;.<br />
<br />
By doing this the following error comes up:<br />
<br />
&quot;Cannot reconfigure files; domain / table definitions must still be converted to runtime dd&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried &quot;Create rdd&quot;, same error!<br />
<br />
What can I do to convert the table to a new dictionary?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help,<br />
<br />

<br />
It is possible that you were too restrictive in the selection range and that there are really domains and tables that need to be cnverted first! <br />
<br />
Follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1-run Convert to RDD again without no selection, that is over all packets and tables with &quot;domains=yes&quot; and &quot;tables = yes&quot; and with reconfigure tables set to &quot;no&quot;.<br />
<br />
2-Leave Baan and login again. Make sure you are the only user who is logged in!<br />
<br />
3- Run Covert to RDD again run same as above but this time set &quot;reconfigure Tables set to &quot;yes&quot;.<br />
<br />
This time reconfiguration should start!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In your case, you have some outstanding conversion from some old changes, and Baan refuses to convert your current change to runtime, before completing the old ones.<br />
<br />
The cleanest approach is to perform a create runtime over the whole package and this will sort out the issue!<br />
<br />

<br />
P.S.: As an alternative, you can search for the runtime indicators tables (several ones) in the tools and delete the entries manually!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is, this is the live system and I can not guarantee to be the only one on the system, because the system runs 24x7 with always someone working with the system.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone can remember another trick for fixing the problem. We have had the same problem some years ago and we were able to fix it by cleaning some tables. But I can not remember the tables :-( <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help,<br />
<br />

<br />
check out these tables in company 000: <br />
<br />
ttadv500 and 501: runtime indicators<br />
ttadv503 and 504: restart indicators (if bdbreconfig fails)<br />
<br />
If everything is converted, then they should be empty. So Emptying them might help you!<br />
<br />
There is also table ttadv502 with a similar name, but I do not know the detailed use of that one, so I would not touch it!<br />
<br />

<br />
thanks for your help. I' have cleaned up the 4 tables and I've tried to convert again ==&gt; still with the same error. <br />
<br />
I think there is another lock somewhere. I checked all the tables I know and the filesystem as well. <br />
<br />
Do you have another clue?<br />
<br />
Thomas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">17th January 2005, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">there is definetly nothing in the filesystem stored in this regard.<br />
<br />
the &quot;Create Runtime&quot; might set an application lock, but the error message should then be different.<br />
<br />
You could try to execute the session with a DBSLOG (look in the baan help or here on the forum for it) to see, which tables are accessed, just before the message comes!<br />
<br />
Actually I was pretty sure, that the four tables are your problem. Strange.<br />
<br />
The DBSLOG should answer that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan knows which Tables and domains need to be &quot;Converted&quot; by looking in the Table ttadv502. If you manually change a domain or a table definition these will be registered in this table (also all other tables that refer to the table which is changed). You can look for the entries for your package combination, write it down or make a sequential dump of the table and the delete the entries for your package combination.<br />
<br />
After &quot;Conversion&quot; Baan writes the table names that need to be &quot;reconfigured&quot; in ttadv501.</div></div><hr />

Thanks to you two! Now it works after cleaning table 502!<br />
