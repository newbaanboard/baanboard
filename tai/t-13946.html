<br />
Assuming that I have loaded BaaN IV c4 with SP9 with which I am quiet satsified, but in some sessions where I face problem , &amp; I get the suggestions that I should load sp10.<br />
 <br />
But i don't want to load it in my Live system , my question is can i make a new vrc in which i can load sp10 ?? or service packs supplied by baan can only be loaded in Standard Update pvrc only ??<br />
 <br />
because when i open PMC and clicked on zoom it showed me only Standard &amp; its Update VRC to select. Is there any alternative or suggestions if anyone has faced the similar sort of problem. <br />
<br />
Main aim is to keep sp 10 and sp greater than 10 distinct from my live environment.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sure you can do that.. You just create a new update VRC for your SP 10+ stuff, then you link your test company to the package combination that has those VRCs.<br />
<br />
One thing you can't do, is test tools solutions, so for example if you install SP10 into your Test Update VRC, you'll have on SP10 tools and SP9 application. <br />
Not that big of a deal, but its something to keep in mind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th December 2003, 08:11</div></div><div class="posttext">As Dave said , u can do this technically but good amount of time will go in creating and maintaining new VRC and package combinations. At the same time tools patches can not be reverted. You will need to have separate VRC combination and need to do separate testing of customization if any (for modified components).<br />
<br />
The reason why you wish to do such thing is because either because of customizations or due to fear that new SP's will create new problems .  Further if u upgrade to SP10 then there may be suggestion to upgrade to SP11 or to latest SP14.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to study the release notes of all later SP's (upto SP14) , check and understand the affected functionalities and affected customization , get list of affected components , decide on extent of testing required , create a complete plan for upgrade of SP's  and porting set.<br />
<br />
Though this may look more painful but in the long run it will help you a lot and eliminate redundant environment</div></div><hr />
