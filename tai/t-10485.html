Has anyone run into the problem where tables are being dropped using session timrp1210m000 (as it should when running it Regen) but not recreated.  Its not consistent and there is no pattern I can see.  Baan solution was to upgrade from porting set 6.1c.06.03 to 6.1c.06.07.  But I have not seen anything in the bug fixes that addresses this problem.</div></div><hr />

delete of all the records, but the c4 one<br />
does a drop and re-create of the table.<br />
<br />
The problem we had was that we ran with<br />
a very small ora_storage (Not able to create tables <br />
on the fly). You need to check<br />
that the user that run the timrp1210m000 session<br />
is able to create the tables in question. <br />
<br />
If not then check it out. <br />
<br />
What we did in the end <br />
was changed the source to do deletes from the tables<br />
and not drops.</div></div><hr />
