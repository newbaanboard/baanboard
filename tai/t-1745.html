<br />
Has somebody an idea how to get the mouse support work in the debugger from every PC?<br />

Thanks<br />

Check the version of the users where it is working and install the same one on the PC's where it is not working, otherwise upgrade to a recent version.</div></div><hr />

You just need to upgrade to the newest client as mentioned above. (i am on B40.c62 which works fine)<br />
