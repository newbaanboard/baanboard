<br />
I have a question regarding server/infrastructure. We may be using one of the generic configurations below for our Baan service in the future.<br />
<br />
I would like your opinions on the the 'pros' and 'cons' of the following configurations :<br />
<br />
1. Physical Three Tier - Database server, Multiple Baan Application Server, Clients running on independent hardware.<br />
<br />
2. Logical Three Tier-  Database and Multiple Baan App running on the same hardware with logical partitioning. Client still on seperate hardware.<br />
<br />
3. Physical Two Tier - Database and App running on the same server ( no partitioning ). Client still on seperate server.<br />
<br />
The application build is :<br />
<br />
Oracle 8.1.7<br />
Baan IVc<br />
AIX 5.1<br />
<br />
It may be that some of you out there have experience to share on these configurations ( and maybe others ! ), any information will be appreciated. I suppose I am looking for any 'icebergs' that may sink one ( or more ) of the options.<br />
<br />
Just to kick things off, briefly, here are my thoughts ( doesn't take long ! )<br />
<br />
1. <br />
Pro's<br />
- hardware resilience, if an app server fails then switch to next app server.<br />
- software isolated ( Baan app will not directly impact Oracle app and vice-versa ).<br />
- maintenence on individual app servers no problem while still meeting service level.<br />
Cons's 	<br />
- cost ( multiple servers ).<br />
- performance not as good as option two and three.<br />
- additional maintainance cost.<br />
<br />
2.<br />
Pro's 	<br />
- logical resilience in terms of partitioning ( app and database still seperate ).<br />
- lower cost in hardware terms than first option.<br />
- performance improvement on first option.<br />
Con's<br />
- service at risk due to single point of failure.<br />
- performance may not be as good as option three.<br />
<br />
3.<br />
Pro's	<br />
- performance probably best of the three.<br />
- cost likely be the cheapest and simplest to implement.<br />
- maintainance likely to be simplest.<br />
Con's<br />
- single point of failure possible.<br />
- Oracle app and Baan app having adverse affect on each other.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be welcome...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I found some other things to worry about:<br />
- Growfor the coming future. It is (maybe) easier to extend a client, but is the server still able to handle the workload?<br />
- Needs the failover system to be capable to handle the whole workload during a failure?</div></div><hr />
