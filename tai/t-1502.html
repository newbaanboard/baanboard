<br />
We have a BaanIVc2 installed on AIX unix server and on Oracle 8i database, we want migrate to BaanIVc4, can some one help me find the difference between c2 and c4 and also the documentation of migration from c2 to c4 also we have customized some of the Baan standard reports in BaanIVc2, what would be the impact of the migration on the changes we have done.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Sant.</div></div><hr />

There are some new tables, some new functionality, but that is the most basic change.<br />
<br />
I guess you aren't in a European country (otherwise you would have migrated already). So you won't need the Euro functionality. <br />
(In that case you MUST review you customizations, otherwise they will do wrong calculations during some stages of the Euro conversion).<br />
<br />
Get advice from an experienced Baan consulting company in your neighbourhood. Your migration will be mostly a technical one. So, you don't need business related consultancy. But still, please don't do the migration on your own - you will save money now, but costs will come later, I'll promise. System consistency can be guaranteed best by experienced technical consultants, who have done some migrations before. It should be a matter of days, not of weeks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 00:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We migrated few time ago from c3 to c4. We had some problems, basically concerned with multi-site and integration functionallity. We had to change our compnr configuration (logical tables) because in c3, all integration master data had to be defined in the same origin company; in c4 it must be defined in the delivery company. If you do not use multi site, your ploblems will reduce a lot, but, it depends.<br />
<br />
Although you say you are running c2:<br />
<br />
- How many patches have you installed?<br />
Sometimes 1 patch change the functionallity, so, in my opinion, your BaaN version is c2, but it can be c?.<br />
<br />
The path we followed in migration was:<br />
<br />
Two machines, the working one and the second for new installation.<br />
<br />
1.- In second machine, installed, OS, Database SW, and third BaaN.<br />
2.- Validate licenses in second machine. <br />
3.- Create in machine 2 a new PVRC specific for your migration, put here your c2 DD and existing c2 companies, and then change companies to the new c4 PVRC.<br />
4.- TEST ALL YOUR ACTUAL FUNCTIONAL PROCESSES. We did it defining a set of tests, very complete, and users did the tests. Then you will have the problems, analyze them and do the tunnings to your customizations, etc...<br />
5.- Users stop working. And repeat the steps to put data in the second machine.<br />
6.- Users get in real in the second machine.<br />
<br />
Time depends basically in the dimension of your data and in the problems you find in users tests.<br />
<br />
This was a short description of our experience,<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are currently in the same project phase as you were.  We are converting from c2 to c4.   We are looking at doing it ourselves, using baan support as a guide, vs hiring a consultant.   Did you complete the conversion?  What kind of major issues did you encounter?<br />

<br />
We talked to baan support about it and did not feel confident about this subject, hence we are still with B4c2 but for sure one of these days in future we would do that.<br />
The main concern is about some customization done here, also there seems to be lot of table changes in C4 ( thats what baan said ) and to convert all that would be a very long process and might want to do it in a test system first etc etc... so we are still with C2<br />
<br />
Please let me know how it goes with you.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Sant.</div></div><hr />
