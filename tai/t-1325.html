<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Our finance department runs two different baan reports seven times each (two reports for each of our seven divisions).  I have set them up to run in Job Managment, but I will need to re-create the job each month because the report's selection criteria will change each month (ending period and year).  Is there any way to update the selection criteria?  Or will I have to continue creating a new batch job with 14 detail jobs everymonth?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use relative dates in your selection criteria, that might help: e.g: +60 means +60 days from system date.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you can hack into the selection data that is stored in table ttaad503 (Job Input Variables). But be careful when using GTM!</div></div><hr />

We had a similar issue to you, where by the period for a financial report needed to be changed that was run by a job.<br />
Instead of using GTM to change the ttaad503 table, we wrote a session that queried the job id and allowed the parameters to be changed. This meant the job itself never had to be cancelled, updated and placed back in the queue.<br />
One thing to watch when changing the values in this table, is that the first part of a parameter indicates it's length, therefore something like 019cuno.t:=&quot;ZZZZZZ&quot;, the 19 is the length of the parameter. If your parameter is a period, then the size can vary, as a period can either be single or double digit. For example<br />
016period.f:=&quot;2&quot;, would become 017period.f:=&quot;10&quot;. the 16 changes to 17 as we have an extra digit. <br />
<br />

<br />
Would you be able to e-mail me some of the code so that I can take a look at how you queried the job id?</div></div><hr />
