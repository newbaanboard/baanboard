Characters are still OK displayed in Notapad which is default editor, but Baan has problems in interpreting them ...<br />

On the side of clients, there is 88592_win32 as is on Windows printer devices, and until SP8 it works fine ...<br />

Perhaps you can find your specific error message on the site of BGS and download a solution for it. Otherwise, I'm afraid you've got to register a case at BGS for your specific problem, so they can come up with a proper solution.<br />

Good luck!<br />

To make the long story short.<br />

Notepad is default editor for texts:<br />

I write  in Notepad -&gt; when I look in Baan what I wrote (In Notepad) it looks like  (OK) -&gt; when I print it - BW print doesn't recognize font  and prints Error<br />

I don't want to stand still waiting for Baan solution - it can be for a month or three;<br />
Can I change font mappings for CP1250 - Baan 88592_WIN32<br />

It seems ridiculous to me that a solution could take up to three months, especially regarding the fact that similar problems already have been solved by BGS.<br />

<br />
 Case 951459 - Error messages while copying text<br />
Product tt7.3a Last Modified / Sol. Proposed: 19 Jul 2002 /06 Jun 2002   <br />

Case description: <br />
When we are copying text from a windows application to a BaaN text windows we are getting some error messages.<br />
<br />
sometimes the copied or appended text is not saved.<br />
<br />
Is there any problems with the way BaaN handles text conversions or limitations.<br />
<br />
please clarify.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Solution description: <br />
<br />
VERSION(S): all<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:  text conversion<br />
<br />
ATTACHMENTS:  n/a<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
Error in TSSwc_width: Can't convert TSS character <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
When copying from a Word application into the 'Baan Editor' or Notepad editor inside of Baan, you may experience this error. There are some special characters created in Word that when pasted to a different editor cannot be converted. One suggestion is to setup and use Word as the external baan editor, which should allow the pasting of Word text. The other alternative is to save your text externally in Notepad and then copy it to whatever Baan editor you are using. <br />
<br />
<br />
I hope it helps...</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, this isn't our problem.<br />
<br />
I was talking with some peoples around in neighbouring countries;<br />
<br />
Our problem is in converting local characters from Windows to Baan and from Baan text editor to Windows.<br />
<br />
The same problem have all Countries in our part of Europe which have and use local character set.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is that this mistake is imported in sistem With service pack 6 or 7;<br />
<br />
Before that, we worked without problems ...<br />
<br />
Why is so hard go get back - I don't know ?</div></div><hr />

read Solution 101830 from BGS (latest locale information), and install the latest locale information. (On server AND client)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem cannot be solved ...<br />
***********************<br />
<br />
I have to say again:<br />
<br />
We hadn't that problem before - on the same Wins, on the same HW, on the same Baan IV &amp; on the same BW clients.<br />
<br />
PORTING SET OR SERVICE PACK BROUGHT US THAT PROBLEM<br />
WHICH IS NOT ONLY FOR OUR COUNTRY, BUT FOR MOST COUNTRIES IN THIS NEGLECTED PART OF SE EUROPE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">10th February 2003, 07:38</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem will be solved in next portingset 7 for B40Cc40.<br />
<br />
It will not be tomorow, but maybe next ...<br />
<br />
Thanks everybody for help and support.<br />
<br />
There is a solution in Baan KB which explains problems<br />
(If someone is interested tell me and I will find it ...)<br />

But...<br />
After installation of porting set 6.1c.06.07 and installation of solution there is no luck for us.<br />
<br />
There is still same problem<br />

My first posting of that problem was on 03. 10. 2002.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andrew.page</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 10:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We have the same problem.<br />
<br />
What is really strange is:<br />
<br />
When I run a report to screen in Spanish I get the special characters.<br />
<br />
When I run to screen in English I get the special characters.<br />
<br />
When I run a report to file, or notepad in English I get all the special characters.<br />
<br />
When I run a the same report in Spanish, the special characters are removed (making extracts pretty useless).<br />
<br />
This was OK untill we installed the latest software solutions and porting set.:confused: <br />
<br />
This doesn't seem like a good move forwards by BaaN.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any more ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 11:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Just sit and wait ....<br />

(Seems to me, Baan developers do that too on this topic)<br />

:(</div></div><hr />

It was not mentioned as part of the BaaN solution 101830 which I installed to update the TSS tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andrew.page</div><div class="date">4th June 2003, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">We have now fixed the problem in Spain.<br />
<br />
In BaaN solution 131939 ther is some small text not included in the special instructions:<br />
<br />
Enter the following line in $BSE/lib/defaults/all to define that resource<br />
use_mbtextconv:1<br />
<br />
This only applies to porting set: 6.1c.06.07 and above.<br />

our consultant did it also on Baan test server <br />
<br />
In both cases - it didn't solve our problem.<br />

<br />
1. Install porting set 6.1c.06.07 (biggest step)<br />
2. Create file $BSE/lib/defaults/all in which has to be one raw;<br />
    use_mbtextconv:1<br />
3. In Maintain user data change locale to ISO_BIN2<br />
    (not so small step for every user)<br />
4. Do the same change (like step 3.) in Maintain device data.<br />

Via ttaad4100 ,i have token a look to the tttxt010 table to analyse the content of the &quot;infected&quot; text lines. :p <br />
The ttaad4100 application have generated the same bshell message previously displayed in BW, but i was able to modify the bad line by deleting  :eek: some curious foreigns characters sequences :eek: <br />
I think that the problem source was due throught a Copy-Paste operation from a user in BW. :)</div></div><hr />
