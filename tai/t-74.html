<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anybody know of a way to print a Baan PO incorporating a company logo? We want to fax PO's straight from Baan. I know that you can buy products like VSI for Baan. But before we spend vast amounts on fax solutions I want to look at standard Baan funcionality. <br />
<br />
I have read on the baanfans.com that you can print your PO to html format which doesn't work for us as we have lines and boxes on our PO layout.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?<br />
<br />
We run B4c4/HPUX/Oracle805<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have programmed their HP Laserjet printers in which they store forms. Within Baan they have changed the reports that they send a macro to the printer resulting to print e.g. the PO on the predefined form. <br />
<br />
Hope it helps,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkorst</div><div class="date">27th August 2001, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use BWPRINT to print a logo on a form.<br />
<br />
You must have the logo converted to a font.<br />
<br />
What you need to do is put a new field on the form, I use just a letter (first letter of the company name).   Assign this field to a user font (example user font 1).   Compile the report.   Run the session but when the device selection comes up be sure and select print preview.  When the preview displays right click and assign the user font that you selected for the field to the font of the logo.   From then on whenever a session is run from that PC user font 1 will be assigned to the logo font and print correctly. <br />

Hope this helps   Debbie</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">28th August 2001, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Debbie I'll give this a go. A couple of questions:<br />
<br />
1. What do you use to convert the logo to a font?<br />
<br />
2. Are there any limitations that you know of when converting the logo?<br />
<br />
I didn't realise that bwprint had this funcionality. You learn soemthing new everyday!! These forums are becoming very useful<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkorst</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm checking with my client on what they used to convert their logo to a font.   I believe she used some software that she downloaded from the internet.   Should have a reply today.<br />
<br />
You can also use BWPrint to change fonts on the form.   Headings bold or larger  ect.    I have also used this to print barcodes, and those funny bank numbers at the bottom of checks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkorst</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">They went through their publisher and had the logo converted from a bitmap to a TTF file.     I'm sure there's some software that can do this, but I don't any off hand.   Maybe you can check with whoever designed your logo.<br />
<br />
Once you get it as a TTF file you will need to install that font on the PC.   Control Panel, Fonts, install font.  Then when you do the print preview with BWPrint it should show up on the list of available fonts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me know if you figure out how to convert it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several freeware/shareware/comercial programs that will allow you to create/convert logo's into True Type Fonts (TTF).<br />
<br />
A fast search on &quot;create true type font&quot; on Google showed one that may be usefull: http://www.high-logic.com/fcp.html<br />
<br />
It is shareware or something, allows you to convert bitmaps into glyps - then to True Type Fonts - but have a look (I will :) )</div></div><hr />
