<br />
<br />
We wish to migrate huge amount of transactional data such as Production orders , Sales order lines and Purchase orders and receipts from legacy system to ERP Ln6.1 FP3<br />
<br />
We wish to know which is the best way to do that , we are aware of Exchange schemes but not aware wether we can effectively use them for the above purpose . <br />
<br />
Any suggestions are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks A lot in Advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when we migrate the transactions from legacy,<br />
<br />
we take the opening balances like stocks, acr/acp and introduce them.<br />
<br />
And for the history like sales, purchase we directly upload the tdsls050/051 tables using exchange scheme or a script as required.<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks A lot for the information. Can you share your experiences of using exchange schemes for migrating the huge amount of transactional data like sales and purchase orders , production orders and warehouse receipts. Are there any pitfalls <br />
<br />
Thanks A lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">31st January 2008, 07:18</div></div><div class="posttext">The pitfall with using exchange schemes for migrating purchase, sales, and production orders are the changes warehousing functionality, and the complexity of the data transformation.  I am not aware of anyone who has used exchange schemes for migrating dynamic data (not to say that no one has...).<br />
<br />
Typically we use exchange schemes when someone wants to migrate master data (business partners, items, etc...) and start over from a transactional standpoint.<br />
<br />
I know this doesn't help much, but migrating dynamic/transactional data via exchange schemes can be a large undertaking.<br />

<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for the information, this was precisely what I too was wondering about. I thought may be with introduction of DAL concept in ERP Ln6.1 , many people must be using exchange schemes for migrating transactional data.<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks a lot for the info, seems like we need to explore other methods (Not Aware of any) for migrating transactional data like Warehouse receipts and Production WIP. <br />
<br />
Thanks once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">31st January 2008, 08:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor does have a migration tool that has pre-built rules for the transactional data.  However, it usually requires that you use a consulting firm that is an Infor partner.  I've had varying levels of success with it.  Most companies want it customized extensively, and to use it in ways it wasn't intended to be used, so there are potential problems there.  However, the logic behind the tool is pretty solid.<br />
<br />
DAL may work decently for open orders, but I am not sure about historical orders.  I'm not sure how the DAL would behave if you try to insert, say, a closed sales order.  Worth exploring, though...<br />

<br />
Thanks A great lot for the information. One question - can this Migration tool of Infor be used to Migrate transactional data from a legacy system to ERP system and secondly if so can this tool also take care of Customised tables and table fields.<br />
<br />
Thanks A Lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">31st January 2008, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Exchange can be used to fill tables, and with the use of the dals, the fields will be validated so you have correct information.  The problem is with the Business Methods.  For example, you want to put in a completed Purchase or Sales Order and it's history.  You could view the purchase order, and even the receipt, but when you went to link to the transactional data for finance it would not be there unless you tried duplicating ALL the transactional history.  The Business Methods update many of the tables in ERP.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a data warehouse to store this information, consider duplicating the Baan tables as custom tables and create inquiry sessions.  This will give your customer service (or what ever area) the ability to see the data within the same system without going looking all over.  You can even join the tables for custom reports and not invalidate the business rules of ERP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gem_infor</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 03:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi William ,<br />
<br />
Thanks a great lot for the valuable information. We are considering the use of exchange schemes only for migration open transactional records , such as open production orders , open SO , so on. According to your information the use of Exchange schemes for such purpose should be ok.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to admit, I misunderstood your question.  I thought you were trying to convert history, not your open orders. For your open orders, exchange is a way to go. Create new order with the remaining open quantities using exchagne. There is alot you can do with exchagne that they do not teach in the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I concur.  I thought you were looking for historical (closed) orders to be migrated.<br />

<br />
Thanks A lot - Vince and Williams , You have provided me with great insight into use of exchange schemes . Now I will go ahead and use the tool for migration of open orders.<br />
<br />
Thanks once again.</div></div><hr />
