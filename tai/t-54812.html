Any assistance would be awesome. I am new to BAAN and just want to verify backups until we get a new admin for the application.</div></div><hr />

We are running SQL agents and getting good backups nightly.<br />
If we had to restore BAAN are these files needed or would we have them from our regular back up process.:confused:<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is another way to restore, restoring or recreating your application, and restoring the info from this files with baan sessions, in a productive system, from my point of view this is the very last option.<br />
