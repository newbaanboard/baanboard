<br />
what I would like to do is automate a company dump and reorganise tables followed by inmporting to a test company.<br />
unfortunately this uses TT and I cannot run jobs on TT.<br />
<br />
Is this possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why cant you run jobs on tt?<br />
Is it a security policy in your company?<br />
<br />
I run several tools jobs on a weekly basis.<br />

<br />
are there any other setting that I would need that would be different to normal job execution?<br />
<br />
is it also possible to automate ascii sessions?</div></div><hr />

The BaaN super user would be attached to the Tools company. Just create the job, schedule it and activate it, through this user.<br />
You plan to use Reorganise Tables, so make sure that there is enough space in the tmp folder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if it happens with you but, the user baan is normally used to do some tech/admin work and its settings change a lot in terms of  package combination and company...<br />
<br />
I think it is better to create a new user just to do jobs in company 000. Call it job000 for example. Another advantage is that, if necessary, it will be easier to trace what is done by a job....<br />
