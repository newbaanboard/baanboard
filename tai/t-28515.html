It does not, however, work when trying to run from the command line in the BW Client.  csh works but ksh does not. It just hangs.</div></div><hr />

Verify that nothing is in your path called ksh.  You might even what to try putting the complete path in when running the ksh.  You can always start a csh and run &quot;which&quot; on ksh to see what is running.  You can also try launching the ksh from the csh to see if it has problems.</div></div><hr />

not a really &quot;shell&quot; it gives you access to some unix commands (like ps) however it's very limited. (intentionally)<br />
