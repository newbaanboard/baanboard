I am using a superuser of sharepoint that can also login to LN to setup and test but cannot get past the[validate] credentials stage.<br />
<br />
I have tried to setup various sharepoint sites and/or doc stores and keep getting the same error (attached) - reason HTTP failure: Forbidden<br />
<br />
It basically doesn't matter what I put in for user/password, even users that don't exist give the same error.  In the username field I have tried<br />
- username<br />
- DOMAIN\username<br />
- username@domain.com<br />
<br />
Nothing in the documentation indicates how to enter user details.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
