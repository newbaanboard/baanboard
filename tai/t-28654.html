<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newtobaan</div><div class="date">13th November 2006, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
<br />
Need some basic help on the import session.... <br />
<br />
I have got a dump from a vendor, which I have been asked to import into our test / development system. The dump.l file looks like this: <br />
<br />
ptdslsl101                          B40Cc4itl0 (with source)<br />
ftdslsl101m00n16                    B40Cc4itl0<br />
ctdgen0000     2                    B40 c4<br />
ctdgen0000     6                    B40 c4<br />
ctdslsl101.01  6                    B40Cc4itl0<br />
ctdslsl101.01.c6                    B40Cc4itl0<br />
ctdslsl101.02  6                    B40Cc4itl0<br />
<br />
So it contains a number of standard components. My question is when I import these into my customised VRC using the session ttiex1285m000, will Baan copy all the standard components into my customised layer. So I will end up with all these standard components as customised? <br />
<br />
Any help or tips will be very much appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
BG</div></div><hr />

Thanks,<br />

Just not sure if I import this dump that I got containing the standard components as well, will the standard components get imported into our customised VRC :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">14th November 2006, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">You should check if you have those standard components.  As a vendor, we never send out a dump containing standard components, so maybe if you have those components already, you should ask for a new delivery.<br />
<br />
Technically, where they go when you install them depends on how you answer that check box for:<br />
Write software components in other Package VRC<br />
If you say 'Yes', and usually you do, it will put all components into your custom VRC.  If you say 'No', you may get them updated in the standard (if it does not throw the 'not authorized to change the standard' error, not sure).  But you will also then get the custom components in a VRC called 'B40Cc4itl0', which you may or may not have named exactly the same on your system.</div></div><hr />
