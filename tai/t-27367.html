Error 506 (Table does not exist) on tfcmg000001 in db_eq(delayed)<br />
<br />
I have dumped table tfcmg000 from the live company and imported it into the test company. However this does not seem to have solved the problem.<br />
<br />
Do any of you know what other methods I should try to resolve this issue?<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Check the $BSE/log logfiles using the ls -ltr command to sort the logfiles in order of last use. From the logfiles often information can be retrieved to locate the specific problem.</div></div><hr />
