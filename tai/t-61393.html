<br />
We are resetting up BaanIVc4 on Windows 2008 R2.<br />
<br />
On our current Baan-system, with Windows 2003, our job users are local users (user exists on Baan-server only).<br />
<br />
Under Windows 2008 we would like to work with job users as domain users.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if this works?<br />
Any problems or restrictions?<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

The two biggest issues I can think of are making sure permissions are correct for the domain user and either setting the password not to expire or making sure you coordinate the password changes correctly so you don't have jobs stop running suddenly.</div></div><hr />

We are on 2008 and are using scheduled tasks and it has been a PITA getting them working consistently</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">31st October 2011, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Gary, it takes a lot of configuration and testing to get schedule jobs to run correctly. However, I would discourage anybody to use the job daemon. Not suitable for multi-company configurations and you think scheduled tasks is PITA, once you have a problem with Job Daemon... better just move quickly to start scheduled tasks. Infor has not maintained job daemon for the longest time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi Gary,<br />
<br />
On Windows 2008 we want to setup all jobs with the task scheduler, at the moment we still have a few jobs that use the baan job deamon.<br />
<br />
If you have any tipps on getting jobs to work with scheduled tasks, please let me know!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

We tested the first jobs, and all seems to work fine.<br />
<br />
As under Windows 2003, it is important that you store the password of the Baan login-configuration while logged on to windows with the job user.<br />

<br />
we us a domain user to schedule and start all our Baan Jobs, which works fine.:D The only problem we have is that the jobs do not print using the windows server printer. Manually starting the jobs works but with the scheduler the session &quot;hangs&quot;. Someone familliar with this problem?:mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the printer that you use a printer that is installed locally on the Baan-server, or one that is installed on another server (e.g. on a printserver)?<br />
<br />
We had several problems with printers installed on a separate printserver, under windows 2008 this does not seem to work well, on 2003 it does.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

<br />
thx for your reply. We print to a seperate printserver. :D<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the things that we noted: if you have Windows 2008(R2), a printer that is installed on a printer server, and a 32-bit porting set, each print job starts a windows process that runs for a certain time (default 2 min.), and then blocks other print jobs for some time.<br />
<br />
I would highly recommend installing printer drivers directly on the baan-server, in that case all seems to work fine.<br />
<br />

<br />
solution 1043194 did the trick for us. We are on Windows 2008 R2, SQL server 2008, baan IV c4. Our print server is also windows 2008 R2. We use a domain user which starts all our jobs form the Task Scheduler. Everything works fine now. :D:D:D</div></div><hr />
