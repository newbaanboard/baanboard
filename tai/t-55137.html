<br />
We are in the process of migrating BaanIV from HP-UX and Informix to IBM-AIX5.3 and Oracle9. <br />
<br />
On executing the bdbpost6.1 command we are getting error 521 (This indicates that shared memory has not been loaded)<br />
On starting the shared memory the error changes to 515 (This indicates a license error; probably an unpatched binary)<br />
<br />
In the new environment, the Baan application and database will be on different servers. <br />
Environment variables that have been set are are:<br />
<br />
BSE=/eubaan02/app/bse<br />
ORACLE_SID=EUBAAN2S<br />
ORACLE_HOME=/baanCNLRDD01s/app/oracle/product/9.2.0<br />
TNS_ADMIN=/var/opt/oracle<br />
oracle_client_home:/user/app/oracle/product/9.2.0<br />
<br />
<br />
We have performed the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Copy the Baan application from source server to target server. <br />
  All Baan directories have been copied (application, dict, lib, bin, etc, tools ...)<br />
<br />
2. Export the 000 company on source server in pipe delimited form and copy the dump to the target server.<br />
<br />
3. Porting set has been upgraded to 6.1c.07.15<br />
<br />
4. The tabledef6.1 file has been updated as<br />
*:000:oracle8(ORACLE_HOME=/user/app/oracle/product/9.2.0,ORACLE_SID=EUBAAN2S):N<br />
<br />
   We have also tried with the tabledef6.1 as<br />
*:000:oracle8(TNS_ADMIN=/var/opt/oracle,TWO_TASK=EUBAAN2S.world):N<br />
<br />
5. $BSE/etc/* files have been modified to reflect the change in BSE location<br />
<br />
6. ora_users, ora_groups and ora_storage files have been created as follows:<br />

Did you validate Oracle database (commercial function t062)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">24th February 2009, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">There are unfortunately several error in your procedure, some of them are related to the problems you see, some of them will show up errors later.<br />
<br />
a) Do not use pipes as seperator for dumping company 000. Baan stores in some tools tables the form/report/menu layouts in binary format, but in String fields. These fields get corrupted if using pipe as a seperator.<br />
At best use a big dump or if you need seperators use &quot;^a&quot;.<br />
<br />
b) You need to change the licence6.1 file to point to your local host.<br />
<br />
c) You need to execute session &quot;Patch objects after system crash&quot; in tools-&gt;SW installation-&gt; misc to get rid of your old validation<br />
<br />
d) You need to revalidate your system by getting new codes from Baan<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
Small addition: above might also be your problem, in case you did not have Oracle on the HP-Ux already. In this case you might be forced to first upload the data of company 000 to tbase, validate your system (including oracle) and then move to Oracle as a DB.<br />
<br />
From which DB platform are you coming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayushk</div><div class="date">24th February 2009, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot for your responses.<br />
<br />
As suggested I have changed the licence6.1 file to point to the local host. The earlier errors (515, 521) are not coming.<br />
<br />
Now on running bdbpost, I get the error 510 (This indicates that the database has not been started. Start the database to correct the problem). <br />
<br />
The database is running. From the application server, I can connect to the database (located on another server) using SQLPlus. Please advise what parameter specification, I might have missed.<br />
<br />
I have also started the dump of the 000 company without the separator.<br />
<br />
The database on the source server is Informix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">24th February 2009, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, if you were running informix before and did not have oracle licensed, then you should still get that unpatched binary error. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, at least your tabledef is also wrong. In your first posting, you specified:<br />
<br />
ORACLE_HOME=/user/app/oracle/product/9.2.0,ORACLE_SID=EUBAAN2S<br />
<br />
This is wrong, because this means the DB is locally. Or:<br />
<br />
TNS_ADMIN=/var/opt/oracle,TWO_TASK=EUBAAN2S.world<br />
<br />
This is wrong, because no Oracle Home is specified. You need to combine the two!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayushk</div><div class="date">26th February 2009, 07:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again for you help. After changing the tabledef6.1, bdbpost has worked. The tabledef6.1 entry that worked is:<br />
<br />
*:000:oracle8(ORACLE_HOME=/user/app/oracle/product/9.2.0,TNS_ADMIN=/var/opt/oracle,ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME=EUBAAN2S.world):N<br />
<br />
Now when we log into Baan and try to run any session (including patch objects after error solving), we are getting an error &quot;Can't read session or object&quot;<br />
<br />
In the log file log.bshell the message logged is &quot; bdb_errno 111 (No record found)&quot;<br />
<br />
I have checked for the location of the application components and permissions.<br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">26th February 2009, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
can you post the complete log.bshell entry? Maybe there is even more than one?<br />
<br />
I guess two things might happened:<br />
<br />
a) You did not copy the complete bse<br />
b) you changed the installation directory<br />
<br />
There might be other reasons, but it is all guessing.<br />
<br />
Are you using the ASCII or the GUI interface?<br />
<br />
Markus</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issues have been resolved. <br />
<br />
The import of table ttadv999 was not proper. So exported and imported it again using ^a separator. After that I was able to patch the system and bring it in demo mode.<br />
<br />
I have created the data companies and the import non tools data is now being done.<br />
<br />
Greatly appreciate your inputs.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayushk</div><div class="date">3rd March 2009, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We have to migrate 4 instances of Baan. 3 of them have been migrated successfully and are running in demo mode.<br />
<br />
For the 4th instance, when trying to log into baan (ba6.1), I am getting the error &quot;You have no license anymore to start the bshell!&quot; In the licence6.1 the entry is &quot;localhost&quot;. This is the same in other instances.<br />
<br />
I have checked the $BSE/log files and there is no message logged.<br />
<br />
Please advise. Please let me know apart from licence6.1 what files/tables are referred by Baan for licensing purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">3rd March 2009, 09:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you execute session &quot;Patch objects after system crash&quot; in tools--&gt;SW Installation-&gt;Misc on that instance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayushk</div><div class="date">3rd March 2009, 09:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not able to log into Baan. So cannot execute session &quot;Patch objects after system crash&quot;. (I did that for the other instances).<br />
<br />
One difference that I can see is that only in this instance in the path $BSE/lib/tbase there are the following files:<br />
reginfo.bdt<br />
reginfo.bid<br />
tbase_open<br />
tbase_param<br />
tbase_reg<br />
tbase_tp_param<br />
<br />
In the other instances the files present are:<br />
tbase_open<br />
tbase_param<br />
tbase_tp_param<br />
<br />
I am not sure if the error is related to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">3rd March 2009, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Log into one of the working instances. Get the sessioncode and start baan directly with the session code.<br />
<br />
Do all this in the ASCII interface and life will be much easier.<br />
<br />
Whatever you have on tbase has nothing got to do with your topic (most likely).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayushk</div><div class="date">3rd March 2009, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again for your help. With &quot;ba6.1 session code&quot; I was able to log in, patch the application and create the company tables. Data upload for the companies is now is process.<br />
<br />
With this, the pilot phase of the migration is drawing to a completion.<br />
<br />
The thought of trying &quot;ba6.1 session code&quot; had come to me but I did not try it thinking that the license error would come.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how is it that &quot;ba6.1 session code&quot; option by-passed the license error that was coming.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the help provided.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">3rd March 2009, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually that specific session is outside the normal licensing behavior and can always be started.<br />
<br />
In historic times you could start ba6.1 always and it would show you at least the menu (after giving a license warning). This way you could go to the session the normal way.<br />
<br />
This behavior seems to be changing from Portingset to Portingset. In the GUI it never worked. Without the licenses the GUI does not allow to start the menu.<br />
<br />
All in all a bit odd, but that how it is.<br />
