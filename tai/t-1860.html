<br />
when exporting data dictionary from session ttiex1280m000 with selecting 'export based on sessions'  nothing comes into the dump.l  file . <br />
And when I don't select 'export based on sessions' everything what I want comes except the sessions .  I am writing the ranges of sessions , reports , scripts , tables ,  and everithing I need and I can see them all except the sessions  in the dump.l file . is this normal. <br />
<br />
What is the best way to transfer data dictionaries from one server to another.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Also the &quot;Only comps of package itself&quot; option.<br />
<br />
When I export and want everthing in &quot;tc&quot; I set the update to yes and pick the compared VRC to the one directly below my current derived VRC (where exported comps live).  I also set the &quot;Only comps of package itself&quot; option to Yes.<br />
<br />
It should be the same options if based on sessions.</div></div><hr />

                     I think Iam too late in answering your question regarding the export of Data dictionary. But its only this day that saw ur post. Anyway I would like to share a few points which I know regarding &quot;Export of data dictionary&quot;. May be this would help you in future.<br />
<br />
     1. In your case if u want sessions to be included in dump.l file then &quot;Delivery session from status&quot; should be developing. If its finished then most probably you may not find any session inlcuded in dump.l  This is because most of the sessions which we use will be in developing status.<br />
<br />
     2. If export based on sessions is checked, then only those components which are attached to the session are exported and not the rest of the components.<br />
<br />
Hope above points will help you.</div></div><hr />
