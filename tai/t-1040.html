<br />
I have installed Nt Server service pack 6.0 with ie 5<br />
then installed and successfully started sql server v7.0<br />
<br />
then when i try to install BaaN after the programme files have finished loading i get a dialogue box with the following message<br />
<br />
This is the top line of the dialogue box OLEMAINTHREADNAME 'REGSVR32.EXE<br />
<br />
this is the error message within the dialogue box<br />
the ordinal 6466 could not be located in the dll mfc420.dll<br />
<br />
then i click okay and the next thing that happens is that the system says that it is loading the tables and stays at 1% 0 of 183 estimated time 0 minutes and does nothing else<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any clues as to where i have gone wrong with the installation<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
 I suggest you should reinstall everything but in this order:<br />
 <br />
 NT Server, NT SP3, IE4.01, NT SP4, NT SP5, NT SP6a, <br />
 IE 4.01 SP1 (it is as a prerequisite on the CD with SQL Server 7)<br />
 SQL Server 7.0<br />
 Baan Application<br />
<br />
 Be sure you have a good Master CD !!! (a newer one) It is also important not to install directly NT SP6a. Microsoft says it should be OK but it is not !!!<br />
 <br />
 It is not a good idea to have IE5, since if brings a new mfc42.dll  and Baan Installer does not &quot;like&quot; new things... (for example Oracle 8i...)<br />
<br />

I did re-format and re-install everything this time but i did change the event viewer (system)  size to 2048 and overwrite as necessary the same as application and although i got the error message it installed fine and now works just dandy<br />
