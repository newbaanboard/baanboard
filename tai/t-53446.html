<br />
We are planning (it is a first for our IS services) to move to ERP LN 6.1 from FP1 directly to FP3 in the coming weeks, I have the Difference Study and Admin Guide.  A number of invidual patches/solutions have been installed since 2006<br />
<br />
However, would someone have a set of instructions or documentation on how to proceed, based on their own experience with that precise migration against Windows Server 2003 and Oracle 10.2g<br />
<br />
We have a number of customized sessions (Manufacturing) and would need some advice regarding them.<br />
<br />
We are planning to create a new environment wiht ERP LN 6.1 a FP1 Standard w/o the customizations, move to FP3, feed the data from Oracle ..? and test, then based on testing results install (or not) customized sessions/modules;..<br />
<br />
Thank you for your advice. <br />
<br />

<br />
You will not want to just move an environment from SP0 to and FP3 installation as you will have data dictionary problems.</div></div><hr />
