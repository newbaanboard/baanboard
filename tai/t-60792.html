<br />
I Installed baan 5c with sp19 with oracle 9 on win 2003. <br />
<br />
Porting set is 7.1d.15 as per bshcmd -V , however version scan tools says porting set as 7.1d.4 ... not sure which one should i really assume is mine ... any idea why this discrepancy ?<br />
<br />
Then i installed sp20 (apps/tools) and tried compiling a script, &amp; it comes with following error ( refer to attached screenshot ) ... any idea why this does not gets compiled ?<br />
<br />
Note : We are still not on SLM.<br />
<br />
Just forgot to mention 1 point in my original post, this is a standard p.script that I am trying to compile. Any p.script that i develop it from scratch gets compiled properly without any issue.<br />
<br />
It seems that somehow for standard source code compilation it expects SLM... any idea... any solution/doc that u can point me where it is mentioned this thing ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">11th July 2011, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that is about right. From a Service pack level in Baan 5c, the code was written taking SLM into consideration. So, maybe even if you don't have SLM enabled, because you went so far ahead, now the code is expecting SLM and it doesn't find it so it errors out as the SLM client is not installed. <br />
<br />
Install SLM and license it then migrate from licd to SLM so you can compile again.</div></div><hr />
