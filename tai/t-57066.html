<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">29th October 2009, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the answers, but unfortunately as a freelancer now I cannot access to Baan Support. I will get those informations from a friend in Infor I suppose. <br />
Really I can't figure why Baan keeps this kind of documents as they are top secrets informations, while other players gives those informations public. <br />
Maybe this is one of the causes of the actual decline of Baan.</div></div><hr />

Solution Description<br />
English	Latest information about performance related information for ERP LN 6.1 and Enterprise Server<br />
<br />
Latest information on performance related topics which deserve special attention or are not yet published via the regular documentation.<br />
<br />
Performance improvement ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
- General performance Guidelines [updated 2007, 23 Nov ]<br />
This document provides information on the impact of the way you define the business processes in ERP LN on performance as well as general tuning and sizing guidelines.<br />
Available via: /ftpdownload/updates/port/documentation/ERP_LN_Performance_Guide.pdf   .<br />
<br />
- Infor ERP LN Performance Tracing and Tuning Guide<br />
The main purpose of this document is to structure existing information about how to improve the performance of an Infor ERP LN environment by tracing and tuning the environment.<br />
Available via: /ftpdownload/updates/port/documentation/Infor_ERP_LN_PTandT.pdf   .<br />
<br />
- Infor Sizing Whitepaper<br />
The main purpose of this document is to provide background information for making the right decisions when designing an Infor ERP LN infrastructure.<br />
Available via: /ftpdownload/updates/port/documentation/Infor_Sizing_Whitepaper.pdf   .<br />
<br />
- Archiving<br />
Setting up archiving while have a positive effect on performance because the growth of the production databases is limited. See also solution 225142<br />
<br />
- Online help [added 2007, 23 Nov]<br />
The online help of ERP LN 6.1 FP3 and Enterprise Server 8.4 has been updated with performance related information.<br />
See solution 142197<br />
<br />
Decrease storage ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
- For customer deploying ERP LN in an Oracle environment: check solution 224038 to use Oracle compression to reduce storage usage.<br />
<br />
- Porting set 8.4b introduces the use of the varchar type for string fields with SQL Server, reducing database storage usage. Check solution 148218 for availability.<br />
Strings of tables created with 8.4b will automatically be based on varchar. To have existing tables changed to using varchar an recreation of the table in the database is required (e.g. by using bdbpre and bdbpost).<br />
<br />
Based on the number of threads this forum, I can only say that Application/Hardware Capacity Management does need some good IT experience and knowledge i.e., a 'Specialist' (therefore, some consulting services unless you have someone in-house). There is no simple formula to tell someone to buy a Server of this size of X users.</div></div><hr />
