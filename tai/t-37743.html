<br />
we are on B50c with SP14.<br />
I'm looking for a way to print/find all pre-requisites for a solution without installing the solution.<br />
<br />
I found the session &quot;ttpmc2440m000 Print Dependencies by Update VRC&quot; but I don't know if that is the right session for me. I just let it it run to see the output, but it it still running( something about 5 hours now). <br />
<br />
In an other thread of the baanboard I found something about a function &quot;Print pre-requisites&quot; which should come with solution 139594. But I can't locate this function on our system.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me to continue?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two options to print the pre-requisites of a solution:<br />
<br />
1. Run the session you mentioned already: &quot;Print Dependencies by Update VRC&quot; (ttpmc2440m000). If you install solution 203819 first, this session will run much better and you can prevent long running times by using the new options to suppress certain output.<br />
<br />
2. Run the &quot;Check to Install&quot; from session &quot;Process Solutions&quot;. Solution 139594 introduced a new option &quot;Retain Status&quot;. If you check this option, the &quot;Check to Install&quot; will just check, and will not change the status to &quot;To Install&quot;. All solutions that would be installed, will be printed.<br />
<br />
Note that in both ways you need to download the pre-requisites first, otherwise PMC does not have all data. To download them automatically you can use session &quot;Download, Scan and Connect Multi-Level&quot; (ttpmc2210s000).<br />
<br />
In Infor ERPLN 6.1 there is an option to download the pre-requisites automatically during &quot;Check to Install&quot;!</div></div><hr />

<br />
that helps. It also explains why ttpmc2440m000 seems to run endless, because we haven't solution 139594 installed yet. <br />
I hope this solution doesn't have to much dependencies itself, in that case I'm probably alowed to install it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Note that solution 139594 is for the Check and Install, and 203819 for printing dependencies. 203819 has one pre-requisite, you probably don't have installed yet (145097, SP16). 139594 is an SP15 solution, with no other pre-requisites than to SP14 (or lower) solutions. But take care with 139594, there are some special instructions for this solution in the knowledge base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jaap,<br />
<br />
thank you. This are really very helpfull informations. :) <br />
Is there any documentation for the PMC? I think a saw something like that somewhere, but at the moment I'm not able to find something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">For BaanERP 5.0c there is not much documentation. You may check the solutions 72342, 100017, 122399, 123464 and 219349. Of course there is online session help.<br />
Solution 202873 contains links to some PMC documents, but they are for ERP LN 6.1. There is a major change with regards to the Service/Feature Pack concept in LN. However, the other functionality didn't change that much, so the documents may be of some help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">25th June 2007, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I just tried &quot;Check to Install&quot; with the switch:&quot;Retain Status&quot; and &quot;Dependencies&quot; from &quot;Process Solutions ttpmc2101m000&quot;. <br />
The results contains partly the same sessions, but also totaly different ones??<br />
<br />
Does &quot;Check to Install&quot; deliver all levels of pre-requisites, as far they are downloaded?<br />
What is a &quot;Dependency&quot; compared with a &quot;Pre-Requisite&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">25th June 2007, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Check to Install&quot; prints all dependent solutions as far as they are downloaded and scanned, but not yet installed.<br />
&quot;Dependencies&quot; shows just one level of dependencies.<br />
A dependency is a relation between two solutions. A pre-requisite is a type of dependency. It means the the pre-requisite solution should be installed before the current solution can be installed.<br />
A co-requisite dependency between two solutions means that both solutions have to be installed, but the order of installation is not relevant.<br />
A post-requisite dependency means that the solution must be installed after the current solution is installed. Note that PMC only knows the post-requisite dependency after the newer solution has been scanned.</div></div><hr />
