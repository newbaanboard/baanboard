I´m trying to upgrade from porting set 07.03 to 07.04 and choosing the local installation process (the only one that is available) the setup application reports a hostname for the machine that is running baan diferent from the real name of the machine. Pressing Next the setup procedure for the porting set fails.<br />
The hostname that setup application reports is an old machine that was replaced by the actual one.<br />
What I understood from the reading of the porting set installation instructions is that this is the Master Application Server name but the document doesn´t say anything about changing it.<br />
Does anyone know anything about this<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

The licence6.1 file is ok and is pointing to the license server that is the same machine where I'm trying to install the porting set.<br />
I also took a look on the BaanERPServer.info file and changed all the hostnames to match the name of the actual machine but it´s still not working.<br />
Any more clues?<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remove c:\Documents and Settings/&lt;user&gt;/Local Settings/Temp/*, create empty ${BSE}/lib/install directory.<br />
<br />
I already complained with SSA that this new installer is worse. You can't install a new environment with this installer, you need to install 7.1d.05 first than upgrade.<br />
<br />
Wish I had a *nix system, it can be so easy....<br />

Following your tip I managed to install the porting set although is still reporting &quot;Windows registrtion error&quot; at the end of the installation process.<br />
Strangely the installer states that the process failed but I checked that the porting set is the new one and it´s working fine.<br />
