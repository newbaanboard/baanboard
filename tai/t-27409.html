<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g端nther</div><div class="date">21st June 2006, 08:32</div></div><div class="posttext">About a year ago, baan introduced a new standard functionality. I guess it started with SOL 145207 (porting set must be 6.1c.07.02 or above). Two new sessions ttcorstdcomm (to be run once) and ttstpverstest (to display some information) were also introduced.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know: What can be done with the new icon/button &quot;attach&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danny Leolux</div><div class="date">21st June 2006, 13:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We have metioned solution present and installed and tools session ttcorstdcomm was runned once. But I don't see the 'attach' icon in any form, tools or other. I would expect that is a new standard option on form level. But I don't see any extra option in standard form options 'ttadv3100s000'.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any information about this feature I would like to know too.<br />

I had to start session ttadv5213m000 (ttcorstdcomm is said to start ttadv5213s000), and I played with different convert to runtime, patch objects after error solving and that on. I also installed the files attach1.gif ... attach3.gif into the directory $BSE/fid/gfd0002.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have asked a similar questions here:<br />
http://baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=24335<br />

<br />
The only thing I learned is to add a button but I could not to use it (as you see in the attachment button.jpg)!<br />
<br />
However using 3GL, I can create any toolbar I want with any buttons (check the attachment toolbar.jpg). For more info on this issue please send me a PM/email.<br />

I have the latest bw version for baan4 (82) and portingset 6.1c.07.04 and the mentioned solutions installed. However, as Gunther I also do not see the attachment icon in sessions in BW. Can you shed a light on how you made this icon working ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, obviously not; I did not change anything on the client side; my bw version is B40c.79.<br />
<br />
Can you shed a light on how you made this icon working ? Just as I already mentionned:  I had to start session ttadv5213m000 (ttcorstdcomm is said to start ttadv5213s000), and I played with different convert to runtime, patch objects after error solving and that on. I also installed the files attach1.gif ... attach3.gif into the directory $BSE/fid/gfd0002. (And re-logon oftern enough ...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st June 2006, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious - did it add any standard options to the forms?  You know to enable the button.  Or maybe even add in something like choice.attach section of code.  I noticed we have the ttcorstdcomm session, but my admin would probably get mad if I ran it just to play with the attach option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">21st June 2006, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">In ttadv470 I have an Option Number 80 for Choice Type 3 (ASCII Forms) (and I have many options for Choice Type 20 (which says (???) as description.....)<br />
I can add a button to a form and make it 'Standard Option' number 80 (attachments) but it still does not do anything. Changing the userdate to user the ASCII option set does not change anything...<br />
<br />
Just wondering, is this attachment functionality not something of B50 ? <br />
All solution numbers for 'attachment' or 'paperclip' refer to portingset 7.something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g端nther</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 07:59</div></div><div class="posttext">In ttadv470 I have an Option Number 80 for Choice Type 3 (ASCII Forms)<br />
On my test system, I see &quot;3 / 68 / sendto.desktop&quot; and &quot;3 / 80 / attachment&quot;; these aren't available on my live system. So they seem to have come from the above solution.<br />
<br />
 (and I have many options for Choice Type 20 (which says (???) as description.....)<br />
I see them on both my test and my live system so they might not be really new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rochus</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">this button is for the office-integration, which is introduced now in baanIV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks,<br />
maybe i can put some light here although i'm not on Baan IV but on Baan V.<br />
<br />
In our Version the paperclip-button is part of functionality of the ODM Package. If ODM is activated then the button becomes active for some predefined sessions.<br />
ODM works only with bw/Worktop<br />
<br />
The sendto.desktop is a function introduced with the cmf module in Tools.<br />
You can send a so called Baan-Shortcut (a bwl-File) to your Desktop or via E-Mail to a recipient or to a task (by default only in combination with MS-Outlook for which a client-connector is provided by Baan).<br />
This works with Worktop/bw.<br />
<br />
When using Webtop the sendto (to desktop or mail) functionality works in a different way. You get an URL that calls the Webtop and starts the appropriate session.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />
