<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ASchenning</div><div class="date">29th October 2001, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently we are running with dutch menus on our SUN Unix-system. <br />
When changing the language off a user to english i get the following message &quot;ttdsks0046 ???????????????&quot; I am told that i have to install a new program to get the english menus working. Now the question, our consultant thinks that after this i also need to install all the Tools-solutions again. Is this true ?? We are currently running BAAN IVc4, SP7 installed.a.schenning@chello.nl</div></div><hr />

If you install another language it will also overwrite your tools components. Probably a backup and restore after the installation of the language will do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ASchenning</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anybody tell me also which directories to backup and restore for the tools-components when installing the menus in a different language. This trick would save me a lot of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">31st October 2001, 09:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course you have a complete backup, but I would go for the $BSE/tools/&lt;version&gt; directory.<br />
<br />
After the installation you can check with a simple find command which files have been changed and restore them.<br />

And If you would like to restore your Baan Software, don't forget to restore also the 000 company where some entries in the database are modified.</div></div><hr />
