<br />
Baan 5b<br />
<br />
We basically manufacture to order, but after a production order (project) is completed, items are some times stored in a warehouse.<br />
<br />
To avoid having project-items stored, custom items are being copied back to standard items before going into the warehouse.<br />
<br />
A time consuming and ugly sollution.<br />
<br />
Now I was thinking......<br />
<br />
Using the item code segmentation in Baan V, would it be possible to lose the project segment in the warehouse module (only)?<br />
<br />
If so, this sounds too perfect to be true.<br />
But then...how do I go about in removing the project segment from the item code. The sessions that deal with this do not allow me to make any modifications the decent way.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed it sounds too perfect to be true. For that reason it is not true. Item segmentation is defined in a tools table (ttgfd422) and can only be viewed in session Item Segmentation (tcibd0500m000 -&gt; tcibd0100s000). <br />
When a baan environment is setup the segmentation parameters will be filled in the mentioned tools table. This segmentation definition is valid for all the companies in that baan environment. It is not even possible to change the segmentation parameters for another company within the same baan environment.<br />
Reasons for this are table sharing in a multi-company setup.<br />
<br />
I guess by now you understand that it is not possible to lose the project segment in one specific module only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply Frans, but I have a few buts up my sleeve..<br />
<br />
The Baan help files tell me, under the heading 'Item Definition and Segmentation' that<br />
<br />
The sement definition cannot be changed easily afterwards. So be carefule when you specify the segments!<br />
<br />
<br />
Now not easily is not the same as not period, right?<br />
<br />
First of all, I only have a single company...and even if I had more than one, I would want it to be across all companies.<br />
<br />
By the way, when I said warehouse module, I (of course) meant warehouse _package_.<br />
<br />
At this point I really don't care if I have to rebuild the entire program from scratch to make this happen. That's how big of an issue this is for me.<br />
<br />
But if so, my question remains, can I have a separate segmentation for the wh package, just like I currently have a separate segmentation for the tc and the cp package?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FransG</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The Item Definition and Segmentation quote is valid Not easily means that you have to clean your system (i.e. remove all items; not to say all data) before you can change the segmentation parameters. Its a bit of an understatement, I guess.<br />
<br />
Yep, I understood you meant the wh package.<br />
<br />
Suppose you define a new domain. Call it whitem. For this new domain you specify in the segmentation definition that only the Item Base is valid. This was easy, but next<br />
<br />
Next youll have to replace all the tcitem domain in the wh package with the new whitem domain. This implies program scripts, dlls, dals, reports, forms etc. Everything.<br />
<br />
Besides that youll need to rewrite all the integration functions in the integration dlls. All item related input and/or output arguments need to be transformed from the tcitem domain to whitem and vice versa. Something similar happens in cp package with a function copying items from tcitem to cpitem and vice versa.<br />
<br />
After this enormous effort there is still the risk of malfunctioning. There might be things I overlooked now. In my opinion the effort and risk are too high to take it. <br />
Please try an alternative solution!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Off course now that you mention it, it makes perfect sense. Duh!:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Thanks for setting me straight.</div></div><hr />
