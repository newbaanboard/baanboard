<br />
Can we kill the mssql_srv.exe process in the server? The process appeared when users try to get data from crystal report, but the users didn't close the crystal report properly so the process is still running in the server and it makes the server run slowly.<br />
<br />
As we know that we can see the ntbshell id in task manager and kill the ntbshell.exe and command in dos-prompt.<br />
<br />
Please advice<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Best Regards,</div></div><hr />

I have a customer running BaanIV on UX over Informix. I always kill db drivers as soon as I confirm they are the product of a crystal report incorrectly closed.</div></div><hr />

I'm very sure that is a crytal report process. <br />
Can anyone please let me know what is the command to kill the crystal report process?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Best Regards,<br />

If you are not sure which driver is the one you need to kill &quot;pslist&quot; might help. &quot;pslist&quot; does not come standard with Windows but it can be downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/pslist.mspx<br />
<br />
You'll find the command help in this link as well<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />
