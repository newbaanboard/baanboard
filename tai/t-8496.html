What are the possible options through which one can connect the BaaN Server with the BaaN Clients with the clients at a remote location and with connectivity problems.<br />
I have explored the following options...<br />
1. Connection throught Vsat<br />
2. Using remote dial-up<br />
3. Radio Links<br />
4. Through Internet using the Citrix.<br />
<br />
Are there any other options also or that is...<br />
<br />
How about using the Fiber cables between the two locations, the distance between two locations is about 80 miles.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">T1 is a type of frame relay network (a way of connecting your two locations).  T1 has bandwidth of around 1500 Mb/s which has been adequate for our needs but your business may need more or less.  It all depends how much you are willing to pay.  This is in reference to your &quot;about using the Fiber cables&quot; question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g_Jericho</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 07:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Can u give me some idea as to how much bandwidth is needed from the client to connect to the server in terms of Kbps.<br />

<br />
The amount of bandwidth necessary depends on how heavy the transactions are between the remote site and HQ. Several months back, we were faced with the similar problem, in which the warehouse is located some 20km from the HQ. Over there, the only possible terestrial network was phone line and ISDN. The fancier options such as leased line, VSAT, etc were not available or were deemed too costly. We gave phone line connection over 56k modem first. Turned out that it was enough for the warehouse as the transactions are just receipt and delivery of goods and it's not really a busy warehouse.<br />
<br />
Using that 56k modem, BaanERP operates rather slowly from the WH for the first 5 minutes. After that, the connection is just as fast as LAN, amazing! We finally decided we'd connect the WH to HQ using that 56k modem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 08:10</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact, very little.  I've connected from different locations with as little as 19200b/s.  However, the gui does not perform well (the ascii interface doesn't need much in the way of bandwidth).  I would recommend 128Kb/s (approx. 2x a 56k modem i.e. ISDN) for smooth operation but that's just my opinion.  Also, if you have to move large files between locations (large print jobs, patches, service packs, non-baan files etc.) you may wish for more bandwidth.  Without calling in an outside consultant to make a recommedation you could just start small and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />
