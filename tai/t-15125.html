<br />
Stupid question:  What are the settings for the Fonts by paper type for 8 1/2 X 11 and 11 X 8 1/2 paper?  Basically, normal NA paper but printing portrait and landscape?<br />
<br />
I thought I had it setup right, but when printing from BWPrint the edges are cut off and the bottom margin seems low.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">25th April 2004, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">The fonts by paper type refer to the size of paper possible that a report can print to according to the font that is used by the report.<br />
<br />
e.g. if the paper is 8.5 x 11 and the small font is defined as being able to print 132 characters, Baan will accept the device if printed to without warnings.  Note this is for DIRECT device printers.  When printing to a direct device, the print driver specified for the device is used (which usually is setup in concert with the characters of the page in fonts by paper type).<br />
<br />
If you are actually using bwprint to print to a windows printer, then the print driver for the printer in windows is used.  <br />
<br />
If things are getting cut off, the report you are sending to the printer is outside the capability of the printer for the font selected, so you'll either have to slim down the font size or choose a different paper size or change your report.</div></div><hr />
