Advice and polite abuse welcome !:confused: :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have the newest bwprint version (comes with the newest Baan Windows client version)? In some older versions there is a problem with font heights or line spacing, so lines will be larger than expected with the result of some lines &quot;dropping out&quot; on the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
In the new version you should be able do define the font height/font spacing thing. (Right mouse click in the preview)<br />

<br />
Many thanks for response . We have BW 6.2 the same version as our porting set<br />
<br />
I am unclear as to the session and point at which we right click<br />
can you assist there ?<br />
<br />
Currently when we select the ttstpslopen we have defaults of<br />
<br />
Paper A4<br />
Font  Small (17.1 cpi)<br />
<br />
Should/could we select Paper A486 (84 lines) ?</div></div><hr />

Then right click on the report preview that is displayed.<br />
This only sets it for that particular client if you wanted to alter it for all you would need to export the registry component that controls the font height/font spacing and install it through a login script or change each one individually.</div></div><hr />

Many thanks , but having checked more thoroughly our problem appears to be that print is not lost if from various clients it is directed to one printer but it is if directed to another . Both HP one a 4100N yhe other a 4050N with the &quot;same&quot; printer config<br />
Just one is configured as a Windows and the other through Unix<br />
<br />
We will try your solution but are concerned of effects when users select different printers. Obviously there could be a fault with the printer</div></div><hr />

Check the paper type defined with the printer, then within the paper type the fonts and within the font the no. of lines and no. of characters.<br />
That should give you a clue what's going on.<br />
<br />
I personally don't like changing fonts with bwprint, this means output from one location could look different compared to another location. It's not really manageable.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

I think that it's more trustfull the printing that comes from a UNIX printer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finally resolved ( kind of )<br />
<br />
Reason may have been caused by &quot;page break&quot; being created in std baan report but resolution achieved by selecting Paper Type A486. <br />
<br />
Now looking for downside of this, other than users saying why can't it be landscape .</div></div><hr />
