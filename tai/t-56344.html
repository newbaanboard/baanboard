<br />
I have installed 2 different Baan instences on the same server (/b4a/bse and /b4b/bse).<br />
When logging on via BW Client, with correct BSE /b4b/bse set, all temporary files will though be created in the other BSE /b4a/bse/tmp. This only happens when using BW Client but not when I logon in unix using ba6.1 with variables set correctly in the unix shell before.<br />
It seems that BW Client does not pass the BSE settings correctly and/or the unix environment for the users are not correctly set.<br />
<br />
Can you please let me know where to set the environment correctly for the Unix users?<br />
<br />
Any hints?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
set the BSE's at client startup.<br />
e.g. <br />
-set BSE_TMP=temporary folder to use a temporary folder other than $BSE/tmp<br />
<br />
or have a look at this !<br />

<br />
your suggestions, setting the BSE_TMP via -- -set BSE_TMP... is working, but the problem is rather, that the variable $BSE seems to be not correctly set.<br />
e.g. when I try to print to a file from within BW and use ${BSE}/tmp/filename<br />
it goes to the wrong BSE, although I have started the BW with the correct value in field BSE. Also tried to set the BSE with -- -set BSE=/b4b/bse, which did not change anything...<br />
<br />
Any additional suggestions?</div></div><hr />
