$ shmtimer6.2 -i<br />
Shmtimer started: pid = 397548, time = 1161773718 (Wed Oct 25 10:55:18 2006)<br />

Usage: shmtimer6.1 [-iksvu]<br />
        -i      : start timer<br />
        -k      : stop timer<br />
        -s      : show timer status<br />
        -v      : show version<br />

Shmtimer info: pid = 397548, time = 1161773739 (Wed Oct 25 10:55:39 2006)<br />

The timer takes care that all users read the time from shared memory instead of doing a more expensive systemcall. So, if the timer is not there, it will do the system call. Beside that you have a performance penalty, there should not be any issues.<br />

shmtimer6.1: rel_sem 44820 failed - error 22 (Invalid argument)<br />
Shmtimer started: pid = 20798, time = 1161774597 (Wed Oct 25 12:09:57 2006)[/<br />
<br />
shmtimer6.1 -s also gives the error above<br />
<br />
process is running though...<br />
ps -ef|grep shm<br />
    root 20798     1  0 12:09:57 ?         0:00 shmtimer6.1 -i<br />
<br />
Is it working?  Is there a lock file $BSE/tmp perhaps that's why it can't 'rel_sem'?  Can I restart the process again without kicking people out of Baan?<br />
<br />
Thanks - Andy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">25th October 2006, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you started the shmtimer as the same users as you started your shared memery (normally the user that runs rc.start). If not that can explain the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">25th October 2006, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan started with rc.start - shmtimer I assume should have started at the same time but hadn't.  rc.start runs as root, shmtimer started manually as root today.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
depending on your platform (Hp-Ux, Aix, ...) you maight have a problem with the kernel settings. It looks like the shmtimer can not acquire the semaphore it needs. This could be due to a kernel limit.</div></div><hr />

ba6.1 seems to run jobs ok when shmtimer6.1 is down. However using ba6.1 as user interface is not possible when shmtimer is down. Is that simply because ba6.1 is not coded to use the system call instead unless BAMODE is 1 or something like that?<br />
