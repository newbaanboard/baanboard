<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 02:52</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running LN6.1 on Windows 2003 with Worktop 2.4.x as the client.  There are quite a few threads about changing the menu color in Baan IV and BaanERP so that a production environment can be easily distinguished from a test system.  <br />
<br />
The situation in LN seems to be different.  First of, there is no GIF folder in BSE and I could not find any icons resembling the menu on the server anywhere.  This indicates that the menu icon should be found on the client side.  I did find menu icons in the Worktop directory under 'Resources' and painted the icon in a different color.  Now the menu in Worktop is different but it is the same no matter which system I access, production or test: the colors stay the same.  So nothing gained.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas about how this can be accomplished in LN?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In erpln6.1 the icons used are mostly located in tools library ($BSE/tools/tt*/btt* as i remember ). Look in tools menu there is a menu defined for graphic data where you have the different icon groups and the icons name. I cannot give more info because I don't have currently access to an ERP LN6.1 environment <br />
<br />
I found that in erp LN6.1 FP2 some icons are not editable in paint.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />
