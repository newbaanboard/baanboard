     We are using BaanLogin on Baan5c/Oracle9/AIX5.2. <br />
<br />
     Periodically (few times per week), we are facing a problem that new users are   unable to login to Baan (while logged user works normally) , with message:  <br />
(Could not setup connection to port 7150): baanlogin failed on host 192.168.10.241 username bsp<br />
Failure executing ipc_boot binary in /baanerp/bse<br />
 After restarting Baan Login (blogin6.2)  service, everythnig works fine. <br />
<br />
Login over rexec protocol doesn't work at all, with message:<br />
   Error 510: Database not on<br />
<br />
Why we can not use rexec protocol?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">10th April 2006, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Baanlogin will pass on environment variables to the connecting bshell.<br />
<br />
So for example, if the user that starts blogind6.1 has ORACLE_HOME set <br />
then the bshell will also get that set as an environment variable. <br />
<br />
rexec does not do this, so you need to make sure the settings in the tabledef6.1 and bse_vars and db_resource are all correct. <br />
<br />
My guess is that one of those files is incorrect and you've never noticed because you're setting the correct values in /etc/profile. <br />
<br />
In that setup ba6.1 works and so does blogind but not bw via rexec.<br />

User root (that starts blogind6.2) doesn't have ORACLE_HOME set. I've checked tabledef, dbresource and it seems OK, only thing that I've noticed is that tabledef containd ORACLE_SID, but db_resource contains ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME.  I've created bse_vars file because it didn't exist before, to be the same as db_resource, but problem still exist.<br />
<br />
When login to Baan over rexec failed, Oracle log file shows:<br />
dbs_errno = 0Error 510 occurred: <br />
Error ORA-12154 occurred during logon.<br />
ORA-12154: TNS:could not resolve service name<br />
Error BDB-510 returned.<br />
Check the Oracle settings:<br />
NLS_LANG = 'slovenian_slovenia.ee8iso8859p2'<br />
ORACLE_HOME (client) = '/oracle/app/oracle/product/9.2.0' (resource oracle_client_home)<br />
ORACLE_HOME (server) = '/oracle/app/oracle/product/9.2.0' (resource oracle_server_home)<br />
Oracle Service Name = 'baan' (resource oracle_service_name --&gt; TWO_TASK)<br />
TWO_TASK = 'baan'<br />
ORACLE_SID = 'baan' (ignored)<br />
Logon failed; errno 510</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might try to set the &quot;TNS_ADMIN&quot; variable to point to the directory on the server, where the tnsnames.ora is stored. Usually $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has a resolution been found for this issue? We have just upgraded from Solaris 9 to Solaris 10 and since the upgrade Rexec does not work at all, and Baanlogin works only for some (super?) users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">4th January 2010, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Is rexec enabled?<br />
<br />
most distros disable it by default for security reasons.<br />
<br />
see if you can rsh into the machine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">5th January 2010, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Rexec is enabled as it always was. Also Baanlogin used to work fine for all users, and since the upgrade it doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">5th January 2010, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know how it works on Solaris, on AIX for instance you have to start rexecd daemon with option -c to prevent reverse name resolution or you have to have all clients listed in /etc/hosts file.<br />
Regarding blogind I don't think that it's connected with user type (superuser or not), that is more likely network problem.</div></div><hr />
