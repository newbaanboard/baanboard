That's the main adavantage (and main headach) of PMC.  Previously, you would download a solution, and have a pretty good chance of it not working because it relied on other, updated code.<br />
<br />
There is a method of downloading it all automatically..would that help?  I think you just check that option somewhere ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 00:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Should be the same way you download the original solution. Go to www.support.baan.com, search the solution number and download.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hunting around for the option to make this automatic.  There is a way to download a solution and as it checks for uninstalled dependancies, install them as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That session was released later, and it will do all the downloading, scanning and connecting of the solution and all dependancies.  If you don't have the session, you should download the latest from Baan (patch the patcher :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">The whole point of having a tool like PMC is that you are sure that your patch tree structure is consistent, ie. taking care of pre-requisites and co-dependancies. The session Lisa mentioned offers an automatic mechanism to download pre-requisites as needed but only when your Baan server can have FTP access to the Internet. <br />
<br />
To answer your first question if you do not have this option: well, then you have to download the patch you want to install, scan it and check its pre-requisites, then download these and start the whole procedure from the beginning again. <br />
<br />
When PMC first arrived it usually took us a full day to install 1 single patch and its dependancies. Fortunately, PMC has improved since then!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsteenwi</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">L.S.,<br />
<br />
Sometimes you can &quot;fool&quot; PMC by using another method of importing.<br />
You can extract the patch by using ttiex124m000. (When a message pops up that you have to install the patch using PMC, the patch is not suitable for the method I'm telling you about right now. In that case, PMC can NOT be fooled! Sorry. Blame Baan...) In the extracted file you can check the components delivered in the patch. After this, you can import the dump by using ttiex1285m000. Dependencies will not be checked.<br />
<br />
Still I would like to underline what a few people before me already commented: PMC is not checking the pre-requisites just for fun or to annoy you (what it generally does, unfortunately). Using the method I describe above, problems could occur when working with the just imported functionality; the pre-requisites can contain domains, formfields et cetera that are being used by the new softwarecomponents. But then again: you could be lucky...<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't involved in the development of PMC but I guess this was partly how it started. I would deliver a solution patchable through Import Patch session, ttiex1284m000. The problem with this is, for example, in the program script your solution refers to a domain which was available from a previous solution (pre-requisite), then of course you will get an error, like unknown domain.<br />
<br />
Well, then we would write a solution that says &quot;In order to install this solution you need to install solutions blah, blah, blah first&quot;. And so on with the next solution referring to the previous solution. This is kind of irritating sometimes especially if its not properly worded.<br />
<br />
In terms of getting lucky and going around PMC, you might be solving your original problem but you're in fact creating another problem on another area. That's why Baan Support is always curious whether you have updated objects in your system.<br />
<br />
Of course, the solutions can be collated together to form a single solution, the so-called Service Packs.</div></div><hr />
