<br />
We run separate instances (and coy's) of BaanIV4c4 on two separate severs located in different buildings about 1/4 mile apart in our fairly large factory site.  The strategy in using two servers is to provide a high level of disaster recovery capability. <br />
ie: not have all our eggs in one basket. <br />
<br />
However, we have a licence server running on only one machine and would need to get a new licence from baan if we did have a disaster that knocked out the server running the licence daemon.<br />
<br />
We would be very keen to run multiple licence daemons if were possible to have them jointly manage the licences dynamically (rather that having to allocate a fixed number to each instance)<br />
<br />
Will appreciate your advice<br />

<br />
1. 1 server with the license daemon shared by the remaining servers (X), eg licence6.1 with &quot;server1,server2,...,serverX&quot;. In case of failover, just start the license daemon on another machine.<br />
<br />
2. X servers with each one it's own license daemon, the number of licences will be split by X. If one system goes down, the license deamons should be able to re-split the licenses again bwteen the remaining servers.<br />
<br />
In any case, moving into 1 or 2 will need new set of keys (does not mean downtime neccessarly!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">26th July 2002, 22:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We have that sort of environment running here.  You will need to have High Availabilty running else if you've got a network licence running then you would have 72 hours before you lose 50% of your licences.  <br />
<br />
The way is to have both Network Licence and High Availabilty checked. <br />
On the /baan/bse/lib/licence6.1 file on BOTH servers have the servers host name listed in order of prefernece seperated by commas. This order should be the same on both servers licence6.1 file.  This may require rebranding with these options.<br />
After stopping the licence daemon you can restart a licd6.1 on both servers. If no rebranding is required you must at least run configure applications esle you will get checksum errors. <br />
<br />
This way if one server goes down the other licence daemon takes over instantly. This too does not cause you to have to split licences but is maintained as one pool of licence. Note that you have two or more licd6.1 running at one time. More than three licd6.1 running at one time is not recommended since this causes additional network traffic. We have three running concurently and it works like a charm.</div></div><hr />
