It might be a silly issue, but I have a problem in running a job via task scheduler, when I try to run the session manually, it will pop up the output device screen twice, first time for output and second time for error report, now when I was enabling the job, session prompts only once and the result of the task scheduler was an error &quot;No report&quot;. Could some one let me know how to fix this.<br />

Logically, if you are running a job via task scheduler, there should not be any pop up window displayed.<br />
<br />
What device are you using? Is it a customized session?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you are right, I have assigned a standard session which have couple of date formats, and the while assigning the job, it gives the date formats for selection and this session has an customized report which is in SSRS and I'm using a SSRS_OUTPUT (redirected to a path), so in the job I have changed the output to this device. But everytime system is giving error message. If there is only one output displayed then no issues with job, but if the session has two outputs like explained in earlier post, then it has issues.<br />
<br />

Which is the standard session you are using? Is there any checkbox on the form something like &quot;Print Error Report&quot; ? Also, have you written anything in the report script which can cause issues while running under job mode?</div></div><hr />

We are running whina6220m000(Perform slow moving analysis) and written a report to send the output to Excel directly, and there is nothing specific to output.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like the two reports which are attached to the session are hard-coded in the script and hence adding a new report might cause issues.<br />
<br />
What you can do is, copy the standard report in your own VRC and then customize it. It might solve the problem for you.</div></div><hr />
