<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">24th January 2011, 09:39</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running  BaaN IV c4  for last 10 years  in all our group companies. Also we are using  AFS (BCK) for some major functionalities. Presenly we are on SQL2000, Windows server 2003 and BaaN SP19 and we could not go further as the new porting set  for the service packs will not support  AFS &amp; BCK(BaaN connection Kit).  As the volume of data became so big (Never done archive)  and  running out of series in First free numbers,  we are planning for following.<br />
<br />
1.   Upgrade  SQL and WinServer to 2008 and increase the field length to 7 digits (all the orders)  and get replacement for  BCK.<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
2.   Migrate  BaaN IV C4 to  ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Here are the questions.<br />
<br />
For option No. 1<br />
      a)  What is the replacement of  BCK to make AFS work or What is the alternative to have same functionalities ?<br />
<br />
<br />
For option No. 2<br />
      a)  What are advantages and disadvantages if we migrate<br />
      b)  We have spent lot of  time  on developing in house reports (out side BaaN).  Do we <br />
            need to start from the scratch ?<br />
      c)  What is the approx. time period will take to migrate ?<br />
      d)  What is the alternative for  AFS (Baan Connection Kit) in LN ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">24th January 2011, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Noor,<br />
<br />
just some information about the topic enlarging order number.<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=44151&amp;highlight=enlarging<br />
<br />
I have done this twice ... depending on your customizations this project can take weeks.<br />
<br />
The solution from baan offers some check reports which help you to identify forms, reports, scripts which have to be checked e.g. if there is enough space for 7 digits or if the form contains a hardcoded max value like &quot;999999&quot;, this reports are realy helpful!<br />
<br />
Another point is, that you have some time both, 6 digits and 7 digits in your system (current orders), i. e. the users have to be trained to work with both e.g. in reports or in business logic.<br />
<br />
As far as I remember all standard forms, reports, scripts prepared for enlarged order numbers are shipped with sp 15 from baan ... but baan did this job not 100 % so you have to check your system with the check reports installed by the solution mentioned in the link above.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
LN: I have done one migration from baan iv to infor ln fp 3. My point of view, that the business logic is realy different so users have to be trainend with totaly new processes ... the gui is more complex (dash boards), so you have a lot of information but you need users who can benefit from this.<br />
<br />
There are some features to transfer e.g. reports from baan to infor ln, but i would recommend to check what is realy needed and develop it new.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
