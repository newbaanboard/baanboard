<br />
1) the table will have field(s) containing the company number 303, this will cause errors when these contents remain unchainged.<br />
2) I'd bet that there are references to other finance tables, in this case the corresponding tables should be exported and imported too.<br />
IIRC there is a session designed for this purpose (moving finance tables from one company to another, in detail chainging all fields containing the company number), but I suspect that the purpose of this session is NOT to merge two companies (tfgld9004m000).<br />
 Especially the design of key1 of tfgld018 calls for duplicate entries, so you have to do some research before you can merge :-)<br />
bdbpre and bdbpost alone will not help.<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keyuser.tdtt</div><div class="date">12th September 2008, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The only purpose for this was &quot;Some of the document status records are in 303 and that I have to bring them to 304&quot; as tfgld018 sharing between two companies was removed so that I could post the transactions&quot;. On trial basis, I tried &quot;copy rows from another table in GTM option by opening 304 tfgld018 in GTM&quot; and it worked successfully..<br />
<br />
Only problem with this is it is very time consuming as I have to compare which records are in 303 but not in 304 and I have to bring only those 303 tfgld018 records which are not in 304.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your replies..Yes sequential dump and restore from sequential dump is the best option. But unfortunately I do not have access to server.</div></div><hr />
