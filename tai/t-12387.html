<br />
Since i am into BaaN development part, I have never installed BaaN , will it be very difficuilt for a new bie to install and configure / fine tune it...... does the cd's which comes with BaaN installation accompanies enough documentation for a new bie, or will it very difficuilt for a new bie to install, i am familiar with all these terms like package comb, package vrc, derivations, etc etc, since i have done quiete a bit coding and also familiar with little administration prcedures.<br />
<br />
If anyone has some installtion docs as to how to install BaaN IV c4 on Win NT with Oracle as database , could u please share it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Asking 'how do you install Baan on Oracle' is like asking 'how do I build a house?'<br />
<br />
Answer: with mortar and bricks.</div></div><hr />

It is very easy and simple. Follow the documentation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is Oracle 8i not supported to be a databse for BaaN IV c4, I have installed Oracle 8i , and saw that the version it was showing it as 8.1.5 when i ran SQL+ of Oracle, and during Installation of BaaN i selected Oracle , so when i clicked on next it said &quot;No INSTANCE FOUND&quot; , since on BaaN installation Oracle version specified was 8.1.4, so can't i install BaaN IV C4 with my current Oracle 8i ( 8.1.5) version ???<br />

<br />
I was just going through the previous posts, regarding this problem of installating BaaN IV c4 with Oracle 8i , &amp; came to know that first we have to install Oracle 8 with BaaN and then upgrade it to Oracle 8i.</div></div><hr />
