How did you create them and from where are you trying to login?</div></div><hr />

<br />
we found the problem and the fix to it.<br />
<br />
We are on the HP-Unix. I didnt create any remote user they are just normal user.<br />
<br />
the problem is we set 755 file permissions on the $BSE/tools directories and all the subdirectories and files under it. We change to 775 and then the users were able to login. I guess there is some bug with the tools that they are expecting a write authorization. We logged a case with baan support. We feel it is a security issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">17th January 2002, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's a security issue, just think about the following:<br />
A super user can install PMC Tools patches and write into tools (patch objects, etc.), and a super user can be any user, not only bsp.<br />
If you restrict the write access to the tools directory, then the only super user that can do such tasks related to tools would be 'bsp'.<br />
Baan installs all directories with 770, and objects as well (except some related to the portingset), so I think that internally they do a few checks, at least to the directories (I usually have problems is with objects installed by super users that use a umask without write for the bsp group, but that's another history...).</div></div><hr />
