<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpchheda</div><div class="date">15th September 2009, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">One fine morning my finance user suddenly srated getting error  while processing his Transactions &quot; No control account found for this supplier&quot;, <br />
My store person getting error &quot;location not found for this Warehouse&quot; and My sales person was getting error while printing Invoice &quot; Trasaction type &quot; &quot; not found&quot;. Then I check and went in to detail and found that field &quot;Financial Supplier group&quot; tccom020.cfsg was missing in Maintain Supplier.<br />
And No Receipt and INspection locations were present in Maintain Warehouses. And Transaction types were missing from session &quot; Maintain Order Types&quot; Also the Parent GL code were missing in Maintain Chart of account.<br />
I am surprised how a picular data from tables like tccom020 (Supplier), tcmcs003 (Warehouses), tcmcs042 (Order Types) and tfgld008 (Chart of Account),<br />
and tfgld009 anf tfgld011 (Transaction Types) were missing.<br />
<br />
We had sequential dump of last day , so we could restore the same and then Baan was working fine. But wanted to know what could be the reason of this data lost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) as mentioned in above post<br />
2) table sharing was done and then revoked ...<br />
3) somebody deleted it directly from db or through microsoft access / batch file ( basically somebody has oracle password to the same )<br />
4) Some test sessions were executed which contained table drop / row drop statements.<br />
<br />
best thing would be to place audit on critical master tables to atleast catch the person or the culprit session.<br />
