  We are working with single logistics and multi finance environment due to some problems at server we could not complete data enteries in time for current fiscal year.<br />
<br />
Now as new financial year is reaching and we want to start a fresh this time ,we want to delete entire transaction data but want to keep master data as it is.<br />
<br />
Is there any way out to delete the old transactional data by keeping master data as it is?<br />
<br />
We are using following module:<br />
<br />
Baan Distribution:<br />
<br />
Purchase<br />
Sale<br />
ILC control is implemented<br />
<br />
Baan Finance<br />
All modules were used.<br />
<br />
I know it seems to be manual task but if somebody has done it earlier and documented somewhere it would be great help to us.<br />
<br />
We are having Baan IVc4 ,Database Oracle 8 I on WIN2k.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I feel in your case Baan archiving is the best solution which archive all data with delete option yes. <br />
<br />
so it only keep master data.. otherwise you have to keep master table seq dump and delete all tables which delete all transcational data also. Create all tables again and restore master seq dump.<br />
