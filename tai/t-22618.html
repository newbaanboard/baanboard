I want to make a backup server in case of failure with the production server.<br />
A Windows based server will be the cheapest.<br />
Do I need an install from scratch to get our Baan application up running on a <br />
Windows server?<br />
Or can I copy the $BSE files to a Windows server and do some surgery to get it to work?<br />
<br />

<br />
A good idea is to use tar and gz on the unix side and uncompress that<br />
with Winzip on the windows side. winzip translates the unix style ascii files to windows style ascii files automatically, and you don't have to screw around with ftp.<br />
<br />
and of course there are other things you need to do in $BSE/lib.<br />

Do you have a one or two-tier system?</div></div><hr />

<br />
why do you think that the windows server will be the cheapest solution?<br />
Use linux instead.<br />
To your question:<br />
You will need a platform-specific portingset in any case (that is the contents of $BSE/bin). <br />
To move/copy your production system you then may copy the rest of $BSE, dump your tables (including 000) and reload these into your new system.<br />
Concerning users/printers you will have some work to do still, BUT this will be loads easier if you use linux instead of M$ as OS for the backup system, not to speak of services to be installed and whatnot with M$ .... I would do a complete installation of Baan and then exchange $BSE if I would have to use Windows.<br />

Not only is easier to replicate Baan (just tar on origin and untar at destination, no hassles like having to get the registry keys setup) but also cheaper. Also, easy to copy over the password settings across and the /home users, etc. since it'a all unix. Imagine the hassle of having to create all users manually on a windows system!</div></div><hr />
