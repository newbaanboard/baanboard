   I have an Exchange Scheme for import Routing(tirou102)， It runs in company A and imports data into B or C.Everything was fine when it operated Company B, but when it imported data into Company C, There was a 606 error for all rows.I checked all the related fields to make sure that the related table fields exist.I can enter the data directly and save it successfully and I can even insert data directly with SQL statements based on the values in the file.However, errors are always reported when data is imported，like:<br />
<br />
 10|3|606|********|001|10|1|2720|G00||0|1|60|1|0|1|100|<br />
 ...............<br />
<br />
The error message is very simple and I can only see words like 606，I know that is reference does not exist, but I can't know which field it is.I try to add command line for the output log to the BW startup parameters, similar to &quot;-dbgobj -keeplog -logfile ...&quot;. However, it can only be for import session(tuxch0223m000), not for real import objects(/exchange/objects/tirou102.o). Therefore, useful quota information is not available. There is also no information to rely on in the windows events  or ${BSE}/log directory. What should I do to get the error message for which field exactly?<br />
Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th June 2021, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Good suggestion.  I was going to ask how they entered it directly? Table maintenance or logging into company a, switching to c and then running the session. <br />
<br />
Seems like way back in the day I had an issue like this across companies - but in my case it was a one-off and I just logged into the company with the issue, rebuild the exchange scheme in that company, compiled and it worked.  I never did try to figure out the error and why it did not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alibaba</div><div class="date">25th June 2021, 06:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your reply GaryEd,I confirm that I first imported the data for tirou101(tirou102.cmba refers to),I checked all reference fields for the tirou102.I think I tried all the possible test methods and couldn't find a solution. I'm just trying to find a way to output the import object(Not tuxch0223m000 but /exchange/objects/tirou102.o) error message, or how to add  more BW runtime error message to the Windows Events...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alibaba</div><div class="date">25th June 2021, 06:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi mark,I did the test, when using the import session tuxch0223m000, select &quot;Overrule Batch Company = yes&quot; and &quot;company = B&quot; within Company A, and then the import succeeded, and if I selected &quot;company = C&quot; , the import failed.(But when selected &quot;company = C&quot;, importing tirou101 is successful).<br />
After I DEBUG import object tirou102.o, recorded the assignment of each field tirou102, and switched to C company, with a SQL script according to the assignment in the import object to do db.insert,commit....., is successful. It puzzled me. When I run the import object program in the DEBUG state, I pay special attention to the value of the current company(get.compnr() = C).<br />
This error has not been resolved so far, but other import schemes, such as item/customer... are normal.</div></div><hr />
