<br />
I started to install Service Pack 9 yesterday on our test server in preparation to a live SP8 to SP12 migration.<br />
After going through all the steps and installing the latest porting set, I started doing batch's of tests to verify our customizations are not broken. Except one of our functions servers all is well for now.<br />
Now I have a problem with Maintain Users Data. When I try to start  ttaad2100m000 I get the following message:<br />
&quot;ttstp112 - form dump error&quot; (in portuguese). I don't seem to have any problem on the other tools sessions.<br />
<br />
Did anyone had this problem? I tried searching the support knowledge base but couldn't find anything on the subject (at least with our configuration).<br />
I also tried to move form dumps (for this session) from our live server to our test server but the problem persisted.<br />
<br />
Thanks :) ,</div></div><hr />

Try running ttiex3226m000 &quot;Patch Objects After Error Solving&quot;.  Let it run wide open, log out, then log back in and try using the Maintain User Data session again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did that already as part of the installation instructions.  Didn't help. <br />
<br />
Thanks anyway,</div></div><hr />

After changing the form, Baan should recompile the object in other languages which might be issue. I that case you need to get in touch with support for the object.<br />

We had the same problem (but in the Spanish language)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will download the portuguese translations tomorrow.<br />
Thanks for the tip.</div></div><hr />

Of course, for the latest SP where no translation still exists, Baan should be able to provide a solution with the form dump or the form dump itself from one of their servers (as last resort...).<br />
And, as suggested, the PMCv2 part for handling of B languages can also give you some help there, and not only for tools (god knows how many times i have to copy components from lang. 2 to 5 or P or ...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the valuable tips Victor. We have all the translations up to SP8 installed.<br />
I didn't download the translations as suggested in the service pack installation guides immediatly because I suspected something was wrong with my test server hardware. Also I do my installations using the baan account which I have configured in an A-Language (English) and that problem also ocurred.<br />
Today I confirmed I had problems in my application hard disk. After changing that disk and restoring the backup of the real server all is ok now. I already installed service pack 9, translations and portuguese localizations and all is ok. Plus my club just won the UEFA cup ;)</div></div><hr />
