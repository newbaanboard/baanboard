anyways, for quick reference, I am qouting from the reply posted for that thread, by patvdv:<br />
<br />
You could check the PMC sessions Process patches to see which service packs are installed.<br />
<br />
I have also used a Baan binary which tells you which SP is installed, but am not able to remember...</div></div><hr />

I'm also using Baan V, I'm using Baan VC.<br />
I just installed Baan and service pack from SP3 to SP18.<br />
<br />
Before i read this topic, i also curios. Did my installation success?<br />
After i checked in session ttpmc2102m000, i saw SP3 - SP18 is installed.<br />
But when i open the session ttpmc2503m000, no record at all at that session.<br />
<br />
Is my installation success? and what is session ttpmc2503m000 for?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

In this case all necessary data is added to PMC to be able to continue with installation of individual solutions and subsequent service packs. You will not see history or installation runs.<br />
To see whether your installation is successful is difficult, because you had to do a lot of manual imports. But if you executed all steps in the installation guide and those steps were successful, you can be sure that the installation was successful. <br />
From now on every time you install a solution or range of solutions, an installation run will be created, which you can see in ttpmc2503m000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What kind of manual imports that i have to do to check it?<br />
or can we run something to test it?<br />
<br />
according to me, i did the installation exactly as the manual book. But still i'm not sure :confused: cause this is the first time i upgrade the service pack.<br />
<br />
If i'm in service pack 18, is it possible to install a solution again?<br />
AFAIK SP 18 is the latest service pack that include all solution. CMIIW<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st February 2006, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't mean that you have to do additional manual imports to check your installation. I meant that if you did all steps from the installation manual, your installation will be correct. <br />
<br />
However, I'm a little bit concerned about<br />
cause this is the first time i upgrade the service pack<br />
because the batch install solution (SP3-SP18 in one go) is not to be used for upgrades, but only for fresh installations, where the VRC structure follows the conventions described in the installation guide. <br />
So, if you upgraded an existing environment, you might have problems. In that case I would recommend you to contact SSA Support.<br />
<br />
You will be able to install solutions. But of course none of the solutions which are included in SP3-SP18 (if you imported the PMC registry correctly!). All solutions SSA makes on top of SP18 (and which will be included in SP19 or newer) can be installed.<br />

<br />
I'm sorry, I mean that &quot;this is the first time i did the batch installer from SP3-SP18.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about that. I did my installation on testing server. <br />
My boss won't let me did it on live server.<br />
<br />
But now, i'm having trouble with my testing server. I can't login to Baan.<br />
I think i didn't do anything yesterday or last few days.<br />

<br />
Continuing our last topic.<br />
I just read again on the manual book that if we want to install SP3-SP18 we must have porting set 7.1d.10 or later version.<br />
<br />
How can we check itu, is it from BECS in the column BW Version. But how to read it?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<br />
Sorry for delayed reply. Use session ttpmc2101m000 in BaaN-IV select Filter option and check option 'Installed Solution'. Here you will find Service Pack for Application and Tools.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can I see what service pack is running?</div></div><hr />
