<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">21st March 2003, 00:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I was wondering if there is a way to go to the shell from Baan without typing &quot;ksh&quot; at the run program.<br />
<br />
If there was someway we can go to the shell by having a menu item in the menu browser ??<br />
<br />
Basically we dont want to give access to run any program to the user. But we want to give them the ability to go to the shell. Ofcourse we can do a telnet, but I was hoping if there is an alternative to do this from Baan itself.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Manish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please fill up your profile with BaaN/OS/Database info.<br />
<br />
Yes it is possible to add the shell access or terminal emulator to your menu item by adding the session to the startup menu.<br />
<br />
Shell Access - ttstpshell<br />
Terminal Emulator - ttstpivtemul</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know about 'ottstpshell' and it is not really a ksh - BAAN has changed what some commands do like 'ps'.  <br />
<br />
I tried to run 'ottstpivtemul' and while I did not get an error, nothing else happened.  What is this supposed to be?  Is there something special that needs to be set?  Or might this be a BAAN V thing?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">21st March 2003, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">just opens a &quot;Unix&quot; window.  seems to be the exact same thing as typing the &quot;sh&quot; in the run program.<br />
<br />
Going by youre post - I assumed that you did not get any &quot;action&quot; at all after running the object.  So I guess you get the &quot;Unix&quot; window as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">21st March 2003, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah... when I thought about it, and looked again, the code that does work for me is 'ottstpvtemul'.  That extra letter 'i' should have caused an error I would think, but it didn't so it must exist as well.<br />
<br />
Is there a difference between 'ottstpvtemul' and 'ottstpivtemul'?  Other than the one with the 'i' doesn't do anything for me :D ?<br />
