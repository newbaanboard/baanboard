For the UNIX setup we use hpjetadmin for Solaris which does identify the printer using it's IP address.<br />

The Windows 2000 setup uses BWPRINT to interface to Baan. <br />

Can you please put a screen shot of the Device Data session for the printer with the IP address ?<br />
<br />
I am trying to setup the a Laser Printer in our network with an IP-Address and a printer name and its not yet working... :mad: <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think what Wayne and Neal are talking about is set up one box as print server, set up the IP printers on this box, share it from this box, and let Baan point to these shared printers from the box. This is how we handle our IP printers by the way. Am I right, Wayne &amp; Neal?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you are right we have our network printers running through a Windows 2000 print server and then simply connect via BW using the printer setups within the Windows client.<br />
<br />
For the device queue we either use the name of the networked printer;<br />
<br />
ie \\ARES\IT LaserJet 5000 <br />
<br />
This works on 2000 clients only or the printer name in the control panel which is better for 95/98 clients.<br />
<br />
ie HP LaserJet 4V.<br />
<br />
Using the BW method once you have a printer connected via windows then everything should be ok.<br />
<br />
For our printer which is connected directly via unix we have the following in the device queue;<br />
<br />
lp -c -d hplaser5000 -n%d %s -s<br />
<br />
See attachment for other values.<br />
<br />
Are you trying to connect your network printers via Windows or UNIX ?<br />
<br />
Hope some of this helps<br />

<br />
Well I got a wierd request from a remote site that they had a Windows laser printer - ABCD with an IP address 10.20.30.40 kind of.<br />
I set the device queue as \\10.20.30.40\ABCD<br />
<br />
I tried to set up the device data but they say that they are not able to take print outs. what kind of device type do we use?<br />
<br />
They are mostly on Windows-2000, NT and 98 desktops, with BW and Worktops.<br />
<br />
Any clues, what needs to be done for them to get the printouts? <br />
<br />
Thanks! :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I presume they are printing through windows ok.<br />
<br />
In that case all you need to do is to match the printer name within the clients control panel with that in the device queue.<br />
<br />
See screen dumps.<br />
<br />
This can be sometimes awkward on remote sites where the printer name on one client is slightly different to another but in that instance it can be just as easy to set up another device and then make it the default for the user within Baan.<br />
<br />
What you can do in Windows 2000 clients is to use the following syntax.<br />
<br />
\\ARES\IT LaserJet 5000 <br />
<br />
Where ARES is the name of the print server, in this instance you can get away with different names in the clients control panel.<br />
<br />
Hppe this helps<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

I have the same need (ie printing to the IP address) and it doesnt seem to work. <br />
It works fine if we use the printer name something like  \\ARES\IT LaserJet 5000 it works, but is there a way to make it work with IP.<br />
Reason i ask some time if the user load a different print driver on the client and use a different name this kind of one ---&gt; '\\ARES\IT LaserJet 5000' doesnt work</div></div><hr />
