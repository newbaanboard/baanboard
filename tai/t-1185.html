I have a table I created which has been running just fine.  I tested some sessions using the tabel in Development this morning and then copied them across to the live system.  However I get an error on the table.  When running General Table Maintenance I get an error 103 when trying to view the table.<br />
<br />
When I run the session associated with the table I get the BW error &quot;Read row error 401&quot; on the table?<br />
<br />
I looked up the error 103 and it mentions the following &quot;This indicates that an Illegal key description has been specified. Use the bdbpre and bdbpost tools to resolve.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am a little in the dark here regarding this error.  Should I drop the table completely and copy from the Development system across?<br />
<br />
Has anyone got any ideas or have you come across this problem before?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Jason</div></div><hr />

After that, use create runtime with reconfigure the table for this specific table.<br />

<br />
I see to have a bigger problem now.  I got to convert to runtime and it gives me the error message<br />
<br />
&quot;Dumping table definitions / domains not possible for package combination oper_001.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have never had a problem with this before, I am in the correct package combination.  Is it a poblem in that table thats causing this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But are the domains present on the live server ?<br />
Is there a permission problem ? See $BSE/dict/ddPCVRC/dmodule if all is OK.<br />

We are running Baan V on an AS400.  The domains are in the live system.  I cannot convert to runtime dictionary for anything now in that vrc?  I have always had permission.  I have asked the AS400 operator to look at the tables and my permission.<br />
<br />
This really baffles me!</div></div><hr />

It might help to check your Baan log files for suspicious messages in order to find the cause of the problem.</div></div><hr />
