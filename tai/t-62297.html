Is there any link between the Package combination attached with the user and the environment variables. <br />
<br />
Session_Timeout works if i login in specific pack.comb(linked with base VRC)but not does not work for some pack.comb(linked with derived VRCs). What could be the reason.<br />

Please help.<br />

As far as I know when we did have a timeout set it worked in any of the packages. I would say you best bet is to contact infor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
session_timeout has been set in all three places. <br />
<br />
In $BSE/lib/defaults/db_resource, it has been set as 120 and In $BSE/lib/defaults/all, it has been set as 60. Now i would like to override both and set as 30. So i used BW client configuration session_timeout=30. <br />
<br />
But it didn't work. As i mentioned it works if the user is linked with base VRC package combination, but not if linked with derived VRC package combination.</div></div><hr />
