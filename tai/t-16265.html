<br />
This is more of a curiosity than anything else, but we have encountered some strange behavior and were wondering if anyone else has come across this as well.  We have a W2K server running BaaN IVc4 on Oracle 8.1.7.  We have one particualr user who can log into Baan via the Baan client with two different passwords!  I tried logging in locally onto the W2k server itself and only one of the passwords worked.  Any clue on how this is possible?<br />
<br />
Thx.<br />

<br />
This might be caused by a double entry for the user in $BSE/lib/ora_users.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">13th August 2004, 10:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably there exist two users with same name and different password: domain user and server user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baangeek</div><div class="date">13th August 2004, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">kbartelds - I was suspecting a double entry in the ora_users file as well  but there wasn't one for that particular user, but there is one for another user who also exhibits the same behaviour.  <br />
<br />
jclju1 - It looks like you are are right.  I tried logging into baan with the domain level password of a couple of other users and I get access as well.  So that seems to be the root of it!<br />
<br />
Thx very much to the both of you!<br />

<br />
Anyway - the ora_users is the link between baan and the database<br />
not between your username and Baan.. you could have 1500 duplicate<br />
entries in that file and it wouldn't affect the os/baan login portion at all.<br />

<br />
Just wanted to let you guys know that the double login seems to be W2K related behavior.  We have an old baan server on WinNT and I tried it there and it didn't work.  Just thought I'd share that.  Thx again all of you!</div></div><hr />
