<br />
Last few days performance is very slow. We checked all the networking issue , LAN card , lease line and router. We are not able to trace the source of problem.<br />
Some times it takes 7-8 minutes to login in , but same time if I try to login in same server  through telnet , I am getting very quickly. Any execution from command prompt is fast. Most funny things is when we stuck in any session or in login at that time we checked the CPU uses are 15%-25% means 75%- 80% idle.  We are not using any third party software in our server. We are not using the baandb for other external software. Our  OS is UNIX and database is INFORMIX. <br />
<br />
Any body faced such problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reason was defect switches (on the gateway).<br />
<br />
After hardware exchange everythings works fine.<br />
<br />
Sympton:<br />
<br />
Sometimes fast, sometimes 30.000 ms response time without specific symptons (with or without networktraffic).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">2nd February 2007, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Jim van der Meij (where is the dude?) wrote an excellent document on troubleshooting Baan performance that was handed out during the 2003(?) BWU conference.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I lost my copy (along with the rest of my Baan library) so if anybody has it on file, send one my way too ;)<br />
<br />
In this case I am surprised that the BW doesn't time out in 7 minutes. Remember that the client-server connection is initiated from the VM (bshell) on the server side. I would say that the login goes just fine but a subsequent step in the process causes your issue.<br />
<br />
My personal rule of thumb: 99% of Baan performance problems occur in the database.</div></div><hr />

The dude [Jim Vandermey] is here (http://www.ostusa.com/about/ost_team.asp)... ;) <br />
<br />
I have Jim's 'Performance Tuning' document with title &quot;Why is Baan Slow? ...when everything else is faster&quot;. It's a 14mb presentation though, so not the easiest thing to send by e-mail...<br />

Just check it out what is the performance of your informix db server ( if its seprate ) . One thing you can do remove all the files from $BSE/tmp as well as increase the size of your /swap . if still you face a problem then tell me again we have the same scenario in my company. donot concetrate on the network some times it doesnt matter if you feel that its quite up to the mark. After deleting all file from /$BSE/tmp make one shutdown too. altogther upload the new patches if u use solaris unix or other.<br />
