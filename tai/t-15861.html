<br />
Before posting this query i tried searching the forum but couldn't find the exact topic. <br />
<br />
Basically my Production server is validated very recently and now because of some reasons i want to format the server and configure the RAID again. <br />
<br />
So my basic question is do i have to again contact baan for the licence ??????<br />
<br />
I will be doing fresh BaaN installation on this production server , the hardware, network card everything will remain the same. <br />
<br />
So What steps should i perform before formatting the server so that i can make use of this exisitng licence key for the Production server once baan is again installed.<br />
<br />
Is this sort of thing possible ??? any table backup i have to take ???<br />
<br />
It is something urgent. <br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
it is possible to run this from the command promt passing it the organisation name,customer,licence code and the security code,validation tools key from Baan. The last two are generated based on the macaddress of the windows machine (more complicated if it is a unix box also checks the cpu name.<br />
<br />
<br />
with this info brand can now be run again using the tools validation key which will greate the brand.lic file (this is the same as running the validate tools tools session ttiex3220m000)<br />
brand.exe -o &quot;organisation name&quot; -c &quot;customer number&quot; -l &quot;licence code&quot; -b &quot;security code&quot; -a &quot;validation tools key&quot;<br />
the licence service on the windows machine will now work (unless the nic has been changed).</div></div><hr />
