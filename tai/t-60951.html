<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">3rd August 2011, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">514 error means your group user for the database cannot log in to the database. Most likely, the encrypted password in $BSE/lib/db/db_groups is out of sync with the password that is set at the database level.<br />
<br />
If you can log in at the database level with your group user, e.g., baandb; then use the $BSE/bin/encrypt6.2 to encrypt that password. <br />
<br />
For instance if the password is P4$$w0rd you would issue the following command<br />
# encrypt6.2 P4$$w0rd<br />
<br />
that in return will give you a string you can place in $BSE/lib/db/db_groups<br />
like so:<br />
<br />
baandb:JL2#4%)('[asdfkLnda12klK}}<br />
<br />
then save that password. <br />
<br />
Once you know it works also do not forget to type that string via GTM in ttdba020 Database Group Password for the group user because otherwise, next time you do a convert to run time you will corrupt the $BSE/lib/db/db_groups <br />
<br />
(This whole time I've referred to the groups file as $BSE/lib/db/db_groups, replace the leters db with your database, ora for oracle, inf for informix, sql for Microsoft SQL and so forth)<br />
<br />
Basically, the reason why you obtain the 514 is all users should have a database user. However, none have permissions to perform any alter operations at the database level. The only database user that is authorized to perform add, remove, modify actions at the database level is the group user which you can see is linked to all the database users. So, this explains why you can log in because for logging in, the ERP uses the database user to authenticate that new connection but and all users have access to read but that is it. When it comes to make a change like creating a table if the group user cannot log in then you will get a 514 error. <br />
<br />
Of course, the problem could be something else but in my experience this is the most common reason and solution to this message given the situation. <br />
