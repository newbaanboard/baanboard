<br />
If you really feel that the .brand file is corrupt, the last option might be to revalidate the tools set and regenerate the .brand file. Then you can try printing RSC again. Of course, please take a backup before &quot;trying&quot; anything at all.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

but I can't remember exactly what the error was... the thing is that I had to change /usr/baan/bse/lib/licence6.1. <br />
this file had the hostname, &quot;Baanpro&quot;, I changed it and put the IP number. and I finally could start baan...<br />
Everything was ok until now, that the &quot;security key&quot; can't be printed. I checked out the log files, for example the &quot;log.brand6.1&quot; and it said = ' Baanpro`not listed in /usr/baan/bse/lib/licence6.1<br />
<br />
What can I do??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jshanks</div><div class="date">28th January 2010, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Open the licence6.1 file and add Baanpro along with the IP.<br />

So the file should look something like this:<br />
<br />
Baanpro, 10.10.10.10<br />
<br />
(Substiture the IP with the correct one)<br />
<br />
Let us know if it worked.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jshanks</div><div class="date">28th January 2010, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">This file is set when Baan is first installed and licensed.<br />
<br />
You don't have to shutdown Baan but it might be better to do this when there are no active transactions. Also, block the jobs from firing before changing. The reason is that it might generate a license error and throw the users out. Ideally it shouldn't because you have the IP address in there as well, but don't take any chances with production system.<br />
<br />
So make sure there are no active users, login into Baan first as 'bsp' or a super user and then change the file.<br />
<br />
Retry the Print RSC.<br />
<br />
Remember to take a backup of any file/directory that you are changing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">28th January 2010, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of things.<br />
<br />
First: your error is around the brand6.1 binary.<br />
<br />
Can you run it from the command line? brand6.1 -U should give you usage. (we're just verifying if the brand6.1 actually works, so if that prints out the usage then you're set.)<br />
<br />
Second: Don't touch your .brand file at all, Baan uses the inode of the file to ensure security. copying it, backing it up, restoring it will switch the inode and make the file invalid.<br />
<br />
Third: Are you running this as bsp or root? The licensing process is kind of a dance, there is a quickguide to take you through it on the Baan support site, I'd recommend following that to the T.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd be careful messing with your license6.1 file. it's easy to change but I wouldn't recommend adding a hostname and the ip for that hostname there.<br />
Just use one or the other. <br />
<br />
If your baan server is called Baanpro and you can &quot;ping&quot; that name and have it return your server from that box, then that is fine. Otherwise use the IP address.<br />
<br />
Also what does the output of licmon6.1 -B or licmon6.1 -b (I don't have it in front of me) should print out your brand info.<br />

jclju1 is right. The -B option shows the shared memory anf file information !<br />

Usage: licmon6.1 [-vVdbBwkusc][-h host][-p num]<br />
   -v       : show version<br />

   -w       : show users<br />
   -W       : show other connections<br />

<br />
i'm guessing that there was no license6.1 file when you started licd6.1.<br />
<br />
i'd recommend putting baanpro back into your licence6.1 file (as the only entry) <br />
<br />
if you can't ping baanpro from the commandline, of it takes you to a place that isn't your machine, then you should update your /etc/hosts to reflect that.<br />
<br />
(assuming that your hostname really should be baanpro)<br />
<br />
then try your licensing again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fdeivis</div><div class="date">29th January 2010, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">ok dave, but, can I change the licence6.1 file, while baan is up?? or should I shut it down first? because, if after i change licence6.1 baan can't start, i wont be able to licencing and repair the damage... because that's what happened before, i could not start  baan, i could not login baan in anyway....  this  is a little confusing.. because i've never had this error before.. and I'm messing with baan production.<br />
<br />
Thankyou dave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">30th January 2010, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">When you make the change, then any new logins will be affected by the change (existing ones shouldn't be affected)<br />
<br />
so in your case - you should probably make the change after hours.<br />
<br />
if you can ping baanpro from the command line and the IP is your baan server then you should be able to log in just fine.<br />
