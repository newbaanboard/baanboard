<br />
Thanks for your response, I tried to see all log files, but there is not as such file where is stored all activity which is done by “secure” ID, there is error log other log is there but what I want its not there,<br />
<br />
I want to know, what “secure” ID is given access &amp; remove , these all activity I need date time wise<br />
<br />
For example: I login by “secure” ID and given “Item Master” session access  to one user for the time and after some time removed, how Auditor know this activity happened what date &amp; time<br />
<br />
I hope you understand what I want to know,<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

<br />
if no , then put it under audit for future log.</div></div><hr />

You can turn that on for a specific user. (Sorry, I don't have the session right in front of me, but it's around Maintain User Data.) It also depends on your Baan version.<br />
<br />
Then it will create a file called $BSE/lib/TIME.HIS which logs every session/object the user touches.<br />
<br />
once you've turned it on, you can parse the TIME.HIS logfile using my little perl program:<br />
