<br />
We are currently on Baan ERP5.0C SP 18 operating in a multisite environment with Single logistics - Multi finance scenario.  We are exploring the possibility of rolling out Baan in Japan ( and possibly China). We want to use English as the system language , but be able to use third party software which feeds off the Baan database and creates local language documentation at customer interface points. For example Order Acknowledgements, Quotes, Sales Invoices, Delivery notes etc. <br />
<br />
I want to ask our knowledgeable forum members if anyone has been down this path succesfully and are willing to share their experiences. <br />
Are there any proven third party Japanese software tools capable of interfacing with Baan and produce the required Customer facing documentation.<br />
<br />

<br />
1. Force the users in Asian countries to use English interface and input English data. This works if they don't have much domestic sales in Asian countries.<br />
<br />
2. Installing a separate server for each Asian country. For example, one server in Chinese language for China office, one server in Japanese language for Japan office. For such case, single logistics and multiple finance does not work as it is not possible to share data among different application server with different locales.<br />
<br />
Our suggestion is to go Unicode installation if you forecast a good business growth in Asian countries.</div></div><hr />
