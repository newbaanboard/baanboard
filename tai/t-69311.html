<br />
when i login with baan user, it says &quot;user account locked out..&quot;. i think it was locked due to the accout policy in the AD but i do not see baan user in my domain and hence i do not know how to start it up.<br />
<br />
i have demo user as well. but when i log into it, bshell starts but nothing happens. i do not see menu browser. it just hangs up. i tried setting -keeplog -logfile filename but no logs generated. this is an old server and i just need to log into it. what are the things i need to check/investigate here? any clues?? <br />
<br />
demo user is not in the domain as well. there seems to be some problem with db connectivity but i am not sure how to resolve it. nothing in the eventviewer as well nothing in $BSE/log as well.<br />
<br />
package combination is b61a and db oracle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, check if there is an entry in ora_users file in $BSE/li directory.<br />
<br />
Check if the shared memory,printer daemon etc processes are active?<br />
<br />
try to access the DB tables from sql, then i think you would require to check the DB references in the tabledef file, if the location specified are active</div></div><hr />

what happens if you try to log in with the BW (without Worktop) ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
@lebowski - I tried running BW independently but its the same. The bshell starts but no menu browser showed up.<br />
<br />
The user exists, the data exists, the db is up and running, the daemons and services all are running just fine.</div></div><hr />
