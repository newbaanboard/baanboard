Usually in most instances I give a few users permissions to it using ttaad2132m000(Session authorizations by session/user).  In most cases this is taken care of by our DEM manager, but sometimes people get missed.<br />
<br />
Now to move a session from demo company to production company depends on some things. Are they on different systems?  This is our case so we use customization projects to export and import them to the sessions.  I do not recall the session names and numbers, this is handled by our app admin.  If they both companies are on the same machine and share a VRC structure then should just be able to copy them to the other VRC.  Do not forget to re-compile them.  This really depends on your setup.  This is also probably a better questions for the tools administration area.  So I will move it to that forum.<br />

Good Luck!<br />

<br />
there are two options,<br />
<br />
1. if the demo and the production companies are in  different servers,  u need to export/import the data dictionary of that program alongwith the form, script, table def &amp; Domains(if anything new is created for this session), use ttiex1280m000 to export and ttiex1285m000 to import the DD.<br />
<br />
2. If both the companies are in the same server, login into the formal company, change the current package VRC of ur user and take the required Package and the package combination of ur formal company, search for the new program which u have developed for ur demo company and copy that to the current package VRC. Compile the script, dump the forms and do the convert to runtime for  that particular session, tables &amp; domains(if copied the same from the demo company). logout and relogin it will start working. <br />
<br />
In both the cases, u need to take the help of your Baan Admin to do the job smoothly. <br />
<br />
Hope it will help u.<br />
