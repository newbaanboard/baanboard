<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuple9i</div><div class="date">8th September 2006, 05:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been testing my backups for useability and I am running into this problem. It probably is a simple fix, but I can't seem to find an answer. I have spent a few hours on this board trying different searches.<br />
<br />
1) Setup server with new O/S - totally fresh install<br />
2) Configure Virtual Drives (Win2000 Advanced Server)<br />
3) Install Oracle database binaries (with starter database done in the install)<br />
4) Recover original Oracle database from tape - setup and check for proper operation<br />
5) Install Vanilla BaaN  - XCOPY original BaaN to overlay Vanilla install<br />
6) Make sure all processes are installed properly<br />
7) Test ability to call BaaN using BWC<br />
<br />
Here is the problem: Steps 1 through 7 are just fine. I can connect to the original database using the original BaaN, no errors, but only locally on the server. When I try to use a remote client, from my or others PC, the splashscreen comes up and poof - disappears!<br />
<br />
I am stumped. If you have any ideas, please submit them. Anything would be helpful (well, almost anything  :D   )<br />
<br />
I have used this approach in the past with no problems, but now???<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">8th September 2006, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">what is Vanilla BaaN ?<br />
Some customers give each stage of there envionments (develop, test) a different name. I suppose Vanilla is just a name for one of these environments.<br />
<br />
Regarding the original question: I have no idea (yet).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuple9i</div><div class="date">8th September 2006, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the confusion. Vanilla BaaN is right out of the box, no modifications to the install outside of BSE or other normal variables. I use the original (existing) BaaN environment that is overlayed after the initial install to get to the environment I need.<br />
<br />
This works fine up until now. I have been thinking about the problem, maybe I need to bounce the license server? The install was done on a server that already had an entry in the license server, so I didn't bounce it.<br />
<br />
Still stumped and thank you for your quick response.<br />
