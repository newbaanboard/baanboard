<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">edycus</div><div class="date">4th December 2006, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I am running Becs B40c.77<br />
and<br />
IBaan Worktop 2.2.34<br />
<br />
We are migrating to a different Baan server and I'm looking to automate the process of converting the users and standardize their setup.<br />
<br />
I have all the configuration info figured out except the ClassID in the Baan client and the Worktop sct file. I'm not sure what it it used for and want to to careful before I make eveyones configuration info the same ClassID. IT appear when you creadt a new server entry in baan client it give it a new ClassID and stores that value in the registry. I would love to make everyones ClassID the same to aid in depolyemnt. This would mean that I don't have to go and setup everyone BECS on each PC. <br />
<br />
If I can keep everyone Becs / ClassID the same then I remotly deploy the new setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alternatively, you can consider using Worktop Central Deployment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">edycus</div><div class="date">6th December 2006, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info. We don't use SMS or central deployment. I have found another way that I will post in this message. I was mainly worried about the client ID being deplicated but tested it doesn't seem to matter. I just wanted to be sure and ask. <br />
<br />
Of course to do this you need to be logged in as someone that has admin access to the computernames you are installing this on<br />
<br />
run from a command prompt BaanConfig.bat Computername<br />
<br />
What the bat file will do<br />
Copy over Baan configuration and Worktop configuration to the computername<br />
Uses the psexe program to copy over another bat file BaanReg.bat to the computername and then runs it on that computer <br />
Add registry entires for the new Baan profiles<br />
runs a vbs file to will change the baan configuration files to the correct computername. <br />
The vbs file will search for the newest worktop menu file and copy it to to be the menu of the new Baan session<br />
Then the program deletes the vbs file from the computername.<br />
<br />
<br />
I rolled these out to about 50 PCs and it worked without a problem. :)</div></div><hr />
