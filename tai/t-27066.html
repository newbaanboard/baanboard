<br />
open a shell from within a baan session of a user that has the permission to do so. Usually the user bsp can start shells.<br />
(Enter '&lt;' in choice field of baan menu if you are using ba6.1 or use the 'start shell' button in the option dialog if you are using GUI).<br />
Simply type 'echo $BSE_TMP' and you will see where your tempfiles live.<br />

P.S.: I assume that you're not a native english speaker (neither am I btw) - just a hint:<br />
'please find a solution' isn't polite, even if it there is a 'please' in it... this sounds more like a command than a request. <br />
But no offence taken as I strongly assume that none was meant :-)</div></div><hr />

touch $BSE/tmp/hello<br />
<br />
To see if you have write permission to that directory.<br />

If this is set then that is the number of hours that the report is saved in the temp directory before deleting the file.  Just something to look into.</div></div><hr />
