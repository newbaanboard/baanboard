Is this cartridge a phyiscal thing I go out and buy, or is there software I can download.  <br />
<br />
Also the QG 1307 indicates it only works with HP laserjet 4 and can only print numeric barcodes. Is this true?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose that you are working with Unix.<br />
The printer cartridge was a optional device to be installed on old hp LASERJET printer (laserjet III and IV).<br />
AFAIK hP doesn't more produce this part. It exist some other vendors of compatible cartridges.<br />
<br />
If you need specific barcode you should need to update the file type01 ($BSE/lib/barcode/hp). Therefor you need the technical manual delivered with the cartridge<br />
<br />
You can also use other printers, like the Kyocera 1750 printers, that support barcoding without cartridge<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ranias</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also download the fonts of the coding you chose for your barcode for example you can go to this link: http://www.makebarcode.com/software/printerfonts.html<br />
and download some of the demo fonts in order to copy then and load them into your HP Laser 4 printer without purchasing any hardware.<br />
<br />
You can afterwards print out the PCL fonts in the printer after loading them to make sure the fonts does exist.<br />
<br />
Hope this would be helpful.</div></div><hr />

You are likely to be looking to use code39 or code128.  If you persevere with the HP website, you will eventually be directed to a 3rd party partner who specialises in barcode fonts for HP laserjet printers either available as DIMMS or soft fonts (dependant on printer model).  More info at...<br />
http://www.hp.com/sbso/product/printing/laserjetfonts/barcode.html <br />
<br />
However, I would strongly advise you to look into using BWprint for your barcode printing - it is MUCH easier!<br />
