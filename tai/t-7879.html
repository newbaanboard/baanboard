On one server (a) as a matter of making sure everything is o.k I converted the RunTime (domain/tables) on all VRC's and everthing is fine.<br />
<br />
On the second server (b) I run into problems such as errors saying the data defintion is not present (which it is - then I re-imported it again from my trusted server to make sure as it may have been corrupted).  I also get errors saying the table does not exist....<br />
<br />
I have spent a week on this.....I am now thinking of copying the &quot;dict&quot; directory from my &quot;a&quot; server (the one that the RDD worked) to my problem server &quot;b&quot;.  <br />
I have also looked at the tools tables that hold the revelent info and if I dump and load the data from the &quot;a&quot; server to my &quot;b&quot; server for the following tables = This should result in the actual Runtime Data Dictionary being the same ?<br />

for finding table tabledef6.1 ist resp.,<br />
for dd, srdd6.1 and file of pack. comb (fd...),<br />
check the path<br />
or is the $BSE-path different ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">29th November 2002, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">our original server  was a dev server (1 tier).<br />
We now have 2 new servers (a,b).  We will scrap the original server eventually.<br />
<br />
The 2 new servers a and b have the exact same dir structure and are also 1tier.<br />
<br />
Both a and b servers were &quot;copied&quot; from the original server.<br />
<br />
The &quot;a&quot; server and its Baan instance is working fine as far as the runtime is concerned.<br />
<br />
The &quot;b&quot; server has problems which I have gievn up trying to fix, so I would like to copy the runtime as in my original post.<br />
<br />
I will also add the srdd_tab6.1 ,compnr6.1, tabledef6.1  files that are to be copied from the &quot;a&quot; server to the &quot;b&quot; server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rochus</div><div class="date">29th November 2002, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, if the os is the same, copy<br />
everything, you can direct the licence6.1 also<br />
to the old server<br />
then restart stdd_init (rc.start_shm)<br />
is the database also in the same path (oracle_home) ?</div></div><hr />
