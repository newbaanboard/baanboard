<br />
After installing BaanERP with SQL.on W2K<br />
I am getting an Error Message &quot;You have no license to run the Bshell anymore&quot;..and the browser shuts down..<br />
I guess it should have started up with a message ..abt Demo version for 30 Days..<br />
I tried cleaning up the registries for earlier installations of Baan...<br />
Wld appreciate any inputs..<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Put your system date back so that your installation can be recognized again as in 'demo' mode.<br />
<br />
2. Rebrand your environment from the command line with brand6.2 (if you re-installed the environment)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a possibility to consider.<br />
<br />
With W2K, I ran into this when a machine was licensed without a network cable attached.  Later when the machine was hooked to the network,  that bshell message appeared.<br />
<br />
Apparently, this has to do with the Windows sensing feature and mac address that is built into the validation coding.<br />
<br />
See Baan's solution   113902</div></div><hr />

I am fiddling around with a Demo version..<br />
Hence the probs .. I guess..<br />
But normally I am able to run the 30 Day Demo version..<br />
Unless Baan was previously installed in that machine..<br />
I tried stuff like backdating and rebranding...<br />
It stores the info abt the previous installs.. but I was unable to locate it...<br />
And yeah as u mentioned it uses the Windows sensing mechanism.. So a change of networks or domains too make a diff..<br />
I guess the last option would be to reinstall W2K and then Baan..<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />
