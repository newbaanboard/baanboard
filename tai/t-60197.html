<br />
Password management is, basically:<br />
<br />
 Setting a general (for all users) time period to enforce password change.<br />
 Automatically enforcing every user to change password in defined periods.<br />
 Setting an initial password for a new user / forgotten password. <br />
 Setting some rules for password itself (at least 6 char long., etc...)<br />
 History management ( for example last 4 password cannot be used,..)<br />
<br />
There is a session in Baan 6. But it dosen't manage password. <br />
<br />
Any  idea, solution is wellcome.</div></div><hr />

Baan uses the Operating System's password management. <br />
Use search option on the forum with the keyword 'password aging' and you will find many threads.<br />
<br />
Refer to -<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">11th March 2011, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Password aging can be implemented in a Baan system that resides in UNIX very easily (granted the UNIX administrator already enabled it for all the users at the OS level). There are two relevant solutions that need to be reviewed on how to configure password aging within the application to enable it.<br />
<br />
Password aging in Baan is only responsible for:<br />
<br />
a) Allowing password change granted there are no restrictions on the account, e.g., account is already expired, or password was changed already and there is a rule that says at the OS level that users can only change password once a day, and so forth.<br />
b) Notifying users if the account password is about to expire and give the option to change password and allow the use of the session change password if the user desires to do so, granted there are no restrictions on the user account at the OS level as exemplified above.<br />
<br />
The rest of the tasks fall directly on the UNIX administrator, Baan password aging will never allow a user to unlock his or her own account.  That is a task only the UNIX administrator can do.<br />
<br />
The two solutions that need to be reviewed under infor365 - Downloads - BAAN / LN - Direct search are:<br />
a) 119781 How to activate password aging for UNIX using the Baan GUI<br />
b) 117156 Correct UNIX authorization of the binary badmin6.2<br />
<br />
<br />
Like nprao mentioned, all this functionality is built around PAM so the password aging object makes calls to the binary (Badmin6.x) that subsequently makes all the PAM library calls and these libraries either validate, authenticate, verify users accordingly. <br />
<br />
PAM is implemented in every flavor of UNIX differently and also the libraries to use will be different depending on the authentication mechanism, LDAP, Kerberos, passwd, etc.</div></div><hr />
