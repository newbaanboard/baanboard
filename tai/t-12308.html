Do a query on Intermec on the board for some discussion that took place earlier.<br />
<br />
From your profile I believe you are using BWPrint to print the barcodes to the HP laserjet. HP laserjet uses PCL whereas Intermec uses IPL. There are windows drivers for Intermec printers, but I do not know what you will have to do to make it work with BWPrint.<br />
<br />
One of the options is to use a software in between like Streamserve ($$$).<br />
The other is to design the label using a software like Loftware (free to try from their website) or Bartender. You can capture the resultant output (use Redmon, the actual code that gets sent to the printer) and do the same thing in Baan.<br />
<br />
asap? That will cost rupees :).</div></div><hr />

It works properly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">16th June 2008, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Barcode printers like Intermec, Zebra, TEC etc provide own codes to generate barcodes. You will check the printers manual to retrieve the correct codes for printing a barcode from intermec. <br />
<br />
Basicly you will need to put a the printercommands on the report layout. Standaard Baan layout commands and barcode formatting wil normally not work when using Intermec, Zebra etc. as these printers a a different printer language instead of PCL 5 / PCL 6.<br />
<br />
So, check the programming manual of your printer device.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At our site we are printing from Baan to Intermec Label printers.<br />
As we have seen it - it is not as straightforward as printing to laster printers.<br />
<br />
The reason is that label printers mfrs have their properiety languages like IPL or DP for Intermec.<br />
<br />
We use bartender (BT-E3 BarTender Enterprise ) to design the label and convert the format to a file in the printer language.  Bartender needs to be licensed - :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
The file is placed in a Unix directory, with placeholders for &quot;variable data&quot;.<br />
<br />
When printing a report - you need to write a custom dll to replace the variables with actual data and send the file to the label printer (like an lp -d)<br />
<br />
No driver is required in Unix - in this case.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

This means do not use a printerdriver when configuring the queue. You can setup a Baan report and just enter the Intermec printercode together with your report layout in your report.. The printer will recognize this the printercodes.</div></div><hr />
