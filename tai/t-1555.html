<br />
When I am logging into baan I am getting this error<br />
<br />
&quot;Maximim number of records(800) reached for ttttxt001&quot;<br />
<br />
and closes. So I am unable to use menu browser.<br />
<br />
This happened after I installed the demo tables for comp 550.<br />
<br />
I am using BaaN IV B2, Informix 7.2 and NT 4<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Srinivas</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">2nd April 2002, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Your description of the problem indicates to me that you're running a demo licence. It's known that Baan limits the amount of records in certain tables and the tttxt001.<br />
<br />
Think you need to re-licence your system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">3rd April 2002, 08:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. I am using under demo license 30 day trial period.<br />
<br />
This error has been rectified after I ran this command<br />
<br />
$BSE\bin&gt;bw ottiexpatch<br />
<br />
The 30 day license is re activated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mihamax</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I've the same problem, but that libne doesn't help me much.<br />
My system is... was licensed, but the license daemon dies quickly as the system starts, so bw begins as a demo one.<br />
After running the instruction above, nothing happens....<br />
has anyone some idea why this is happening and how can I restore the baan normal state?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">24th January 2005, 06:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Mihamax,<br />
<br />
You need to perform steps of soft crash.<br />
<br />
But I would recommend to contact to BaaN support immediately.<br />
<br />
	1	Restore back-up (optional)<br />
It may be necessary to restore a back-up on the system.<br />
	2	Remove the /.brand/.brand6.1 file<br />
To prevent the license daemon from starting up, the /.brand/.brand6.1 file must be removed.<br />
	3	Run the rc.start shell script<br />
Next, the rc.start shell script must be run to initialize both the printer daemon and the shared memory.<br />
	4	Validate Tools Set (ttiex3220m000)<br />
Next, the Validate Tools Set (ttiex3220m000) session is run to create a new /.brand/.brand6.1 file.<br />
	5	Configure Application (ttiex3225m000)<br />
Finally, all objects are patched in the Configure Application (ttiex3225m000) session.<br />
<br />
Srinivas, <br />
<br />
In the demo company limitations has knownly incorporated, you may find, it will allow to add only 200 items in the item master.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

We'll see after that, what will appear next... I think it'll take some days. My baan is on winNT. You are saying something about backup. Do you know a certain baan strategy for this backup, or you do mean just saving the directory structure and data?<br />
Thx a lot,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mihamax</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">re-licensed and 's ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">28th January 2005, 06:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice to see your success. :) <br />
<br />
Do you know a certain baan strategy for this backup, or you do mean just saving the directory structure and data? <br />
<br />
Yes, I was pointing out directory structure and data.<br />
<br />
And backup strategy is depends on how your business afford, require and demand. I would suggest, prepare any strategy which will be proven in terms of zero data loss and less time consuming.<br />
<br />
My strategy I have posted here, which is agreed by my management. <br />
