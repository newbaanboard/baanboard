<br />
I have an question about clustering of the LN Software. Do you have guys already implement an ln cluster Installation? If yes, how did you guys do that?<br />
<br />
My first try was to install the application on an shared storage and got 2 Servers who has access to the shared storage. It works, but is extremly slow. Another disadvantage: if i want to Install an solution or do an upgrade, you have an downtime because of changes on the dictionary. So its not the best solution. An windows failover cluster is possible, but has the same Issue. <br />
<br />
Has anyone an solution for my &quot;problem&quot;. I want an Implementation with 99% availability.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
