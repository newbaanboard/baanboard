<br />
I was working only on tools and development since last 3 years. I have very limited knowledge of Admin, installations, Unix etc but now I want to learn that. As they say, it's never too late.  <br />
<br />
I understand it is complicated and difficult to explain in short, but it will be great if anyone could guide me where to start with and how to go about it.<br />
<br />
I have some basic questions regarding this. I will appreciate if anyone could help me.<br />
1. What is porting set and exactly what is it used for?<br />
2. What is purpose of 'Protocol' and 'Port Number' in BW configuration properties?<br />
3. What are environment variables? And what is its purpose?<br />
4. How does database server get configured? <br />
5. Purpose of each directory in $BSE.<br />
6. How do third party integrations (eg. Crystal Report) work?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />
