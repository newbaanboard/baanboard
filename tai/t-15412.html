	We normally lease our servers. And every time our BaaN server goes off lease and we get new a server as you know we need to re-license it. Before BaaN was taken over by SSA we did not had any problem in getting the new license keys even without having BaaN support but now with SSA one need to have BaaN support to get the license keys. Since we donÂ’t want to re-open our support agreement with BaaN (costs to much!), I was just wondering is there anything we can to do prevent this re-licensing issue every time we change servers.<br />
	<br />
	Is it possible to install the license key on a separate box that works as the license server? Is there a different type of license we need to get from BaaN to have it work as one license for all the BaaN servers?<br />
<br />
	Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
Now, on the separate machine, in order to install the license server, what other BaaN component needs to be installed? Do I install just the binaries or do I need to install the application as well?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you will also need few file from lib, for example licence6.1!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">makiju</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Not needed... We use this method in clustered systems. Just put licd6.1 somewhere and run it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what you see is confusing, but quite correct!!!<br />
<br />
The form/table, which s used to enter the security key always contains exactly one row. This is the row, where the session &quot;Print requested system conf&quot; was executed last.<br />
<br />
So if baan send you two security key, one for seq no 1 and one for seq no 2, simply fail over, enter the whole data (ie. the seq. the configuration keys and the security key) and validate.<br />
<br />
You might find that the field to enter the security key is not enabled. In the ascii Interfacee you had to press the group key &quot;s&quot; to get there. In the GUI it should be that button, which looks with a bit of imagination like a butterfly.<br />
