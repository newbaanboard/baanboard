<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davismit</div><div class="date">15th December 2009, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,  I have been though the other posts for licence and security files but dont see anything that fits this message I got, appologies if I have missed a post that covers this.<br />
<br />
<br />
B5.0_c AIX<br />
<br />
we have just tried to install the service pack and porting set into our live environment and had a major issue.<br />
<br />
After upgrading the porting set to 8.5a.02 from 8.4c.01, when restarting Baan we got the following message when we tried to access any session (we got this message in all modules not just the tm example below).<br />
<br />
No license to run object '/baan/bse/application/tm2.2_a/otmboa/oboasyncpro<br />
c' (productId 0) - Tools Security File PVRC not found in Master Security File.<br />
<br />
I put the original porting set back on (from *.old backup'd files) and Baan was back to normal. <br />
<br />
Leaving the porting set until we found an answer for this message we decided to install the service pack solutions and found that after afew tools solutions were installed we then got the same message when we tried to open any session in baan again.<br />
<br />
The original porting set was still on at this time so it was decided to just overwrite the porting set files again with the *.old backups and this again let us into Baan and let us continue with the remaining solution install and create runtime etc.<br />
<br />
I know need to put the porting set on but need to find out why Baan locks everything out when I do this.<br />
<br />
There was nothing in the SLM log.<br />
<br />
I dont believe this has anything to do with the new porting set or the service pack but has something to do with our environment that means if anything has changed we get this message regardless of SLM working fine.<br />
<br />
Any Ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />

Installing a solution for that package should bring those security files back<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if you can file ibic files within any of the /baan/bse/application/tm directories it is possible the Package derivation files is not set up correctly; therefore, check the $BSE/lib/fd* files to make sure the paths within that file for that package are pointing to the correct location.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This happens for all packages, the tm was just an example.  Also when we do the porting set upgrade we never overwrite the fd file so nothing should change.  All security files sit in the correct VRC (base layer) and the master security file tab.reg isnt changed by the upgrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
Reverting the porting set everything works again but I have found that when I run ibic_info6.2 -S all then the output gives me the error &quot;cannot find package security file&quot; for all the packages but they are there.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">18th December 2009, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">That is very strange.  There are many factors that can be causing this, 1. Current system service pack level (both tools and applications should be the same but specify if different and why)   2. Current portingset version and portingset version to which you are upgrading  3. OS and patch level for the runtime c libraries (requirements for target portingset)  4. Whether you are using SLM or license daemon could be also affecting, version of SLM. <br />
<br />
I would open an incident with Infor providing them with all this information.</div></div><hr />
