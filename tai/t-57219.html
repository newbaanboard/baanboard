<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SergioRdz</div><div class="date">11th November 2009, 05:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everybody<br />
<br />
I ask for your help, because I'á¸¿ getting crazy.<br />
<br />
I have less than one year working with Baan and I don't know it very well yet. We use BaanIVc4<br />
<br />
I am in charge of administration and  I'm still in training. My problem (big problem I would say) is when I'm asked to move components from Development VRC to Production VRC.<br />
<br />
Why is it a problem?......let me tell you. <br />
<br />
Usually Developers ask me to release a customization wich includes a big number of components (from 3 to +500) such as scripts, reports, forms, tables, sessions, etc. The way I do this is creating a dump in the session ttiex1280m000 in development VRC and then import it in ttiex1285m000 in production VRC.<br />
<br />
The BIG problem is that as a backup I have to create individual dumps for each component that exists in production VRC because if I make a single dump with all the components I could not restore any component in individual way. This consumes too long!!<br />
<br />
In my old job I used to work with MFG/Pro wich uses PROGRESS and move customizations from develpoment to production was as simple as copy the object from development server and paste it to production server , they were no more than 10 objects per customization (a single compiled object used to include report, form, script, etc)<br />
<br />
I hope you understand that this new way of work for me is too desperate because it takes me tooooo much time release customizations to production environment.<br />
<br />
I hope there is a more efficient way of do this, and I thank you very much if you share with me the way you do this in your work.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

Well, yes. Administrating a heavy customized environment like yours will be a little bit more complex than MGF/Pro.<br />
<br />
In general lines, I believe that you are doing well. Steps more, steps less, it is the used way. Perhaps PMC solution will help you on this. You should put a support order at Infor to have the guidelines to do this.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

The solution is quite simple. Use PMC. You can use it like Infor uses it to distribute solutions. It's really a very strong tool in order to keep your software consistent.<br />
<br />
Start on the development server the session ttpmc1100m000. Create a solution. Add components, generate the dependencies, export the solution.<br />
Before doing this you probably have to define your base vrc on both development and production<br />
<br />
Scan the solution on production, install it with the save components option. This is important because only than you will be able to roll back the installation.<br />
<br />

<br />
So let me investigate about how PCM works.<br />

It helps in better tracking of the customizations, too. At the same time, it simplifies the PMC creation process.<br />
