In the session it shows as inserted, but, when we actually look in to the table<br />
through GTM there is no record available in table.<br />
<br />
The inserted record is shown in the session until we press refresh but its not <br />
seen in the table. Does anyone has any idea whats happening?   :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with dave 23, it is that you have misplaced / missed out the commit.transaction()</div></div><hr />

This standard session is available from Baan V onwards.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that the commit is missed.<br />
May be an error is returned by the dal, but no error message is in the buffer to be shown to the user? I could not reproduce the situation you have. :(</div></div><hr />
