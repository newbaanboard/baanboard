<br />
tell me we are having 40 user linces but now wht we are facing is that after 23 or 25 user the baanwindow get hanged and no user is able to login. the licmon is still working if i will try to remove the lincense from licmon6.1 it is not possible to remove all the linces. we have to manually kill all the user from unix prompt after that from bshell process and then from tbase process .<br />
<br />
after that i hav been  stopping  the baan using ./rc.stop<br />
than to start it from the ./rc.start. that is a temp solution<br />
<br />
the server config.-<br />
1. processor-AS1200<br />
2. ram -512<br />
3. 18 gb hdd(2)<br />
4. 9 gb hdd(3)<br />

<br />
just some ideas:<br />
1) when 'users hang' ... what is the CPU-usage like? Are you running a single CPU system?<br />
2) Does this situation occur regularly when a certain number of users are using Baan? Or is this the case rather when certain sessions are used?<br />
3) You wrote that you kill the users from unix prompt ... how do you do this exactly?<br />
The right way would be to use bshcmd6.1 -e -u1 -w1 {PID_of_bshell} ....<br />
this way all corresponding processes like ba6.1 and tbase6.1 will be terminated too. Especially your mentioning of having to kill tbase processes hints that you are terminating ba6.1 or bshell6.1 processes with the 'kill' command. <br />
This (killing tbase processes) will in most cases leave your tbase unstable and force a restart of tbase, often a lengthy process, as tables that have been marked 'dirty' (=open in update mode) will be checked and repaired.<br />
