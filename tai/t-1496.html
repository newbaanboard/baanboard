In these processes, they must put information that will be change every day, like as date, and others will depends of another information. I don't like to write programs on Baan - because I don't know Baan enough for this.  <br />
<br />
I'm thinking to do one Perl Script to 'talk' Baan sending option by command line and capturing the output on ascii console.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if I can interact with Baan session by ascii console e command line on Windows NT/2000  ?<br />
