<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
Database size and audit log are 2 different things....Audit info is stored at file system level and not in tables.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To delete you have to use &quot;purge audit files&quot; session and then, delete the files from file system level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skgupta</div><div class="date">7th March 2008, 14:43</div></div><div class="posttext">From Purge Audit files. it give a error.<br />

Message Code : ttaad44020<br />

Refer to the Session's help:<br />
<br />
Purge Audit Files (ttaad4261m000)<br />
Each time an audit sequence file exceeds its maximum size, that is specified in the Audit Trail File Sizes (ttaud3135m000) session, the sequence file is terminated and a new sequence file is generated. The maximum number of sequence files for each table/company combination is 999. When the last sequence file is terminated, the audit server will try to reuse sequence file 000 again. However, the audit server cannot overwrite existing sequence files.<br />
Use this session to remove the old sequence files so that the audit server can reuse them to write new audit information.<br />
To purge sequence files, enter a range of:<br />
tables<br />
packages<br />
companies<br />
sequences<br />
Click Purge to remove the audit sequence files within the range.<br />
Notes<br />
You can purge an audit file only if<br />
cleaning is allowed for the audit file: i.e. if the Cleaning Allowed check box in the Audit Trail Security (ttaud3137m000) session is selected.<br />
you are authorized to purge the audit file. Refer to the online help of the Audit Authorizations (ttaad4162s000) session for details.<br />
the audit file is not currently active: you cannot clean audit files with status &quot;UNTERMINATED&quot;.<br />
Important!<br />
Remove audit sequence files through this session only. Do not remove audit sequence files by using commands such as rm or del, because the status of the sequence file is maintained in the sequence header in the audit information file. When this session deletes the sequence file, the session also sets the status of this sequence in the information file as deleted. If the file is removed by any other means, the status is not set and this results in inconsistency</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you delete audit files from server level? Till then, you wont be able to save disk space.<br />
<br />
And i am still not able to understand how your Database is growing because of Audit trail....can you please support your statement with valid observations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skgupta</div><div class="date">8th March 2008, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear kaukul<br />
<br />
forget about database. I want to remove one month record from audit. how?<br />
<br />
when I run the session to display audit, it will show only one month report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can set a job for session &quot;purge audit files&quot; with commit time set to &quot;-30&quot; days. This job can be ran on daily basis in off-business hours. After running this session, you have to delete all files from the audit directory only for this table and that are older than 30 days. As you are using windows, create a batch and put it in the above job below the session &quot;Purge Audit files&quot;.</div></div><hr />
