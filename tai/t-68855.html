<br />
I wondered if anyone else here uses SSRS reporting services with their later versions of LN and had any experiences to share ?<br />
<br />
We use SSRS extensively for reporting from LN and in house developed reporting. We don't want to risk losing that flexibility and zero cost reporting solution.<br />
<br />
Any input is appreciated !</div></div><hr />

Great, thanks for that bit of information and link. Greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Our migration plan will be to create some Virtual machines and begin loading the latest versions of SQL Svr 2014, etc etc, LN 10.4 or 5, Add in our development stuff, then bring in our data from current system for testing. <br />
<br />
We will upgrade our hardware as needed at the time of actual implementation. This will be our 5th year running FP7.</div></div><hr />
