Actualy the devices are not visible in the device list but while printing, if I type the name of the device in selecte device session, it accepts it and print the report on that device. I think test company and production company share company 000, what your idea. should I go to add new device with the same name in production company? or there is some configuration/setting is required?<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

They share the same company 000, so when I add a device using ttaad3100m000 it is accessible in both companies.  I would expect the same on your box if they share the tools company 000. Since I am not really a Baan administrator I do not know if there are set-ups or changes to get this to work.  You might want to check you ttaad300 table - mine is in company 000.  If they share the same data I would expect you to find the same device lists.<br />

<br />
yes, also at my side the two companies, test and production, shares the same data with company 000, and there is only one table ttaad300 in company 000 which contains the all devices. But few of devices are only visible in the device list when user print some report in the test company. These deivces are not visible in the device list to user, when user print the report in the production company. I think there is some thing missing.<br />

Can super users see all the devices?  This post might need to be moved to the admin forum where they might know of a solution.<br />
