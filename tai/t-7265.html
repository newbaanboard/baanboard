<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">22nd October 2002, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you get porting set on CD (from Baan) or you downladed porting set on ypur own from Baan support?<br />
<br />
Few weeks ago I downloaded the same PS - this is only update of Baan partner CD porting set 6.1c.06.01 ...<br />
<br />
Only update !!!<br />
<br />
And documentation on Baan pages is for full package!<br />
<br />
I don't know is it yours situation but if it is you shoul first install PS 6.1c.06.01 and after that 6.1c.06.04<br />
<br />
It worked for me ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">22nd October 2002, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed the same porting set and had no problems. I didn't remember installing a previous porting set before installing this one but you should read the documentation carefully before installation.<br />
<br />
good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 08:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Documentation is covering full version of porting set which is not what you get with ftp download of sources from Baan online support.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 10:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have adequate portingset for your operating system? There are two different portingsets for AIX operating systems: one for AIX 4.1.5 and another for AIX 4.3. I am not sure but I think you must use portingset for AIX 4.1.5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Portingsets are full installs, although older versions can hold things that dissapear. ... like the alg6.1 script ...?</div></div><hr />

Maybe someone should also check, but,<br />
I downloaded portingset 6.1c.06.04 from baan support;<br />
<br />
I know that two zip files (which should be directories, I think lib and ... don't remember) were only one or two files which I left old binaries in this directories except this files.<br />
<br />
I said - maybe it should be chacked ...<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Also, what I forwarded to Baan support are differences and mistakes in User permission solution on support pages and Quick guide on this topic<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />
