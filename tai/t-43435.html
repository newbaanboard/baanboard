<br />
I have an issue where a new notebook on my network cannot connect to our Baan server.  This may be the oddest problem I've ever had.<br />
<br />
PC:<br />
<br />
- Dell Latitude D630<br />
- Windows XP SP2 - All updates except ie7<br />
- Baan Client Versions v7.9 &amp; v8.2<br />
- Member of W2K3 Active Directory Domain<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
<br />
Everytime I try to connect ot the Baan server, with the baan client, I get a Error 1326.  This happens no matter what user credentials I use.<br />
<br />
Symptoms:<br />
<br />
- Ping server by name &amp; IP address - OK<br />
- Log on to server from another PC with the same account - OK<br />
<br />
- Change .BWC file to access server via IP address instead o name - Doesn't work<br />
<br />
- Attempt to log on to the server doesn't show up in the Baan server event logs<br />
<br />
- Reinstalled Baan client v8.2 - No effect<br />
<br />
- Uninstalled client &amp; installed client v7.9 - No effect<br />
<br />
- Attempt to map a drive to a share on the Baan server generates an error for a normal user &amp; for me, the Administrator, it connects but looks more like a file to the OS than a mapped drive.  - this is not always the case<br />
<br />
- Switched network connection - No effect<br />
<br />
- Removed docking station from the notebook - No effect<br />
<br />
- Swapped HD into spare Notebook of the same model - No effect<br />
<br />
Any advice someone can offer I would really appreciate.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Wade</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, can the same user connect to Baan from a different Desktop?<br />
If it is the user, it might be the od local-log-on problem.<br />
<br />
The biggest surpise is for me, that you do not have any event log entries on the server. Can you telnet from the laptop to port 512 on the server, ie. &quot;telnet SERVER_IP 512&quot;? If not you might have locally a firewall running, which is blocking outgoing traffic?<br />
<br />
Are you using rexec (Port 512) or baanlogin (Prt 7150) to connect to the server?<br />
<br />

<br />
We're using the default, port 512 to connect to the server.  <br />
<br />
I tried telneting on port 512 as you suggested and a session opens but there is no echo so it's had to verify that things are working.<br />
<br />
The user is currently working fine with another desktop so it's not a credentials issue.  I've tried logging in a several different users including myself - Administrator/superuser and have the same result.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of is that there is some sort of corruption in the Windows Authentication files on the notebook I'm working with.  If so I'm not sure what can be done other than reinstall everything.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

It was a good thought, but doesn't appear to be the issue here.<br />
