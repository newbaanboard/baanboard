<br />
We have both baanIVc3 and Baan5c here, and it seems like I can't use the schroll button on my mouse in BaanIVc3. It's OK in Baan5.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to enable the schroll button even for baanIV? <br />
<br />
Thanks!:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you set up the scroll mouse for universal scrolling, or, in other words, to simulate the cursor keys, they will work in BaanIV on one condition:  the cursor has to be positioned near or on the scrollbar.  Then scrolling works reasonably ok.  I tend to use it only when I get close to the data I want:  clicking on the scrollbar, which gives me a page at a time, works the best for &quot;fast&quot; scrolling, and then I switch to the scroll button for the &quot;slow&quot; scrolling.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">27th August 2003, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Please check whether other applications under Terminal Server work with a scrollmouse.  If they do, Baan should as well, since universal scrolling is nothing more than filling the keyboard buffer with &quot;arrow key&quot; keystrokes.</div></div><hr />

I've asked this question at support and the answer was that it's not &quot;really&quot; supported (because Baan client is not a fully Windows program).</div></div><hr />

I am using scroll button with BaaN IV client. The only requirement is, you need to install mouse properly. Mouse comes with a floppy, use it to install properly instead of Plug-and-Play feature.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">29th August 2003, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on how the mouse driver &quot;translates&quot; the scroll function. In XP there seems to have been added a separate &quot;scroll&quot; function that is not implemented in the BW client. If you use a mouse driver that translates scrollwheel movements into the new scroll function, it will not work in Baan; if it translates the scroll wheel movement into &quot;filling the keyboard buffer with 'arrow key' keystrokes&quot;. Using a mouse driver from floppy usually will do because they use the old way...</div></div><hr />

<br />
here is a mouse driver that works. I tried out with Windows 98 and XP.<br />
<br />
But you have to move with the cursor on the scrollbar. Then the mouse scroll button (wheel) works fine.<br />
Please check it in your environment.<br />
<br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />

Since BW044 version in c3 and W98 time ago, to now BW068 ands W XP.<br />
<br />
I think it is only a problem with driver.<br />
The driver linked in that thread is able to put specific function for specific application. It works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">customizer</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
<br />
after I got a new USB mouse (Saitek Touch Force Optical) I've had some problems with the scrolling wheel function in Baan IV (W2K with BW068). This is what I found out:<br />
<br />
Saitek advise to use the built-in windows driver. Sorry, no scrolling here.<br />
<br />
Logitech Mouseware does support the scrolling wheel (positively checked with Version 9.24). But mouseware detects the mouse's manufacturer and refuses to work with 'foreign' mice. Sorry again.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Intellipoint 5.0 works with non-microsoft mice but does not support scrolling in Baan IV.   Aaaaargh!<br />
<br />
Microsoft Intellipoint 4.1, finally, does not refuse foreign mice and supports scrolling in the menu browser as well as in multi-occurrence forms.  Hooray! But why did they remove this feature in the newer version ???<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe this can help others who have the same problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rejohnson</div><div class="date">10th February 2004, 02:45</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just not worth it to downgrade the mouse driver just to get scrolling in Baan Windows.  Too much functionality lost in other applications to  balance it out.<br />
<br />
We would, of course, prefer that the Baan software support the wheel mouse as any other Windows application would.  Must be some unusual or obsolete procedure call...<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone, for your contributions.<br />
