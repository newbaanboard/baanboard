The backup is an online or an offline? (in the first case, there is no need to stop Baan)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">10th October 2002, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">You never need to stop Baan for an online backup of the database.  However, keep in mind that an online backup of the database done during the night may catch a batch job in the middle of a major update and when you restore to the point in time of the backup, you may have to perform some cleanup of the data.<br />
<br />
The ArcServe2000 agent does perform an online copy but may sure you are at Win2000 SP2 otherwise, the backup may not be restorable due to nasty interaction between early versions of ArcServe and Win2000.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">11th October 2002, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think there is any backup tool  that has a Baan 'module' (unlike SAP). What you should be looking for is a way to backup your database files *and* other (baan) files. Surely your ARCserver documentation describes how to backup an Oracle or SQL-server database?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm new of this forum. Excuse me for my bad english, but I'm italian and I don't speak very well english.<br />
<br />
I've Baan IVc SP6 on Win2000 SP3 with Arcserve 2000 SP4.<br />
I backup ALL the database (32Gb) on a tape.<br />
<br />
This is possible through the SQL connector of Arcserve (Archserve haven't the necessity to see Baan).<br />
The problem (I've open a thread) is that is possible only a full backup and a full restore: I've read it on the arcserve support page (single table backup and recover is possible only for SQL 6.5).<br />
<br />
I hope this can help you!</div></div><hr />
