<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">5th March 2007, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">In the past, I have updated companies between servers by doing a complete export of a company, deleting out the &quot;Blank tables&quot; from the dump folder, removed all the &quot;Shared tables&quot; from the dump folder, killed off the TBRG tables / used the ttiex seperatly to import DEM's.  I then dump out the 'shared companies seperately and import them seperately.  I make sure my Logical tables match dump company to new company.<br />
<br />
If I didn't delete the exported 'logical share' companies and imported them as is into a new company, where would Baan write the data ?  Would it write the data into the new companies logical shares that are configured or simply ignore them and write into the new company I specified regardless of Logical Shares ?<br />
<br />
Just curious how that works ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">5th March 2007, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">bdbpost will follow what's configured in the system where you are running it. In other words what's shared is shared and Baan will go to compnr6.1 to figure out what's the company for the physical table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">5th March 2007, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, thats good to know !<br />
<br />
Now, one further question that just entered my mind. If I have to run the TFGLD9004 to fix comapny numbers, will it affect the shared tables too ?  What I mean is, will running the FIx comapny numbers affect other comapnies sharing the same logical tables ?<br />
<br />
Thx again  !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">6th March 2007, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it will change those numbers. tfgld9004 does not know whether the tables are shared or physical because that distinction is done at a much lower level.<br />
This should not affect other companies even if they are sharing tables because the affected records will be those referring to transactions in the other company and not their own. <br />
<br />
However if what you are doing is creating a test environment try if possible to copy the whole group of companies. Otherwise you are taking the risk of creating reference problems, inconsistencies and orphan records.</div></div><hr />
