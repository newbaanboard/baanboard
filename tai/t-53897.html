I can connect to Oracle as the Baan user and I see all of the baan tables.<br />
<br />
All other products that use Oracle are running OK.<br />
<br />
Any Ideas?<br />

    Are you able to ping the baan server by the name Titan? Is the BSE folder on your server D:\Baan?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">7th October 2008, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for not getting back.  Yesterday was an interesting day to say the least.<br />
<br />
Well, here's what happened.  We were trying to get the Job Daemon to run the way it did on our old server.  We noted that there was an environment variable &quot;USER&quot; defined at the system level on our old server.  Well, that is what killed the system.  Rebooting the server with that environment variable defined is what prevented anyone from logging into Baan.<br />
<br />
Just removing the variable did not do the trick.  Even stoping and re-starting the other two Baan Services didn't help.<br />
<br />
The system needed to be rebooted after the variable was removed.  After that, we could one again log into Baan.<br />
<br />
We are still having issues with the Job Daemon.  On our old server, the service would start and that's it.  It's just a service.  However, on our new server, the Job Daemon opens up a Window and stays opened.  If that window is closed by accident, the service terminates.  That creates a reliability issue.<br />
