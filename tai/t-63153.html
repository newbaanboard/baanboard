<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sankuu</div><div class="date">26th November 2012, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Trying to load a new instance of LN FP8 (Infor 10 ERP). We got the license for the source code (product 7026). Initially this product ID was loaded under concurrent/user license. when i loaded the base LN and later tried loading the source code dump but the source is not getting loaded (porting set 8.8a). Later, infor suggested to add the product 7026 under server license. i added under the server license and added the respective server as well. Still the source code is not getting loaded but i see all other components (ex:- script object) is gettig loaded.<br />
<br />
Let me know if anyone faced this issue with latest portign sets (8.8a).</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have to import the source code dump in the B61_a VRC of LN and then apply the feature packs/solutions. PMC &quot;looks&quot; if there is a source code in the base VRC and if there is, it applies the (changed) script in the update VRC.<br />
The license itself has nothing to do with if the source code is loaded or not.<br />
You need it to able to compile the standard sources.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sankuu</div><div class="date">27th November 2012, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, you are right. i did loaded source code under B61_a vrc before loading the PMC of enterprise. I loaded several instances of LN (Fp3 Fp5, Fp7) and i did not see this issue after loading the base LN. I am seeing this issue only while loading under the FP8 porting set (8.8a). I think they did some changes on checking the license product in latest new releases which is what its causing thsi issue i believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lebowski</div><div class="date">28th November 2012, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, sorry, now I got it.<br />
I checked our FP8 installation (portingset 8.8a): the source codes are loaded as always, like in older versions, too. ID7026 is a server license at our site and always was, so I can only say that I dont have this issue.<br />

I've checked the latest info in FP8 (KB 1155124 &quot;Latest Information for Infor LN 10.2.0) and stumbled upon this:<br />
<br />
&quot;26 September 2012: From this version onwards, sources are only installed if SLM contains the correct Source License. So before installing or updating an environment, SLM has to be configured with such a license, otherwise no sources appear in the environment. This is in contrary to the behavior in previous releases, where this license was necessary to start the development activities only. The current Source License has SLM Product ID 7026.&quot;<br />
<br />
We're planing an update from FP6, but haven't done it yet.</div></div><hr />
