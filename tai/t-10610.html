<br />
we are running on BaaN4c4 with Oracle 8.1.7 patch 8.1.7.2 on Windows 2000 Server SP3 using Porting Set ...0607.<br />
<br />
Without doing any special changes or adjustments we have since several days 2 - 3 times a day the problem, that the BWs from all users are frozen simultaneously without any warnings from the system. You donÂ´t have the possibility to proceed working in BaaN. The only chance to get rid of that &quot;Business Stands&quot; is to restart the whole server. <br />
<br />
There are no error logs in the event viewer or in oracle logs or alert files.<br />
<br />
We checked already the hardware and the network without finding any malfunction.<br />
<br />
Is there anybody facing the same problems who may help us?<br />
<br />
All kinds of comments or answers are higly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some thoughts:<br />
Is there a kind of  'Power save' process running?<br />
Is there something else running as Update AntiVirus / Firewall on a scheduled time?<br />
The time between frozen situations, are they the same duration?<br />
Does it happen also at night? (While running batchjobs)?<br />
Is there a DomainNameServer with scheduled processes? Or something like that, so it is not reacheable at that time?<br />
Are there directories, which have after some time no space available?<br />
Or the TEMP-tablespace?<br />
<br />

I think it was update to a newer SP level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 If not, check if there are users that can connect to the server using Remote Desktop Connection / Terminal Services. <br />
<br />
 Maybe someone makes a fool of you and changes the system date. As far as I remember, this is the sympthom, all users &quot;freeze&quot;. <br />
<br />
 It is just an idea..... not a solution.</div></div><hr />
