<br />
I hope you all have had a great festive season and are getting prepared to get back to work?<br />
<br />
I am facing a problem which I am not sure which options would resolve. I am receiving the attached error for quite a few sessions and reports which my users are running, some do not cause them to be kicked out, others do. I am hoping one of you might be able to take a look and let me know what will resolve this. I am thinking of re-running &quot;Create Runtime Data Dictionaries&quot; but if you could possibly assist with which choices I should choose as well as let me know if I may run this while users are working on the system or not. As you know, there is a &quot;Create Runtime Data Dictionary&quot; and a &quot;Create Runtime Data Dictionary (Forms &amp; Reports)&quot;. Which one should I run to resolve this? or is the one that requires &quot;Create Runtime Data Dictionary for Tools&quot;?<br />
<br />
Your assistance is greatly appreciated in this regard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check the package combination in which the users are working. Is the table part of this package combination? <br />
It looks like the table is being used e.g. in some program but is not part of the package combination.<br />
You could check in %BSE%\dict\dd&lt;package combination\dtudll if you can find the dict file for that table.<br />
If it's part of the package combination and you can't find it in the runtime than a create runtime could probably solve it.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
