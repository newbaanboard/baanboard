	I am sure this has been discussed before but I could not find what exactly I am looking for on the board. <br />
<br />
	Some time when users are running a session (any session), they just get drooped off of baan with out even getting any error message in the middle of the process. When I looked at the log files, some time I see a log in the log.bshell file and some time only the log file log.sh_server is updated with the following error message<br />
<br />
2003-09-08[10:18:24]:E:solakae: ******* S T A R T of Error message *******<br />

2003-09-08[10:18:24]:E:solakae: ******* E N D of Error message *******<br />
<br />
Can not figure out whats going on since I can not reproduce the error ( I would have probably tried million times). <br />
<br />
Any ideas what might be causing this. We are running baanIV, 6.1c.03.01 porting set and oracle8 backend.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I guess Baan Support will tell you the same:<br />
<br />
Do not bother debugging. Upgrade to a reasonable porting set.<br />
<br />
I do not know your platform, but for HP-Ux a very good one was 6..1c.04.02, but actually the current once, also seem to run perfectly.<br />

   Thanks for your feedback. <br />
Well, I could have contacted BaaN support on this but, just have one little problem. We dont have BaaN support anymore :).<br />
<br />
So, I guess I will have try something else (if I get lucky, I might find something)<br />

Thanks,<br />

	I did little bit more digging on this issue and I found a bshell error file in the $BSE_TMP folder that was created when a user got kicked out baan with shell server terminated error in the log.sh_server file. <br />
<br />
Here is the log. <br />

-----------------------------------<br />
I dont understand what the error file is telling but I got to believe it is related to some memory/resource shortage when the bshell was trying to do something.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
based on that error log I can only guess either the program cross the bshell memory limits -<br />
<br />
Known limits (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_misc_known_limits) <br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
the program was tring to use a block of memory which was already freed and released to the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">genehunter</div><div class="date">16th August 2011, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually what that means to me is network failed to deliver packets. Check you LAN/WAN utilization and make sure you are not loosing packets. do a simple ping test<br />
<br />
ping -t servername from the app server and see if any packets dropped. If they did then that is your problem</div></div><hr />
