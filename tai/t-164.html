<br />
We are currently on porting set 6.1c.05.01, I would like to take us to the newest porting set.  I have never done this before; and after speaking with Baan Tech support and reading the manual - it seems pretty straight forward.  I'm just a little concerned due to the fact taht I remember when my boss preformed the last porting set update - strange things happened afterwards...like printers not working.  <br />
<br />
Any tips/tricks to this?  -- Or just anything in general that I should be aware of before I do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks;<br />
Theresa</div></div><hr />

However in the past we have problems with the sort6.1 so keep your old version standby. You should do a little testing afterwards, I had the problem with the printers too, however after configuring them again the problem was solved.</div></div><hr />

Keep on an eye on file permissions. Some portingsets contain new functionality that comes with new files to be installed in e.g. $BSE/lib/printinf, $BSE/lib/terminf, $BSE/lib/locale. If these files have wrong ('unreadable') permissions, you can run into weird things.<br />
<br />
In general it's a good idea to make a backup of all $BSE subdirectories you are going to replace:<br />
<br />
<br />
 bin<br />
 lib (without subdirectory help!)<br />
 api<br />
 ....<br />
 <br />
<br />
At least then you can always revert back.<br />
<br />
Another option is to put the new portingset in parallel with your current one but that can be more dodgy and requires some more tweaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">10th September 2001, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Also make sure that you check the full solution text because with 6.1c.06 some extra functionality was added regarding reports (the headers now include html functionality) and the bdepre6.1 / bdbpost6.1 functionality has changed as well (for better I think!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DavidS</div><div class="date">11th September 2001, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it wise to update to the latest porting set merely because it exists, or better to stick with your current porting set if that doesn't seem to be causing any problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">11th September 2001, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">There is certainly a point in sticking with a working solution: if it works, then don't break it<br />
<br />
However... if you opt not to upgrade your portingset, standard program etc for a long time, you might find yourself in a situation that due to functionality changes or other requirements a portingset upgrade is needed and the gap to cross the bridge has become too big. Therefore I would advise to keep up with portingset releases with 1 or 2 versions in 'lag', ie. not installing the most recent one but rather the 1 or 2 versions before that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">11th September 2001, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">It's very well saying one should stay with their current porting set because everythingÂ’s working fine. But sometimes Baan support may ask you to upgrade you porting set in relation to a case that you may have logged. Personally I think a request such as this should always be questioned. <br />
<br />
Somebody has already mentioned previously, upgrades to porting sets can resolve some issues but create new ones.<br />
<br />
To you Baan Die-Hards out there what's your general rule on upgrading porting sets and installing SP's? (Pat - I noted your comments above)<br />
<br />
When upgrading porting sets should anything else be upgarded at the same time?<br />
<br />
Like Theresa we're also running porting set 6.1c.05.01, with SP5 (HPUX, Oracle 805) and I was debating whether I should upgrade the port set to 6.1c.06.02 and upto SP8 (on our test box first)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Usually it is a good idea to check at portingset upgrade time:<br />
 solution for standard program<br />
 solution for ostpsplopen/ostpsplclose<br />
<br />
2 major new things/fixes in 6.1c.06.02:<br />
<br />
 new bdbpre/bdbpost functionality: see http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=59<br />
 OPS$ logins should work again. Although I haven't been able to confirm that myself.</div></div><hr />

Check permissions on the $BSE/lib/oracle_home directory and everything under it. Preferably they should be owned by bsp.<br />
<br />
Also check your $TNS_ADMIN settings: is this still pointing to right *.ora files? You will see a similar directory structure under $BSE/lib/ora/oracle_home as under $ORACLE_HOME.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Setting the following in $BSE/lib/defaults/db_resource may solve the problem,<br />
<br />
oracle_client_home:/u04/bse/lib/ora/oracle_home</div></div><hr />
