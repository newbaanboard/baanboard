<br />
We are planning to evaluate webtop as well as other 3rd party products with which we can have a zero-client interface.<br />
<br />
It will be nice if you guys can post more about the many advantages as well as the disadvantages of each of them, please share your knowledge and experiences.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Advantages:<br />
- TS itself is a zero client<br />
- Almost any application can run within a Terminal Server environment. So it makes any thick client a zero client.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages:<br />
- you now have two desktops, which is more difficult to work with using also apps at the same time not running via Terminal Server<br />
- runs well on a LAN but can run into performance problems when running over the internet since all keyboard and mouse input must be send immediately to the TS and UI updates must be send back<br />
- Needs configuration of accessing local resources like printers, copy to clipboard, etc.<br />
<br />
We also get sometimes the requirement to run Webtop within a Terminal Server. I really would like to know why you would like to do so...<br />
<br />

<br />
Moreover, the scalability at the central server that is actually running all the applications multiple times, could give problems. Besides this, the pricing strategy for terminal server software can really make you bleed in your wallet. Often you have to pay an amount per server (CPU-based) plus a fee per client....<br />
