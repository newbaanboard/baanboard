<br />
There is a lock on your PMC table.<br />
Hopefully you can remove/delete it by session: ttstpdellocks (Remove application locks)<br />

Have you checked this with BGS? Did you have to install any pre-requisites to SP8? How up-to-date is your PMC software itself? I think there may lay your problem. Anything interesting in the $BSE/log log files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">31st July 2002, 10:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no positive knowlegede of prerequisites for SP8. We installed direct from SP7. During this installation SP8 for tools was successfully installed (maybe we can say as a prerequisite). So  think our PMC Software should already be on a SP8 level. <br />
On a later point of installation we get this &quot;record locked error&quot; on PMC History table.<br />
<br />
What do you mean with BGS?<br />
<br />
I'm not that familar with SQL-SErver Errors. We tried already ttstperrlog but find nothing usefull for us. May because we don't know where to look.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Each Service Pack normally comes with a set of release notes that will indicate whether you must install certain pre-requisites or not. The fact that you come straight from SP7 doesn't matter I think. You should always check the documentation that comes with each Service Pack. In your case there may be no pre-requisites. BGS is Baan Global Support. Check with them because this may be a known problem. I have not much experience with the Windows/SQL-server myself sorry.<br />
<br />
By the way, did you do CRDD for Tools after the SP8 for Tools installation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">31st July 2002, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">BGS is working on it. CRDD for tools did already run. Concerning to my colleg there is nothing mentioned in the release notes, that there are prerequisites.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Then I would wait for the outcome of the BGS investigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
at least, after a complete create RDD, the installation of SP8 succeeds.<br />
