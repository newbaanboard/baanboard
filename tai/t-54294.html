<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">obkfix</div><div class="date">16th November 2008, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there ....<br />
In our factory , we have , in one of our depa' , a PC running WIN-XP with a labels printer (zebra something) installed locally to lpt1 - lets call it PC A.<br />
15 meters from that PC theres another PC running WIN-XP with no printer attached - lets call it PC B.<br />
In PC A - I share the printer with full rights for everything to everyone...<br />
In PC B - I installed the shared printer...<br />
Now , I run BaaN  , on PC B (the remote one) and try to print a label - it crushes!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Before the win-xp's those pc's used to run win-98 , and on the remote pc I used to capture the lpt port....<br />
In Win-XP , capturing lpt port is not possible....<br />
<br />
HOW CAN I PRINT MY LABELS FROM THE REMOTE PC????? ;-(<br />
please help</div></div><hr />

   Check out the following pointers:<br />
1) Is the name of the Printer the same in both the PCs?<br />
2) Are both the PCs using the same driver for the Zebra Printer?<br />
3) Is it just Baan or is it that you cant print to that printer from any application?<br />
4) Ever considered the use of a printer server and configuring both the PCs to connect to the Printer using this printer server?<br />
<br />

<br />
yes , both pc's have the printer installed by the same name (its shared)<br />
yes , both pc's use the same driver for the printer (its shared)<br />
printing to that printer from the remote pc is possible because i've installed an app called printfil which caputers the plt port (an option that doesnt exist in winxp) and then i can print from BaaN , but its too clumzy...too many screens to go through , and i need it to be working simple for my production employees , who dont understand computers that good...<br />
<br />
after all this , i understand that BaaN prints to lpt1 no mather what , i need to &quot;SHOW&quot; BaaN , that the lpt1 is elsewhere , just like that app does , how??????<br />
a script , a registry key , anything??????<br />
cant be that theres no way to do this.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">18th November 2008, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We had label printers attached to W95 boxes with a client proggy emulating a print server and a corresponding driver on the Baan server.<br />
Today these printers are attached to a linux server using cups. These printers are defined as lpd://ip_adress/SHARE_NAME and use RAW protocol.<br />
Report layout is built with all the control commands copied from a label generating program printing to a file.<br />
I assume you are printing via BWPrint and can't help you there, but I know that label printers attached to XP boxes can be shared.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">obkfix</div><div class="date">19th November 2008, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Well....thank you all , but I found a solution in a very simple &quot;net use&quot; command line....<br />
The thing is that when you ue a &quot;net use&quot; command to capture the lpt1 port in a pc working with Baan in order for it to print to a remote computer , you have to delete all printers or else it wont work....<br />
Now I have another problem , the user thats working on that computer has minimum rights and credentials on that pc and in the network in general , and the &quot;net use&quot; command asks for local admin credentials....<br />
How can I use the &quot;net use&quot; command in a batchfile witbh the &quot;runas&quot; option so it should run in the startup (impersonating as the local admin) and all my troubles would go away???</div></div><hr />
