<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barney</div><div class="date">14th October 2004, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">A user has asked me if it is possible to update all the expiry dates for Supply Chain Purchase Schedule Contracts, to a date in the future.<br />
We have many contracts and to manually do this would take a while.<br />
I checked out GTM and I am able to modify tdpsc001.exdt field to say 31122099 but what about the Cancelled contracts? The update through GTM will change all contracts regardless of contract status.  Now, if I went to the session and attempted to modify a cancelled contract I would get the message Contract cancelled modification not possible so, if I change the expiry date on the table do I run the risk of disturbing referential integrity?<br />
I have been taught only do GTM on a field you can actually change in the session.<br />
What is the general consensus here?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

GTM should be used in production only as a last resort, when something is not working and there is no manual way outside of GTM to accomplish this.  Usually with Baan Support's blessing, or directly done by them.<br />
<br />
In your case, where you can do this manually but it takes too long, you may try creating a batch process (new session) to go through and do what you do manually in the sessions.  This can be done using the AFS methods, which allow you to call the sessions from within your code, and capture the errors instead of displaying.<br />
<br />
Bit of a learning curve if you have not worked with AFS's before.  You can start with the Sticky at the top of the AFS Forum on these boards.</div></div><hr />
