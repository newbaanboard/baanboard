<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">7th February 2013, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We have recently implemented Baan IVc4 in a child facility.  This child is a subcontractor of the parent.  Users from the parent company would like access to view data in the child Baan company.  <br />
<br />
We would like to create a user in Baan that can read but not write or delete data.  I am curious on how other people may have done this.<br />
<br />
We were thinking of two different scenarios:<br />
<br />
 Create a regular Baan user with 'typical' database permissions but add session by session the 'Display' or 'Report' based sessions to that Baan user.<br />
 Create a regular Baan user with permissions to all modules and alter the database user permissions so they cannot update or delete data.<br />
<br />
<br />
Option 2 seems the easiest, but I wanted see what experiences (if any) you have had and or any Pros and Cons to the options (or is there a third option)?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th February 2013, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We have used both ways in a very limited fashion(maybe 1 or 2 users each method)- for a generic id with just a handful of sessions I would use option 1.  Other than that I would use option 2 with all of the packages set to read only if you want them to have all reporting sessions for all modules.  Other than that we use DEM flows which is just like option 1 - everybody gets the generic reporting role.  All of this is in just our production environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will work fine!</div></div><hr />

I never had used that session and in my original post my option 2 was setting the 'read only' permissions at the database level, not within the Database Authorizations module in Baan.<br />
<br />
The session you point out is perfect!</div></div><hr />
