<br />
One of our jobs, that takes care of our order planning, takes too long to finish. <br />
It starts at 3 am and normally it's finished by 6 am. Now, when i enter the office at 8 am, it's still running, taking up a lot of memory. <br />
<br />
I've allocated some extra memory to the server today, but I would like to know if there are other things that might work and where i can see what the cause is. <br />
<br />
i hope you people can help me. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Anything new doe to the system - patches or upgrades?  Is any auditing or logging turned on for the tables being used?  Maybe more details will help someone come up with something more specific to look at.</div></div><hr />
