<br />
If you want to use the jobdaemon for more companies than you have to use logical tables, i.e. share the job tables (ttaad500 - ttaad513 (not sure about the number)) to the physical company in which the user is logged in that's running the jobdaemon (probably baan).<br />
<br />
Please search baanboard to find out about the pro's and con's using the jobdaemon.<br />

You need to create command line files with the company to be run in the company variable, possible the user variable and package combination set, and a line to run the bshell with the job session as the process to run.  Then schedule this with the windows scheduler.  In windows explorer open your server, then the control panel, and you will find an icon for scheduled tasks.  You will find an icon to add the task there for your command file.</div></div><hr />

However that's up to Pavel.</div></div><hr />

When you want to schedule seperate runs for the companies, then it is suggested to use ASM or a native scheduler.<br />

Instructions can be found in the ERPln Administrators Guide U8854 Chapter 12 for the 3 variations.  I'll have to dig up a newer admin guide for Baan IV to see if it is mentioned there also. In the event of needing to postpone a run, rerun, or timing, my clients have found that individual job streams work best.</div></div><hr />
