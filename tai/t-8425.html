<br />
I have tried to &quot;move&quot; some exchange schemes from one company to another by creating a sequential dump from source company, then creating tables from sequential dump into target company.<br />
<br />
Selected tuxch000 to tuxch999<br />
<br />
Strange result!<br />
<br />
The exchange schemes with names (tuxch021.cxch) in Capitals were created successfully, but the lower-case rows were not created. the successfully transferred schemes appear to work OK in the target company.<br />
<br />
We're using BaaN IVc2 on Informix.<br />
The source, and target companies have different VRC combinations, however, we have never used Exchange before in the target company so I was happy to try, knowing that I could &quot;undo&quot; the changes if necessary.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I'm being too naive!<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced case-sensitivity problems like this?<br />
<br />
Appreciate any help.<br />
<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do a dump of tuxch tables, you should also do a dump of the tttxt tables, because of conditions etc, which are stored into  the text tables.<br />

<br />
This might well be the cause.<br />
<br />
I cannot overwrite the tttxt files in our main company, however, I will try doing the reverse, i.e. copy txt files across to the exchange company (making sure that upper and lower case names are included) and look for a similar result.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip!<br />

<br />
I was going to ignore table tuxch014 and redo the condition scripts manually (because of the text issues).<br />
<br />
Did you also ignore all the log tables as well?  Do you have a list of the ones to ignore?  I'm on Baan IVc4<br />

...I assume this is the best way to get from A....B?</div></div><hr />
