<br />
 We have a DBserver with SQL2000 and an App server with Win2000 AS. We are trying to install Baan5c but there is NO option to create the DB on the DB server!!!  It's looking for the Sql Service on the App Server. <br />
<br />
Has anyone done a 3-tier installation with Baan5c????<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Even after 45 days I have no info from them.  From there it might have been dumped into the Sea. :D <br />
<br />
Now I doubt whether baan can be installed on 2 NT m/c s with database on one and Application on the other. But it is a shame that for such a simple setup there is no proper documentation in BaaN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are having Three Tier architechture with WIN NT systems. So clear your doubt. The major change is to enter TWO_TASK parameter into tabledef6.1, for more info. search in KQ.<br />
And about stories happened with BaaN Support, it is unlimited, better will make a new thread on &quot;General Discussion&quot;, so that we can fight (technically) them.:D <br />

<br />
as i remember my last 3t Installation you must do the following:<br />
<br />
install baan and the database on the database server.<br />
After complete installation move the baan-environment to the application server and configure net-environment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">20th September 2003, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Martin's suggestion seems to be good. I tried to load baan application on a m/c where I had the oracle client. (database server on a different m/c was already up and the oracle client was ablr toconnect to server also. Two_TASK was set properly). I was unable to load. As Marting suggested I will load baan and database on one m/c first and then shift baan application part alone to different m/c. Any ideas how to do? I can copy baan application to different m/c but what abt the registry setting??<br />
<br />
Suhas did you do 3tier  installation in the same way?<br />
<br />
I think Unix system will not have any problems as we can copy the application data easily. But in windows registry settings are also to be created. So that may give problem. This is what I feel. Can someone confirm?</div></div><hr />

Sorry, our discussion seems irrelevent for you, but as pointed in my last post, refer Knowledge Quest (KQ/Folio Views) and search TWO_TASK, you will get sufficient material, but I am not sure the combination which you want matches to that.<br />
<br />
Shrinivas,<br />
<br />
I did 3 tier for BaaN IV C4, Oracle 8 on WIN NT, if you want further queries related to that, PM me, because it'll again irrelevent for Erick to explain here, as he is owner of this thread.<br />

<br />
Let me put my problem in few lines.<br />
<br />
I have a machine A where oracle 8 and baan is already installed and running.<br />
<br />
On machine B I wanted to install only BaaN application while database would be A. (2 Application servers and 1 database servers).<br />
<br />
I installed Oracle client on B and set the TWO_TASK parameters etc. I can do TNSPING, run SQL8.0 from client on B to SERVER on A.<br />
<br />
Now when I am installing Baan on m/c it was not displaying the instance on m/c A as avbl and hence asking for creation on database which obviously it cannot create on m/c B as it is a client only. FAT client in m/c B is not the soln I am looking as I want a full baan application. Since I set two_task on m/c B I feel it should show instance on A.  Also there is no option to install baan application alone without the database.<br />
<br />
Eric : Sorry for using ur thread to solve my problem. But I feels it might clear some clouds surrounding the 3 tier arch. installation procedure.</div></div><hr />

I think you are working on NT. I  tell you what we had did, earlier we have single m/c with appl &amp; db on same machine. after that we brought new m/c, in this we install db on new m/c (b), load db client on old m/c (a), reset the parameters of two_task etc and upload 000 co. through squential dump in new setup and after that rest live companies.<br />
<br />
similarly we add one more app m/c (c), copy (just copy ) complete baan volumn from m/c a, set kernal parameters on m/c c, load db client and start working in demo version. For proper working require to revalidate s/w in network licenses.<br />
<br />
all above jobs we had done over sun solaris m/c.<br />
<br />
hope this will help you out.<br />
