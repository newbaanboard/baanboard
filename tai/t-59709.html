<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">16th December 2010, 04:26</div></div><div class="posttext">At implementation we had a company 786 defined in its own VRC (obg4) which was derived from standard.  Recently we created company 300 which has its own VRC (mex4).  This VRC is also derived from standard.  This was done to allow independent modifications to the different companies (VRC's).  <br />
<br />
Now we would like to create a VRC level which is derived from standard, but is below the obg4 and mex4 levels so that any customizations done at this level would affect both company 786 and 300.  <br />
<br />
I know I can create the new VRC by running Create New Package Combination/VRC ttaad1222m000 and have it derive from standard, but can I then modify the obg4 and mex4 VRC's in Maintain Package VRC's ttadv1111m000 and set these two VRC's to be derived from my new one?  Are there any other sessions/steps to complete this process successfully?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any and all assistance.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
on one of our baan servers we are hosting five different comanies; the basic software for all is custmized but common to them. But to be flexible, we decided to give all of them a unique VRC so that each company can have their own customizations. And - tata - one of those situated in spain had some legal requirements.<br />
 <br />
All I can say that your basic idea is correct. You should have a very close look at the output of ttadv1414m000 &quot;print package vrc derivation structure&quot;. We hade some trouble about missing labels because there was an error.<br />

Yes you can. After changing derivation structure you have to rebuild both package combination (obg4, mex4) in Session Packages by Package Combination. At the end of the process you must have new fd files on $BSE/lib for package combinations ong4 and mex4. Before start with changes be sure that you have good backup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I advise you to use session ttpmc2240m000.<br />
if you set &quot;Change dirivation of other VRCs&quot; flag to &quot;Yes&quot; Everithing you need will be done automatically.<br />
This session does not create Package Comvination, so you'll have to create and fill PC manually, but in my opinion it's easer then change dirivation of 30+ PVRCs.<br />
<br />
Create Runtime for all Package combinations is needed in any case!</div></div><hr />
