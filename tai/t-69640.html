I have successfully installed Infor 10.3 and SQL Server in failover cluster. Services are also shifting from one node to another node without any interruption. <br />
<br />
But when I am trying to login, it gives me error as -<br />
<br />
Message	: Client tried to connect with protocol 'Rexec', which is not allowed on the used port<br />
Message	: Server: protocol 'Rexec' is not allowed<br />
Failure executing ipc_boot binary in BSE.<br />
<br />
Also I have also assigned client access network IP to cluster disk on which Infor directory is installed. Ping is happening for that IP address. But when I am running netstat command in server then it is not showing me that IP address with 512 port. Am I missing something please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
as the message says &quot;REXEC&quot; is not allowed, so try<br />
<br />
BaanLogin on Port 7150<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. I tried your solution but it did not worked for me.<br />
<br />
I changed the port 512 to 513 in logic service and it works.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
