I'm close to jumping off the building, as I've become somewhat frustrated in trying to make it work.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">On the Baan ftp site there is the best document for Exchange:<br />
&quot;Exchange User Guide&quot;  U7137A USA.  Also, the JVIMPORT is available as a Power Point/Example.<br />
<br />
You should be able to get that from Baan.  If not, I have soft copys - what are the rules about posting the Baan Documentation?  Post email address and I will send to you.</div></div><hr />

Baan's partners still try to teach this class, but Baan lost most of the examples and doesn't have the correct dumps to go with the exercises they do have.<br />
<br />
Ask your questions and I will have an answer.</div></div><hr />
