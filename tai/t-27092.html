I experienced some problems during the installation of c4 with a remote desktop while importing the tools tables.<br />
It's said shared memory is not up.<br />
Now I know it is not working with remote desktop.<br />
So I installed it with an Terminal.<br />
Now, I try to create the RDD and I get the error &quot;series error in bdbreconfig,exit&quot;<br />
If I convert 1 table, it is OK.<br />
If I try more than 1 Table I get this Error.<br />
I.g. I import tables for Package tf, the create RDD it is not working.<br />
By the Way, baan is installed on an Virtual computer.<br />
It means, a hard disk with 800 GB divided in 8 different partitions, each with its on terminal and operating system, or simellar.<br />
Help would be highly appr.<br />
Best Regards <br />
Schweizer</div></div><hr />

directory, there may be a log.bdbreconfig or sometihng similar that will tell you what happened.<br />
<br />
Another option is that the porting set on the install CD is bad, but that should only be the case if you have a very old install CD.<br />

I was using the same cd's on another computer and it was OK.<br />
The event viewer is empty.<br />
And as far as I remember, I could not find anything in the log files.<br />
I think it has somthing to do with the machine or the shared memory.<br />
But a have look on it tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
