<br />
When we install a new server we just copy the baan directory to the new server, install the portingset (to create the registry settings), do our database things. Now I have to install first 7.1d.05 and after that I can use one of the later portingsets to upgrade it. Installing e.g. 7.1d.08 I get errors like 'Can start service' and 'Windows registration error'.<br />
<br />
I have a workaround, created a case for it but I am wondering if more people have problems with the new installation methode.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, the same problem here.<br />
<br />
I do the following :<br />
<br />
copy BSE environment from old server to new server<br />
copy the Baan-Installation from c:\baan\winnt\baan (you must look, where it is installed) to the new server c:\windows\baan.<br />
<br />
Now the Problem is, that you had no services for baan.<br />
<br />
I had created the services with srvinstw.exec from MS Resource Kit on the new Server exactly as they are installed in old server.<br />
<br />
Start services.<br />
<br />
Update Portingset.<br />
<br />
The next Problem is, that you had no Program Group Baan and the old copied BECS won't work. --&gt; Install the prefered Client for the new Portingset on the new server, then it works.<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />

EDIT:<br />
<br />
the registry setting i had exported from registry of old server, modified and import in registry in new server</div></div><hr />
