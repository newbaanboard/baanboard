And the job period is set to 1 day. But I find it does not work sometimes. The reason for this is the Job Daemon stops automatically, and I do not know why. Is there anyone who konws how to solve this issue? Whether there is a command to start job daemon at a certain time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
what are you backing up?<br />
<br />
if it's your database you should be using your SQL Server backup facility. (it's built in!)<br />

At  our end , jobs are manual responsibility of a group of 3 people . So we have no need for this.</div></div><hr />
