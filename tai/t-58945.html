<br />
Please consider this scenario<br />
<br />
We are having two Servers on ERP Ln FP2.<br />
<br />
One server is validated for 10 conc Users Licenses whereas the Other is validated for 20 conc User Licenses. Hence effectively we are having 30 User Licenses.<br />
<br />
But not all the users all always able to log in the 1st server due to license shortages.<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility that in case there is a license shortage in 1st server, the system uses the license of 2nd server.<br />
<br />
Hope I have been able to communicate my requirement.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">5th August 2010, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">With SLM you could use one of the servers as master license server, the second as slave and have it licensed for 30 users. If one of the servers fails the application can still be used on the other. However after 3 days it will support only half of the number of users unless you buy the HA option.<br />
<br />
Question is: are both licenses the same right now? Are both slm server in the same lan? Not sure if you should use it over a wan.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can just add the other slm server to the servers.xml since the documentation states that a client can only be connected to one SLM cluster.<br />
