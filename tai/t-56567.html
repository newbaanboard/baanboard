Infor's articles, 121503, 109404 and 74316.  <br />

According to all of these articles as well as this forum, it is recommended to change the desktop heap size because of the quantity of users (we have 52 licenses) that can log on and to solve sort.exe errors.  We were having occasional sort.exe errors.  I believe our original setting was with only 2 values. The third was missing.  So we changed the size to 1024, rebooted and logic service would not start (shortage of space for desktop).  We tried 3072 and got frequent sort.exe errors (every few seconds).  We went to 512 and everything seems fine.  We haven't had sort.exe errors yet but with our original setting, we didn't have them that frequently so I can't say that they've completely stopped.</div></div><hr />

We had changed the shared section settings following  way  SharedSection=1024,3072,3072 <br />
<br />
And since then frequent binary errors on server consol never came. Maybe this helps. Also tell what's the server physical memory if problem persists .</div></div><hr />

You only need to change that setting if the volume of transactions and users is greater than the resources available to users of the server where the application. If everything is working fine for you I would not change that setting.<br />
<br />
* The first SharedSection value (1024) is the shared heap size common to all desktops. This memory is not a desktop heap allocation. Do not modify this value to address desktop heap problems.<br />
<br />
*The second SharedSection value (3072) is the size of the desktop heap for each desktop associated with an interactive window station (WinSta0), except for the Disconnect and Winlogon desktops. In other words, ntbshells will use this heapsize setting and making it too big could be more damaging than helping in your case if you have not seen anything other than a few sort errors here and there. <br />
<br />
*The third SharedSection value (512) is the size of the desktop heap for each desktop associated with a non-interactive window station (usually a service). If this value isn't present, the size of the desktop heap for non-interactive window stations will be same as the size specified for interactive window stations (i.e., the second SharedSection value). If you have services that interact with the application this setting will be used. So you might need to modify its value if it's too low and you are experiencing problems with the application (e.g. nobody can print, batches are not closing, etc)<br />
<br />
In windows servers that are 64bit based, these settings have been increased by default because the 64bit architecture by default needs to address more memory to handle processes data.<br />
<br />
In general, be careful when you or decrease increase these values as a too low or too high value for the interactive and non-interactive desktop can have negative effects on a server depending on the physical memory resources of it or the number of processes that run at any given point in time. <br />
