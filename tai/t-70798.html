<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alibaba</div><div class="date">29th January 2018, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to migrate Baan IV from Unix to Windows and almost everything after migration was fine, but the system became very slow after selecting any printing device(including when the compilation script showed the relevant information). But it is not true suspended. After a long time (&gt;= 10 minutes), the selected device window will also pop up to display the printed data.<br />
I checked the windows events log, did not find any errors. Also try to monitor the related processes with the tools in Sysinternal, also did not find any.<br />
I checked the ${BSE}\tmp directory, the related data was almost immediately generated in the background, but it was very long time passed to the device for display.<br />
Has anyone encountered the same problem as me? Can you give me some tips or advice on how to solve the problem?<br />
thank you all!</div></div><hr />

Alibaba,<br />
<br />
You should setup the  session ttaad3221m000 (Purge Device queue) in a batch job to purge every 30 days (or based on your retention period), so that table is not growing that big. <br />
<br />
You can also execute this SQL statement in Oracle -<br />
<br />
delete from tttaad320000 where t$rdte &lt; sysdate - 7; commit;<br />
<br />
Because the table is so big it might fill up your archive/redo logs. <br />
<br />
Alternatively, a quicker way would be to purge the table data -<br />
<br />
truncate table tttaad320000; <br />
<br />
This command won't fill up your archive/redo logs.<br />
<br />
Also, refer to this thread to check if you have the settings/solution in your Baan-4 system -<br />
