First we are upgrading the Enterprise Server.<br />
<br />
After staging the installable units, when we run the Installation wizard, after the message &quot;all users should get out of the system&quot;, we get the error:<br />
<br />
&quot;You cannot update the VRC 7.6_a(tt) because PMC solutions exist. Remove this solutions by hand first&quot;<br />
<br />
Has anybody seen this before?<br />
<br />
Note: <br />
After the installation of FP2, the solutions that were installed were the ones for Portuguese localizations and also 212227, a pre-requisite for FP3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem seems to be solved.<br />
<br />
In the case of an upgrade you have only to select &quot;Enterprise Server PMC solutions&quot; unit. <br />
&quot;enterprise server&quot; is not needed. This was causing the problem.</div></div><hr />
