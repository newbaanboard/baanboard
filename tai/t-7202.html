Then from there of course you would create a flat file with just the table names - being careful not to have ^M after each table name. Then you have your list for the -I option. <br />
<br />
In my circumstance in regards to  how we use Baan, this report would yield a list of about 600 tables,  out of the 2500 or so that are created for a single/single. Yes this is a simple method, I'm sure there are more clever and sexy ways out there, but this method is relatively quick and it will work. :)</div></div><hr />
