What are the loggings? What if you reboot your system... will the license deamon / service not be started then? What is your configuration? Do you use the license of the operational server on the test server? What is in your $BSE/lib/license6.1 file? What if you replace the hostnames there with their IP numbers?<br />
<br />
There are a couple of solutions on the Baan site that explains the different setups with regards to licenses thouroughly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">12th November 2002, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">What was your previous portingset version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">13th November 2002, 06:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Previous Version was 6.1c.03.<br />
<br />
Rebooted many times but of no use. Licence server is not enabled.<br />
\lib\licence6.1 has entry of the server name (as it used to be before).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">13th November 2002, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">So, still the original portingset that come with the installation, still running on a system with a date around 98 and not licenced.<br />
<br />
Baan keeps a time stamp of the installation that should match the portingset version. That is why when you have a problem on a server, you can put back the date to be able to go into Baan and be able to re-license.<br />
<br />
By going thru a huge upgrade lap, you ended up with these 2 dates way different, so Baan will &quot;refuse&quot; to run.<br />
Check the validation quick docs and solutions for any information on this, but I think that the solution is not straight forward... If you change the date to after the non-license period Baan will lock the records you can select; if you put back an old date, the portingset compilation date will be way newer and then you get that message.<br />
<br />
Baan would say on this that &quot;you should not have a test system without being licensed&quot;...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I have given it up.<br />
<br />
Before installing new porting set I had my bin and lib directories got copied as bin.old and lib.old.<br />
<br />
Now I reverted to these directories and named the directories which the porting set created as bin.port and lib.port.<br />
<br />
Now I am able to access baan<br />
<br />
Looks like unless u have a licenced version don't put new porting set.<br />
<br />
I feel we should have test servers without these licencing problems so that we can take risks and test various programs which we cannot do on a live prouction server.</div></div><hr />
