<br />
Looking at webtop - was hoping someone could detail the connection between a user's windows client running IE through to the bshell on unix.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to find out more about how this works.<br />
<br />
If anyone has information on gathering the IP address of the windows workstation connecting to the webserver and then ultimately the unix baan server.<br />
<br />
I see that the windows based webserver connects to the unix server via rexec.  Enabling logging on the rexec daemon only shows the IP address of the webserver, not the requesting workstation's IP.<br />
<br />
I've searched and have seen a few posts about getting IP addresses (ie via ipaddr.exe), but nothing has been helpful at this point.  <br />
<br />
Even if I could find out where/how tomcat logs a connection I might be able to work with something there, but I'm not familiar in-depth with Tomcat.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, if anyone knows of a hidden Baan4 function that returns a client IP address, that would work as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advnace!<br />
<br />
PS - Apparently my environment information didn't come through automatically.<br />
Baan IVc4, SP 20<br />

Currently running ASCII, looking at implementing SSH, BW and WebTop.</div></div><hr />

But you can create your custom program in bms mask during startup which can write to a log file or a custom table to save the user id &amp; the ip address.<br />

<br />
Sadly, no, the get.client.ip.address() function does not exist in Baan 4.  (I checked, I thuoght it might be undocumented like get.bw.hostname())...<br />
<br />
But you can create your custom program in bms mask during startup which can write to a log file or a custom table to save the user id &amp; the ip address.<br />
<br />
This would be great, but I still need to determine the IP address of the client workstation.  All I can find out at this point is the IP of the webserver making the request to the bshell...<br />
<br />
Even if I knew at the hpux level, that'd be fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe even if someone has an idea of how to modify the java Login applet under Tomcat, so that it drops the username, timestamp and remote computer IP address to a file somewhere, that would be useful?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Edit : its called jk not mod_jsp http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/</div></div><hr />
