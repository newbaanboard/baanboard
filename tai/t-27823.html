<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staugner</div><div class="date">8th August 2006, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We would like to run a session as a batch and have it saved in html format to a file on the local network.  We can save it in Baan Tmp, but only on the C drive of the user.  As a batch, it is out in Unix, but not accessible for recurring e-mails which are the ultimate destination.<br />
<br />
We have a device set up as shtml.  What argument and path can it recognize other than ${BSE_TMP}\file-{LOGNAME}.html?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any information you like ;) . It's a little tricky, but it works for me with pdf printing and auto-email the pdf to however I like.<br />
<br />
The way (short description):<br />
<br />
 Create a table for the device names you want to use this way<br />
 Create a dll that creates and fills a default (!) file which names never changes (i.e. in the home directory of the user)<br />
 Include the dll in your report and execute the functions for every device in the list (thats why you need a table)<br />
 Write in the file the information you need (email, pathes, ....)<br />
 Your device can also be a shell script. Use awk or whatever to parse your parameter file and execute the actions/email-adresses you defined before<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staugner</div><div class="date">8th August 2006, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Csecgn, but I think I may not have presented my case well enough.  My report will be run as a batch by a daemon each week.  The problem comes in when I want to have it saved to a network file so that my program &quot;Recurring E-mail&quot; can grab it.  Baan will save it out to a file on my drive if I run a report locally and save it as shtml, but I will not be running it, and I don't want it on my computer.  How do I set up the path (UNC) to have it directed to a network file?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">8th August 2006, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understood correctly, Baan creates the shtml-file, not the device. The device is just for sending the result to a printer (i.e. IE or mozilla).<br />
<br />
We use a shell srcipt as device. The primary output is a PCL file created from baan (baan default driver for HP4).  I'm using the shell script to pick up this PCL output, add some additional parameters and send it by rsh to a script on another server that separates this to two parts. One part is the PCL file that will be converted through GhostPCL to a PDF. The other part of the file is the parameter part with the email adress (and some more parameters). <br />
<br />
Back to your question: If I'm right, you output is a from baan ready converted shtm file and so you can send/put it by a shell-script with a separately created parameter file (which includes the path) to a network drive.<br />
<br />
Hope this is a better explanation (and that I'm right with the shtml)<br />

The device is actually shtml and the file output Baan wants to send out is file-{LOGNAME}.html.  I can get it out to Unix, but will need to shell it out to windows by ftp.  I had hoped there was a way to send it from Baan to a windows html file without a bridge from Unix.<br />

U can use server2client function in an baan script to transfer unix file in a windows environment either in binary mode or ascii mode . Only that netwrok drive must be mapped properly on client environment.<br />
<br />
There are lots of examples of server2client on this board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check the B2Email Standard Tool (http://www.nazdaq-it.com/utilities.php?prod=b2email-s). It can send as an email attachment in many formats (HTML, PDF, RTF, XML, CSV, TXT, BPF...). This tool can be easily configured as a job then you can run it from your daemon.<br />
<br />
It can also archive the report on the server/client and print it on Windows/UNIX printers.<br />
<br />
I hope it help,<br />
