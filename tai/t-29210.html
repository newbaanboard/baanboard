<br />
I have already installed DB2 version 9 into one of our customers IBM P series server running on UNIX AIX 5.3 5L. The installation was a success (I guess) since it does not prompt our any error. Then when I tried to install LN into the UNIX server remotely (cannot be done locally) during 'Enter destination directory' since I have keyed in the destination directory and hit 'Next', it prompt out a message<br />
<br />
Internal Failure<br />
Error Number : 0x80040707<br />
Description : Bsi.BsiSaveInstInfo:<br />
<br />
When i click OK it will quit the installation procedure</div></div><hr />

In the ops, there is a patch for Install file for Unix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mohdzain</div><div class="date">4th January 2007, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">The previous error bypassed, now i am facing different kind of error during installation. During installation, it is scanning for PMC solutions: .3.3_b3_da.  It says that Error(s) occurred during scan; see $BSE/log/log.pmc for further information. Why does it prompt this error??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naabi0</div><div class="date">5th January 2007, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought Baan only supported DB2 8.2 and below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mohdzain</div><div class="date">9th February 2007, 11:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes we have already installed to db2 8.2 since they say ERP LN could only support until db2 8.2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">9th February 2007, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">doesn't look like a database related error. either your install CD is corrupt/bugged or you're having permission problems on the box. Did you open all of the ports they ask you to in the install guide?<br />

<br />
Could you explain what was the issue that was stopping the installation. We might be upgrading our server from LN SP1 to FP3 soon on UNIX/ ORACLE environment and thus need such inputs at hand.<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mohdzain</div><div class="date">26th February 2007, 03:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem lies with permissions since we create the folder for installation but didn't specify the permissions. Another thing is that make sure that the DB2 is up and running. U can just type db2cc which is our instance and it will inform whether the database is up and running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mohdzain</div><div class="date">30th July 2007, 09:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually manage to install LN in UNIX. There are some configurations needed to be done on the UNIX and to the DB2 prior to install LN. Thanks for your help....</div></div><hr />
