<br />
First, i am a new bie in BaaN Tools and i still learn in developing BaaN for the first time..In my company it has used for BaaN (the person who developing it had resigned)..<br />
<br />
And i want to make simulation server for BaaN, i have already install for Windows 2000 Server Advanced for the OS and using MS.SQL 2000 SP3 and i had followed the documentation in BaaN installation.<br />
<br />
And i will start to install for BaaN itself, but i confused with the SP/VRC. Should i do installation from SP1 to SPXX??With the information in the CD??<br />
And when i do installation/setting for the VRC??<br />
After that all, i set for the business process or in the beginning??<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">14th October 2008, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Danny,<br />
    1) Install Baan4 from the Master CD followed by the post-installation tasks mentioned in the installation documents. <br />
2) If you have the latest Baan4 Master CD then it would take care of installing the latest porting set. If not then install it separately from the same CD (usually provided).<br />
3) Then setup the PMC &amp; Update VRCs. <br />
4) Go for the SPs after that. If you are going for service packs beyond 18 then i would recommend using either the 1-18 or 1-21 (whichever is available from Infor) SP batch installation utility. The documentation would be available when you download this batch utility files. <br />
5) This can be followed by your customized VRCs or implementing your business processes.<br />
<br />
Hope i haven't missed out on anything..<br />

<br />
from your post I conclude that you seek a test environment to play around in and test things. Shouldn't this system be exactly like your productive one?<br />
If you do a clean install and apply all service packs you will lack every single individual solution/development that has been applied by your predecessor.<br />
As you are on a windows system, have you thought of cloning the whole server using VM?<br />
Just an idea.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />
To  Sukesh75 :<br />
Yup, i have all the master cd + the documentation and i will try it as soon as possible..<br />
<br />
What is PMC? (i'm sorry but i never hear this word mean :p)<br />
And about VRC, in my place i have two VRC (standard and VRC private in my place).<br />
<br />
To norwim :<br />
Yup, but if something happen in our system in future i can handle it from zero :D<br />
<br />
And can you help me to get backup data from 2007-2008 in my BaaN live and restore it in BaaN simulation i create later??How can i do that?<br />
<br />
Thanx before</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">15th October 2008, 09:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Danny,<br />
    PMC stands for Product Maintenance &amp; Control. The PMC sessions are the ones you would be using to apply new solutions or service packs in Baan. Earlier, the service packs or solutions were applied using session Import Patch {ttiex1284m000} but post SP3 (i guess), this was replaced with the PMC Sessions. <br />
Therefore, its important to initialize the PMC in baan prior to applying the SP batch utility program. Go through your documentation and i am sure you would find info on PMC. <br />
<br />
As far as your VRC is concerned, the bare minimum you need while updating your Baan SP would be the Standard VRC (present by default) and your Update VRC. All the rest of the customized VRC (i hope this is what you mean by Private VRC) can wait till after the SP (doesn't make a diff actually). <br />

And i choosen full after that enter password for baan and then making group name for baandb and the problem after this..<br />

The error said that rebuild your database because it was not binary..But i have followed the instruction when i installed for MS SQL Server 2000 by choosing binary in the steps.<br />
<br />
And i tried to rebuild the database by binary as instruction in help SQL Server but it failed even i stop all the services in SQL.<br />
<br />
So, i uninstall SQL and install again the SQL with the same instruction and it still same..<br />

Do you know what problem in my SQL Server 2000 SP3..Because i choosen for the binary in the steps..<br />

   How old is your Baan4 Master CD? Any idea when you got it?<br />
Secondly, could you just outline the steps you have taken for installing SQL Server 2000?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DannyWilliams</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 05:59</div></div><div class="posttext">How old is your Baan4 Master CD? Any idea when you got it? --&gt;<br />
Maybe 2000/2001.<br />
<br />
This is the step i install my SQL Server 2000 :<br />
1. Type of instalation client and tools<br />
2. Checklist for default<br />
3. Setup type custom<br />
4. Use the same account for each services + use the local system account<br />
5. Authentication Mode : Mixed mode+ blank password<br />
6. Collation setting : Latin1_General + Sort Order Binary<br />
7. Network libraries : Names Pipe (\\.\pipe\sql\query)+ TCP/IP Socket(1433) without proxy + MultiProtocol checklist without enabling Multiprotocol encryption<br />
8. Choosing license for seat : I choose 100<br />
9. Finish..<br />
10. I execute this query in SQL<br />
execute sp_configure “show advanced options”, 1<br />
reconfigure with override<br />
execute sp_configure “max degree of parallelism”, 1<br />
execute sp_configure &quot;priority boost&quot;, 0<br />
execute sp_configure “lightweight pooling”, 1<br />
execute sp_configure &quot;max worker threads&quot;, 255<br />
execute sp_configure “open objects”, 0<br />
to maximize performance according to the documentation :p<br />
<br />
Shoult it caused because i used SQL Server SP3 not SP1 because the documentation from Infor using SP1??<br />
<br />
And yesterday when i tried to rebuild database using SQL server it didn't work at all..And make the SQL couldn't start any more..<br />
<br />
 PLs give me advice..<br />
<br />
Thanx you in advance</div></div><hr />

I select for &quot;Server and Client Tools&quot;..<br />

And when i install for BaaN after i choosed type of my database (i choose Microsoft SQL v 7.0) and the next step write down for baan password (according to the documentation it missed for choosing Enter locale settings &quot;ISO_BIN (binary sort)&quot;..<br />

Yes, you are right..Not skipping..But from the step in my instalation after choosed for Database (i choose MS SQL 7.0)..It didn't show this step and directly go to fill password baan..<br />

Can u help me to explain about this?or i must download for new master cd baaN???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">21st October 2008, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that strange. Usually after you select the type of baan installation you want, it goes to this screen. My Baan master CD is as old as yours but never skipped this screen in all the installations that i have done. Its beyond me as to why it wouldnt come in your scenario. Maybe you want to try it again by creating a new instance of SQL and installing Baan on that instance or if time permits, wipe the slate clean and start from the beginning.<br />

Or must SP3 and then install BaaN and finally i upgrade the SP4?<br />

<br />
the latest information i get from infor was<br />
&quot;<br />
Baan IV c4 Backoffice (with ss7.0 support)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means you need to pre-install Microsoft SQL Server Version 7 and NOT SQL Server 2000 before you install this copy of Baan IV. That is the cause of you getting the binary sort error.<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
So it means, i use wrong master cd/i should install SQL V7.0 before?<br />
<br />
Can u explain to me?Because they always told me to rebuild database, but i did it for serveral times and i checked it that it is right i use Latin1_General and sort Binary..<br />
<br />
Please give ur advice thanx</div></div><hr />

   Its been a while since we moved from SQL 7.0 and so the recollection of the steps (exactly what and how we did it) are a bit sketchy. However, i am attaching a document which will help you in upgrading a sql7 installation to sql2k. <br />
<br />
Its best that you request Infor to send you a Master CD for the combination of Win2k3/SQL2k so that you wouldnt have to take this tricky installation route.<br />

   What do you mean by &quot;Database was empty&quot;? During the final stages of Baan installation, it creates &amp; populates certain tables for Baan to start. So your Baan Database could not be empty, if the installation was successful. <br />

   Once after you installed the demo companies and prior to installing the patches you might want to setup the Shared Memory . <br />
1) Run session Maintain Shared Memory Data {ttaad4150m000}<br />
2) Click on Group Insert and select &quot;Program Object&quot; as Shared Memory Data Type. <br />
3) Click on Special Menu &amp; select Copy Objects From DD <br />
4) Supply the following information in the next session<br />
package: tt<br />
version: (std VRC)<br />
Program from: dll to dllzzzzzzz <br />
 Repeat for        dsk to dskzzzzzz <br />
        &amp;                stp to stpzzzzzz<br />
 Once this is done, select Convert to Runtime from the Special Menu &amp; Restart.<br />

  Does the user with which you have logged on to the server has enough security privileges for creating databases and db objects? If &quot;baan&quot; has been given as the default admin user at the setup, does this username exist on the server as an OS user and is part of the administrator group? <br />
