<br />
We are using BaanERP5c on an as400 iseries 820.<br />
We have 1G of Ram, 9 HD each at 20 G.<br />
<br />
We have only 3 companies with real data inside then and we are averaging 80% occupancy of the disks.<br />
<br />
Obviously this information will depend on what volumes of data you will use.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

thanks Shaun<br />
We were even using as400 model 170 with 460 CPW, 1G RAM and HD 40 GB.<br />
but the problem is if the implementation of empty Baan on <br />
model 170 with 115 Procesor CPW, 320MB RAM and HD 12 GB will be successful.<br />
I wrote 'empty Baan' because they are not going to use Baan functionality, only our packages: Human Resources and Payroll. So there won't be so many data to import and the increase of data per year won't be so huge.<br />
(I almost forgot: 10 baan users and 1300 employees)<br />
<br />
any hints?<br />
<br />
Another question is how big is the installation of system OS400(+DB2 and necessary PTF's), let's say V4R4 or V5R1?<br />

<br />
as long as baan in empty then i don't see any blocking problems with the installation on the as400 that you are talking about. It may be slow, but it should run.<br />
<br />
Regarding the OS400, i cannot tell you exactly how big the installation is, the only information i can give you is that we installed v5r1 and there where 12 cd's for the OS and a further 8 cd's for db2 (the ptf's are the standard ones on the support site).....this probably doesn't help a great deal, but as you can imagine we have all our data installed on top now so it is difficult to say how big it is.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
