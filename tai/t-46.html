<br />
Class:	Error		Session:	ttaad4225m000	Object:		various<br />
<br />
Country:		F<br />
<br />
Description:	<br />
Situation Description:<br />
The session 'Reorganize Tables' [ttaad4225m000] were killed or stopped while the job were busy.<br />
The system is not able to be started any more.<br />
<br />
Solution Description:<br />
While running, the session first creates a file called R.&lt;tablename&gt;. Then the table will be rebuilt using <br />
this R.&lt;tablename&gt; file. When everything runs well, when the table is reorganized, the R.&lt;tablename&gt; <br />
is removed from the system. After the session is killed (while running), the original table will not be <br />
complete - it is not suitable for use anymore.<br />
In this case you will have to rebuild the table using the R.&lt;tablename&gt; file manually. Shell down to <br />
Unix or DOS level and go to the directory where the reorganize session started from, search for the <br />
R.&lt;tablename&gt; file(s) and run the command given below:<br />
<br />
	Unix:	bdbreconfig6.1 -N &lt;tablename&gt;&lt;company no&gt;+<br />
	NT:	bdbreconfig -N &lt;tablename&gt;&lt;company no&gt;+<br />
<br />
Example: In most cases the file(s) can be found in the TMP-directory of the root-path. The name of <br />
such a file could be 'R.tibom000822'. If you have a NT-System the command you will have to run will <br />
be:<br />
	bdbreconfig -N tibom000822+<br />
<br />
This command reads the tablename and company number given as arguments and converts them <br />
into a new table definition matching the new data dictionary definition. It requires a new data dictionary <br />
with a '.new' extension, the current data dictionary and tables matching those in the current data dic-<br />
tionary. After successful completion, old tables are deleted and new are generated.<br />
The command finds the optimum way to reconfigure and if there is no real change in two data <br />
dictionaries it prints the massage 'No conversion required'. Furthermore it sees to it that a database <br />
remains consistent. When more than one table is given to be reconfigured and if an error occurs in the <br />
middle of the operation, it reverts to the orriginal state.<br />
<br />
Warning: make copy of the dump/file(s) before doing this!!</div></div><hr />

Not that many people are aware of this 'recovery' procedure throug bdbreconfig6.1 although it is documented in the Tools Technical Manual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright - where are you getting this cool stuff?<br />
How long have some of you been involved with Baan-Oracle?<br />
How can I get a copy of a Tools Technical Manual?<br />
What other toys do you have that might help we BaaN/Oracle rookies?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">17th January 2002, 08:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Were to get those info from? <br />
- BGS, search with keyword Oracle. <br />
- Take a look at the quick guides. <br />
- Ask your tools consultant for scripts/documentation.<br />
- Look on the net on boards like this one. <br />
- Ask colleque's.<br />
- Manuals like a programmers manual can be printed out by the documentation sessions, not sure if you can do that also for the tools technical manual.<br />
<br />
Baan already started in 1988 to develop a driver for Oracle, I was supporting the programmer then. However I started to use it reguarly since 1997.<br />
<br />
Does that answer some of your questions?<br />
<br />
One comment on your first posting: analyze on $IDX1 does not do all indexes! I am used to do an analyze on a weekly basis and simply generate the analyze statements by quering all tables which are owned by baan.<br />

I am also facing the same issues and getting more than 9 R FILES created in tmp folder. How to bdbreconfig each single file or just run the command and the system will recover all available R files?<br />

Thanks<br />
<br />
I think this is the format of the bdbreconfig command<br />
<br />
# bdbreconfig6.1 -Ntimcs016 -C100<br />
<br />
And i have used bdbpre and bdbpost,so based on that i can suggest create a text file and input all the tables in that you want.For example<br />
<br />
Input.txt<br />
<br />
timcs016<br />
timcs017<br />
timcs018<br />
timcs019<br />
timcs020<br />
<br />
And put this input.txt as input to the bdbreconfigure6.1 command like<br />
<br />
 bdbreconfig6.1 -I /temp/Input.txt -C100<br />
<br />
Not entirely sure about the syntax but you can check in your respective shell about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
manage to recover the data accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for this excellent thread.<br />
<br />
In my case, I used &quot;bdbreconfig6.1 -Ntfacp200&lt;Company&gt; -m -n -f&quot;, but nothing happend (okay, output three lines; line 1 = Table ..., line 2 = --- ..., line 3 = tfacp200&lt;Company&gt;, but column &quot;New&quot; did not display any Counter).<br />
<br />
After a &quot;ps -ef&quot; I found a hanging inf_srv6.1 process which had to be killed before. <br />
<br />
After that, when I restarted bdbreconfig6.1, the &quot;New&quot; counter started like a charm.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Günther</div></div><hr />
