<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fred64</div><div class="date">27th January 2006, 11:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Baan job that executes session ttadv6420m000 (Print software components per package vrc) for every pvrc combination. This means the session is executed 12 times with different settings.<br />
When I execute the job it freezes after executing about 2 to 4 sessions.<br />
I checked ttaad500, 501 and 503 but they all seem ok.<br />
I placed a trace on the job to find the problem but with the trace on the job it runs perfectly.<br />
I placed a Unix sleep command after every job step to slow things down a bit but that didn't help.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions what might be the problem here ?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

Does the job consistantly freeze on the same session or a different session ? Is the job being run through the activate job session or is it just running through the job queue ?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
Most of the time it freezes on the same session. But when I activate/deactivate some sessions it freezes on another one.<br />
The problem occurs both runnnig the job from the crontab or starting it by manualy with ttaad5203m000.<br />
I am superuser and all permissions have been checked.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walter01</div><div class="date">30th January 2006, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">When I execute the session with the same settings everything works fine.<br />
All output per job step is written to an ascii file in $BSE_TMP where the filename reflects the name of the printed pvrc.<br />
For those job steps that don't freeze it works just as I intended it to.<br />
<br />
Output example:<br />
-rw-rw----   1 wg01     bsp           22372 Jan 30 13:54 ccB40Cc3lacc<br />
-rw-rw----   1 wg01     bsp            1134 Jan 30 13:54 ccB40Oc3live<br />
-rw-rw----   1 wg01     bsp           64872 Jan 30 13:55 ccB40Pc3pcm2<br />
Where : cc = package, B40? = version, c3 = release, lacc etc = customer.<br />
<br />
This time ccB40Pc3pcm2 freezes up after printing the last lines of data.</div></div><hr />

When I repeatedly print to an ascii file from any tools session, it tends to<br />
freeze. So it has nothing to do with my job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walter01</div><div class="date">30th January 2006, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">There was an error in our shell scripts that's executed by our ASCIF device.<br />
It contained a path of our previous server.<br />
It's solved now but I don't understand why it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't work.</div></div><hr />
