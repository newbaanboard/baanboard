<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pcolombo</div><div class="date">7th April 2005, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys: Ive been read post <br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/...highlight=ba6.1<br />
<br />
and have some problems configuring client side <br />
<br />
I opened new thread cause im thinkin previous is closed or something like that.<br />
<br />
These are my doubts:<br />
<br />
1) What values i must setup in my BSE,and BSE_TMP, server directory or client directory?<br />
<br />
i.e my BSE in server is d:\baan and client is \baan.<br />
<br />
2) When i setup users in baan server , must i also setup as remote users?. This is the only way i know to generate the r-file. So i suppose that i also must create a system called &lt;baan-server&gt;. Is that correct?<br />
<br />
3) In &quot;Copy ipc_info from server:$BSE/lib/ into current lib, edit it and add in first line:<br />
&lt;baan_server&gt;!bshell s 0 0 p /baan/bse/bin/bshell6.1 path on server&quot;<br />
<br />
Must i leave ipc_info on sever without changes ? , must i enter the path as Windows folder? i.e: <br />
<br />
baanserver!bshell s 0 0 p D:/baan/bin/ntbshell <br />
<br />
4) My actual directory structure in client side is :<br />
<br />
\baan<br />
-------\bin<br />
----------ba6.1<br />
-------\lib<br />
----------ipc_info<br />
----------\user<br />
-------------uuser<br />
-------------ruser<br />
-------\tmp<br />
-------\log<br />
<br />
BSE=\baan<br />
BSE_TMP=$BSE\bin<br />
BSE_REM=baanserver<br />
<br />
My ipc_info in client shows:<br />
baanserver!bshell    s    d:\baan\bin\ntbshell.exe<br />
<br />
My user &quot;user&quot; is in bsp group.<br />
<br />
When i try to execute ba6.1 i receive the following:<br />
<br />
ba6.1: Server 'baanserver' not listed in ipc_info file.<br />
ba6.1: cannot get the hostname of the server<br />
ba6.1: ba6.1 failed to connect to bshell<br />
<br />
Just to test i moved ipc_info to another location , when tried to execute ba6.1 again , i received the same errors.<br />
<br />
What im doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and sorry about my english<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

You do not need to change anythying in the ipc_info file on the server, just the client needs to know where the bshell is to be run.<br />
Also, the BSE and BSE_TMP are always the server side so the ba6.1 will just act as a display server (like a BW).<br />
You also need to have the rfiles (remote users) created and copied over to the client to be able to work from the ba6.1 client side.</div></div><hr />

Looks to me like your tabledef is wrong. Baan thinks that &quot;baanserver&quot; is <br />
a driver instead of a machine. <br />
