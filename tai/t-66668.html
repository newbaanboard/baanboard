<br />
I wanted to see if anyone has any recommendations on this before we start getting down on testing.<br />
<br />
I inherited an LN Enterprise Server FP3 (ES3) with a tools version 7.6a3 and Porting Set 8.7a.<br />
<br />
Edit: I am running on AIX 6.1 &amp; Oracle 10.2.3<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any experience on upgrading the Tools Version (They asked us to go to the latest), we have some issues where Infor mentioned an upgrade on the Tools should fix it. Can we upgrade tools without upgrading the ES? I am a bit wary about some of Infor's advice because most of the time, their first thing is to say update the porting set and tools will fix every issue in the book.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ian</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can your 7.6_a3 with the latest tools solutions for that version. That should be no problem.<br />
However you can also upgrade to e.g. 7.6_a9 (10.3) if you upgrade your portingset to 8.9.a first.<br />
<br />
That works too but you will notice some minor changes. Did this lately for one customer as first step to upgrade the whole application to 10.3. <br />
<br />
BTW: ES is the name for both tools and portingset.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the advice. Hopefully the tools upgrade would sort some of our issues we are seeing with it.<br />

If I remember correctly, there are some solution you need to install (if that solutions are not yet installed).</div></div><hr />
