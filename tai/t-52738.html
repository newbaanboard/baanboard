<br />
Users who use Worktop now get Menu Browser instead of Process Browser within worktop.  <br />
<br />
The first time they tried Worktop after the issue developed, they got a quick flash of a message about authorisation.  In Maintain User Data - Startup, the Worktop box is checked and also the Baan Process Browser.  It makes no difference, in fact, if these boxes are unchecked or if the Menu Browser box is checked - it is as if the Worktop settings are being ignored.<br />
<br />
If I run an old version of Worktop (2.2.3) it very clearly says &quot;No worktop authorisation has been defined for this configuration file&quot;.  Yet the user is set up correctly in Maintain User Data.<br />
<br />
The user can still run DEM Browser in BW without problem.<br />
<br />
The cause of the issue is not clear, but seems to relate either to Standard Program updates, or to porting set update.  The current porting set is 6.1c.07.14.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
