<br />
When I used 'End Activity' after I checked-in the session, I got the message as attached file.<br />
<br />
Could you please to advise solution to solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Detail as attached file ( ch_lnreport_204 is a temporary activity)<br />
<br />
&quot;A new activity ch_lnreport_204 has been opened. This activity includes the components you wanted to end. <br />
A retry of the end activity action can be done for that activity. Error message: Error, Cannot perform CM Action, resource does not exist or is not synchronized with the workspace&quot;<br />
<br />
Many thanks,</div></div><hr />

Currently, I can end activity because I haven't authorized to management the folder.<br />

Hi JanePapa,<br />
<br />
I'm solving the same problem.<br />
<br />
Can I ask what authorization it was and to what directory.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had this without the permission thing (depending on setup in Studio), but non finalized delivery activity.</div></div><hr />

It's definitely available in MT Cloud.<br />
