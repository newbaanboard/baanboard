<br />
We currently have 1 Informix instance supporting several Baan companies.  <br />
<br />
Company 100/200 are in the same VRC, and company 700/800 are in the same VRC.  User 'bsp' is accociated with 100/200's VRC...however, I need to reorg a table for company 800, and I can't do it through the GUI (user bsp)...it gives an error about &quot;not in same VRC package&quot;.  <br />
<br />
When I chance bsp's VRC to company 800 (through maintain user data), after I log back in...the TOOLS section is gone.  ???  <br />
<br />
Anyone have any insight on how I can get this fixed so that I can reorg tables in company 700/800 through the GUI?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advancce for your help;<br />

They have perhaps delete tools menu from the main menu (I did ask my admin to do that!).<br />
<br />
So when you change your bsp user to the combination choose another menu than the standard menu (tccom00000000 i think). You could choose to access to the tools menu directly for instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More than likely you are viewing a different menu for the latter companies where the Tools section has been removed. It doesn't mean however that the Tools sessions are gone though. You can always execute them directly by using the Run Program option and entering the right session code. If you only have to access a couple of sessions this is a viable workground.</div></div><hr />
