<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Our finance department posts (envelopes and stamps) 100's of statements a month and have asked me if I know of a fax solution that will help with this process. Whilst I know there are Baan fax solutions available I don't want to spend £1000's.<br />
<br />
Has anybody got any ideas on how I can print out statements from Baan and then fax. I initially thought we could print statements to Word and then some how use a macro to fax the individual statements. But this I know will get messy.<br />
<br />
All ideas will be greatly received!<br />

very cheap - they have several products that are interactive and also automatic that can fax/email the action reports from Baan.<br />
<br />
I will not say the $$cost you can contact them...I was kinda shocked at the price (expecting much more).<br />
<br />
Another way I might explore is setting up the FAX device, and then in the &quot;wanted&quot; reports using a lookup to the supplier/customer table to read the fax number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can launch the software with parameters like excel, then you can always develop your own device driver.  You can check out the code and utilities forum for examples.  You can see various methods of launching different applications. It also seems to me that someone had a sample of a fax device, but I can not find it.  So the poor mans solution is to develop it yourself - maybe.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We are evaluating a fax server right now that has an text API.<br />
It will watch a directory, and when files arrive into the directory, search them for codes that contain the information about who to send the fax to.<br />
<br />
I am considering writing some custom code into the standard baan reports that will put these fax codes into the report, and then just print them off into the directory.<br />
<br />
One of the issues is that each fax must be it's own file.<br />
<br />
I think the fax server is called 'Fax Maker'.<br />

<br />
Our solution is to send an email from the BAAN Server to an small linux box with a modem. The software on the linux system is called hylafax, it´s very powerful and free!!.<br />
<br />
More infos www.hylafax.org (http://www.hylafax.org) <br />
<br />
Greetings <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">16th September 2002, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">We have hylafax running here as well.<br />
All you need to do is:<br />
a) get a linux-System running with a modem and the hylafax server (This takes some time for experimenting, but as already said: It's free!)<br />
b) create a &quot;printing-device&quot; for Baan, which in reality is a shell script that transfers the data to the hylafax-server (Here we take the field &quot;Filename&quot; as container for the recipients faxnumber)<br />
c) some additional scripting on the faxserver creates an email that informs the sender whether his fax was submitted or not<br />
<br />
Just try and have fun while developing the script needed,  if you get stuck, mail me (now@niederrhein.de)<br />

<br />
We have Baan Installed on IBM AIX unix machine, and we also have Redhat Linux machines for out public website, how easy is it to set up the hylafax and get baan to send fax. Can I install hylafax on aix5.2???<br />
<br />
If you send me more info on install/configure hylafax I would appreciate.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is one more new product developed by FutureIT namd Generic command server (GCS). This is total server based solution, no client side installation, no extenssion of reports etc. Just configure a new device and send fax using Microsft SBS shared fax service and send email using Exchange server. I think the product can ne customize for other plateforms.<br />
yes, its not a free product.<br />
<br />
you can contact to future IT  for further detail at info@futureit.ch (www.futureit.ch).<br />
