<br />
I'm look to implement some kind of email alert when the job fails or stop working (jobdaemon). I have a simple print job running 1-2mins to verify jobdaemon is running, but I manually have to look at it. <br />
<br />
What would be the best way to send an email alert when that job fails to run after for example 3 mins?<br />
<br />
Would it easier/best to run some kind of check at the unix level?<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

... alert when the job fails or stop working (jobdaemon)<br />
<br />
So you would have to monitor the jobs success as well as the state of the jobdaemon.<br />
<br />
I would do the following:<br />
Make the job create a simple file (may be empty) as its last step (you may want to use the report script to do this).<br />
Start a job via cron some minutes after the job should have finished.<br />
This simple job will state the presence of the file, create the email if the file doesn't exist and finally erase the file.<br />

U may use these fields to run a session only on error of job steps.<br />
<br />
There are many alternatives to send email (like os mailx  / outollok automation in vb .net etc ) which u can gather further more detail on this board.</div></div><hr />
