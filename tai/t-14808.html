<br />
I have one user that is having a problem on a few different sessions with yes/no fields.  When she tabs into the yes/no field there is a 10 to 20 second delay on the cusor to show.  Some times she clicks on the drop down arrow and nothing happens for 10 to 20 seconds.  Now she only has 1 Baan window open and Lotus notes.  Her desktop has 512 meg of ram.  <br />
<br />
I had another user with this problem but it went away.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas.  This is the BW client on Windows XP machine.  We are using Baan 4c4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best thing to do is to put some trace functions on her client. That way you can determine what transactions are responsible for the delay.<br />
<br />
If you're porting set is up to par, you should be able to use the new BLAT, which is just the greatest thing to come from Baan in a long, long time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">15th March 2004, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a new tracing toolaAvailable in porting sets 6.1c.03 and 7.1c.02 and higher.<br />
<br />
It allows for comprehensive tracing of SQL, sessions, the database driver (yes! yes! Finally we have a tool that takes the guesswork out of query interpretations!), etc.<br />
<br />
Best of all, because it logs everything in binary format, the trace files stay within acceptable limits.<br />
<br />
Although not all options are implemented at this time (of course they don't tell you which ones aren't, I personally am unable to extract bind variables), it has proven extremely helpful in the two weeks that I've been able to use it.<br />
<br />
BLAT can be set like any other variable. The options are available from the wiki or the Baan Performance Tuning Guide that was published here somewhere by Grandmaster Dikkie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My help desk person deinstalled and reinstalled the nic driver and problem solved.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help and suggestions.</div></div><hr />
