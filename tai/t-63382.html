On the Unix Level but after Compiling the Object Size becomes<br />

At the very minimum, the embedded path, date, user of who and where it was compiled would change but that may not explain the 180 byte (then 27416 vs. now 27236) difference.  Maybe differences in include files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">23rd January 2013, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I have tried with bic_info6.1. But for some reason it is giving an Error saying Can't open object 'oacr4410.new' for reading</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">24th January 2013, 07:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Its All right as of now as the Client agreed that Untill there is a Functional Difference in the Working of the Program we will go ahead with the Different Object Size.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the Help. I got to know bic_info6.1 through it.</div></div><hr />
