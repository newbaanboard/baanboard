<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">What OmeLuuk is saying is that there is no such thing as a template for Baan system administration.<br />
However, by reading all the messages on this board, mainly the tools and administration forums, you will get a pretty good idea of how a Baan system will behave different from other systems and what problems to expect and how to prepare for them.<br />
<br />
Good luck and don't hesitate to leave your questions here (although preferably a little more specific) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Profuse did have the idea of the &quot;canned knowledge&quot; in CCPacks (from the Competence Center Program)... but I am afraid China is too far off for us, ... see more on our site (http://www.profuse.nl). Not meant as a commercial (do not want to violate the Board rules) info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">And if I may add...<br />
<br />
...of course there are classes available through various institutes around the globe (as I mentioned to Luke earlier, his company Profuse actually got me started in the right direction with their tools and Baan SA classes).<br />
How the availability is in China I dare only guess. From a Baan perspective that would literally be the other side of the globe.<br />
<br />
Your implementation partner should be able to help you out though, Bai Song.<br />
<br />
However, Baan Admin classes are much like driving lessons. You don't really know diddly squat until you have some significant milage behind you....and some people simply never learn.<br />
<br />
But like I said before, if you can post more specific questions, you'll find plenty of people here who will be willing to help you out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OmeLuuk's web site is in Dutch.<br />
<br />
I suggest the following web site for online translation from Dutch into English... This is what I use... <br />
<br />
http://www.worldlingo.com/products_services/worldlingo_translator.html<br />
<br />
By the way, it can translate into Chineese too..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">8th September 2002, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that they expect you to build a training manual but an operational manual for your particular system, that is:<br />
<br />
- how is Baan setup (install path, version, PMC setup, VRC setup, etc.)<br />
- how to add/delete users<br />
- how to add/delete devices<br />
etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baisong</div><div class="date">9th September 2002, 04:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Does any friends has document of system administraton which to be draw up by your self.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">9th September 2002, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">There is one more option in the &quot;Quick Guides&quot; (http://secure1.support.baan.com/html/Documentation_quickguides.htm) on the Baan site. This may help you along, as well as the &quot;Knowledge Related&quot; solutions that are published.<br />
<br />
But as layed out above: nothing beats a good training to get started. This may also a 1 to 1 training by some senior colleage...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">9th September 2002, 12:47</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;quick guides&quot; have proved very useful for us<br />
<br />
Is this a &quot;controlled document&quot; insofar as updates to it are concerned or is it &quot;frozen&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">10th September 2002, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know if they run maintenance schedules on the quick guides. On the one hand, since they are published in solutions, they are to maintain them too. But on the other hand, I think it is more realistic to consider them to be &quot;frozen&quot;.</div></div><hr />
