I have a situation in Baan4c4 explained below:<br />
<br />
We have developed a tool which is supposed to copy user authorizations from one Baan server to another Baan server. <br />
<br />
Running this tool creates records in the tables from ttaad001 to ttaad999. <br />
<br />
After doing this we do the &quot;convert user data to convert to runtime&quot;. <br />
<br />
But the user whose authorizations are copied still does not have permissions to the sessions. <br />
<br />
But after this I tried deleting a session from session authorizations for that user. Then I added the session again and did convert to runtime for that session. Now I could run the session with that user login.<br />
<br />
Is the tool, which creates records directly in the ttaad... tables, missing any logic in the sessions ttaad2130m000, ttaad2131m000.....?<br />
Let me know if anyone has any idea about what could be happening.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

They were set when you deleted and added them from the sessions.<br />
<br />
We have a similar tool but we are on a different/higher version of BaaN, so I can't help you out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jksandy08</div><div class="date">26th October 2005, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw the table ttaad400. But I could not make out anything from that. I mean I did not understand the values of modification type and remaining key.<br />
what do they mean? modification type has some values a,p,u...what do they mean? and what are the other values it can have.<br />
It would be very helpful if someone can throw some info on these.<br />
<br />

If I remember correctly to solve this problem I had to copy some data from tables ttaaad999 and ttadv999 as well.</div></div><hr />
