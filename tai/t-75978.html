<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stuckon4c4</div><div class="date">4th October 2023, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We use Windows Task Scheduler to run our Baan jobs and have done so for years now. In the past couple of months, the jobs have started to (seemingly randomly) stop running on the Baan side. On the Windows side, all of the tasks show that they ran properly. However, on the Baan side, the jobs don't run. <br />
<br />
I can't find any rhyme or reason as to when this happens. It seems to potentially happen more when we are not logged into the server, but the jobs run just fine other times when we're not logged in. We have made it so that the users never get logged off of the server and the tasks run as admins. <br />
<br />
The weird part about this is how inconsistent the issue is. If they were not running at all it would be easier to troubleshoot as we would be able to replicate the issue. This is causing major issues in bringing in inbound EDI, sending EDI, running financial jobs at the correct time, etc and it keeps happening. I've even stayed logged into the server all day and don't see any issues.<br />
<br />
I have a sneaking suspicion it has something to do with connectivity, but I have no proof. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Moderators have to approve the first post.  As to the issue itself - I moved it here because I think it will get more responses hopefully. <br />

We have 4c4 on UNIX platforms and never had an issue like this.  But I have seen some pretty weird things between the clients and the servers.  All of our jobs run on the app server and then once the app kicks off for the sessions in the job they connect to the database server.    I have seen network issues between clients (on windows) to the app server, and have seen some network issues between app server and database server.  I do not know if that could be your case or not. In our case the DBA's and Network teams could track down the issues between app server and database server.  It was a lot harder with the clients and the app server.  This one could not be duplicated on demand.  The first thing I would do is log a case with infor.</div></div><hr />
