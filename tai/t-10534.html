After setting up session_timeout option in ufile, the system logs out the idle user.  But, it displays BW error msg and waits for the return key.  Can't this be avoided?<br />
<br />
i.e., I've set a timeout of 15 min. for an idle user.  After 15 min of inactivity the system logs the user off automatically.  When the user is logged off, BW error windows appears, saying &quot;BW connect error ....&quot; and waits for the return key to be pressed.  <br />
<br />
Can't this be avoided? so, that the user will not even know that he was thrown out by the server.<br />

It's just a generic message that appears whenever the client loses connectivity no matter what the cause.</div></div><hr />

Before cleanly logging out users after a preset time of inactivity - CloseIdle will save data in any of the user's open sessions.  You can have different timeouts per user and can exclude certain sessions or users from timeout as required.  I've used it and think it's great!</div></div><hr />

Just curious about one thing.  What would CloseIdle do with a session where the required fields are only halfway completed?  Issuing a &quot;Save&amp;Exit&quot; command would surely result in errors!  Does CloseIdle handle this?</div></div><hr />

As I know, CloseIdle investigates the process to database, if it is active then it does not shutdown the session even though it exceeds the preset time-out.<br />

The descriptive message itself shows reason of bshell disconnection, otherwise users may complain that bshell is disappering. Hence, I think, it can't be unavoided.<br />

Insert sales order<br />
start creating a sales order line: enter item code, but do not enter a quantity or price yet. Now have CloseIdle close your session:<br />
- fieldvalues may not be saved to database since it will result in a sales orderline with an item without price or quantity<br />
- ignoring the input data will cause data loss...<br />
- session is in &quot;waiting&quot; state on input on a field, thus database is idle</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your comments are vital &amp; has certainly set me re-thinking. I read documentation of CloseIdle, where they wrote and assurred this. I don't know exact architecture of CloseIdle, long time ago we used it in demo period. Later we inhouse built the functionality of CloseIdle. <br />
Let someone cross-check it, If the data is in field values only, small data loss might be there.<br />

<br />
In my experience, if a form is half-way completed and a 'save and exit' would cause a Baan error if attempted, then CloseIdle will not close the session.  Hope that makes sense</div></div><hr />
