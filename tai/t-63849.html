<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">21st March 2013, 09:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we're on SP19 and I gave it a try some days ago on our testserver. I used the multilevel-download-session to download the latest BaanIV related solution listed in solution 1180901.<br />
<br />
It did run a while and if I calculated right, it will require roughly around 3000 solution to install on our testserver (check to install ended up with 54 pages of pre required solutions, with about 60 solutions on one page).<br />
<br />
So I'm guessing it will install on every BaanIV SP-level (and will just download all required solutions). KB 1180901 does not name a required SP for BaanIV, so I think basically you can install on every SP-level.<br />
KB 1180901 links a XLSX-File providing a list of solutions for BaanIV, ERPV and LN.<br />
<br />
I only did a check to install without any updates, just to get a first list of customized components affected by the updates. I still don't know, how to handle that thing. ;)</div></div><hr />

Your answer is correct. So the more SP's you have installed already the less solutions you need to install. (what do you mean I still don't know to handle this?)<br />
<br />
After having the solutions installed you can start to build the xml file for you sepa payments.<br />

We're planing on migrating to LN, but I need to check alternatives, just in case, we don't migrate until then.<br />
<br />
The amount of solutions isn't  something small. I still need to check the customized components affected by the solutions (and the derived components, which have been copied from standard-components and are not found by the check to install runs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">22nd March 2013, 21:11</div></div><div class="posttext">With that many solutions I would recommend to install them in a test environment. Only way to make sure things will keep running.<br />
Since SP's are primarly bug fixes I guess that most things will keep running. But you have to check.<br />
