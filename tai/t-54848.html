<br />
We are facing a issue with Timezone. When the time zone was set to GMT or GTM+2.00 , the record was mismacthing between General Table Maintenance (GTM) and database level. Could some one tell us what could be the cause for this.<br />

System: Windows 2003server<br />
Database: Ms-SQL 2005.<br />

<br />
But this is a nightmare for some stuffs like reporting, i work in a bug corporation, and what we do, is put the server(unix) in UTC, and then all the user templates with a timezone located in UTC, in this way the function is not going to add or substract any from the original hour, and the date/time showed is the same than the saved in the database.<br />
<br />
in b5c and Lnfp3 the timezone africa/casablanca works great for this purpose.<br />
