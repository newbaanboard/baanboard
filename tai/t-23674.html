<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chadwickh</div><div class="date">8th April 2005, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like a BaanIVc4 session that would insert into a temporary table a number of records, do some computations on the records, etc. In the end it would provide me a measurement on how long it took. Your typical computer benchmark program like &quot;http://benchmarks.dacris.com/information.htm&quot; but in a Baan session. I've been told to run some finance reports that take a while to see how long they take. Well that could be affected by data changes, if the data's been archived, if users are working on it, etc. Anybody come up with anything like this? I can't imagine it'd be that hard to do. Maybe it could keep the stats in a table with a description field so I could keep track of when it was run. We're replacing our UNIX servers, and I'd like to be able to run a simple standardized test to get a feel for how performance has improved or not. Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
there are a couple of issues, which your approach:<br />
<br />
a) having such a session, would anyway just test batch performance. <br />
Testing batch performance is important for each migration, but for this you can take indeed a standard session like the MRP or a statistics rebuild, which are repeatable.<br />
If you use such a batch test, then you need to do this anyway in something like a donwtime period, because otherwise the result is messed up by concurrent user actions.<br />
<br />
b) The real issue in testing performance is actual online performance of X concurrent users. This is the real challange and a single session will not help you here. Especially in your situation (going from a HP to a windows box) scalibility by CPU count will be affected.<br />
<br />
c) Finally you have to consider, that the performance is always much more dependend on the specific code executed. A silver bullet solution to increase performance does not exist. A silver bullet solution to measure performance is therefore also nonsense. If the performance for your test session is good, this does not imply that the performance of other major sessions is good, as different SQL statements are executed.<br />
<br />
But I agree that a performance testing mechanism would be of great help for any migration. So maybe somebody here a solution without the pitfalls I described?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 03:52</div></div><div class="posttext">This topic is quite broad.... there are many things you can do check performance and response.<br />
<br />
1. CPU- You are on HP, which have the glance, top and Open View utlities where you can see the bar charts about CPU, Memory/RAM, Disk Swap etc usages.<br />
<br />
2. database - You are on Oracle, so you can use Spotlight or DBA studio for metrics. Tables are regularly analyzed ?<br />
<br />
#1, #2 - also depend on the System Tuning Parameters, Network Bandwidth, Number of Users, Load Balancing etc.<br />
<br />
From BaaN end <br />
<br />
# 3 Shared Memory is used or not.<br />
<br />
# 4 Use of filters, bad table/index designs.<br />
<br />
# 5 Number of companies and databases and also number per database.<br />
<br />
#  6. Efficiency of SQL - This is the hard one as you never know how the end users do the data entry or use the search capabilities etc or if the developers had a bad code.<br />
<br />
You can use the BaaN Standard ARTM - http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_artm_artm_overview<br />
<br />
or build your own custom tools to trace what the user is doing. Here is our example -<br />
<br />
# 7 - Job History - As Markus mentioned you can get that information but it also depends on how many records you are processing.</div></div><hr />
