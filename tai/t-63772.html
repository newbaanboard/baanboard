We are using ERP LN at our site. Is there any option to trace code of any BaaN activity at the OS level? I want to build an utility which traces code line by line and give me some output. Is that possible? Assume I have both source code and object of LN. Please let me know your thought.<br />

You can use the Unix system commands -<br />
<br />
NAME<br />
      tusc - trace unix system calls<br />
<br />
 SYNOPSIS<br />
      tusc [options] command [args ...] | pid [pid ...]<br />
<br />
      truss [options ] command | -p pid ...<br />
<br />
 DESCRIPTION<br />
      Tusc traces the system calls a process invokes and the signals it receives. It displays arguments in a symbolic way, shows the first bytes of read and write buffers as well as signal information when available. Tusc can attach to live processes by providing PIDs (process IDs) as argument(s).<br />
<br />
-OR-<br />
<br />
 NAME<br />
      strace - write STREAMS event trace messages to standard output<br />
<br />
 SYNOPSIS<br />
      strace [ mod sub pri ] ...<br />
<br />
 DESCRIPTION<br />
      strace gets STREAMS event trace messages from STREAMS drivers and modules via the STREAMS log driver (strlog(7)), and writes these messages to standard output.  By default, strace without arguments writes all STREAMS trace messages from all drivers and modules.<br />
      strace with command-line arguments limits the trace messages received.</div></div><hr />

Though I didn't understand much of these but will try or pass on this to my technical team. I have another question though - Can we put trace while debugging that it stops everytime program tries to make commit.transaction? Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

You can set a break point in the debugger for all the commit statements.</div></div><hr />
