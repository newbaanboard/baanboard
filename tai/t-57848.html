<br />
Is the path correct ? Do you really have you BSE on drive c: ?<br />
Is a firewall blocking the request ? Disable the firewall on your PC and also on the server for testing.<br />
Are the BW settings really the same on the PC and on the server ?<br />
<br />

Thanks for replying.<br />
Have tried your suggestion. It wasn't the desktop firewall but the server's! 1st, i just turned off the desktop firewall but couldn't connect. Then i proceed to turn off the Windows server firewall and i can login now. I also turn on back the desktop firewall (while the server's firewall still off) and i still can login into Infor ERP.<br />
<br />
Question. Is there any exception setting in the server's firewall specifically for Infor ERP LN? For, i would like to enable the server's firewall all the time. Your further advise is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />

I was getting the same error on the Windows server 2008 machine and i had to add port (512) to the firewall, so the clients can connect.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
