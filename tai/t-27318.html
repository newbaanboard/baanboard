<br />
In linux you have to enable the rexec service via YAST it's off by default.<br />

What do you mean by a remote windows 2000 machine?<br />
<br />
You're not using Remote Desktop are you? If so - it will not work<br />
you have to use PC-Anywere/Citrix/VNC instead.<br />

1. First check that the rexecd service is running on your linux box:<br />
<br />
# telnet localhost 512<br />
<br />
If not, then you probably either have to install it and/or add it to the inetd configuration.<br />
<br />
2. Then check that the rexecd is reachable from your windows server. For that, open a DOS window and do a telnet to your linux server also on port 512:<br />
<br />
DOS&gt; telnet linux-server 512<br />
<br />
If that does not work, then a firewall is probably blocking access for you.<br />
<br />
3. Check that rexec works from your windows server:<br />
<br />
DOS&gt; rexec &lt;linux-server&gt; -l &lt;user&gt; hostname<br />
<br />
This should show you the name of your linux server</div></div><hr />

Make sure &quot;localhost&quot; has an entry in your /etc/hosts file. It looks like rexec is not enabled on your linux server. How to do this depends on your Linux flavour but if you are using SuSE then this can be done through Yast (Network Services &gt; inetd). Look for the exec service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vktonk</div><div class="date">12th June 2006, 11:06</div></div><div class="posttext">i think rexec is on as the output of following command shows<br />
<br />
[root@c-3176 etc]# chkconfig --list | grep rexec<br />
        rexec:  on<br />
<br />
i am using REDHAT Advanced Application server 2. What do you mean by localhost. i had found that /etc/hosts file but that was empty.<br />
also i am not able to locate exec service when i try service exec start it says unrecognised service..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">12th June 2006, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">You should have at least following entries in your /etc/hosts file:<br />
<br />
<br />
127.0.0.1               localhost.localdomain localhost<br />
&lt;ip of your server&gt;            &lt;name of your server&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Make sure the file has '644' permission set so that it is world-readable.<br />
<br />
Then try the rexec tests again. You may also have to change some other security settings as well (securetty, PAM).</div></div><hr />

now that issue has been resolved but we are getting a new message.. it tells that &quot;An error occured while login to host&quot; .. <br />
the snap shot of that is attached... this message comes when previously REXEC message was coming....</div></div><hr />

You obviously forgot the attachment. Does a telnet to port 512 work now?</div></div><hr />
