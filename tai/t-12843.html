<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We upgraded to port set 6.1c.06.07, some reports (standard reports modiified)now do not print correctly. The reports overflow to another page when they fit on one page before. The device and paper type etc are the same. Recompiling the report does not fix this.<br />
<br />
repgen6.1 / repgen_incl6.1 builds are from Jan 31,2003.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have debugged and its the standard code (not the code in the report script), all of a sudden the footer section is executed, the internal var that tracks the current line is 1 more that the actual number of lines.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experience this ? any clues ?</div></div><hr />

This sounds similar to a problem we had, check for the latest ttstprepdll from baan support web site and try that.<br />

Thought I had it for you.  I'm sure that's what fixed it for us, plus we had to try the latest bw for barcode problems.  Maybe it was the combination.  Doesn't make sense though.<br />

just try different Bw ...Also, try running report on different PCs. A user can change some default fonts or so but I am sure that different version of BW should solve your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Try by maintaining Report defualts by session (ttaad3105m000) by specifying the Paper size and Font size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the latest repgen6.1 / repgen_incl6.1 / ottstpsplopen / ottstpsplclose / BW (B40c.68).........still no luck.  <br />
<br />
My problem is actully a little different that I first detailed.  The report is a check printing report.  The report prints 7 checks per page.  After the port set upgrade only 6 checks are printed per page, the 7th check is &quot;lost&quot; and never gets printed.  I debugged and found when its time to print the 7th check that the latter.lineno var is wrong, it is one more than it really is, thus the footer section is then printed.<br />
<br />
any clues ?</div></div><hr />
