<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sablassville</div><div class="date">22nd November 2007, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a job that I start using rc.startjob script.  After it runs for a long time (which is what I want) I want to stop it.<br />
<br />
the job runs one session only.  It is a custom session for an interface.<br />
<br />
I need to kill the running bshell, have the Baan job stop cleanly and ready to run, and have the application lock released.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me please?  <br />
<br />
I have played with the bshcmd6.1 command and the &quot;-k&quot; and the &quot;-e&quot; don't leave the job in the free state and remove the application lock.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Hmmm...seems the issue is related to your custom session. Have you tried running it without job?<br />
<br />
You can search here &quot;kill&quot;, it has been discussed many times. You can kill user from BaaN or Oracle or OS level.<br />
<br />

1. Your Job runs only one session.<br />
2. It's a customized session.<br />
<br />
So, why don't you give the session a way to stop itself in a clean way? I have done that by using a timer (e.g. every minute or so) and some condition (a specific file is present, an entry within a table exists, maybe some more).<br />
