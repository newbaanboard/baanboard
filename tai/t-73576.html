i am quite new to Infor and currently have a problem with permissions in 10.7.<br />
<br />
I want to build permissions modularly. That means there is a basic role and other roles that extend this role. Now I have the problem that in the basic role there are sessions with lower permissions (example print / display). The extension role has full permissions for this session.<br />
<br />
If I understand it correctly, the restrictive permission has a higher priority. So Print / Display will always be active for this session, right? Is there any way around this? If I can't build it modularly, I have to create and assign quite a few different role combinations as one. And that would be very complicated.<br />

Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

That is a good start. We did something similar the BASE USER Role was print/display and then additional roles which gave additional session permissions.<br />

You can create modular model, refer to the Tools Administration manual and the threads on the forum.<br />

<br />
thanks for the feedback. I have already read the known documents / entries. If I understand it correctly, I can build roles modularly by doing this on company level. That means I could define the basic role globally and the extended role company-specific. In theory certainly practical, but a user can have several extending roles. These can also have different permissions on one and the same session. It would be desirable if the higher permission has priority but that does not work as I understand it.<br />
<br />
This is how I currently understand it:<br />
Company        basic role<br />
Company 100 Extending role1<br />
Company 100 Extended role2<br />
Company 100 Extending role3<br />
<br />
The company gives higher priority to rolls 1-3 than to the basic roll. But how do they relate to each other? For the permissions of roles 1-3 we would always need the highest permission.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is an inaccurate statement (I have seen that behavior in GLOG/other systems). In Baan/LN, the highest privilege [0 (no access/display) + 1 (full)=1 (full) ] will be assigned.<br />
<br />
You need clear business requirements and good design to have a stable system and easy of maintenance.<br />
<br />
For Example-<br />
Corporate-Base-Role<br />
ACCOUNTINGCLERK<br />
ACCOUNTINGMANAGER<br />
<br />
Corporate-Base-Role: default print/display for all companies/system.<br />
ACCOUNTINGCLERK: access to a few sessions (full/modify/display).<br />
ACCOUNTINGMANAGER: is a superset of additional session privileges in addition to the ACCOUNTINGCLERK's sessions. <br />
<br />
Based on this thread, I take it that you have also design the Menu structure or using the Standard menu and not DEM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LordMrT</div><div class="date">18th December 2020, 10:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Good morning NPRao,<br />
<br />
DEM is not planned until later. We currently only use the tools permissions. Currently we handle it so that there are only two different menus. One for the administrators and one for the users. In 10.7 it is so that only the sessions / menus are displayed, on which also permissions are available.<br />
<br />
To come back to the problem. I now understand that global permissions (without a registered company) have a lower priority than those with a registered company.<br />
<br />
I'll try to describe our current situation so that I can maybe clarify it a bit better.<br />
<br />
We have a default role with no company assigned to all users. In this role there are permissions on standard sessions such as password changes etc.<br />
<br />
In addition, each user has at least one role from their department (with assigned company).<br />
Example warehouse management.<br />
The role Warehouse Management Basic has appropriate permissions. Among them also display permissions on the session whwmd2300m000.<br />
However, depending on the activity, a warehouse employee may have one or more additional roles.<br />
For example, warehouse management or inventory. These role permissions must be separated. To stay with the above session, the following scenario now arises:<br />
<br />
Role Default, Company &quot;&quot;<br />
whwmd2300m000 - No entry<br />
<br />
Role Warehouse_Basic, company 300<br />
whwmd2300m000 - Print / Display<br />
<br />
Role Warehouse_Lead, company 300<br />
whwmd2300m000 - Full permissions<br />
<br />
Role Warehouse_Inventory, company 300<br />
whwmd2300m000 - Insert / Print / Change / Display<br />
<br />
In our tests, a user with the roles Default, Warehouse_Basic and Warehouse_Inventory had only Print / Display permissions on session whwmd2300m000. It would be desirable if he has the highest authorization based on his roles and that would be Insert / Print / Change / Display.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it is currently unthinkable to completely roll up the authorization concept after 20 years. The current effort would be too high. In addition, we are currently in the process of migrating from 10.2 to 10.7.<br />
<br />
I hope I could clarify my problem a bit.<br />
Thank you for reading and already happy holidays and a happy new year.</div></div><hr />

It should have had the &quot;Insert / Print / Change&quot; as the cumulative access from the 3 AMS Roles. I hope you executed the runtime (ttams2200m000/ttams2201m000) for the roles and the user. You can also use the Debug Bshell to trace the Role Design issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I have found the problem. It works as you described. There seems to be a display bug with our 10.7. Via properties (Ctrl+Shift+8) the lower right is displayed, but the higher one is actually active. In the past we only relied on the displayed right and did not check it more closely.<br />
<br />
We have now started a ticket for this with our service provider and are waiting. In summary, we can fortunately say that modular permissions work. <br />
<br />
Many thanks for that.</div></div><hr />
