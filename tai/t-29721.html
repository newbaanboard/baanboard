Hello,<br />
<br />
create this job for :<br />
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday .... with period = 1 week .<br />
So in cronab of your jobuser you will execute :<br />
<br />
00 15 * * 1 EXPORT USER=jobuser;sh $BSE/etc/rc.startjob monday<br />
00 15 * * 2 EXPORT USER=jobuser;sh $BSE/etc/rc.startjob tuesday<br />
00 15 * * 3 EXPORT USER=jobuser;sh $BSE/etc/rc.startjob wednesday<br />
<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
This takes the execution of the jobs to the defined day, no other execution day has to be set in BaaN.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your statement:<br />
<br />
&quot;...the job will never run again unless I manually increase the next execution date.&quot;<br />
<br />
is incorrect<br />
<br />
Drop the use of job daemons completely<br />
In Baan set up job periods to 1 minute for all your jobs<br />
Do all your scheduling in cron<br />
<br />
The only time next execution date and time can mess up your jobs is if they are in the future at the time cron kicks off the job. It will stay in status waiting until the specified next x d&amp;t arrives.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can I do this? Is this a unix process?<br />
<br />
I also read on multiple thread's on this forum that the job should still start when the execution date is passed, but for some reason this isn't the case here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are not aware of job daemons you most likely are not using them.<br />
<br />
Job daemons are Baan processes that run in background and start jobs based on the frequency/calendar defined in baan.<br />
<br />
They are kicked off using $BSE/etc/rc.startjobdm which at the very bottom runs this:<br />
<br />
ba6.1 ttaad5206m000 2&gt;${BSE_TMP}/rc.startjobdmerr &amp;<br />
<br />
Search for that tools session name among your OS processes to see if you have one running:<br />
<br />
ps -fe|grep ttaad5206m000<br />
<br />
I doubt you do.</div></div><hr />

I changed the settings to 1 minute.<br />

<br />
I guess (from the name root100) that you do the same as we do here, that is to start baanjobs via roots crontab. The job has execution permission for user bsp and group bsp, not for root. Have you tried to change the permissions? I just did a test, although I could execute a shell-script with permissions like yours from prompt, it didn't execute from crontab.<br />
What happens when you call the script with &quot;sh PATH/rc.startjob.root&quot; in crontab?<br />
<br />
A job in Baan that has status 'free' should be executed regardless of the entry in field 'next execution date' when started via ttaad5203m000.<br />
<br />
Add something like 'date &gt; /home/bsp/did_i_run_or_not' in your rc.startjob.root script to check whether the script was started at all.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

$BSE/tmp/job<br />
${BSE_TMP}/rc.startjoberr.1<br />
$BSE/log/* (log.ba6.1 and log.bshell might have something)<br />
<br />
Also try to send standard output and standard error to files you can review after the run (or run time) in your cron line. Something like this:<br />
<br />

Even root has no access to your file, i assume it is roots crontab?<br />

Please give r and x rights to others rwx r-x r-x permission and try it.<br />

<br />
ok, so you made sure that the unix script was executed.<br />
So the 'bad guy' definitly has to be Baan :-)<br />
You started this thread with a question about scheduling the job differently. So I assume that the job itself (all sessions started in the job) haven't been modified?<br />
You mentioned that the job will be deleted when you unhook 'periodically' - did this happen to you? If yes I have an idea what may have happened:<br />
When you define a job, besides from all the information defined on the job control basis (session per step, next step if an error occurs) you have to enter the values of the input fields on the forms (stored in ttaad503). <br />
Could it be that the started session simply lacks this information?<br />
Its behaviour would be exactly as viewed now ..... start and terminate as there is nothing to do.<br />
<br />
Or, just another idea - perhaps the session was started with year.f=&quot;2006&quot; and  year.t=&quot;2006&quot; or something like this? <br />
Have a look at ttadv503 to check.<br />
