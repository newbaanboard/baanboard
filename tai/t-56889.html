<br />
If not - Install IAS and then try installing Baan from master CD.<br />
<br />
Then you might get the error message properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have install the IAS and try install Baan from the master cd.<br />
Still having same problem. <br />
The problem is that, it seems cannot connect to master sql database using baan login.<br />
But using window authentication i can login, but with baan manually login it cannot login.<br />
The baan profile i have created and with administrator rights and I install using login with baan but it still not able to authenticate to sql database.<br />
Any idea?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">8th October 2009, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">IAS forwards authentication and accounting messages.<br />
thus helps to get error messages for event viewer. !!<br />
<br />
Is server in Domain .?<br />
If not , temporarily provide net for server so that it could fetch error description .<br />
<br />
hence you could get the proper error in event viewer instead of the following<br />
<br />
&quot;The local computer may not have the necessary registry information or message DLL files to display messages from a remote computer&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">8th October 2009, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">did you install SQL server as the Baan user?  The install guide states the following (as I remember that last time I looked at it!)<br />
<br />
From fresh windows server install...<br />
<br />
1. Setup local admin user 'baan', with password the same<br />
2. Install MSQL server with specified settings for sort order etc<br />
3. Run the connection test to MSQL before trying to install Baan<br />
<br />
... then start the Baan install CD.<br />
<br />
Did you follow this procedure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamort</div><div class="date">9th October 2009, 06:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sushil,<br />
<br />
The server is not in domain. I put it in workgroup.<br />
<br />
May I now what you mean by provide net for server so that it could fetch error description?<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Hi Andy,<br />
<br />
I did follow the procedure to install the sql according to the guide provide in the Baan CD.<br />
I did run connection test using sql authentication and window authentication. All can login.<br />
But I notice a thing when I login using baan username. In the document and settings folder, there located 2 profile folder for Baan, one is with name baan and another is baan.computername. It seems it created a new profile under baan.computername.<br />
Could it be this profile name cause the problem.<br />
I suspect the window authentication for sql could be using baan.computername and this is where installation of baan could not recognize it and prompt error?<br />
Could this be the case.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my Baan server just reload with Windows 2003 64 bit and SQL 2005 as Baan IV still dont support Windows 2008.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">15th October 2009, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I advised the same, don't understand why they want to get it running on 2000.<br />
You can already use SQL-Server 2008, that's supported. Infor expects to be able to support Windows 2008 in Q1 of 2010.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please send the used porting set # and master CD installer ver. <br />
<br />
notes:<br />
- Did you activate the SQL Server Authentication with the NT Authentication &quot;Mixed Mode&quot;??<br />
- Did you upgrade the MSSQL to SP4 ??<br />
- Did you install the vcredist.exe and the .netfx??<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">18th October 2009, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Both profiles exist because you have logged on to the machine at least once as baan member of Workgroup and at least once as baan local user of computer.<br />
<br />
You need to be careful of confusion between baan user (a member of Workgroup) and baan user (on server computer).  Both should exist and both should be member of Administrators group and have rights to Log on Locally and Log On as a Service.  Then it should not matter which of the two users you are logged in as when you try to install Baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamort</div><div class="date">23rd October 2009, 04:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ahmed,<br />

-Yes did activate sql authentication with mixed mode<br />
-Yes upgrade sql to sp4<br />
-I will check on vcredist.exe and .netfx. I do not think I install these 2.<br />

<br />
Note :  Remember Baan is a Client Server Software.</div></div><hr />
