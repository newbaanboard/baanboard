<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">25th February 2002, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We have just upgraded to Baan5c SP6 with latest portingset, latest BWClient/BWPRINT and now have an intermittent printer problem. When printing to continuous stationery about 50% of the time a form feed is sent half way down the 1st page, then throwing out the page alignment for the rest of the report.<br />
<br />
This problem DID NOT exist is 5c SP3 with old portingset and BWclients.<br />
<br />
Due to the intermittent nature of the problem, we can't pin down the problem. It occurs from multiple PCs, with multiple printers and with at least 2 reports that we are aware of (Invoices and Delivery Notes)<br />
<br />
Running Baan5c SP6 on windows NT4 with SQL7 database.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else come accross this problem :confused:  ?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
