<br />
I want to define, for role, an access to a complete package except one session. The only way i found is to give access to all modules except the one that contain the session. And give access to all session in this module except the one i don't want. It is really time consuming and not very easy to maitain.<br />
<br />
We tried to create 2 roles : first one give full access to package (tc for example) and second one forbid access to one session of tc. We have assign these two role to a user and he still can access to the forbidden session.<br />
<br />
Is there any easy way to says : role have access to this package except this session?</div></div><hr />

If you assign roles in parallel then the most open authorisation is applied.<br />
