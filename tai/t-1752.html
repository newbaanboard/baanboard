<br />
1) Do not shutdown the system!! Stay logged on as root!<br />
2) do a backup of the user data (check whether the backup is ok), print out information concerning disk arrays/file systems/db-spaces/printers in case you have to reinstall the OS<br />
3) Ask for someone with a similar system and get a list of the ownerships/permissions to change them back<br />
<br />
Did the &quot;sticky&quot; bits (execution permission &quot;s&quot;) remain? If so, you should be able to reverse the process<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />

<br />
how to check for the sticky bits<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

Remember you can use the binperm6.1 utility to re-correct permissions of the binaries in the $BSE/bin directory if needed.</div></div><hr />

forsms, which operating system are you usig exactly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">19th April 2002, 09:00</div></div><div class="posttext">If all the files owned by root are changed but not the others, that means that the userID 0 was changed to another user?!<br />
<br />
If so, you should be able to correct it by reassigning the userID 0 back to root, but how easy it will be depends on your OS (HP-UX thru sam starts a background process to re-assign the userID).<br />
<br />
If not, (wrong chown command or similar) then it will be much harder to track which files were affected and you need to compare ownerships with a similar system...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">19th April 2002, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi forsms,<br />
<br />
as Gerhard pointed out, we need to know which unix you are working with.<br />
As to your question, the tools have differnt names on different systems<br />
AIX: smit (or was it smitty?)<br />
HP: sam<br />
SINIX: sysadm<br />
<br />
thats about the ones I know<br />
<br />
Disks: /etc/mnttab + <br />
ls -lrtd * &gt;&gt; file for all directories<br />
<br />
DB: onmonitor if it is Informix, enterprise manager for oracle(?)<br />
<br />
But if you changed the ownership by &quot;chown&quot;, you will have to look for someone with a similar system, I really don't believe that there will be a tool - you will have to write a shell script (but this shouldn't be too hard)<br />
<br />
As to the sticky bits:<br />
the forth parameter of the file-permissions (&quot;-rwsr-x---&quot; for example) is set to &quot;s&quot;.<br />
<br />
(On my system, the file &quot;/bin/ct&quot; has the sticky bit set)<br />
This indicates that the user who executes this program, inherits the permissions of the owner of that file. I wonder if these have &quot;survived&quot; the change of ownership.<br />
<br />
Again - good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms</div><div class="date">19th April 2002, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on HPUX11.00.<br />
<br />
Actually, the moment I realized that I have given chown at the wrong place, I press &quot;Ctrl-C&quot; many times, and the command exited in between. So I believe that not much harm is done (percentage-wise). But many files now have changed owner's/groups.<br />
Luckily, i was logged in as root, so, could change the owner for 1/2 files (when i was trying to log-in as root from another simpterm session, I was getting a message that ..not proper permissions for such-and-such file... i am not able to recollect the exact filename!!). so i changed the owner/group and now i am able to log in as root.<br />
<br />
also, &quot;sam&quot; is working fine.<br />
<br />
i am using swverify command as &quot;swverify \*&quot; to get a log of among other things has a log of something like below:<br />
ERROR:   File &quot;/opt/dce/bin/camigrate&quot; should have owner,uid &quot;bin,2&quot;  but the actual owner,uid is &quot;prod,136&quot;.<br />
ERROR:  File &quot;/opt/dce/bin/camigrate&quot; should have group,gid &quot;bin,2&quot;<br />
         but the actual group,gid is &quot;bsp,125&quot;.<br />
...<br />
based on this log, I am changing the owners/groups as per recommended by the log file  &quot;swagentd.log&quot; <br />
These sw command and log file is in /var/adm/sw directory.<br />
<br />
This swverify is really comming handy (although its a pain to go through the entire list!!!)<br />
<br />
Any more suggestions ...<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
