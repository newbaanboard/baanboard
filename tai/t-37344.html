<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">13th June 2007, 00:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Just been to the Baan UK Spring Conference.  I thought you may like to be aware that in the future (FP4 &amp; Tools 8.4) Infor will be integrating the open source Eclipse BIRT (http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/) (Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools) into ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Initially the focus is on pull reporting, i.e. running predefined queries to extract and report/graph data from ERP LN data, then later (FP5ish) the focus will be on formatting the output of push reports, e.g. purchase orders, sales invoices, customer reminders, remittance advices, etc.  <br />
<br />
I don't believe that BIRT is positioned by Infor (or Eclipse) as a splice and dice tools, ETL tools or OLAP tools.  I wonder if it will only work in Webtop since BIRT is java based.<br />
<br />
I've not seen it demoed and it is still in development, but it is nice to see that Infor is finally doing something about improving its reporting capabilities. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcrusche</div><div class="date">29th June 2007, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">What I know is that Infor has developed a plugin in eclipse which will make easier for BIRT to read LN data dictionary...<br />
BIRT will be available on webtop, but you can install it as standalone and use the plugin for LN.<br />
I am now learning how to use BIRT, and I see that it is very &quot;Crystal like&quot;.<br />
very powerful.<br />

are there any newer informations about the BIRT-Integration?<br />
I tried to install it with the newest Tools-Update (8.4), but I didn't found any documentation or ways, how to integrate the reports.<br />
regards Dirk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jeffersyuan</div><div class="date">20th September 2007, 05:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I am also looking for the Integration.<br />
<br />
DFisch, <br />
Where can you download the Tools-Update(8.4)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">20th September 2007, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Dirk,<br />
there are two Infor Documents:<br />
U9269A US: Infor Reporting Studio 8.4 Installation and Configuration Guide.pdf <br />
U9197B US: Installation Guide for Connector for JDBC forInfor ERP LN.pdf<br />
<br />
They are both not very detailed:<br />
You should also use the Docs for WebTop Version 8.4.<br />
<br />
My Information from Support is that the Infor Reporting Studio (the mentioned Eclipse Plugin) should be released in November 2007.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Even web based reporting can help in many cases . <br />
<br />
If  u are interested in secure creation and storage of cubes , oracle's discoverer and SQL analysis services help u. Else pure multi-dimensional drag and drop functionality (ie splicing &amp; dicing)  is available in Excel pivot table too .</div></div><hr />

<br />
we have the same problem. We are now on 8.4 but we don't know how to set up Birt or how to use it.<br />
Another problem is the &quot;Hompages&quot; functionality. We can't upload the &quot;*.har&quot; files to the Weptop. <br />
<br />
If you get more information about this, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Regards <br />

<br />
Is there somebody get the documents?<br />
By Infor365, I cannot find the two documents.<br />

<br />
Hi Jeffers,<br />
you can find the documents on the site. For the first one search for 'U9269A*'.<br />
For the second: There is a new version 'U9197C US'.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

as far as i understand the report-viewer will get their data from the jdbc-driver (provided by the infor integration package).<br />
<br />
Perhaps some of you has tested the jdbc or odbc-driver and can tell me if the mentioned driver(s) translate the table-fields (or domains) into the appropriate translation-fieldname<br />
For example: tcibd001.dsca will become &quot;Item Description&quot;<br />
<br />
Best Regards Bruce</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">25th September 2007, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Bruce,<br />
i haven't tested it so far, still awaiting the Reporting Studio for Eclipse.<br />
But from my point of view it should consider the DD of Baan in the way you mentioned. Otherwise there is no added value in this solution.<br />
You are already able to query the Baan DB with the appropriate JDBC Driver and form a report with the Birt Solution, if you know the right Tables/Fields (No prob for an experienced Baan Dev).<br />
So in my opinion the Baan Solution should give you the extras to simplify the Report Development with Birt.<br />
Indeed i HOPE so!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruce21</div><div class="date">25th September 2007, 08:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
if you perform on the cmd-line  <br />
java com.ssa.jdbc.TestQuery localprocess &quot;select * from tcibd001&quot; (as described in the document &quot;Installation Guide for Connector for JDBC for Infor ERP LN&quot;) do you see the fieldnames or the enum-values (for example tcibd001.kitm) ?<br />
