<br />
I am working with LN FP3.<br />
<br />
I have the following issue:<br />
<br />
I am sending to print a big report on ASCIF device, but the report is slow, very slow, I have done it, I trace the process up in operative system while proccessing report, I have detected the following:<br />
1. The query report takes the half of time than total time report.<br />
2. The other half of time is taken the ttstpsplclose and ttstpconv process.<br />
<br />
My question is, Anybody can tell me if exists one way to best perform  ttstpsplclose and ttstpconv processes(probably modifying device setup), when I have heavy process?.</div></div><hr />

How are you printing the data? brp.* or rprt.* or spool.* functions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for your response.<br />
<br />
I comment you that it is standard report (whina1210m000), and it is using the tccomdll0010(brp.* functions) library to print report.<br />
<br />
I expect for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't help much with the Standard Report. Though, you can check if your $BSE/tmp is not full. There are some recent improvements made for the session due to its poor performance.<br />
<br />
Check following KB's. All related to the session slowness. <br />

That's already solved for a very long time by now, so if in fact you're still on FP3, probably updating tools might help (and porting set and tools, if it doesn't)<br />
