The memory used by the user's registry has not been freed. The registry will be unloaded when it is no longer in use. Â This is often caused by services running as a user account, try configuring the services to run in either the LocalService or NetworkService account.<br />

Has anyone experienced this warning message? if so, do you know information on the cause and remedy. <br />

<br />
this is usually caused when a user connects to server using RDP where his id is greater than 0 then he/her logs off at id 0.<br />

1.Try not to use RDP.<br />
2.if #1 does not fit then connect only as ID 0 then disconnect not log off.<br />
3.Try alternatives for remote control like - VNC , Dameware,PC-DUO.</div></div><hr />
