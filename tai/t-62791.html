<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camilla</div><div class="date">4th September 2012, 00:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello to every one,<br />
could some one tell me the minimum authorization that i have to give to a role for normal user?<br />
I would like to manage authorizations at table field level, so that some fields are not visible for some users or to limit the input orders to some BP.<br />
But, even if i try to create the easier rule to some table, the authorization does not works even if i link the role to the user and i did convert to runtime.<br />
Please help me! Thanks<br />

Talking about minimal permission, required to start Infor LN you can find them in &quot;DEFAULT&quot; role of your Infor installation.<br />
I used to give Delete/insert/modify/read remission for while company in Table authorization by company session (ttams3144m000) for all users. This authorization is given because it is hard to consider all relating tables.<br />
To limit access for known tables, field and data ranges you can enter appropriate data in Table authorization by table (ttams3142m000), Table data authorization (ttams3145m000) and Table Field Authorization sessions (all of this session are accessible through Specific menu in Role data session (ttams2100m000). All setting in mentioned before sessions has higher priority over Table authorization by Company.<br />
To understand what exactly wrong with your role settings I need to see the entire list of setting for this role. You can print them and put into your next post.</div></div><hr />
