<br />
I get the following error when I am starting some of the Baan sessions.<br />
<br />
  1 : process 6 - Error : SQLState QP999: Corrupted data dictionary (error 512) (read.next.records() in object ottstpstandard)<br />
  2 : process 6 - Fatal error : Error 512 (Corrupted data dictionary) on select<br />
  3 : process 6 - Fatal error : Can not continue in tdext8566m000 in DLL: ottstpstandard (read.next.records)[retry.point]<br />
<br />
I did convert runtime DD  and also tried with create RuntimeDD for all the tables... but no use.<br />
<br />
any suggestions to avoid this error?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">29th June 2007, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you select &quot;Reconfigure table&quot; when you created the runtime DD?<br />
 <br />
Did you look in the logs ($BSE/log)? We got this error a lot when upgrading Baan recently and the logs often had more specific messages for this error (log.ba6.1, log.bshell, and the database logs). They might point you to the table that is causing the error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbabu1</div><div class="date">29th June 2007, 21:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yashwant</div><div class="date">30th June 2007, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">check ttadv500-504 tables .delete all the garbages.it will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">1st July 2007, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you identify the corrupted table?<br />
<br />
If you want to know how much time the repair wil need, you can check the baan DD against the table structure in the database. If there is no difference, you only have a problem with references. In this case there will be no reconfigure happen. If yes you can modify the table structure in the database so it is identical to the baan structure -&gt; no reconfigue will happen. Or you don't change it and let baan do the job.<br />
<br />
The next steps to solve such problems are equal in both cases:<br />
<br />
1. first check the tables ttadv500 to ttadv504 in company 000, They should be empty. If not, yo have had some old incorrect reconfigures. You have to clear this first.<br />
<br />
2. set the corrupted table to expired. Press save. Remove the expired. Save again.<br />
<br />
Now you should see your and all referenced tables in ttadv502 (and your table is not expired).<br />
<br />
Convert to runtime all tables/packages/modules incl. reconfigure.<br />
<br />
Log out and log in again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">2nd July 2007, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I have run across this several times in the last 6 months at various customers.  To speed up the Convert to Runtime Process, certain checks have been removed.  If you have not created ALL the tables for you package combination, and a patch gets loaded with table changes, the reconfigure program will try to reconfigure them, and usually will abort because the table does not exist.  An attempt to create the table, will create it with the new table definition, but reconfigure still expects to see the old table.  You need to view the table within the administrative tools to see the physical structure, and then make the datadictionary in Baan match.  If a field has been added, then you can delete the field in the database also.  Which ever is easier. It will be created during reconfigure again.<br />
<br />
This is only one possibility, that started with FP2.  As a rule, I tell my customers to make sure all tables are created even if they are not used, and to run create tables before any Convert to Runtime where you will be reconfiguring tables, or before applying any patches.  None of them have had a problem since.</div></div><hr />
