<br />
I am working in LN 6.1 and I have a big big problem, <br />
<br />
I want to install a standard solution by PMC and I checked if exists any component customized and it shows me one report and this says me that exist one component in one VRC but I looked for in ttadv2500m000 (sessions),  and I saw that isn't. Then I looked for at SO level and there was the component, then I erased this, then another time I checked if exists any component customized and it shows me one report and this, says me that exists one component in one VRC and I still shows me the same result. <br />
<br />
Anybody can tell me in where PMC looks for components customized?</div></div><hr />

The PMC Check To Install report shows the component and the VRC where it found it. If you attach the report to this thread, I can exactly tell you what to do to get rid of that component.</div></div><hr />

Thank you a lot, I know that PMC looking for on DD, but this do not do it in tools components. As far as for example the object programs looking for on ttadv239, then I ask you, in sessions exists any table for this.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
