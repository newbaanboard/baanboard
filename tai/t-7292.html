<br />
Can remember a post in the last couple of months that listed steps to clear for a fresh attempt at convert to r/t d/d but can't find it.  <br />
Have found recent post listing the purpose / content of the ttadv500-504 tables but need to find the 'lock' file that needs to be deleted to allow a fresh attempt. <br />
<br />
Environment  Baan_4c4   AIX 433 Oracle 805<br />

(original problem came about when reconfiguring a table when the rdms not running for an old test company - company now deleted).<br />
<br />
You help will be appreciated<br />

Thanks for the suggestions.  I have been through all of the threads you listed and though the links in them but. These really help me understand what happens but I have still got the problem<br />
<br />
I tried deleting the entry ib ttadv504 that I think caused the problem. I also tried a create rdd.   Also renamed  $BSE/dict/ddMMPROD/dtdxsl/dtdxsl060.new&quot; (which is the failed reconfiguration for the dead company0<br />
<br />
Now have a 2 error messages comming up. <br />
1 &quot;Dumping table definitions/domains not possible for package combination MMPROD&quot;   (the package com I am working on)<br />
2 &quot;Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary [ttadv5215m00] has not finished reconfiguring yet!&quot;<br />
<br />
I am now well and truly stuck.  Can you give me any other leads on how to get out of this mess I've got myself into?   What is telling it to do carry on with reconfiguration?  -- We can live without this reconfig if it is possible to work around it.<br />
<br />
As it stands we can't do any dd work<br />

It should ask you if you want to continue, just confirm... then you can run your create</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ran wide open then the next time came up with the message to continue reconfig.  Then found another db instance had oracle connection problem which I fixed and I was then able to continue reconfiguration<br />
<br />
Thank you (and NPRoa for an earlier suggestion)<br />
<br />
This board is invaluable (-- thanks to the webmaster and sponsors also)<br />
