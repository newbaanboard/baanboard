<br />
If you install the WebTop interface you should be able to do it within an Internet Browser...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">25th June 2002, 10:17</div></div><div class="posttext">No, there is no Mac client, Mac's are not usually associated at all with entreprise environments, more like designer environments (where they really excell).<br />
<br />
But if you're on MacOS X or have a telnet program on prior versions, and you're using BaanIV, you can always use the ba6.1, or, as mentioned, start a bx6.1 on the server with export of display to MacOS X (with X server).<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you are out of luck...</div></div><hr />

So using Webtop on a Mac client is not an option :( <br />

If yes then it should work with software like Ericom Interconnect:<br />

Certainly we used Mac for both network and dialup access on a Triton 3.1 system.<br />
<br />
For GUI, the answer has been &quot;no&quot;. That is, there is no Baan client for Mac-OS. In theory, you should be able to install the windows client on a Mac running Virtual PC, but I haven't heard of anyone who has tried it.<br />
