<br />
I installed SSA ERP LN 6.1 Fp2 with MS SQL Server 2000 on a server where I already had Open World installed and licensed. My license client detected the new products as &quot;unassigned products&quot;, then I added them to the Server Licenses.<br />
<br />
In other server I had and installation of LN already running and licensed. What I want is to use this license with my new instalation.<br />
<br />
I changed on the license server the name of the Servers (with the new one), but I don´t know how to handle the lic. client. <br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

for more information. There is also a SLM-Windows Help file -<br />
<br />
Client Configuration<br />
Configure to which SLM Server you want to connect.<br />
SLM Client uses the servers.xml file to connect to a SLM Server. This dialog box helps you to edit the servers.xml file. The servers that are in the SLM Servers to be used list are written to the servers.xml file. You can add servers to that list by adding them from the SLM Servers available list, or you can add servers manually.<br />
SLM Servers available: The installation wizard did a broadcast to find out which SLM Servers are running. The results are displayed in this list. When a SLM Server is running in Slave mode, also the Master server is displayed. To add a server to the SLM Servers to be used list, select it, and click Add. <br />
SLM Server: You can add a SLM Server manually. Enter the name of the SLM Server. <br />
Port: Enter the port number of the SLM Server. To add the server to the SLM Servers to be used list, click Add. <br />
SLM Servers to be used: The SLM Servers in this list will be written to the servers.xml file when you click Next. You can add a maximum of 4 SLM Servers. To remove a server from this list, select it and click Remove.</div></div><hr />
