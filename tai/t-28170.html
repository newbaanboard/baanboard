<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chadwickh</div><div class="date">14th September 2006, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Having problems with Baan calculating the next execution date and time for jobs executed close to the Fall and Spring time change. I installed the latest solution 205563 (for this particular problem) and it's dependent solutions and the problem isn't as bad as it was but is still a problem. I have a test server with the date changed to April 1, 2006 at 18:32 EST. When I have a job with an 8 hour period and execute the job, it sets the next execution date and time only 7 hours ahead, not 8. If I run the job at 20:49, the job does move the next execution time 8 hours ahead. <br />
<br />
I have other test jobs that are doing similar behavior. If I log into the MET time zone (middle european, 6 hours ahead of EST), this is what happens:<br />
<br />
job       period  system execution   next system     issue<br />
                             date time        date time<br />
<br />
T97012 1 hour    4/1/2006 20:07 4/1/2006 20:07   Didn't add the hour<br />
T97013 1 day     4/1/2006 20:16 4/2/2006 21:15   Added an extra hour<br />
T97014 1 week   4/1/2006 20:16 4/8/2006 21:15   Added an extra hour<br />
T97015 1 month  4/1/2006 20:17 5/1/2006 21:15   Added an extra hour<br />
T97082 8 hours   4/1/2006 20:17 4/2/2006 5:15     Added an extra hour<br />
T97091 9 hours   4/1/2006 20:18 4/1/2006 20:45    only added 30 minutes<br />
<br />
Anybody else have similar problems with this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually I am surprised. I thought Baan changed the whole job mechanism to use Universal Time Coding and then the problem should not occur to start with.<br />
<br />
I have not thoiught the whole thing through in detail, but maybe you can consider one of the following:<br />
<br />
a) You could run the jobdaemon  in a Timezone without springtime etc.<br />
<br />
b) You could set the job duration to 1 min. and then schedule the job in the unix crontab instead of the jobdaemon. <br />
<br />
