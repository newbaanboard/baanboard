  One of our developers has discovered that none of our customized forms are available in our development vrc structure.  I did a quick check to be sure all of our custom sessions, scripts, and reports were not affected.  They are fine and reside in the vrc that I expect.  What would cause Forms to suddenly 'disappear' from a vrc?  <br />
How would I go about restoring them?<br />
Thanks,<br />

No, I think the ttadv300 table is corrupt.  The form objects are still present on UNIX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">16th June 2005, 01:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you ever happen to load ttadv300 via a delimited bdbpre and bdbpost?  I have found issues in some versions of Baan with this out of company 000 for forms and had to use the bdbpre non-delimited version where it stores the dictionary type of info along with the data in the data dump file.  Basically the issue was with the form layout data in company 000 having embedded characters that bdbpre/post got confused with the delimiter so things got corrupted.   Try accessing the table from Oracle sqlplus and see if it &quot;looks&quot; right.  Not sure what else to try.  Maybe re-create/check the indexes to the table?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it that you were trying the sequential dump for ttadv300 and after that the Forms have dissappeared.<br />
<br />
If this is the case you may have ticked &quot;Delete the existing table / drop the table&quot;<br />
<br />
In case you have a back up of your forms you may have to reload them.</div></div><hr />

I did use a sequential dump file format to refresh our dev data with what was on production. I don't think it is delimited. <br />
I am not sure about your version but it seems similar to this issue I encountered last year and the fix was available in the Porting Set 7.3a02.<br />
More info from my case -<br />
<br />
I exported Baan table data from company 410 in development using session ttaad4226m000  Create Sequential Dump of Table. Then I tried to import 410 tables into company-135<br />
Using session ttaad4227m000  Create Table from Sequential Dump. I get the following error-<br />

<br />
The table tttxt010 in company 410 has 13511 rows and tttxt010 in company-135 has 74075 rows.<br />
<br />
Can you please clarify us on how to fix this error? Is there a problem in the export/import process ?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
