<br />
Appreciate if somebody could help me with this problem.<br />
<br />
My company have decided to use the 'PaperClip' to put attachments on the Items-General.<br />
<br />
But of course before we can use this function, we need to install ODM Vault Server.<br />
<br />
We already installed the ODM VS but unfortunately the Service cannot be STARTED. We have already faced this problem for a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know/experienced this before? I really hope that you can help me with this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandeep Basu</div><div class="date">12th January 2009, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">yups, it is no longer supported though  and  from all the documents that I have seen , it shopuld not be required but the ODM install guide does have this sentence check this link or google for it.<br />

THe LN FP5 guide has this line  below so Iguess they are stil referring to it, but I couldn't get it to work without installing MSJVM. I have since been running it along with 1.6 JRE for webtop without a problem so you could give it a shot<br />
Because the Vault Server (VS) is Pure Java compliant, you can install the VS on any operating system. The only requirement is that you must have the Microsoft Virtual Machine installed and configured correctly.</div></div><hr />

MSVM is no more required to work with ODM.<br />
