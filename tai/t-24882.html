<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsaenz</div><div class="date">22nd August 2005, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We just upgraded from standard Baan 4c4 to BaaN 4c4 AGS0 up to Service Pack 12.  When we try to bring in a patch we get a fairly large list of objects that are installed and are available to install.  The problem is that some of these objects have nothing to do with the solution and are based on standard VRC setup.  Is there a way to check the proper setup of the PMC tool to make sure we got it right and we are not spinning our wheels?</div></div><hr />

I can only assume that the AGS0 layer (+update) were created propely and was patched to the same level as the other PMC layers (so, all in SP12).<br />
<br />
To get a good understanding of the patch layers, you should draw first your VRC derivation tree (use tf module for example) and then draw also the PMC VRC structure and cross-check them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">26th August 2005, 12:28</div></div><div class="posttext">You still need to import the standard versions for example we have sch1 ext but some parts of baan don't have any mods for sch1 so those sessions are still the standard sessions in 4c4. Other sessions are actually using the sch0 ext. so when I am patching I need to load patches for standard, sch0 and sch1.</div></div><hr />
