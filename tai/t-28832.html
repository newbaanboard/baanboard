<br />
Planning the setup of the servers, I hope you can help by answering some of my questions.<br />
<br />
1) What is the difference between clustering and failover? Does it mean the same thing?<br />
<br />
2) The direction we are going is to set up a Failover server that can take over from the Prod. server when it is down. Can the failover server and Production server be located in different locations? Eg. Production server is in our outsourced facility while Failover is in our office. Connection is by a leased line. We want to do this so that it meets the DR requirement, in case disaster hits one of the locations.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Yes...both are for high-availability.<br />
<br />
2. It is advisible to keep fail-over server at geographically distributed area, because of theft/fire/earth-quake/9-11 etc.<br />
<br />
Please check leased-line SLA that can provide 99.99% up-time.<br />
<br />
