<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">7th June 2013, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">The Infor ERP MSQL Level 2 database driver has three resource variables<br />
that influence the cursor handling: msql_cursor_type,<br />
msql_max_free_cursors and msql_retained_cursors. Each of these<br />
resource variables is described in the following section.<br />
<br />
msql_cursor_type<br />
The resource msql_cursor_type configures the driver to use one of the two<br />
SQL Server cursor types: 1 (Keyset-driven with autofetch enabled) by default<br />
or 2 (Fast forward-only with autofetch enabled). Changing this value can<br />
result in a difference in performance slightly. Which type performs better<br />
depends on the particular scenario. In a 3-tier scenario (where the client,<br />
application server and the RDBMS physically exist on 3 different machines)<br />
msql_cursor_type:1 may give better performance.<br />
msql_max_free_cursors<br />
The resource msql_max_free_cursors influences the number of statement<br />
handles (SQL Server cursors) that are kept for reuse by the driver. The<br />
default value is 32. Whenever the application closes a query, most resources<br />
in the driver are freed. However, if the MSQL cursor being allocated will soon<br />
Database driver configuration and tuning | 6-3<br />
be re-used, closing and opening of the cursor can be avoided. To avoid<br />
closing and re-opening cursors, the cursor is put in a free list containing all<br />
cursors, which are disassociated from a query. When a request for a new<br />
cursor comes, first a free cursor is taken from the free list. If no free cursors<br />
are available, a new cursor is opened. In this way the number of times a<br />
cursor is closed and opened is reduced. When the number of free cursors<br />
exceeds the value of msql_max_free_cursors, the MSQL cursor will be<br />
closed. Increasing the value of msql_max_free_cursors will result in more<br />
concurrent cursors open (thus more memory), but in fewer cursors being<br />
opened and closed.<br />
Note: When array fetch interface is enabled, free cursor list is not<br />
maintained. The driver internally resets the msql_max_free_cursors to 0.<br />
msql_retained_cursors<br />
With this resource the number of inactive cursors and thus the number of<br />
open cursors can be reduced.<br />
When a query has fetched all rows, a close is issued on the corresponding<br />
cursor, which means that SQL Server is notified that no additional fetches will<br />
be done. This gives SQL Server the chance to free certain query resources.<br />
After the cancel, the query can be re-executed without re-opening (parsing,<br />
binding) the cursor. The driver does not know if a cursor in cancel state will<br />
be re-used later. In the worst case it is not re-used, and the cursor will<br />
continue to be reserved for the query. After all rows have been fetched, the<br />
driver has a facility to put inactive cursors (in cancel state) in a cancel list, so<br />
that they become candidates for being assigned to a different query.<br />
However, a number of inactive cursors in this list that is not available for this<br />
purpose are defined by the resource msql_retained_cursors, which defaults<br />
to 20.<br />
If the number of cursors in the cancel list is less than 20, a cursor from the<br />
cancel list cannot be assigned to a different query.<br />
If more than 20 cursors are in the cancel list, and a request for a new cursor<br />
is issued, the least recently inactivated cursor is used for this new cursor.<br />
This cursor is disassociated from the original query and assigned to a new<br />
query, which does parsing and binding on this cursor.<br />
When the original query is doing a re-execute, the driver detects that the<br />
cursor has been associated with another query and will get a new cursor and<br />
re-parse and bind the query again. Increasing the value of<br />
msql_retained_cursors leads to less re-parsing and re-binding of queries,<br />
which reduces CPU resources. The number of open cursors however (and<br />
thus memory) is increased.</div></div><hr />
