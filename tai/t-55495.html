<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">28th March 2009, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I have installed 2 environments of webtop 8.5, 1 through the automated process, 1 through the manual in order to add it to an existing tomcat server.<br />
<br />
Session field help seems to work.<br />
<br />
Server 1<br />
tomcat 5.5.23<br />
automated process<br />
<br />
Server2<br />
tomcat 5.5.27<br />
manual process<br />
<br />
On the client I was running Vista and Java 1.6.  When I log into server 2servers administration page, I only see Webtop 8.5 in the help tree.  If I do a ctrl refresh, and login again I see a complete help tree with all the extra components loaded.  Server 1 I only see webtop 8.5 in the help tree.<br />
<br />
On client 2, running XP and version 1.5 and 1.6 of java, I log into either server and see the standard help tree of Webtop 8.5, Enterprise Server, and FP5.  I don't see the extra help, even when doing a ctrl refresh.<br />
<br />
On client 3, runnin XP and version 1.5 of java, the Help tree works perfectly with the complete help tree.  This was a old system that has not been updated since Jan 2008.<br />
<br />
On client 4, running Ubuntu 8.4 and Firefox, Java 1.6, I only get the Webtop 8.5 help.  I am going to try an earlier verson of Java.<br />
<br />
I have removed all versions of Java from client 1 and replaced it with a Java 1.5 environment, no change.  Server 1 has only webtop 8.5 and server 2 with a ctrl refresh shows the full help tree. <br />
<br />
Since I do have a client that shows the whole help tree correctly, I suspect this is a client issue.<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced anything similar?  Suggestions welcome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">30th March 2009, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I came to realize that the Help Menu Tree shown reflected the first time I connected to Webtop from the client on each of the machines.  Although I would have thought that the Webtop Cache would have refreshed, it never has.<br />
<br />
I physically went into the users home directory on the client and deleted the Webtop Cache.  The next time I reconnected, the help tree had all branches that I had installed and is now working.<br />
<br />
I would appear that if you were to upload new help files that this might be a necessary step.  I found nothing in the knowlege base that reported the problem.</div></div><hr />

I reported that bug and they fixed it in the latest Webtop release:<br />
<br />
INCIDENT DETAILS<br />
Details: 	We noticed that, in worktop you change the startup company and menu it changes immediately when you log in again. But when you sign into webtop, we can see the new startup company but the menu did not seem to have changed.<br />
<br />
We cleared the cookies and objects/cache in the IE and yet the same old menu appears. We tried to create a new profile too and that didnt fix it.<br />
<br />
Please clarify.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Attachments: <br />
<br />
When a webtop user logs off, menu info is saved under C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;USER Name&gt;\WebtopMenuCache directory. Please remove those files if a webtop user does not want to keep the last menu tree when the users logged out previoulsy.<br />
