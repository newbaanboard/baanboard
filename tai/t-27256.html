We have Baan IVc4 (SP6) as our current LIVE system running NT &amp; SQL 7.<br />
My task is to migrate this across to a new WIN 2003 / SQL 2000 server.<br />
<br />
I am being advised to proceed as follows but would appreciate a second opinion :-<br />
1. Install dumps from SP1 - SP18 batch installer<br />
2. Import records into PMC tables from SP18.<br />
3. Export live company tables from live environment.<br />
4. Copy $BSE/dict/ddOPER001 from live company to test environment.<br />
5. Import tables into test environment.<br />
6. Run &quot;Create DD runtime ttadv5210m000&quot; for OPER001 package combination. This process will rebuild all data definitions and all changes from SP6 to SP18 will be applied into company imported.<br />
<br />
Will this work ?<br />
<br />
Also, what's the best way of getting the data across to the new system when I have calculated that doing a sequential dump will probably take 3-4 days &amp; we do not have enough local disk space to do a disk backup of the 70Gb database.<br />
<br />
Also, if the above process will work, at what stage &amp; how would I get the customisations (not too many) across from our Live environment (LIV1 VRC) ?  <br />
<br />
Big ASK ??? Any help would be gratefully received.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use w2k/w2003 with Oracle and I have to install baan regurarly on new/other servers (I have to manage about 15 environments).<br />
<br />
First to do is just  to copy the whole f:/baan folder or what ever place you installed it in. <br />
The database is another issue since you want to migrate it. I am not familiar with SQL server so I can not advice you with sql server tools. However you can export all tables as well with bdbpre and import them in the new database with bdbpost. For this the user baandb? (this is in oracle) should exists with the correct roles. Have a look how this is defined in your current installation. <br />
(bdbpost/bdbpre only work on console in windows, in windows2003 you can use a special switch in terminal server client in order to use the console)<br />
<br />
Now you need to install the portingset on the new server in order to update the registry. Check afterwards especially if BSE_REM is set, we need to remove it normally.<br />
<br />
If you use unique database accounts for you users you need to create them again after you have your environment working again.<br />
<br />
Now you need to validate your new server.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think I may have gone too far already to use your method.<br />
<br />
I have already installed SQL server 2000 followed by Baan IVc4 from the latest media from Baan.  I have then installed the latest portingset (61c 07 10) &amp; BW followed by setting up the PMC.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ??</div></div><hr />

You can use commandline switches to pass a file which contains table names so you can run them in parellel. The import can be done as well with multiple processes.<br />
Please have a look in the manual, setting RDS_FULL etc. can probably help to speed things up.<br />
You can try to use the switch for creating indexes afterwards as well, that normally helps as well. However I have bad experiences with it, I sometimes end up with duplicate keys.<br />
<br />
Transferring your customizations can be done with ttiex1280m000 and ttiex1285m000.<br />
