<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theresa</div><div class="date">19th September 2001, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">After all the trouble I went through getting bdbreconfig6.1 to work on my test server, I then forgot to sent my logical logs to /dev/null before I attempted the reorg - and thus screwed myself.  <br />
<br />
The rebuild died, I copied the R file and attempted the rebuild again (after disabling logs/recycling informix) using the following command:<br />
<br />
bdbreconfig6.1 -Ntdsls051100+ 2&gt;sls051.log<br />
<br />
But I still got the following Informix error:<br />
<br />
Drop Original Table error 1134<br />
Can't create original table (error 506).  <br />
<br />
So now I am getting ready to go through an Informix restore (on the test server -- thank God),  and I just want to make sure that there's not anything &quot;Baan related&quot; that I have to do?  <br />
<br />
I'll just put in my Informix L-0 backup tape and type in:  ontape -r ??  -- And Baan will be happy when that completes?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any/all assistance;<br />

I don't see why the rebuild does not work. The R. file is a valid backup of that table and you should be able to re-create the table with it. I would check first what the error 1134 means, I am assuming this is an Informix error. Possibly the problem can be fixed and you could avoid having to do a restore.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the insight into the situation...after looking over some of the switches available to bdbreconfig6.1, I noticed '-m -n' to ignore ref. integrity and domain constraints.  As I didn't have anything to lose, I attempted the reorg again adding those 2 switches, and it worked! -- I got the data back in.  <br />
<br />
I need to run the reorg again, but I'm trying to figure out if the bdbreconfig6.1 command checks &amp; correct the data/indicies, ref integrity, and validity of references by default.<br />
<br />
Also, the extents on this table did calculate in KB.  :)<br />
<br />
Here's the command I used to get tdsls051 back into Baan:<br />
<br />
bdbreconfig6.1 -m -n -Ntdsls051100+ 2&gt;sls051.log<br />
<br />
Thanks (yet) again for helping me out...</div></div><hr />
