<br />
we have a problem of distributing licenses per company in baan server.<br />
<br />
In one server (baan logic, baan license, db), and it is licensed for 30 users . we have three LIVE companies C01, C02, C03<br />
(C01 : 10 users; C02 : 15 users; C03 : 5 users and so are the licences they use and pay for)<br />
<br />
Now how to make sure C01 uses only 10 licenses and C03 uses only 5 licenses...<br />
<br />
any ideas friends..<br />

<br />
can you give some more details on your points on this ipc_info or scripting the logic.<br />
<br />
1) you said to edit ipc_info file:<br />
I found the ipc_info(in the server $BSE\lib) file has something like the following:<br />
<br />
bshell	s	0	0	s	${BSE}\bin\ntbshell.exe<br />
<br />
msql7		s	0	0	p	${BSE}\bin\msql7_srv.exe<br />
<br />
what should I edit on the ipc_info file which apeears as bove, can you give some details.<br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
2) to script the  logic to determine C03 only 5 users can login or C01 coy only 10 users can login. How to do this, can you give some sample scripts pls.<br />
<br />
Thanks and best regards<br />

<br />
you can see the thread above that you cannot run a  batch file from ipc_info under windows I should have remembered that. You need to write a small vb app to do the job (this is a lot easier under UNIX as you can call a shell script)<br />
<br />
Q2<br />
if you create three security groups in windows e.g c01 c02 c03 and place the users in their groups you can identify group membership. you can call licom -w to tell you who is logged. use vb code to query sams database if NT or active directory as to the group membership of the currently logged on users the results from this tell you if the group has reached it's limit if not you launch the ntbshell.exe<br />
<br />
<br />
I realise this is very high level I don't have any sample code as I have never needed this <br />
<br />
this link gives examples on using adsi to check group membership<br />

tks for your good efforts.<br />
<br />
I think the solution is complex in NT. I liked to address it from within Baan or atleast at a batch file level.<br />
<br />
Anyway let us wait if something more can come up on this<br />

just give it a life back.<br />
<br />
we have users assigned companywise; we have licences per company; common baan server.<br />
<br />
we want to control the no. of log-ins per company.<br />
<br />
is there a way to know from baan tools tables or files the current users logged-in so that we can run a script to see users linked to a company and restrict the log-in as a start-up session.<br />
<br />
thanks for ur help<br />

If the company numbers are set at BWC  level, u can check the variable BSE_COMPNR . <br />

Alternatively u can check the variable $LOGNAME &amp; $USER and the files $BSE/lib/user/u$USER to get company number and then have your script algo for determining the licence allocation.</div></div><hr />

say, I have the users by Coy; I have a custom table where-in I have no. of license per coy.<br />

200         3<br />
<br />
now a start-up session to see a list of users already logged-in (I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO THIS; would u throw some light on this pls)<br />
is there a command or area from which I can know the list of users. I will check if the log-in is permitted if not I will log the user off (THIS ALSO HOW TO DO...?)<br />

<br />
U need to adopt an approach whereby you determine whether login is allowed to user or not  before user gets into baan. In the approach u listed, user first gets into baan and then the startup program determines about loging status. However I dont know how to  kill the bshell (bshcmd.exe -k bshell.pid() ??) .<br />
<br />
The preferred approach as others pointed out and even I recommend is to adopt ipc_info route wherein you run an exe or batch file with winscripts and determine the login status and execute the bshell.exe if the login is valid in that script itself.<br />
<br />
We have unix and korn shell script which wont' be of any help on Windows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have also have the similar problem, we are working on Sun Solaries, DB is Oracle, BaaN 4c4. We have created a shell script which checks &amp; allow user to logged in as per max. login allowable but when we add this shell script in ipc_info, it is not executed.<br />
<br />
Can you please paste your script.<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">21st September 2004, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">U have to add first line  as indicator of the shell to use like <br />

#!/bin/ksh (for korn shell).<br />

You can have the startup program in BMS mask data - ttadv4188m000, do your checks and then use the BaaN functions - pstat() and kill() and kill all the processes belonging to a user to disconnect him.<br />

<br />
Does ur  users have only only 8  characters. U can also try the $LOGNAME variable for user name . Also start the bshell6.1 with argument $* instead of login params. Further u don't get the messages in BW windows when programmed through shell script . Further u have not set the $BSE &amp; $PATH. Possible that licmon6.1 -w does not run successfully.<br />
<br />
Did u run the file manually.Is it giving proper echo on the screen.<br />
<br />
I have some problem here attaching the script (probably due to our firewall setup), I'll upload the script once i check with firewall vendor.<br />

Hi NP,<br />
<br />
Is there any sequence one should follow killing processes . For example if process init or ottstpstdlib gets killed before other processes. Definitely pid must be the last to be killed .</div></div><hr />

Hitesh,<br />
<br />
I did the top to down killing [process ids in ascending order, process id tree generated from the pstat() ] and killed the current process last. It works fine for me.</div></div><hr />

If LOGNAME does not work try to use the $USER variable to get the user login.<br />
variable initialisation not required in .profile in case of BW but yes when user take baan ascii login then in .profile BSE BSE_TMP etc variable should be properly initialise.<br />
I think the .profile is not executed when you are logging in from the GUI. If you are inside the BW/Worktop and you like to get the path/settings etc from your .profile you need to explicity execute the .profile.<br />
<br />
Based on your posting -<br />
In one server (baan logic, baan license, db), and it is licensed for 30 users . we have three LIVE companies C01, C02, C03<br />
(C01 : 10 users; C02 : 15 users; C03 : 5 users and so are the licences they use and pay for)<br />
This solution is not fool proof if a user has all company access authorization. If the users are always tied up to a single company and not allowed to change company then you can always use the BMS mask program to call a shell script to check which users are logged into the system then check them against Tools User Data and then check your custom table for the number of allowed licenses per company, to be connected or disconnected.<br />
This will avoid complexity and also works in both the cases of ASCII or BW/GUI interface.</div></div><hr />
