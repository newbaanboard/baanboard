<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">20th August 2001, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been looking at the bug-fixes/changes in the bdbpre and bdbpost of the 6.1c.06.0x portingsets and I think the following is usefull to understand the new [good] functionality Baan has implemented in:<br />
 <br />
The new dump format can be recognized by looking at the first two lines of the dump file:<br />
 <br />
 2000-11-09 09:27:13.368<br />
 #$!pre-dump!$#000100v<br />
 <br />
The first line is a timestamp and should comply to the format<br />
&quot;0000-00-00 00:00:00.000&quot; (the character '0' stands for a digit).<br />
<br />
The second line is a &quot;magic&quot; (&quot;#$!pre-dump!$#&quot;) followed by the version number of the dump followed by the options that describe the dump.<br />
<br />
- The version number is encoded as a 4 digit decimal number (&quot;0001&quot;).<br />
<br />
- The separator is encoded as a 2 digit hexadecimal number (&quot;00&quot;).<br />
<br />
- The last character 'v' stands for 'variable format', as opposed to 'f' which stands for 'fixed format' (-x option).<br />
<br />
<br />
Example: Problems importing dumps<br />
<br />
From the headers of some files I saw that we have 0001fff, meaning ff as the code for the separator code and last f as fixed format export.<br />
A check showed that they were using a different separator on the import from the one used in the export? (a hex ff = decimal 255 = character &quot;|&quot; for iso-8859-1).<br />
As aditional note, notice that Baan always suggests to use the NULL character (&quot;\0&quot;) as the separator to avoid problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTES: Baan has fixed problems with compatibility with previous dumps in 6.1c.06.02!</div></div><hr />
