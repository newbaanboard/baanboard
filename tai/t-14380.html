<br />
Have a peculiar problem.User A is unable to login from her terminal.<br />
It prompts an error as stated in attached file.<br />
Have tried removing and reinstalling the client BUT still the same.<br />
Able to 'ping' our Baan server also.<br />
What is the problem, pls advice.<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
Yours in service<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">t.leijdens</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you checked the bw configuration. Could be that the BShell Environment is not set correctly.<br />
<br />
It should be something like:<br />
<br />
BSE: d:\baan (Windows style) or /baan/bin (unix style)<br />
Bshell: bshell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">This message means that the password is incorrect.<br />
<br />
If the bshell is named faulty in the BW configuration, the error msg would read something like &quot;...can't get server info...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Francesco, I doubt if it is bad username or password, because in that case usually there are 3 bw-messages:<br />
<br />
1: Logon user: error1326 (Logon failure: unknown username or bad password)<br />
and then the other two that are printed above as nr. 2 and 3...<br />
<br />
I do however agree that it doesn't look like wrong environment either...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don't know what it could be...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right, the first line would show either &quot;login incorrect&quot; or &quot;password incorrect&quot; respectively.<br />
<br />
I did some messing around and I am unable to reproduce this error.<br />
<br />
One would think that it has to be something in the client though. <br />
<br />
Dhnish, two questions:<br />
- Is the user able to log on from another machine?<br />
- are other people able to log on from this user's machine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">you get that message when the BSE in the Bshell environment is not set to the correct path.<br />
(Also, you get the same message when you try to login when the Baan server is not available. since you are able to ping the server, that situation is ruled out)<br />
<br />
If the Bshell name is incorrect you get the &quot;ipc_boot.. cant get server info&quot; message.<br />
<br />
you might want to check up the BSE path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">If I change my BSE (either in BW or in the Unix environment), I get a &quot;boot failed of user ....&quot; error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">i just changed the &quot;d:\baan&quot; path in the BSE path to &quot;d:\baan432&quot;  (BW) <br />
(pls check the attachment).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you guys,problem is solved<br />
Its something to do with the WIN registry.<br />
I removed all keys related to Baan and reinstalled the client.<br />
It works now<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
