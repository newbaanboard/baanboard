    We have a problem in providing different data format for our european users without creating/linking new language.  There was one possibility to avoid creating new language(in unix), but that one is not useful for us as we are on Windows Server.  Therefore we have decided to take the pain of creating/maintaining a new language and copy all existing components to new language.  <br />
<br />
     Before I proceed for that I thought I could get help from baan support to do that.  But when I contacted baan, interesting response I got from them is they never created new language and they dont know the steps for creating new language!<br />
<br />
    Now I am really confused and I am looking for help if anyone has ever done this kind of process of creating a new language and copying components to new language. All this pain is just to provide different data format, and if you have any other alternate solution I appreciate it most!<br />
<br />
thanks &amp; regards</div></div><hr />
