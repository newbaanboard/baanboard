<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">7th June 2005, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is one possibility (for BAAN IV, at least):<br />
<br />
Assume that you are interested in knowing when that particular user started that (or any) session. Then for that user, in Maintain User Data (Form 3) you can check the History field and convert to runtime. This will cause BAAN to log each time the user starts and stops the session. This information can be seen using Display User History or Print User History.<br />
<br />
The down side of this is:<br />
- Each and every session that the user starts will be logged.<br />
- It is not possible to know who else used the session unless all such users are flagged with the History field.<br />
- We do not use this, so I do not know what administrative effort is required to keep the $BSE/lib/TIME.HIS file in control - it never truncates, it is the BAAN Admin duty to keep its size to suitable limits.<br />
<br />
The other possibility (if you have source code) is to customize the session to log who used it. This has the advantage that only that session's usage is logged. However, anybody who uses it will be logged (which may not be a bad thing in itself).</div></div><hr />

If its a custom session you can add code to your script -<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
import(&quot;prog.name$&quot;, calling.session)<br />
calling.session = strip$(calling.session)<br />
<br />
Then you can check the calling session value if it has the menu browser code or any other session code.</div></div><hr />
