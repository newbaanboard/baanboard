In the near future we will have two time zones in one company. This fact will grow up some problems.<br />
There will be troubles if users with two different time zones make transactions. If these transactions stores dates and times in sort keys then the order of the datas are not correct.<br />
Maybe someone of you had already solved such a problem.<br />
Please help us in this case!<br />
Thanx.<br />

Even though we have 3 sites in two times zones all of our servers reside just in one time zone.  So no problems with date and time stamps.  <br />

Unfortunately we only have one server in europe for all companies.<br />
Mybe there is any ohter solution.<br />
Thanx for replying.</div></div><hr />

The transaction date and time are based off that server.  Your users will just have to understand that when looking at transactions to add or subtract the time difference between the server and the company site.  But the transactions should go into the system in a consistant manor - keeping transactions in the correct order.    <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">22nd May 2004, 00:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you are using Unix you can set the TZ environment variable for each user depending on what time zone they are in.  Dates and times will be displayed correctly for each user.  The date and time are stored in the baan tables in GMT (Grenich mean time) and displayed (or entered) with the user's TZ in question.  In BaanERP5c it is stored in UCT.<br />
<br />
Set the user's TZ in their profile, or you can get fancy and have scripts depending on their bshell names or something.<br />
<br />
TZ examples:<br />
<br />
EST5EDT   - eastern time<br />
PST8PDT   - pacific time ... (get the idea?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We do it so as you described. So we set time zone variables under Unix. And so we get the problems, because we have two different time zones in one company. Some users have the time zone form Califonia and some have the time zone from Micigan. Thats the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanx!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">24th May 2004, 23:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We have the exact same scenario. we are single logistic company offices in different time zones. (EST &amp; CST)<br />
What we did was.we created 2 separate User Data templates for both EST and CST Users. (ttams1110m000)<br />
The difference between EST &amp; CST template is time Zone value in form 2. <br />
We enclosed EST Template to all Eastern Time users and CST template to all CST Users.Now all transactions are coming into to our database as per local times.<br />
I hope that is clear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">25th May 2004, 07:54</div></div><div class="posttext">mraguthu, your suggestion will work, but that is BaanVc functionality.  There are no time zone templates in BaanIVc4.<br />
<br />
Roland, I am not sure I am following you.  Depending on the TZ you are in, it should not matter.  The data is stored in GMT, and displayed as the TZ of the user that is either reporting, displaying or entering.<br />
<br />
e.g. user A in EST, user B in PST (3 hours early).<br />
<br />
A enters transaction 1 at 11:00 AM EST<br />
B enters transaction 2 at 11:00 AM PDT.<br />
<br />
If user A looks at the data he will see the first transaction at 11:00 AM and the second one at 2:00 PM.<br />
<br />
If user B looks at the data he will see the first transaction as 8:00 AM and the second as 11:00 AM.<br />
<br />
Is this not what you are seeing?<br />
<br />
Eric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vichtl</div><div class="date">25th May 2004, 09:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx mraguthu but estotz is wright. Regrettably.<br />
Estotz you got the problem. Exactly as you described is our situaton. I will give you an example where we can get troubles wiht user A and user B in two different time zones.<br />
Table tdinv700:<br />
After every accounting transaction at this table one new entry will be created in this table. The primary index is the following.<br />
Article, stock, transaction date, transaction time.<br />
If two users in different time zones now make an accounting transaction on the same article and the same stock then the following situation can happen.<br />
Local time User1: 08:00<br />
Local time User2: 13:00<br />
User	time 	Quantity	inventory after transaction<br />
User1	08:00	1	1<br />
User2	13:00	3	4<br />
User1	08:01	2	6<br />
<br />
If you now select this datas you get the following output<br />
User	time	Quanity	inventory after transaction<br />
User1	08:00	1	1<br />
User1	08:01	2	6<br />
User2	13:00	3	4<br />
<br />
This is the main problem.<br />
<br />
