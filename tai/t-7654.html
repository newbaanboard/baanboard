Error 2017 mean 'permission denied' which would match the statement that you made regarding the unability to  create the users in Oracle. Why could you not add these during the installation? Did you use a proper credentials for the Oracle database in order to create the new accounts?</div></div><hr />

Can you tell me how to set the users and group parameter in oracle during the installation,or can you tell me how to add the users and group to the oracle manually now?<br />

Can you help?<br />

You can check the SQL scripts in the $BSE/lib/ora directory to see how the install script will create the user/group. However it's much wiser to make sure that the install6.1 actually works properly as it's likely that you will have problems creating tables in a later stage during the installation as well. What is the Oracle account you are using to create the users?</div></div><hr />
