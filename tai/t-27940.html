I don't it should matter though.  There is documentation available via one of the solutions.  However, you will need to backup the bin, api, lib, java, shlib directories.  Th download the solution with the porting set.  They come as entire directories.  After exploding these directiories in a temp directory move these directories to your $BSE/ directory.  Then run  the shmvalues6.1.  Ofcourse Baan needs to be down.  There are about 16 steps listed. Not sure if they are different though for Windows.  Be careful with the print drivers.  they tend to get messed up. You will find the print drivers under $BSE/lib/printf. Also if you've got user scripts under the bin directory you will need to copy them back in.  The only problems we've encountered was with the print dirvers and the values the shmvalues6.1 created.</div></div><hr />
