<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maneesh_jain</div><div class="date">2nd May 2005, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I have got a problem. In my new 4c4 environment, I applied SP's upto SP18 and created my VRC structure. Yesterday, I created a sequential dump of the company 000 from c2 environment (all tables) and loaded into my new c4 environment (without knowing the consequences). Now, when I look at my VRC's I am seeing all VRC's, package combinations from my c4 as well as the c2 environment. Is there a way to fix it? I don't know how many individual tables have been affected by this. I don't have a backup of my 4c4 company 000.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I think you are screwed. If you loaded the whole company 000, then you overwrote so many original records in so many companies, that there is no turning back.<br />
<br />
I fear you have to start all over again.<br />

Sorry,<br />

We just migrated from 4c3 to 4c4 and did the opposite. We moved everything to the 4c4 base install from 4c3 EXCEPT company000 since company000 is the base install for the version. Best to reinstall 4c4 from scratch at this point. <br />
