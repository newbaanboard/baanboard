We are trying to import the data from 1 company to another company, in middle of the process we get an error &quot;Error in bdpost&quot;. we have tried importing another data as well but getting the same error with all the data. We have checked solutions &amp; VRC both are same for the both servers including porting set but still unable to import data in companies.<br />
<br />
We have attached the Error Log file, Table Not Created Log File &amp; screen shot of the error. Request you to provide the assistance to resolve this issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do a check tables and see what it is complaining about and verify that the field or domain is in the .pd file.<br />
<br />
Running a convert to RDD may fix this issue as well if there is a .new file for the .pd file.</div></div><hr />
