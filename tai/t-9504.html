We are on Baan IVc3 NT/SQL 7 environment. Does Baan support Windows 2000 server for c3? I heard Microsoft is phasing oou NT and by 2005 they won't be supporting NT. Is this true?<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">4th April 2003, 03:09</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few issues with Baan on Windows 2000 that I have come across in the past, but they seem quite few and far between. There is a Knowledge base article on it, but Baan are always happy to say that they were one of the first ERP packages to be Windows2K compliant. If you are considering moving to W2K, I would look at a new install option with a new server, install W2K, database option, then migrate the data over. I have done this in the past and only had some small problems, however its not a small task and needs to be planned properly. The benefit is that you can move over to a new, faster, cleaner and fresh start server, also gives you an old server that can become used for something else (print, web, file, Unreal Tournament server). In the meantime, you can also plan a c4 upgrade in there as well and get upto date with the Baan standard as well!<br />
<br />
As for Microsoft stopping support for NT, I would say that they already have stopped support, when was the last service pack for NT released? Like most companies, they want you to move with them and as there are several new windows options in the pipeline for release over the next few years, I would say that support will be stopped and software may start to be thin on the ground as well.<br />
<br />
Look at it in the same way Baan look at thier support, the roadmap saying that 4c4 support will be dropped by 2008, by then you should all have upgraded to Gemini (Baan 6, which I remember being told by Baan would never exist) and be in a perfect fusion of Windows 2005 (I think is codenamed Whistler or some such thing) with WideBroadElasticBand VPNOSRN (Very Private No Office Space Required Network)  connection (with 512 bit encyption and open slot for any outside agency to get in without an account), discussing support issues on your handheld hologram mobile.</div></div><hr />
