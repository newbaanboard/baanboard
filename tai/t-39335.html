<br />
I have an interesting problem when setting a new user up in our system, I go through the normal steps:<br />
<br />
[1] create user in windows <br />
[2] create user in Baan<br />
[3] convert to runtime<br />
[4] create database user<br />
[5] convert user<br />
[6] link baan to database user<br />
[7] dump user<br />
<br />
All goes well until step [7] when the dump clears all of the user data out of the file &quot;msql_users&quot; in the folder BSE\lib\msql. <br />
<br />
With an empty file no users can log on so I have restored the file and all is well again except I do not have my new user.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on why &quot;Dump Users&quot; should delete the file contents and not recreate them??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
PS. I do get a &quot;not all groups are created in the database&quot; message during the dump.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Try using the DBSLOG=0200 and see whats being logged...See if the user is part of the baandbg group...<br />

You have to convert such users (or delete if you don't need it).<br />

Shouldnt Step3 be done after Step 7??<br />
This steps don't affect each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barney00</div><div class="date">19th July 2007, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to you both for the replies. The information from both of you has solved my problem.<br />
<br />
jclju1, you put your finger on it! There was one user that had status &quot;Not yet created in RDBMS&quot;. I converted the user and the msql_users file populated correctly after the dump. thanks very much.<br />
<br />
sukesh75, once i had converted the user with status &quot;Not yet created in RDBMS&quot; that user would not log on but after converting to runtime there was no problem. thanks to you too.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
