Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86).<br />
2 Open the InforLNStudio_&lt;version number&gt;.nnn-x86_64.zip file, which contains the LN<br />
Studio software, and extract all contents of the file to the new installation folder.<br />

<br />
I have installed Infor LN 10.4 trial version. I just wanted to know if development is possible with Infor LN trial version.<br />
<br />
I am able to carry out all the development and customizations in LN trial version. Ideally it should work with LN Studio as well.<br />
<br />
If someone can guide me in this regard, that would be of great help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Vishal</div></div><hr />

LN Studio installer comes as a zip file and you just need to extract it and start using it. Some configuration (Connectivity) needed before you could do development. You can refer to LN Studio Admin Guide for those configurations. Like Defining Project Server, Creating Development Environment and Activities etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbhawesh</div><div class="date">4th April 2019, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">LN Studio use license for Adapter to connect to LN and then development license to be able to compile components. I don't think Demo license would make any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">4th April 2019, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to Infor Xtreme. In DOwnload section, Download LN Studio 10.4 along with its document.<br />
<br />
Then copy it to a specific location in your file system and then unzip it and open Eclipse.exe in that. Before that you need to install Java Runtime Enviornment, preferably check in the documentation which Version is required and then Download that. After that you would be able to run Eclipse</div></div><hr />
