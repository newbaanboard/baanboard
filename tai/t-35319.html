<br />
I'm having a lot of problems getting a Lexmark Dot Matrix printer to work from Baan IV. I've called Baan support and they are stuck as well, so I'm hoping somebody might have some experience with this.<br />
<br />
We are moving to Baan IV on a SUSE Linux server. The printer is installed at the OS using CUPS. The printer in question, a Lexmark Form 2481 printer. It works fine on our old server (Baan 3.1a on HP-UX 9).<br />
<br />
I've installed the printer in CUPS and it works fine from the command line. Using this command (which is what is used in Maintain Device Data on the old server) I can print a file from the Linux command line:<br />
<br />
lp -s -c -onb -d myprinter filename<br />
<br />
If I try this from Baan, I get &quot;Error 1&quot;. <br />
<br />
I've tried a lot of things. I've installed the printer with the Raw driver in CUPS or the Generic IBM PRO driver. I've used various options with lp and lpr, and I get the same results: it works from Linux but not from Baan.<br />
<br />
The only one that came close was lpr -l, but this generated about 40 pages of garbage before it printed the data.<br />
<br />
Baan support says that Error 1 means I don't have permissions for something, but we checked them and they are all set correctly. <br />
<br />
Baan tried using filter6.1 to generate the output from the command line, then they used the lp command above to print it, and that produced this error:<br />
<br />
client_error_document_format-not_supported.<br />
<br />
This suggests it is a problem with the way CUPs installed the printer. So does anyone know how it should be installed?<br />
<br />
On the old server, it uses a dump printer configuration. The lpadmin -i option says it should install a SysV compatible interface, which might work, but it needs an interface file, and I'm not sure how to get or create one.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help<br />

<br />
Baan already converted correctly its data stream, using the driver you selected in the &quot;maintain device data&quot; session, so you have to ask CUPS to print is in raw mode: without other conversions.<br />
<br />
Solution, just add &quot;-o raw&quot; in your &quot;lp -d...&quot; command.<br />

<br />
We came up with two solutions. The first was to use the lpr -l option, which I guess is similar to lp -o raw option.<br />
<br />
We haven't tested the other solution much since the first seems to work, but it is possible to use the lpadmin -i option to install a backward compatible interface script. I just found the script (in this case a dumb printer configuration) on the old server and copied it over. The printer worked fine. <br />
