<br />

There should be a set of sessions to print the log info in the Exchange Menu.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for youre reply. To get these reports, are there any tables for which auditing needs to be turned on? What I am trying to test is, get a system report for any exchange import/export, and the log activities should match to a proper change approval for data conversion/interfaces.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

These are the log information of the Exchange runs and you can also print the print sessions on them, which gives the exchange run, records info, user id, date, time etc. You can look at the session's main table to find the tables associated with those sessions. <br />
<br />
I am not clear why do you have to audit the log tables? If you really need to know every change in the Exchange world then you also have to setup audit for the main exchange sessions in case someone changes the exchange schemes' definitions.<br />

We are on Gemini/LN-6.1 Tools version, where Exchange is moved from the TU package to DA. I believe these hints will help you out, else someone else on the same Baan version can suggest you alternative options.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your quick reply. My goal is not to audit the log tables, but to see if I could get a  system report for any data update using exchange as a gateway. For auditing, I will use these reports as a souce and should be able to validate the program promotions to production for these  data conversions/interface. And also to validate if any users are 'editing' the data (feeder file) before loading it into BaaN.<br />
