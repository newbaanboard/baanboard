Is it possible (advisable?) to use the delete tables session to get rid of the tables in my test company to release some space?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course you can delete the tables. The question is: <br />
Where do you make the tests after that? Do you have a test server?<br />
<br />
Or is your question more arising from any other concern?<br />

<br />
I do have a test server which I can bring up to date and use.<br />
It`s just easier of course to have a test company you can just change to in baan without coming out and logging into a different server.<br />

Before setting up an archive company it took two days to build a live company by the time I did the import  and run the company number correction sessions but it went down to a day afterwards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a company which looks after BaaN for us (I`m an MCSE brought to a company to look after the network, PCs etc, this is my first meeting with the BaaN monster).<br />
They came in a while ago and did an archive for us but the data is still about 4Gig.<br />
