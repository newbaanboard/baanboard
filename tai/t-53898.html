<br />
Iam in the process of evaluating a solution for sch1 VRC.<br />
<br />
This solution has a co-requisite in the stnd VRC also.<br />
<br />
Is it compulsory to install the stnd solution or can we choose NOT to install it?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />

In general, co-requisites are defined between solutions of a standard product and derived products. Co-requisites guarantee that related products are updated simultaneously under the condition that the update VRCs of the related products are linked to the same VRC combination. The order of installation is not relevant. The solutions can have the same base VRC, or different base VRCs.<br />
I haven't use them in our system. If you are on LN system, refer to the document which has examples of different VRC combination scenarios.<br />

Without knowing your PMC VRC derivation tree, it is difficult to suggest something.<br />
Dependencies for customizations<br />
Individual solutions, patches and/or Feature Packs for customizations must have dependencies to corresponding updates of the parent standard product. Not having these types of dependencies can result in runtime compatibility problems<br />
if only a solution for the standard parent product is installed, while installation of an update for the customizations was also required.<br />
The best way to establish these dependencies is to define co-requisite dependencies between the updates of the parent product and the corresponding updates for the customized product. The co-requisite dependencies are generated automatically if the customization uses the same solution numbers that were also used in the parent standard product. Of course this method only works if the base VRC of the customization, together with the base VRC of the standard parent product, are part of the same base VRC combination at the distributor side. At the recipient side, the update VRCs for the parent standard product and the customization must also be included in a VRC combination.<br />
The co-requisite relationship will only be in one direction: from the customization to the standard parent product. This one-directional co-requisite makes it impossible to install a solution for the customization without simultaneously installing the corresponding standard solution for the parent product. However, as long as you have not scanned the customized solution, you can still install a solution for the standard parent product without simultaneously installing the corresponding solution of the customization. This can result in run time compatibility problems. The customization report solves this problem. When you<br />
check standard solutions in a customized environment, you can optionally print a customization report, which signals customized components and informs the recipient that, together with the standard solution, an update for the customization must also be installed.<br />
Other<br />
The facts described in the sections Rules to upgrade derived products (p. 8-26) and Building Feature Packs and the Infor Installation Wizard (p. 8-27) are also applicable to the development and maintenance of customizations.</div></div><hr />

since SCH0 is derived from stnd you should apply it.<br />
