Can I do the same thing for field with financial year and period ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">21st June 2006, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">No, this works only for date-fields. Year and period are longs; date is an amount of days/seconds from a certain moment on. Therefor it enables such functionality..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Appreciate if anyone can give suggestion for this problem.<br />
<br />
Unlike date field, financial year and period can not be self incremental based on the system date. <br />
<br />
As a result, I have to change the job settings every month for financial report that has financial year and period as input fields.<br />
<br />
Does anyone has this problem ?</div></div><hr />

I don't know if this is for many jobs or for a job with many sessions, so I cannot evaluate if you are willing to spend efforts for it, but I can think now of 3 options to achieve this..<br />
<br />
1) if customizing the session is not an issue for you, then I would opt for this option.. Just replace the form-fields year/period fields with date-field(s). You can either give a from/to range and so determine the period (even with an optional check that from and to must be beginning and end of period) or even easier just fill in the corresponding year/period in the script.<br />
2) For a few jobs with lots of sessions with similar settings, I created update-sessions which update the setting-strings in ttaad503 - the job-parameters table. These are simple ascii-strings, so this is done very primitively by just filling in the right positions with the correct values. When you opt for this option, maybe drop us another line about it, so I - and probably others too - can give you some hints and tips. One thing for instance to notice, is that the period is not always 2 positions, but 1 for period &lt; 10 and 2 for period &lt;= 10 (i.e. not period 07 for July, but 7). Because of this the string length varies.. Anyway, this option is neat and exact. It takes some ticking, but is certainly not difficult at all.<br />
3) You can try filling the correct values using AFS. To update the job parameters via AFS should be possible, yet I've given up once after trying and bumping into conflicts.. I don't know if this is an option, but of course you could call the sessions not as in job, using AFS. I personally would then much prefer option 2)...<br />
<br />
Don't hesitate to post of you need more help/advice..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Option 1 is definately out for me as I can't customize any BaaN session (no developer right)<br />
<br />
I am interested to use option 2. All this while, I never try updating Baan table in Oracle directly. I am not sure how this is possible. Can you please show some light.<br />
<br />
Thank in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The program I was referring to for option 2) is a script in Baan. I created a session in Baan in which the user enters the parameters and when hitting continue all relevant jobs/sessions per job are updated. <br />
<br />
Of course you could also do this directly on the database, although I am not a great fan of that. How bad is it to have to change the job settings every month...?</div></div><hr />
