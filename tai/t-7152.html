I need to update another company (company B)with this data ( actually, the cost price, from company A will be inserted into the purcahse price in item data in company B)<br />
<br />
I just want to update theses prices for the items that I have exported from company A. Is this possible??<br />

the export.  Then change the Maintain table relations form 2 to oerverwrite yes (rest of the fields no).  And you will also need to change the fields relations on form 2 to overwrite 'yes' on the fields you wish to change, and 'no' (like item number), on the fields to leave as is.  <br />

Hope this helps some too!</div></div><hr />
