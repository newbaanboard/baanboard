<br />
we have a strange thing and I hope somebody had the same experience and found the solution for it. Our jobdaemon seems to be stopping after 2 pm every day. Now I know we have the cognos cube running between 1 and 2 pm but could that kill the jobdaemon?<br />
Further information is that we have LN FP3 and porting set 8.3. Personally I think it is the porting set. Can anybody agree with this, if so then we have to upgrade the porting set?<br />

Thanks,<br />

According to the post you use a AIX server: why not start the jobs with cron? That's probably more stable and more efficient. Or do you want to have you users to be able to schedule reports?<br />
No hints in ${BSE}/log ? Probably not, guess with that kind of experience you know where you have to look.<br />

How are you? And thanks for your reply somehow I knew you would reply. Yes we want to have our users to scheduling the reports and there where no hints in the logs files. However I think it has to do with the porting set but we don't want to install a new porting set cos of previous experience and they where badly. That's why I asked if somebody had this issue before.<br />
