<br />
is it possible to audit only a few fields in a table? e. g table tccom001. I am not interested to see changes in the fields namc, namf, telp1 and telp2.<br />
<br />
How can I get them out of the audit?<br />
<br />
My idea was to disable the audit trail in the table definition of tccom001. I let the convert to runtime DD run. Then I made changes with session tccom0101m000 and printed the audit file, but the fields I wanted to leave out are still logged. Did I forget anything?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />

<br />
your idea is right. We've did this successfully some time ago for tdinv001 (and some more).  Currently I don't remember that we've done additional things. <br />
Maybe except of a Baan restart (for new reading of the audit parameter from the runtime DD).<br />

<br />
thanks for the answer. My changes do not become effective. Convert to runtime DD is the only reason I can think of. <br />
<br />
Is there any other idea why the excluded table fields are still audited?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I am absolutely sure that your approach (disabling audit trail on field level in table definition) is correct and we are using this successfully to monitor changes in the items table  ignoring  changes on fields  like reservations or stock quantity.<br />
Did you restart Baan or did you only do a CTRDD? Which DB do you use?<br />
Another thing might be the use of logical tables.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<br />
yes I executed the CTRDD and restarted the system. Maybe there is something to do on database level -&gt; I don't have access to that because it's under control of an outsourcer our database is Informix.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">12th February 2008, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">That means that in comapnies 720 and 920 is audit for table tccom001 still set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
does this mean that I have to disable the audit for table tccom001 to exclude some fields from the audit?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">12th February 2008, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I didn't understand what you really want to do. Now it is clear to me also. You try to exclude only some fields from auditing changing field definition in Maintain Table Field session.<br />
I didn't test it and don't know how it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will have a look next week when I am back on site.<br />
To my understanding, auditing should be managed by the bshell rather than the informix driver that passes the Baan-3/4GL commands to the DB (has anyone more detailed info here?) - but I really doubt that any action is necessary on the informix part. I would assume that the information stored in the data dictionary control which entries are written to the audit files.<br />
Our suppression of audit for certain fields of tiitm001 works fine, but we are using bisam - still I may not believe that the behaviour should differ with another DB ...<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />
I think that last lines in table definition file describe for which fields is audit set. So, in my opinion, if you disable audit for one table field, this field must disappear from line started with AUDT.<br />
Check table definition file in your operational package combination (usually $BSE/../dict/ddpack_comb/dtccom/dtccom001).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Germanicus</div><div class="date">15th February 2008, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I have found the reason for the problem. <br />
<br />
The convert to Runtime DD was not really executed by the system. I could see that in $BSE dict dtccom001. At the end of this file there is a list which fields are in the audit.<br />
