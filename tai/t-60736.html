I am getting an error when a user,say user1, attaches the file from his system (that is defined as Work Area) and clicks on 'Submit for Review' button in session dmdoc1520m000. The status of the document remains the same i.e. In Design and error appears.<br />
<br />
To check this probelm, i attached the document from Windows server (where Vault Service is running) and clicked on 'Submit for Review' button. I did not get any error and status got changed. But when the user(reviewer) tried to view/edit files attached by me before approving the same doc, system had thrown the same error. He is able to approve the document though.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Please see the attached document for steps i had followed and the error i got.<br />
<br />
Please help me in resolving this issue. Appreciate you help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Vishal</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishal</div><div class="date">2nd July 2011, 04:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, problem is resolved now :). There was a network communication problem with AIX server. Ping from this server to Windows server by machine name was not going through but Ping by IP was working. This issue was fixed by adding an entry in the 'host' file under /etc folder of AIX server.</div></div><hr />
