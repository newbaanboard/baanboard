o&lt;module&gt;&lt;object_name&gt;+<br />

Example:<br />

What '+' means? If I look inside of it i see the source of the object.<br />

Please, I need a quick answer.</div></div><hr />

My guess is that it is a customization.  Have you had any work done by outside consultants/programmers that would have put this on your system?</div></div><hr />

<br />
int are modules in BaanERP designed for integration. However, I'm not sure about the + sign. Could it have been manually renamed for some purpose?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 08:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info Paul, I'm not familar with ERP at all.  I agree that + was probably added manually (perhaps as an alternative to renaming them to .old when replacing objects) although that would depend how many objects we're talking about.  My advice would still be to contact anyone who has worked on your Baan system to confirm that this is the case.</div></div><hr />
