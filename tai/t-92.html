Situation:<br />
Two servers running in cluster; one is running BaaN the other Oracle. In BaaN Config files (*.bwc), in Bshell environement Command field it must be &quot;-- -set TWO_TASK=baanIV&quot; for making BaaN to work. This is normal operation. But in case one server crash, because of using cluster, the other one is taking control (of BaaN or Oracle). Well, in this case BaaN is not working anymore until I remove the setting &quot;-- -set TWO_TASK=baanIV&quot; from *.bwc files. This is anoying because it means I must have two identical (with and witout that setting) bwc files for each user.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Is there a way to avoid that ? (other setting who allow to use the same BaaN Config file).<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is of course possible to have 1 config file only. The reason why you put in TWO_TASK is to make sure that Baan connects to the correct Oracle instance. This happens through the Oracle listener process that you have running on your DB server. The clue to a working  cluster configuration is that you configure your listener (tnsnames.ora/listener.ora) to use the floating IP address of your Oracle hot package. Since this floating IP address moves from one node to the other in case of a crash, you will still be able to connect to your database using the same TWO_TASK setting.<br />
<br />
2 more remarks:<br />
<br />
a. you can avoid setting TWO_TASK in your bwc file as there are several other places you can set it:<br />
 $BSE/lib/tabledef6.x <br />
 $BSE/lib/defaults/db_resource<br />
b. in the most recent portingsets for BaanIV, the TWO_TASK has been changed into oracle_service_name. TWO_TASK will still work but Baan recommends to use the latter as TWO_TASK will be a deprecated feature some time in the future. Read the portingset release notes for exact details.</div></div><hr />

Thank you Patrik, I'll try to do that, but please can you tell me where I can find more information about the options avaiable for Bshell environement Command field ?</div></div><hr />
