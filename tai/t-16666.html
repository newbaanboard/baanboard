IF in the R.dump the date is out of range - Can I do something to restore this table from this dump?<br />

Yeah I know what you are thinking but unfortunately I do not have the current backup of the table ...<br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">That sort of thing happens when your DD/Domain doesn't match with<br />
the dump..  [i.e., random out of range errors... ]<br />
<br />
You need the original table def and domainfiles used when you created<br />
the R file.. since you were doing a convert/create to runtime, it moved the .new files in palce..<br />
<br />
You're on windows / sql so that's a little bit more complicated ( have to make sure A) stored procedure is dropped and B) table DD/domain aren't in shared memory).<br />
<br />
One thing you could try first though would be to send the -Z or -R options to bdbreconfig<br />
bdbreconfig -Z -N&lt;table&gt;+ -C&lt;company&gt;<br />
bdbreconfig -R -N&lt;table&gt;+ -C&lt;company&gt;<br />
<br />
-Z is supposed to roll back and -R is supposed to roll forward<br />
but it seems these change a lot.. <br />
<br />
Anyway, this is a difficult one to walk through in a forum, if you've got a support contract give 'em a call.<br />

<br />
just out of curiosity: In SQL Server there is a stored procedure involved, when you do CRDD?<br />
<br />
What is it doing?<br />

<br />
the stored procedures handle inserts and updates in tables, so when a table is created, a stored procedure gets created with it.. I think its for performance or something..<br />
<br />
But the problem is that the stored procedures don't always get dropped properly after/during a reconfig, so they end up having the wrong/old picture of the table in them..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kamaljit</div><div class="date">2nd October 2004, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">What happens with the bdbreconfig + - option is, that instead the dd.old was used the normal dd was used, then matched against the R.-file (and then afterwards reconfigured due to a dd.new-file). The 205 error occur during the matching-stage. So the dd.old points us all to a wrong thinking. <br />
<br />
How to solve it is easy now. Example is table tcmcs003100(means comp. 100 - belongs to Packagecombiantion b40ocdev).<br />
<br />
Under /baanerp/dict/ddb50ocdev and then in directory dtcmcs you have the original situation for the ddÂ´s:<br />
<br />
dtcmcs003 x bytes<br />
dtcmcs003.old y bytes<br />
<br />
I have copied:<br />
cp dtcmcs003 dtcmcs003.new<br />
cp dtcmcs003.old dtcmcs003<br />
<br />
and then works in $BSE/tmp the bdbreconfig6.2 -Ntcmcs003100+ perfect</div></div><hr />
