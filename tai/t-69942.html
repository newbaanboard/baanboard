<br />
Is it possible and does anyone have experience in cloning a Baan IV install to another server?<br />
<br />
We have a production installation and &quot;had&quot; a Test install until a disk crash with no back-up :mad:   I'd like to copy/clone the Production install to our Test Linux server.  The Oracle database already exists with the Baan tables.<br />
<br />
Is that even worth the troubling or is a fresh install a better and more practical approach?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th April 2017, 14:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally - I would do a fresh install of the application.  One time we tried something like just copying the directories.  Resetting all the files to point to the correct database, etc.  It seems like it was just one problem after another and eventually we stopped and re-used another company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I do agree with Mark, incase if your OS is Unix/Linux, you can try a shot with below steps.<br />
1. Take a tar of $BSE from your PROD (See that no user is logged in and you stop the services, that way you will not miss any files) <br />
2. Untar the $BSE into TEST.<br />
3. Edit your $BSE/lib/tabeldef6 and change the path of the DB to your TEST DB.<br />
4. From $BSE/bin, run Binperm6.1 to set the permissions correctly.<br />
5.Start Baan serveices.<br />
6. Try login to Baan with bsp/Baan user and if you are able to login, check all the sessions and the Data, incase of any issues, you can fix them.<br />
<br />
All the best.<br />

<br />
We did it for ERPLn. I do not remember the exact steps but the steps in general were as given below:<br />
<br />
1. Install plain Infor Ln  through supplied installation media. Just keep the directory path and everything same, even the database name name. The drive path as well as the environment should be same.<br />
<br />
2. Stop all the services on newly installed server (baan related services).<br />
<br />
3. Copy the entire directory structure from existing server to  new server, you can rename the existing directory as .old.<br />
<br />
At this point you can restore the entire database of production server to newly installed server and check that tabledef file points to local database ( i am assuming the application and database on same machine)<br />
<br />
4.start the baan services on new server. It will probably start in 15 days trial period. Point the licensing to existing licence server<br />
<br />
These are just rough outlines but covers the core steps required. Additional settings might be required to be done.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">11th May 2017, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">In your case: just simply copy your BSE to the other server. Change tabledef6.x so it points to the correct database. If passwords are different you need to change ora_users/ora_groups as well, you can generate the new passwords with encrypt6.x<br />
<br />
Make sure that as soon everything works the contents of tabledef6.x matches your database definition within the application. If not than a create runtime will set it back. Sames applies to the passwords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donlburton</div><div class="date">12th May 2017, 04:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Han - <br />
<br />
So the procedure would be:<br />
<br />
Source Sever:<br />
Shut Down Baan<br />
Shut Oracle<br />
Tar the BSE directory<br />
<br />
Target Server:<br />
Oracle Shutdown<br />
Un-Tar the Source into an identical directory<br />
Run Binperm6.1 to set permissions<br />
Start Oracle<br />
Start Baan<br />
The question I have: how does the Baan License from one server to the next <br />
effect all of this? <br />
<br />
PS: The client runs from Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help.<br />
<br />

If you don't change file $BSE/lib/license6.1, the second server will get licence from production server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ERPpals</div><div class="date">12th May 2017, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, once you copy the instance, login as root (incase of Linux /Unix) and run BINPERM6.x so that the wrapper scripts and other file permissions will be set properly.</div></div><hr />
