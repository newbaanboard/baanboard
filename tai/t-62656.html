The screen shot of the error message is attached. <br />
<br />
We are not sure whether the problem occured due older version(9.00.5000.00) of SQL Server. Please help.<br />

What is your current Porting Set?<br />
<br />
Current MSSQL version is SQL Server 2005 and Version 9.00.5000.00<br />
<br />
We were using porting set 6.1c.x baan IVc which we need to migrate to new windows server 64Bit. Since 6.1c.x is not supported by 64Bit, we plan to install porting set 8.7b.01 in the new server where MSSQL 2005 version 9.00.5000.00 is already present. During the installation we are stuck with the issue as attached<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you require more details.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chris_kzn</div><div class="date">15th August 2012, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry dude, I am still using porting set 6.1.xxx on our Windows Server 2008 R2 server. I have not read what the difference is changing from the 6.1 to the 8.2, I thought 8.2 was just redesigned for Virtual Environments.<br />
<br />
Only one thing comes to mind:<br />
Make sure you have installed Microsoft VCC or whatever they require - the file vcredist_x86.exe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Lahey</div><div class="date">4th September 2012, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">The error is caused because the installer is trying to invoke the SQL 2008 client which is not installed.<br />
<br />
Download &amp; Install the SQL Client 2008, SQL 2005 Compatibility pack and MSXML 6.0 on the application server.<br />
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16177<br />
<br />
You will also need to install .NET 4.0 if its not already installed, before installing the SQL Server 2008 components.</div></div><hr />
