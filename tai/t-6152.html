<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Last days it occurs. that I have had a error 512 on a ERP an one on a c4 System.<br />
<br />
On the c4 system we did the following: <br />
<br />
- repair int tbase6.1<br />
- full convert to RDD<br />
- full create RDD<br />
- rorganize tables<br />
<br />
and wie tried rc.stop and rc.start to take care about the shared memory manager.<br />
<br />
Nothing helps. At least we deleted the table, and created it new, that helps. So we are lucky, because that was possible with that table without data loss.<br />
BUT WHAT TO DO IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE?<br />
<br />
So on the ERP System I can not delete the table! This problem still exist.<br />
(ERP is with SQL 2000)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

When the error occurs, is it still possible to make a sequential dump of the table?<br />
If so, in case of the risc of losing valuable data, you first can make a datadump, then delete the table, create the table again en import the data. Just make sure the data still is compatible!<br />
<br />
Ofcourse it's important to note the remark of Nicholas, because I think it's the proper solution. We did it ourselves recently, and it works like a charm. (By the way, in this particular case we used the datadefinition of our testenvironment, wich was compatible with the data.) Fortunately, we were able to save the data first.<br />

But I'm so far lucky, that none of the tables contains very important data. So at hte moment I delted them and created new.<br />
<br />
For sure no sufficient solution with important tables.<br />
<br />
Besides from one of the tables I tied to create a seq dump, but that also doesn't work.<br />

<br />
  Maybe it's an option to restore the datadefinition from an earlier backup? (Or, as in the case I described, from a testenvironment?)<br />
  Data perhaps can be restored from a previous database export?<br />
<br />
<br />
That is, ofcourse, when regular backups take place, but I presume they do.<br />
