<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chadwickh</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to install the French language (4) in our existing setup (see below). Looking for ways of doing this to minimize the amount of time it takes, that is, without having to do a fresh install and reapplying all service packs and customizations. I've got the tape coming (hopefully) from Baan with the French extensions. Since French is a base language it appears I have installed over time the French service pack updates but I don't have French tools nor the the base VRCs, like *B40_c4 and *B40L_c4_*.<br />
<br />
I was hoping I could do the following:<br />
1) create a new environment as a clone of my current environment with a new database having company 000 cloned in it as well.<br />
2) install French into this new environment/company 000.<br />
3) using Oracle, export company 000 from the new environment<br />
4) using Oracle, import company 000 back into existing environment<br />
5) Copy the following UNIX directories from the new to existing environments:<br />
 - $BSE/tools<br />
 - $BSE/application<br />
 - $BSE/dict<br />
<br />
Any issues or problems with this approach? <br />
Can I overwrite any prior existing components? <br />
Have you done this before?<br />
<br />
Setup: We have BaanIVc4 on HP-UX with Oracle 8.1.6 (soon 9.2.0). We're running languages 2 and 5 (English and Spanish) upto service packs 9 for stnd, sch0, sch1 and nas0 and upto service pack 12 for tools. We have 2 database servers with 4 application servers with HP's service guard HA installed. We have over 50 live companies since 1999.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you should install from master-tape<br />
over existing installation,<br />
BUT because of already existing comp.000<br />
and updates for french,<br />
with the option, full update --&gt; NO<br />
the you will get only add. tools components<br />
for tt and comp. 000 and<br />
your localisation<br />
<br />
updates in french for U_stnd are already installed (A-language)<br />
<br />
after all, you should run the programs for removing<br />
unnecessary objects form localisation</div></div><hr />
