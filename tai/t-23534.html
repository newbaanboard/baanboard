Additionally u need to take care of users (ttaad200/201) , logical tables (ttaad420) , device settings (ttaad320) , user defaults (ttadv997 ??) , Company data , package combinations,directories for pvrcs , package vrcs , languages , currencies formats /number formats  , user authroizations , user session groups etc ( discard the ones which may not be relevant)<br />

<br />
even though others might disagree, I would be carefull to copy only selected tables from 000, if you are not very sure, what you are doing.<br />
<br />
If you migrate, you want on the new server the same SW level as on the old. The installation gave you the required regsitry settings and services etc. Now, why don't you just copy the whole baan and company 000 from the old to the new server. This assumes, taht you did not change installation pathes etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">27th March 2005, 01:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys,<br />
This is second time we are migrating our Baan from one server to other server. In 2002 we did migrated our Baan from 730 IBM iseries to 840 IBM iseries, this year we are planning to migrate our Baan from 840 to 570 IBM iseries in next couple of months.<br />
In AS/400 Baan companies are generally go by libraries. In our general practice we do these following(this procedure only apply if you want to copy all your Baan instance)<br />
<br />
1)	Copy the Baan Data library (Baan 000) and rest of Libraries (other Logistic &amp; finance companies)<br />
2)	Restore the all users and user authorities in OS level<br />
3)	Copy the all application directories (Baanerp/bse/application)<br />
4)	Make sure that you copy the db4 users files to other server<br />
5)	Change the host name in tabledef6.2 file. (/baanerp/bse/lib)<br />
6)	Change the host name in license6.2 file. (/baanerp/bse/lib)<br />
7)	Start the Baan on new server<br />
8)	You wont see the licmon6.2 job in new server.<br />
9)	Run the patch objects after error solving. That put your system in demo mode.<br />
10)	This point I prefer you better to run all create runtime tools &amp; application process, just for safe.<br />
11)	Change the host name in Database definition session and convert run time.<br />
12)	Validate the new system with Baan validation department to get permanent licenses.<br />
13)	Like that you have to re-validate all you Baan software after moving the Baan to new sever (like Open world, Bridgelogix software etc)<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
Thanks,<br />
