Why is Vc company copying such a pain? If this is the way it has to be, does anyone know all the areas the change company number DOESN'T correct so I can at least to a procedue on it. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juancarlos</div><div class="date">22nd August 2002, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess no one has a better way then - just export company to dump, then do the copy company session from Vc (which only does a few things) then import and bang away at the mess in tcemm and other areas that still have the reference to the other company number you exported from. <br />
<br />
Baan really needs to correct this mess of exporting and reimporting companies. As bad as I though IVc4 was - it is light years ahead of Vc because of the mess that tcemm has brought to company references.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do recognize the problem to be honest one of the things I have to write for one of my customers is a session that cleans up the mess in the tcemm tables after having copied a company.<br />
<br />
However untill now everytime some more important came up...<br />

At least a manual list of all things to look at and change or something.</div></div><hr />
