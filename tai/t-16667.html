<br />
We have BaanERP 5c (SP12) installation on &quot;Windows NT 4.0 Backoffice Server SP6a&quot;, with &quot;SQL Server 7.0 (No service Pack installed)&quot;. We are to make a complete Baan Database restore trial on &quot;Windows 2000 Advanced Server (SP4, with Terminal Services enabled)&quot;.<br />
<br />
SQL Server 7.0 installation on &quot;W2k Server with terminal services&quot; requires, &quot;SQL Server 7.0 SP4&quot;.<br />
<br />
The Live SQL Server has no SQL Server service pack installed. With this configuration, we were able to restore BaanDB user database completely to &quot;SQL Server 7.0 SP4&quot; on &quot;W2k SP4&quot;. But structures of SQL Server system databases (master, msdb, etc.) are not same in differnt SQL Server Sercive Packs. Thus these database could not be restored and hence DB user information and access rights information was missing on W2k. (We are using Veritas Backup Exec 8.5 SQL Server Agent to backup and restore the database.)<br />
<br />
The above problem may be solved, if we install SQL Server 7.0 &quot;SP4&quot; on Live Server, take a backup, and then restore it to W2k. In this scenario, the &quot;backup source&quot; and &quot;restore target&quot; will have same SP levels of SQL Server, and system dataases will be restoreable as required.<br />
<br />
The question Is:<br />
If  SP4 of SQL server 7.0 is installed on the Live server, Should there be any concern that it may have any side effects with BaanERP? If yes, then what it may be and are there any workyrounds to avoid those?<br />
<br />
One other piece of information  is: SQL Server 7.0 doesnot support MSDAC 2.6+ without SP4. Keeping this in mind, can the upgrade to SP4 of SQL Server raise any compatibility issues?<br />
<br />
Please provide as many concerns as possible for this scenerio :-).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Asghar</div></div><hr />
