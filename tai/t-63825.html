<br />
I have tried to search a similar post like this but did not find any. Anyways, here is my question.<br />
<br />
Which kind of authorization is efficient? A DEM based authorization or Standard Role Data Authorization including <br />
<br />
1. Session Auth<br />
2, Database Auth<br />
3. Library Auth<br />
<br />
I personally use Role Data authorization for the following purpose:-<br />
<br />
a. It is not necessary to create seperate users as we need to do in DEM.<br />
b. We can change the authorizations based on single sessions.<br />
c. Consumes less time than DEM Authorization.<br />
d. Any changes can be done quickly.<br />
<br />
I want to know the views regarding this topic. I want to know which one is better. Should I revert back to DEM based authorization?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Thanks for the response. I went through your post and found it helpful. But, most of that information was known to me. My question was regarding, which is comparatively better method to provide authorization. <br />
<br />
I would like to know the views of people who faced problems in respective techniques, which technique they feel is the better one than other etc. <br />
<br />
As we all know, security is the most important aspect in any software, I want to have a deep study on various aspects of it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
