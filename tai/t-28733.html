<br />
I have an issue were certain sessions won't open or will freeze for some clients who have a dynamic IP from a DHCP server.  The rest of baan and other applications work fine, though.  Users will also sometimes get a login error with a dynamic IP.  When I set them up with a static IP the problems seem to go away.  The problems also seem to go away when I install a different NIC, but there's no similarity between the defective or good NIC's<br />
<br />
I've tried a lot of thing such as resetting TCP/IP (with netsh), uninstalling the NIC, updating the drivers, logging on to baan and windows with different profiles, updating the baan client version, replacing network cabling, switchports, and deleting the DHCP lease but nothing seems to help.<br />
<br />
Any help would be very appreciated!</div></div><hr />
