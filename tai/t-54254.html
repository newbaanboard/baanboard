<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">idreaming2005</div><div class="date">14th November 2008, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to say, I installed all the solutions on the application side by mistake.I think that is why I can't link to homepages from webtop. <br />
Therefore, I uninstalled all of them,and did disconnect soluctions/patches from VRC(ttpmc2202s000).After that,they all disappeared from application VRC list. So I  went on download and scan them to tools VRC, but this time couldn't do.<br />
System pop up error, is 'The base VRC of the dump B61_a3 differs from the base VRC of the update VRC.<br />
Any one can help on this?</div></div><hr />

A few need to be installed in tools. So the message you get is correct.</div></div><hr />
