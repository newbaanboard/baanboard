<br />
Suppose if he opts for Unix Os, Oracle DB and BaaNIV / ERP and he plans for 100 user licence in baan does he need 100 user licence for oracle or he can go for 5 or 10 oracle users.<br />
<br />
What is the policy at ur sites? Will you go for the same number of DB licences as Baan? What if OS is NT?<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your best bet is to contact your local Oracle re-seller and have them throw a few options at you.<br />
It is also possible to obtain discounted licenses through Baan (or at least it used to be).<br />
<br />
My guess would be that the second option will be the least expensive one, but then...I had a stomach bug during the three-week licensing course, that forced me to spend most of my time in the hotel bar.</div></div><hr />
