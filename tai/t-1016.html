What should be the package combination for company 000 ?<br />
And what is the use of the First Day of the week and the Default Currency for this company ?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ncasper</div><div class="date">11th February 2002, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Since all of the tools dds and application components reside in their own directory it shouldn't make a difference which PC you assign it to.  <br />
<br />
As for the default currency, I'm not too sure that makes much of a difference either since you really arn't doing any transactions in company 000.  We have ours set to USD the same as all other companies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">11th February 2002, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I would keep company 000 connected to the standard package combination. The currency and first day of the week do not really matter so can be left to the defaults. Keeping company 000 on the standard layer may prevent users inadvertently switching to it.</div></div><hr />
