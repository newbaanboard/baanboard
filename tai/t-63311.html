<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vkpacc</div><div class="date">5th January 2013, 22:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I can recommend you to use Infor Data Conversion Adapter 3.0.  This is special Infor tool for migration data from Baan IV/ BaanERP 5 to Infor LN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">20th February 2013, 01:22</div></div><div class="posttext">the mappping tools are fine, but they promote the idea of filling your nice new LN system with all your redundant BaanIV junk.<br />
<br />
I would treat this as a reverse archiving exercise and only migrate what you need, not loads of obsolete parts, orders etc.  IV to LN is a big step with lots more stuff to setup than the BaanIV data can provide - plus do you really just want to implement LN with the limited structure of your BaanIV system?<br />
<br />
LN exchange module with DAL is surprisingly good for imports and generally prevents inconsistent data (unlike exchange in Baan4) - plus it allows you to be more in control of your project.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mario</div><div class="date">23rd February 2013, 00:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Have done a lot of B4 to ERP LN migrations, a few with infor data conversion adapter, but most just with a few scripts with 99% dal functions and 1% afs. Using your own script is more flexible. <br />
You can recode a lot of base data (mcs data) and you can clean all static data items/routing/bom/ etc. If needed you can create one archive company in ERP LN which has all old orders / items / projects etc. But the life company is clean with only the items you want and only open orders, open invoices / inventory etc. <br />
<br />
Good luck with the conversion project! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daldridge</div><div class="date">25th February 2013, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We've done a few too; if fact we're doing several upgrade projects now. I agree with Mario that scripts are more flexible. I would suggest that if you use the Baan 4 to LN conversion tool that you exercise caution. It's not 100% and has to be &quot;hacked&quot; (i.e., GTM) in certain areas. This is particularly true where there are new tables, new fields and new functionality. <br />
<br />
I too would try to dissuade you from migrating history. Archive this and keep it in a Baan 4 company read-only or a data warehouse. When taking across master data you have an opportunity to add prefixes to keep different types of items, business partners, etc. separate. You can do recoding of items but beware the links in tables such as tdsls401 Sales Order Lines, tdpur401 Purchase Order Lines, etc. when you're migrating open orders because of the references.<br />
<br />
One thing that we've found causes headaches if you're not prepared is when you're adding new capability that requires data changes. For example, when you turn serialization on then you have to set flags in tables like tcibd001 General Item Data and migrate serial numbers. Then you have to reference these new serial numbers in open orders.<br />
<br />
Again, good luck with your migration and let us know if we can do anything to help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felipe_Saavedra</div><div class="date">31st December 2014, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done several LN migrations using mostly AFS (stpapi), by using AFS the advantage is that the data integrity is as good as if you typed in manually using the standard session.<br />
I normally use a go-between excel spreadsheet to allow for data cleanup, mapping to the new table field values and to add the new values required in LN.<br />
Cheers and all the best for 2015!</div></div><hr />
