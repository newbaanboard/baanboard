<br />
<br />
Some know if exits any way for change the server´s IP address without relicencing Baan?.<br />
<br />
Our instalation features are:<br />
<br />
Baan IVc2<br />
Oracle 8.1.7<br />
Solaris 9<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you change the HW (meaning the first CPU) or the hostname,that would be different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Change of CPU also not affecting licenses.<br />
<br />
I already tried. But yes I didn't change IP address, Host name etc only upgrade cpu 300 mhz to 400 mhz.<br />

I was pretty convinced, this is the case (at least on Unix platforms).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can change the server´s IP address without relicencing Baan. Infact I had did the same task before 4 days back. We are using BAAN IV c4,SQL-2k. Do not change Hostname, Ethernet card.<br />

<br />
In Baan IV, you always need to be aware on which platform you are running.<br />
<br />
On Windows (due to lack of an CPU serial no I think), they use the mac adress of the first ethernet card in their calculation.<br />
<br />
on Unix they use the serial of the first CPU, at least I think so.<br />
<br />
So on both platforms you can change the IP. On Windows you can't change the hostname and ethernet card. On yo can't change the hostname and first CPU. On Linux ...?</div></div><hr />

As I mentioned earlier we upgrade the CPU's without re-licensing of BaaN, I remembered once my Ethernet card get faulty hence replace the motherboard of server (sun solaris) (but flash memory keep remain old which may contain MAC address of NIC card) and again relicensing doesn't required.<br />
THIS IS PRACTICALLY TESTED. <br />

Hi Sanjay..<br />
<br />
Your ethernet card was faulty - so you replaced the motherboard.. and somehow you managed to retain the flash memory (That's located on the motherboard...)?<br />
<br />
anyway, apparently somewhere along the line that model of sun CPUs stopped changeing their serial numbers. I wouldn't expect the same from any other vendor. (and other modle of sun cpu either!)<br />
