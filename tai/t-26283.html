<br />
If so, how do you manage the user names? Is there a special session for doing this?</div></div><hr />

We do use bclm in order to license webtop which is used in combination with 5c.<br />

I'm not sure if it is available yet or if anyone else has it already.  I'm guessing that it must be a modified version of BCLM for Baan 5.0c.  I just wanted to find out if anyone else has any experience with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use BCLM-Snapin (a kind of client for Microsoft Management Console Technology) to define named users (as well as other licence relevant data) in ERP LN. This can be installed on any windows client PC and poited to the Baan Server (See attached picture). It should be the same for a Baan V installation as I don't think they want to reinvent the wheel!</div></div><hr />

Currently Baan 5c does not support SLM (BCLM) licensing. However it is planning to support from the porting set 7.1d.12 onwards. Along with new porting set, you need to install few tools solutions also. <br />
With this new porting set and solutions, Baan B50c/B50b can be licensed with SLM and so named users is possible. <br />
<br />
With Named user license, you need to enter all the user name in the SLM for the given product.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
Thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">2nd February 2006, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">does that mean that both ways of licensing will be supported?<br />

Both SLM and regular Baan B50c license will be supported for sometime. I believe in future ERP LN porting sets will also be supported for Baan B50c/B50b. So if you upgrade B50c/B50b with LN porting set, at that time only SLM is supported.<br />
Hope this answers the question.<br />

So even when you run baan in *nix you needed a small windows server to support the licenses. (That particular customer did use openworld with 5.0c, baan did run on solaris). Is that still a requirement or can you handle the licensing totally on the *nix server on which you do run baan?<br />

There Ã­s an SLM available for unix (Solaris definite. We are using it for LN). AFAIK the syntax is the same as the commandline syntax on MS (never tryed commandline on MS because we only have Webtop and OW licences on SLM. So is no need. SLM and LN works fine.).<br />

<br />
there seems to be some confusion here about the terms &quot;SLM&quot; and &quot;SLM Management Console&quot;. SLM itself is a server process which can run on a Windows or a *NIX machine (not neccessarily the Baan server!!). &quot;SLM Management Console&quot; which can only run on Windows, is on the other hand only the client application for managing the licence data which reside on an SLM server. The SLM Managment Consle can actually run on any PC in a network. I for exxample have installed it on my notebook and can manage any SLM-Server by changing the IP address pointing to the server in the XML file &quot;servers.xml&quot;.</div></div><hr />
