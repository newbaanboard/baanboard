<br />
I've also encountered this error. What I did was, I upgraded the porting set and downloaded 114812 Solution. Just follow the instructions on that solution. Also don't forget to run binperm6.1 after upgrading the porting set. (This is to ensure the right permissions).<br />
<br />
Hope that this will help you.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
