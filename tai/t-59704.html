<br />
did someone of you ever came around this problem and got it solved ?<br />
<br />
I want to install Worktop (2.5.8) on Windows 7, but allthough Windows is installed and configured German, Worktop is installed only in English.<br />
The headlines of Worktop are &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Window&quot;, &quot;Help&quot; etc. and not &quot;Datei&quot;, &quot;Fenster&quot;, &quot;Hilfe&quot;.<br />
<br />
First I did a standard installlation. Afterwards Worktop was in English.<br />
<br />
So I uninstalled Worktop.<br />
<br />
Then I did a custom installation and chose only German. Worktop was still displayed in English.<br />
<br />
The regional settings in control panel are German/Germany.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?<br />

What version of windows 7 are you using. I faced the problem with windows ultimate with another program.<br />
The system language is not set in the way the woktop expects it.<br />
I'm not shure, but try something like language=DE as system variables on your windows 7 installation<br />

The issue comes with Win7 Professional. With Win7 Enterprise everything is ok.<br />
I will see what Infor says about that...<br />
<br />
Have a nice day,<br />

<br />
I have found the solution for it!<br />
I just installed the worktop 2.5.8 on an windows 7 prof 64bit. After the installation I had the same problem. As the language is determind from the regional settings of the windows installation, i checke it. It was in my case &quot;Deutsch(Schweiz)&quot;. I switched the settings to &quot;Deutsch(Deutschland)&quot; and started the worktop again -&gt; know the Language was correct. I changed now the setting back to &quot;Deutsch(Schweiz)&quot; and the Language remaind German! Also after a reboot of the System.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you.<br />
