<br />
On a Baan IV c4 system I have a problem with my enum values in tools.<br />
<br />
When I start for example session ttaad2109m000 in ASCII mode (ba6.1) and I press space on the field ttaad209.skey, no enum values come up anymore.<br />
<br />
When I do the same in bw, there is a drop down error in which I can choose the enum values.<br />
<br />
In the $BSE/tools/B40_c4/dd/dtt.pd/dtt.pd file the enum values are all ok.<br />
<br />
The session has been converted to runtime (ttadv999) but this did not make a difference.<br />
<br />
What could be wrong?</div></div><hr />

If happens with other sessions, it may be a bug in the stpstandard library (several fixes were made for it regarding things like this...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have it in more than one session; ttstpstandard is as of last week: system is up to date -1weekdump approximately.<br />
<br />
The problem is there for a longer period of time. But the strange thing is: I do not have it on newer sessions (like ttaad2100m000). That is why I want to renew my RDD (see other thread).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have it checkd with Baan, something that affects a whole lot of functionality, and different enums is a software bug, unless... You mentioned that only the tools sessions are affected [?], have you created runtime for tools also?<br />
Is it possible that you installed something that affects the functionality of tools and need a creattion of runtime? (I never install tools patches without reading all the texts).<br />
<br />
[additional note: Just remembered that something a change of functionality also involves an update of the portingset...]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Portingset is latest, ttadv5213m000 I run it regular, did not make any difference...<br />
<br />
When I make a dbslog file, I do not see a difference with a system where it works fine until ottstpenumset is loaded. On my system it is not loaded and elswhere it is. No offending rights etc... <br />
BTW that ottstpenumset I saw with -dbgfdev<br />
<br />
Because of this problem I started the other thread also.</div></div><hr />
