<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">8th December 2004, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">We have some tables that have triggers in Oracle. When we run sessions that call bdbreconfig (create/convert rtdd and reorg tables) we'd like bdbreconfig to stop and remind us (initially. We can try something more complicated later) that we need to check which tables have triggers before reconfiguring. Then it should go ahead or cancel depending on our answer.<br />
<br />
We thought about renaming the binary and replacing it with a script that would add the logic and would call the real binary at the end. The logic seems to be skept.<br />
Have anyone tried this? Is it possible?<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I created a baan table with fields like Trigger Name, Trigger Table and Status<br />
Then deleted it and created an oracle view of dba_triggers with the same fields (and same name..)<br />
<br />
then I created another table with like trigger name, trigger table and maintained that via Baan.<br />
<br />
Then I had a report that would run in batch every morning that would<br />
check to see if there were any tables in the 2nd table that didn't exist in the<br />
first table, which would indicate that trigger was dropped.<br />
