<br />
A few months ago we evaluated the Disus product on our test Baan server and I thought I had uninstalled it. But we have a problem that when a normal user logs on to the test server they get an error saying &quot;no permission for tcdisbshellch&quot; The tcdisbshellch session is the Disus Bshell Checker (idle logout) So when the user logs in I'm presumming that this session is trying to run but the user does not have authorisation through their DEM.<br />
<br />
I thought maybe there would be something in the uxxx file under $BSE/lib/user directory but there isn't. <br />
<br />
Is there anywhere else I can check?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You can define session groups and assign them to users. Within these session groups you can define which sessions have to be started if the user log's on. <br />
<br />
The session group is stored in the u&lt;user&gt; file in $BSE/lib, the session group definition is stored also somewhere in that directory. <br />
<br />
However I am not sure if that bshell checker makes use of these options.<br />

The first part consists of the general user settings. In this part you can assign a key map group and session group to the user. You can also specify if the debugger must be displayed in the same window or in separated windows.<br />
The second part is only used for ASCII-terminals excepted the field &quot;Sign During Input&quot;. In this part you can specify the colors of the BA menus.</div></div><hr />

1.  Check the BW client to see what program you are calling (eg. bshell)<br />
<br />
2.  Check the ipcinfo file to see what is being called by the rexec call from the client (perhaps a bshell wrapper script)<br />
<br />
3.  See if there is a reference to the Disus executable in the wrapper script. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, send an email to Disus?<br />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
1. We are calling bshell from the BW client.<br />
<br />
2. Our ipc_info file looks like:<br />
<br />
bshell          s    0    0  p  ${BSE}/bin/bshell6.1<br />
bshell.inst     s    0    0  p  ${BSE}/bin/bshell_inst6.1<br />
sh_server       s    0    0  s  ${BSE}/bin/sh_server6.1<br />
audit           s  501  510  p  ${BSE}/bin/audit_srv6.1<br />
fs6.1           s  303  335  m  ${BSE}/bin/fs6.1<br />
nserver         s    0    0  s  ${BSE}/bin/nserver6.1<br />
bisam           s  307  370  p  ${BSE}/bin/bisam_srv6.1<br />
btam            s  307  370  p  ${BSE}/bin/btam_srv6.1<br />
informix        s  305  350  p  ${BSE}/bin/inf_srv6.1<br />
oracle7         s  302  320  p  ${BSE}/bin/ora7_srv6.1<br />
oracle8         s  302  320  p  ${BSE}/bin/ora8_srv6.1<br />
sybase          s  309  390  p  ${BSE}/bin/syb_srv6.1<br />
db2          s  310  301  p  ${BSE}/bin/db2_srv6.1<br />
<br />
I presume the above is fairly standard.  Is this the file you were referring to?<br />
<br />
We sent endless emails to Disus at the time of uninstalling their product but got fed up with the lack of response.<br />
<br />

<br />
What I would do now is try to run with some trace options: DBSLOG=077777 to trace your database actions and with -dbgobj and -dbgfdev and -dbgfile to trace the opening of files.<br />

I will bounce a message to my contacts at Disus if you will send me an email directly with your contact information.<br />
