By design it seems not to be possible to create a PMC solution on checkin or commit of an extension (as is in LN Studio). Or do I have to set the &quot;Integration with PMC&quot; checkbox on the used activity?<br />
<br />
Then when creating a PMC dump for a table extension manually, I only add the table extension DLL txest&lt;table&gt;. I noticed that in the PMC dump header no mention of the CDF fields are present..? So when and how are the CDF fields (records in ttadv491, ttadv492, ttadv493) included in the PMC solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RieseUSA</div><div class="date">8th August 2023, 01:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The ability to include CDF fields with a table extension got introduced with the LN 10.7 tools.  You just need to include the library for the table extension and the CDF data will be included.  There is no mentioning of the CDF data with the solution.<br />
<br />
I have done this by manually creating a PMC solution and also via the automatic generation when using LN Studio and with the Integration with PMC option.<br />
<br />
If you are using LN 10.7 tools and this does not work, e.g., the CDF fields do not end up on the target system, I believe there is some PMC version setting to allow creating solutions for a target system that does not have the LN 10.7 tools.  If that is set to an earlier release, I expect that the CDF data will not get included.</div></div><hr />

There is no mentioning of the CDF data with the solution.I know it works, but was just wondering how. I think they must be included in the encapsulated ttiex dump, but not mentioned in the PMC header. What I did not do (yet) was extract the ttiex dump...</div></div><hr />

But after deactivating the extension and even removing it entirely, the table extension (ttadv491) is stil present...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">11th August 2023, 08:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes that's true. And I think it's OK. A new CDF in a table is activsted by a convert to runtime datadictionary (c2rtdd) run. To disable it, LN would require to remove the field from the table with a data loss. So I think i's ok, when you disable a table extension that the CDFs are still present in the table.<br />
<br />
That a CDF is not removed by c2rtdd after uninstalling a solution is somewhat strange. I never tried that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OmeLuuk is not talking about uninstallation the solution, but about removing the extension. That will indeed not remove the CDF, but uninstalling the solution will do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th August 2023, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">... That will indeed not remove the CDF, ...But that will obscure the current table status somewhat. You will have to go to the Customer Defined Fields menu under Application Configuration to maintain these fields.<br />
As for the table extension itself, deleting it is an obvious choice when there is no logic involved (no hook implementation).<br />
<br />
Maybe it would help a bit when the existence of the CDF fields is shown in the menu of Extended Components under the menu on the left hand side in the Extension Modeler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">24th August 2023, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">... removing the extension. That will indeed not remove the CDF, ...By design, you should add the CDF by extension, but once set up (even on the source system for the PMC solution) the link with the extension is not so that removing the table extension will also remove the CDF fields. As by functionality it makes sense, but it feels not right that once a CDF is in place, you could add it to a session in LN Studio, but not in the BW/DFE fashion. Is it intentional that the table extension may be deleted when a CDF for the table is defined?</div></div><hr />
