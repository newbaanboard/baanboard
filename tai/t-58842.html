<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">14th July 2010, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to upgrade BCLM to SLM 7.1. Installation wizard finished with error &quot;Can't registered ... you have to reboot server first&quot; (or something simillar. I tried with reboot but error remained. <br />
<br />
After that i noticed that I made mistake because I did not check if SLM 7.1 can run on Windows 2000.<br />
<br />
Now I have new SW on folder, it seems that in registry we have old settings and I can start license service.<br />
<br />
My question is what I can do now? Is it possible to &quot;downgrade&quot; SLM back to old version? Or it is better to restore old situation from backup.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your answers.</div></div><hr />

.. the onla problem is, that you have to revalidate the system...</div></div><hr />
