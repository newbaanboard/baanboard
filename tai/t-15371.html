<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th May 2004, 00:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Application locks are programmed in - I see the session call is to 'whinh2202m00c' - is that a custom session?  And, how is session called?  Maybe if from an outside process somehow?  I don't see the application lock write in the regular source for whinh2202, but it could easily be called in one of the libraries or dal's that session calls.  Or the custom code may have added the lock and not write the calls correctly.<br />
<br />
Either way, you should contact whoever wrote the custom session.  If that's you, and it's called like a regular Baan session from the menu or file / run, then you can troublshoot by debugging to find when the application lock gets created, and what the user (logname$) is at that time that it's writing this for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raghunath13</div><div class="date">18th May 2004, 03:04</div></div><div class="posttext">As per my knowledge, i don't see any application lock calls programmed in the customized session whinh2202m00c.<br />
<br />
The above session uses whinhdll1000 and other related DLL's for processing Lot Transfers from one Warehouse/Location to another. I have noticed other standard programs like Easy Warehouse Transfers also creating application locks. The lock gets created when the program is processing Receipts or Generating Inbound Advice. I don't understand why the lock should be present even though there is no related bshell process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th May 2004, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">So, when other standard processes create this lock, do they have the user name as *********?  That's the key, there are 2 separate routes from that answer:<br />
<br />
YES:  If they all do that, you should report to Baan....there may be some bug with the way they are setting the locks and moving the processes around down there.   This is assuming you are calling the sessions from within Baan and using a standard type of user that can create locks normally.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, not a functional person able to answer that from other sites - maybe someone else has expericed the locks with ****** in these Warehousing sessions and can also share.  It should not happen with standard code and I would consider that a bug.<br />
<br />
NO:  If the standards write the lock correctly, we need to look at the custom code, or how the custom code is called - is it from within Baan or is an outside process calling it..?  Do they have any calls in there that may manipulate the user id..?</div></div><hr />
