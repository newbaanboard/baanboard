<br />
Trying to use bdbpre / bdbpost to rebuild some 000 tables. I'm using MS SQL2000 with Windows 2000<br />
<br />
When I try to execute bdbpre (or bdbpost), for example:<br />
<br />
bdbpre -N ttadv301 -C000 &gt; h:\dump\xxx.pre<br />
<br />
I get the error:<br />
bdbpre: FATAL ERROR: 'Logon: to server failed errno 0'<br />
<br />
The BSE, BSE_TMP, and PATH environment variables are active and correctly defined.<br />
<br />
What am I missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 20:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I have instructions from Baan on the bdbpre / post process for MSSQL / Win 2000.  They instruct me to do the following first.<br />
1.  Backup (!)<br />
2.  Turn off Transactional Logging (for large sequences, if the logging has to auto expand, it can cause table locks).  If you are not doing a huge table or have plenty of space, you can leave it on, but I would keep an eye on it.   If you have to auto expand the transactional log or the db in MSSQL, you can get record locks and dropped tables!<br />
3.  From the BSE\bin directory, type the following<br />
   &gt;fillenv.bat                            <br />
    --- maybe that's the piece you are missing<br />
  &gt;SET RDS_FULL=10<br />
  &gt;SET USER=baan<br />
<br />
The last 2 they told me were for performance.   <br />
<br />
Step 3 has to be run every time you enter a shell.  <br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmorais</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 19:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried the set USER=baan and it works.<br />
<br />
However, never needed to do this on Oracle/Informix databases on NT.<br />
<br />
Thanks Ibencic and Omeluuk for your prompt answers.<br />
<br />

P.S.: Ibencic, where did you find those instructions from baan on how to work with bebpre/bdbpost on W2K/MSQL? <br />
The only instructions I have are the ones that come in the online help and are for the UNIX binaries. For NT I had to discover the differences by myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">That was in an email from Baan support...<br />
We had to open a case because our Create Runtime (through the session) took a dive, and we lost some data.  BTW..it took a dive because we ran the Create Runtime with reconfigure while having the transactional logging on, and the db had to do an 'auto expand'.  This caused table locks and dropped tables during the Create DD.</div></div><hr />
