<br />
We still have some Baan IV installations (IVc and IVc4) running for legacy purpose (read only).<br />
<br />
Now our IT dept has decided to switch the clients to OS Windows 7.<br />
<br />
We are not any longer under support contract with Baan/Infor, therefore it is not possible to get the latest BW client.<br />
<br />
Now the questions:<br />
a) Which BW (Baan GUI) client is neccessary for Windows 7?<br />
<br />
b) Where can we get/download this BW client?<br />
<br />
c) If we decide to go with a Telnet app, which Telnet app would you recommned? <br />
<br />
Many thanks for any comments.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
it will pretty hard if you do not have access to the FTP or support site as you need to see the information of the BW, porting set, webUI and the worktop.<br />
<br />
if you are using the latest BW, there is a huge chance that it will not compatible with your version of porting set and you need to upgrade, as Hitesh Shah said.<br />
<br />
i forgot about the lowest version porting set available for windows though.<br />
<br />
for the telnet, do you want to have a cross communication of OS? if so, i recommend putty, it's pretty good for me.<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />

It looks like we have to go for PuTTY.<br />
