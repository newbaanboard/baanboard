<br />

<br />
The problem we are facing is for some work we are logged into bsp and it generates an error and then we logged into &quot;root&quot; and the error is solved<br />

<br />
as long as you talk about being logged into Baan, the following rules apply:<br />
<br />
a) There is exactly and only one situation, when you should log in as root and this is during validation. During validation Baan will create the .brand in the root directory and this needs root authorization. <br />
<br />
b) In all other situations you must not work as root, because as a side effect Baan will crrate files (e.g. log files or runtime files in $BSE/lib and $BSE/dict etc.), which would be created with root authorizations. As a consequence these files will not be readable or changable anymore by normal users and these normal users will then get errors during their work.<br />
<br />
c) There is a bit of a Baan myth around, that you should do things like &quot;create runtime&quot; etc. as user bsp. This is a myth. As long as your baan user is a super user in Baan and has the primary unix groups bsp, you can do these things with any Baan user.<br />
<br />
<br />
So now to your problem: Most likely somebody in the past worked as user root in Baan and created the situation dewscribed under (b). So now you need to do some cleanup, correct the file permissions and everything should be fine.<br />
<br />
