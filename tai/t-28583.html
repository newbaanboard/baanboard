<br />
We have a test Baan IVc4 system which is being used for a disaster recovery project. We had been given a temporary licence key by SSA/Infor which has now expired. However, there is one more thing that I need to test. Without going through the process of re-validating the Baan system and applying for a new temporary licence key is there a way to set the system back to new install mode where you're given a 30 day demo licence?<br />
<br />
I've tried renaming the brand file but this doesn't appear to make much difference.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

We have on installation (7 Servers) for production and an independent test and developing system. All use the same licencemanager/licence key (and we don't have problems with the licences for test and production. They are also shared.).<br />

Thanks for your input everybody. I resolved my issue by rolling the system clock back.<br />
<br />
Csecgn - We cannot share the licence as the DR Baan system is on an isolated network.</div></div><hr />
