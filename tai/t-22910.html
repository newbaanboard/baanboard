Trying to get the Baan Company number up on the main menu in Baan IVc3.  Nothing fancy, I don't want to change the title bar to something unique, just get the company number up there.  This has been discussed before, I read up on all the posts, including the BAAN_WIN_TITLE solution, which only works for Baan V and higher as far as I can tell.  But I'm still confused and not ready to give up, maybe someone knows.<br />
<br />
On our IVc3 system on the main menu it shows the Baan Company number in brackets on the title.  We are at porting set 6.1c.06.02.  As far as our administrator knows, he never set that up, it just came that way.<br />
<br />
On our clients IVc3 system it does not show the company number.  They are on porting set 6.1c.06.03, higher than us.  <br />
<br />
So, I thought it was a porting set issue, but it seems not to be if ours is lower and still has the number.  <br />
<br />
Anyone running IVc3 out there - does your main menu have the company number on it?  If so, any ideas how that got there  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
simply copy the form to your VRC and edit it ..... the company number is a special field. This works for ascii-Clients and has nothing to do with the porting set.<br />
For BW-Clients I would assume that the version of the BW-Client is what matters here. Even menues that do not display the company number for ba-clients, have the company number displayed when I access this menue via BW. I am using BW-client B40c.45 here. I couldn't find any setting to turn the display of the company number off.<br />

They are running GUI only, not ASCII.  I tried copying the menu to their Package and playing with the company number, but it has no affect.   The standard base menu has the company number special field on it, but not coming up at the top of the Menu in GUI.  Would rather not update the standard menus, but I would if it worked for now, but it does not.<br />

Tried the BW version thing too.  Our newer BW Clients still do not see the company number on the IVc3 system, but the same clients can see it on just about any other system.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />
