<br />
We recently set up an automated customer invoicing and now invoices are generated via a JOB called “FACT” (using session cisli2200m00 for the printing process) which generates a PDF file ready for printing. <br />
<br />
But the &quot;FACT&quot; JOB is picking the first option “Invoices “(a BAAN standard) which generates the invoice in PDF but this is NOT the format/layout we wish to get for automated printing as we need another called “Print Sales Invoice”.<br />
<br />
However the job still creates the first one, and I would like to change the settings so the JOB pick automatically the other layout “Print Sales Invoice” for the PDF output.<br />
<br />
How/Where can we change the layout/output settings in a JOB such as this one?<br />
<br />
Please see the attached screenshots for better view.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your quick reply if possible...:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
