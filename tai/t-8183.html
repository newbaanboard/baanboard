now there is a user Arvind , his login does not have this session in  <br />
Baan menu, when i ran baan with his login <br />
<br />
For giving the authorization i ran the following session ttaad2131m000 <br />
( Maintain Session Authorization by Session )<br />
and there it asked for the user, package and session that i did ....and also converted to runtime.<br />
<br />
after that i ran baan with user Arvind/password i was not able to see that session in his <br />
baan menu ......infact his baan menu is not the normal menu which we see....<br />

Session ttaad2131m000 does not modify such menus. Use session tgbrg5100m000, and select the process under which you want the session/activity to be placed. Modify and then start BaaN from the user's login. Do not forget to execute session &quot;Generate User Dialog&quot;.<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
