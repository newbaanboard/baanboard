<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">20th September 2010, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">When I am using the Webtop on different customer's systems, I am experiencing veeeery slow response in the following use-cases:<br />
<br />
* Maximizing a webtop window<br />
* De-Maximizing it<br />
* Using the Sort-By functionality, when the session has dynamic index switching enabled.<br />
* This also seems to happen (but I'm not quite sure here) when closing modal windows (those that are &quot;blocking&quot; the one from which they were started)<br />
<br />
In those cases, the Webtop seems to freeze for one or minutes, also the java console is frozen then. After that time, I get the response. I convinced the java console to give me some thread traces during that period, and I am finding some strange looking locks (Java, not database, just to make that clear) in Java, Baan and Jidesoft (a third party library infor is using for the webtop) classes. For me it looks like a deadlock situation.<br />
<br />
(To replicate, just open the item master in Webtop and click on the maximize button)<br />
<br />
This happens with Webtop 8.5 and Java 1.6.21 as well as Java 1.6.19 (on the client!!). I've heard from other consultants that they have been experiencing similar issues<br />
<br />
Ok, so this post has three reasons: First, of course, does someone has a remedy?<br />
<br />
Next, I want to get some feedback if others are experiencing the same problem (so please reply here if you have the same issue), because then I will open an incident and probably link it to this thread. Multithreaded deadlock issues are a nightmare for software vendors to debug and resolve, but if enough customers are concerned, we might convince Infor to look into it.<br />
<br />
Finally, I've heard rumors that this might be an issue only with newer Java versions ON THE CLIENT. So, please, if anyone is running Webtop and another Java version (client side) then the ones I've mentioned above: Please can you post your version (Client java and Webtop), and if you encounter that problem or not?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
Uli<br />

Some Notes:<br />
* For me it looks like it's got something todo with va.awt.Component$AWTTreeLock and com.jidesoft.plaf.basic.BasicJideTabbedPaneUI$TabbedPaneLayout.<br />
* This post here http://old.nabble.com/being-locked-out-td22007590.html here somehow produces the same thread stracktrace that I had</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">20th September 2010, 23:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I did a lot of download-install-test-cycles. The issue came up with Java version 1.6.12. All Java 1.5 versions and every 1.6 Java less or equal 1.6.11. is working. <br />
<br />
The bug is the same on Webtop Versions 8.5 and 8.6.2<br />
<br />
Infor says they tested the latter with Java 1.6.18, obviously they never maximized a window...<br />
<br />
Since running older Java versions on the client is a major security risc, Infor has to provide a bugfix here. I'll file an incident, and encourage everyone who uses Webtop to do the same.<br />
