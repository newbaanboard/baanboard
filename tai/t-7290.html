<br />
Did anyone ever try to change the Date formats in the Languages sessions - ttaad1510m000 and ttaad1110s000 ?<br />
<br />
If so, what are the steps to ensure that the changes are effective in all the forms/reports etc.<br />
<br />
I found that the session, for Companies - ttaad1100m000 has the &quot;First Day of the Week&quot; entry will that be effected ?<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I've never tinker with the language setting of a report field so far, since I haven't come across such need. Would you think it has something to do with that?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 07:39</div></div><div class="posttext">oh well, seems the tools reports didnt change. But, the report fields from the non tt packages did change.<br />
<br />
Paul, <br />
<br />
I was looking to modify that settings as the manufacturing reports had date fields problem  that they showed 2 digits less and the date was cut off. But this change the year comes to the end but the last 2 digits get chopped off.<br />
<br />
It seems acceptable for short term till BaaN delivers us a solution, or we have to remove the date/time separators in the language setting.</div></div><hr />
