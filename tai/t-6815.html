<br />
In a Baan IV_c4, BISAM, HP-UX 11_20 environment. SP10 implemented.<br />
<br />
In order to be able to merge customizations for a customer, we needed to install a part of the weekly dumps that are being released in SP11. Ever since we did that, zooming from a session is no longer possible when working in the GUI!<br />
In de ASCII everything is ok√©.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse we ran a CRTDD for tools for all PC's, as well as a &quot;normal&quot; CRTDD for all PC's. Yet, the problem stays in all companies and all PC's.<br />
It seems to me one of the (tools) solutions installed must be the blamed for this; but which one?<br />
In the BGS KB there's no mentioning of a problem of this kind.<br />
<br />
Needless to say that our programmers are not the happiest people on earth at the moment.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />

Thanks! This was indeed the solution.<br />
<br />
Sometimes life isn't as hard as it seems.<br />
