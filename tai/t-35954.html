<br />
A strange issue is coming up.<br />
<br />
I have created a new package combination under update standard in my new Baan5c environment.<br />
<br />
I changed the package comb. for default company 902 to this new comb. and then changed the pckg. combination for 'baan' user as well.<br />
<br />
After CRDD, i came out and trying to log into BAAN, but it pops up the error &quot;Could not log you into database - CANNOT DETERMINE LOCATION!!&quot; <br />
So, i went to /lib/users and changes the combination for user back to update std and then it would allow me to log in.<br />
<br />
I created a new user and same situation is coming up with this user as well.<br />
What am I doing wrong??<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

Did you check under the /BSE/application folder whether the various folders for each package has been created for this new VRC?<br />

<br />
Yaa...all folders have been created for this new pck combination as well as VRC in dict and application.<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<br />
I took following steps:<br />
<br />
1) Create live pack combination derived from update stnd using session &quot;Create package combination (one step)&quot;<br />
2) Created new VRC in above step only.<br />
3) Change the package comb. attached to one of the companies using session &quot;change pack. comb. for company&quot; and convet to rdd.<br />
4) Change the package combination attched to user baan using session &quot;General user data&quot; and &quot;change pack. comb. for user&quot; and convert to rdd.<br />
5) log out and try to log back in.<br />
<br />

  Thats a nippy little feature(&quot;Create package combination (one step)&quot;)!! I did the same as what you outlined in your post in my experimental LN6.1FP3 and i had no problems logging. I could open up the sessions as well and it gave no error...I guess this feature is the same as that you find in Baan5c<br />
<br />
When you did the above mentioned single step vrc creator, did it return any errors or warnings at the end of creation?<br />
<br />
I hope you didnt create a customized vrc for the tt package?<br />
<br />
Last but not least, if nothing helps, it would be good if you can check at the baan support site whether any solution is there for this session <br />
or <br />
try to create the new vrc package manually by using sessions &quot;Package VRCs&quot;, &quot;Directories of Software Components&quot;, &quot;Package Combinations&quot; and &quot;Packages by Package Combination&quot; in this order.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">21st May 2007, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an idea (from Baan IV point of view) - have you got a wildcard in the table ttaad411? (Meaning that &quot;all other tables&quot; are assigned to database xyz.)<br />
Check program ttaad4111m000  or look at $BSE/lib/tabledef??.<br />
The error &quot;cannot locate database&quot; at least sounds as if the system can't determine which database to use for your new company.<br />
Perhaps someone can give me an info whether this logic has been altered in LN.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yaa..I have used this method of VRC creation a lot of times with success..but don't know what is happening this time?<br />
<br />
Secondly, regarding the session ttaad4111m000, all entries seem to be OK...all tables+ all other tables assigned to database 001.<br />
<br />
any ideas? <br />
