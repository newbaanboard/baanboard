<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">2nd February 2016, 10:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I am working on a site with 3 BaanIVc4 servers - one is in a separate (trusted) domain (but on same physical network, same organisation).  All are VMware windows 2003 servers.<br />
<br />
SLM master &amp; slave is on the 'main' domain, one slave was on 2nd domain and all 3 servers were licencing successfully for around 18 months.  We tried to add SLM slave to another server, but there is some strange setup that allowed this cross-domain SLM traffic to work, so the new server SLM is not accessible across the domain - and no one now knows what is was!<br />
<br />
I'm sure Infor helped get this working last time (before I was here), but now they say it isn't supported and we are now stuck.  Has anyone who got this to work kept any notes of how they did it!?</div></div><hr />

FQHN identifier<br />
The full qualified host name (FQHN) of the host where the SLM Server is deployed will be used to identify the system. Based on the FQHN, SLM will generate an SLM host-id for the identification. This id is used to register the SLM Server in the license file.<br />
The full qualified host name consists of a host name and a domain name part. SLM Servers that are deployed on a VM will handle license requests from only SLM clients that are deployed on systems in the same domain. In a SLM cluster with multiple SLM Servers it is possible to deploy the SLM servers for all the domains where an SLM Server is deployed.<br />
Note:<br />
It is strongly advised that you deploy the SLM Servers that belong to the same SLM Cluster all on the same host type, so all on a Windows systems or all on a UNIX system and all in a virtual environment or in a physical environment.<br />
SLM uses these rules to identify a hostname as a FQHN:<br />
• Must be 2 labels or more<br />
• Labels cannot contain more than 63 characters<br />
• Labels cannot contain special characters<br />
• Hostname must be reverse resolvable (hostfile, DNS, etc must be correctly configured for this)<br />
For SLM to work in a VM environment all (servers and clients) must follow these rules, to use FQHN licensing on a Non-VM these rules only apply for the server(s) SLM is running on. We recommend that you not to run VM and non-VM in the same SLM cluster setup, if this cannot be avoided ensure that all (servers, client) follow the VM rules.</div></div><hr />
