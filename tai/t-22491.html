While working with BaaN, suddenly it seems that you're connection with the server is lost. Then you have to wait, sometimes up to a minute, and the response is normal again. This happens randomly during the day. The only thing that changed was the installation of bwclient 76.<br />
<br />
Is there somebody out there who knows a sollution?????<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

BW version does not seem to be the problem: most users have an older bw version.<br />
