We are Baan-User in Austria and have also sites in different countries in Europe, where we use Baan, too. Now we also start business in US, with Baan.<br />
We have already installed the language: English. Is there a special Baan-Localisation for US available? Or is there everything in Baan-Standard available?<br />
Are there any Baan-Add-ons necessary in US, for example: for tax-compliance?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

But I am sure any US people on the board here would be able to give more infomation than I can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A GEO code is a code used together or in lieu of address information such as city, state/province, and ZIP/postal code to uniquely identify a taxing jurisdiction.  The tax provider determines the GEO code based upon the address information entered and the county and city limits selected.<br />
<br />
The format of the GEO code varies by tax provider.  AVP uses a two-digit GEO code; the GEO code together with the city, state, and ZIP code, identifies the taxing jurisdiction.  Vertex uses a nine-digit GEO code comprised of a two digit state code, three-digit county code, and a four-digit city code.  A tenth digit is used to identify if the jurisdiction is inside or outside of the city limits.<br />
<br />
Take care... if you work with the EDI module in an open environment, it require agreements on the data to be exchanged and its structure. On the international level, the agreements are laid down in the EDIFACT (Europe) and the ANSI X12 (USA) standards. <br />
On a national level, agreements have been made per line of business. <br />
The BAAN IV EDI module in principle supports EDIFACT, ANSI X12, and Inter Company EDI (a BAAN IV standard for EDI exchange between BAAN IV companies operating on one UNIX system).<br />
 In addition to supporting these standards, the EDI module allows for the support of other standards because the BAAN IV EDI module allows new messages to be created. Codes, conversions, and conversion setups can be userdefined. <br />

Bien le bonjour<br />
