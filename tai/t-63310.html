<br />
I am facing a piculiar problem,and got trapped completely .Please help me in getting a quick solution .<br />
<br />
I have one session which reads a file and inserts the data into a table ,after db.clear.table .<br />
<br />
It works fine when i run thesession manually or by activating the job manually by pressing continue button through session ttaad5203m000 .It takes 55 minutes for the complete process .<br />
<br />
But when the job is activated automatically in the morning 3 AM, it runs for only 13 minutes and only deletes all records from the table ,but could not able to insert the records .My observation is the job is not running properly thats why ambiguous result is coming .<br />
<br />
Can any body help me out in this automation through any alternate way  e.g.using shell script ,I dnt know  shell script,please send me the sample code if you have.<br />
<br />
My Environment is BAAN-IV C4 AND LINUX O/S .<br />
<br />
AWAITING QUICK SUGGESTUION .<br />
REGARDS<br />

<br />
In the ttad5203m000 you can specify for which company the job should run if it is different from the current company you are logged in ... that could be the reason it is working here.</div></div><hr />
