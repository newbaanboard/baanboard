Periodically, Citrix users get 'hung' when clicking the Baan Worktop icon - does not get to user name / password. Have any other users experienced / overcome this problem? Only known solution to me is to reboot the Citrix server, but most unsatisfactory during normal hours</div></div><hr />

<br />
To use worktop in a terminal server environment<br />
As of version 2.3, the Worktop supports the Microsoft Terminal Server service. Although, Worktop has been tested for Windows 2000 Terminal Server, other terminal servers, such as Windows NT TS and Citrix, are also supported. <br />
<br />
Terminal Services is a service that adds terminal support to Windows 2000 Server. Terminal Services is a multisession environment that provides remote access to Windows-based programs running on the server. Essentially, Terminal Services is an alternative to central deployment, which is described in Introduction. <br />
<br />
To enable terminal server users to use the Worktop, the administrator must configure the Worktop in the Terminal Services configuration to start up with the argument /ts. <br />
<br />
In the following example, the administrator configured the terminal server so that, when a user connects, the Worktop starts automatically: <br />
<br />
Several methods are available to deploy the Worktop on terminal server. The most typical approach is to enable users to connect to terminal server with their system account. Subsequently, a user can open a Worktop document that is created by an administrator and connect to the Baan backend with their personal Baan account. Specific changes made to the document, such as GUI modifications, are stored in the terminal server user profile. <br />
<br />
A second approach is for all users to connect to terminal server with their system account and connect to the Baan backend with a common account. This can be useful if all users rely on one specific DEM business process. <br />
<br />
Note that some restrictive issues, such as the following, apply to the use of terminal server: <br />
<br />
Administrators control the deployment of Worktop documents, as described in Introduction. <br />
Older versions of terminal server only support up to 256 colors. <br />
Some screen update problems exist. In many cases, minimizing and maximizing, or resizing the Worktop window can resolve this issue.</div></div><hr />

I'm also facing this issue, here is it what happens.<br />
<br />
1.There are few users logged in LN via citrix, sometimes 15-20 with no issue, but when a new user tries to login to CITRIX(with even &lt;10 users), his citrix session hangs.<br />
earlier we use to logoff all users from Citrix server, but now we just logoff a few users to allow others to get in.<br />
2.To Solve this we tried Xen desktop, now users are able to login to Citrix, but not at all able to login to LN.<br />
3.But there are other applications installed on citrix as well which work smoothly in the same scenario.<br />
<br />
We check internet line health reports as well, there seems to be no bottleneck, even appears underutilized.<br />
<br />
Dear Experts, really appreciate your inputs on the topic.<br />
If anyone else is also using Citrix for LN and never came across to such issue, still please share your thoughts and setup if possible. Thank you all.</div></div><hr />
