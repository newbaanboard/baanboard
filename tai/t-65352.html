<br />
I've created a new company which is part of our single logistics/multi finance environment. This I have done following the Baan quick guide 1022.<br />
<br />
I am having an issue completing the Maintain Company Parameters tflgld0103m000 session. It won't let me save the record because I have no transaction type set on form 3. As the transaction type table is a logical table linked to the group company, if I enter a valid transaction type I then get an error saying default series for transaction type not found. If I then try to maintain the transaction type to enter a series I get an error saying Company Paramters not found. <br />
<br />
I have read another post on BB which says use GTM but I don't like doing that unless that's the only option. I've logged a call with Infor support but at the moment they're not being very quick in coming back with a solution.<br />
<br />
I've created new companies in the past and cannot remember having this issue.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

tcmcs0295m000 for the new company can help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you checked the table sharing? I guess, transaction type table might be shared and series might not be shared. Just check with the other already created companies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">30th January 2014, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I did check this and the series tables are not shared in the other companies. Which make sense as I don't think you would want to share a series across companies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">30th January 2014, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, right. The series should not be shared. Have you checked the table sharing? Make sure you aren't missing any important ones. I am on LN so don't have many ideas about your system.</div></div><hr />
