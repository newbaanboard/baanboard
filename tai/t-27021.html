<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">3rd May 2006, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a user with an unusual problem.  He is printing statements using session tfacr3440m000.  The layout is portrait.  Each time he prints a statement, he gets a message<br />
&quot;Report Does not fit on paper&quot; - He hits OK.  Then he gets message<br />
&quot;Are you sure you want to print?&quot; - He hits OK.  Then he gets message<br />
&quot;Wait until device paper has been changed?&quot; - He chooses &quot;NO&quot;<br />
Then his report is generated.<br />
<br />
I have reviewed this process and the paper type is Letter, not Landscape and the remaining parameters look OK.<br />
<br />
I have asked his staff if they have this problem when they print a statement to the same device and they say NO, which explains why I have not been able to replicate this using my user ID.<br />
<br />
I have attached document with image of his print parameters.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what is causing these messages?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd May 2006, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Something else - make sure the user did not do a save defaults on ttstpsplopen.  I have had this cause me all kinds of problems - with a printing issue I first delete user defaults to this session.  Then I create the device preference list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">3rd May 2006, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">What table is used to store user defaults?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">3rd May 2006, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Never mind my previous question.  I found the table ttadv990.  And I see 12 records for this user, company 0, session ttstpsplopen.  Are you telling me to delete these 12 records?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd May 2006, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I use session ttstpdeldeflt to delete the user defaults.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">3rd May 2006, 23:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much.  I did not know how to remove the default user settings.  One is never too old to learn something new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th May 2006, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Did removing the defaults solve the problem?  I am curious because every so often these defaults corrupt printing for a user. Example - a user prints production orders to printer x.  At some point the production order will stop printing correctly for this user - and some of my function servers lock up for this user, other reports also print incorrectly.  And in some cases they get messages just like you mentioned. I delete the defaults for ttstpsplopen and magically everything works again.</div></div><hr />
