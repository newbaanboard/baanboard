<br />
I have had this strange problem, I hope you can help me with. It is solved now, but I would like to know how I can find out what caused it.<br />
<br />
After creating a new user on my Baan Box (Baan4c4/NT4/Informix) 2 users came to inform me that they couldn't log on anymore.. I checked the logs on the server and a error came op that they were missing from the inf_user file. I checked the file and both users were missing.<br />
<br />
I checked the &quot;maintain database users&quot; and found that those two users were indeed missing from the 2nd database (without audit). I re-created them, did a conversion to runtime, and they could log-on again...<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me how I can find out what caused it? or has any suggestions....<br />
<br />
If I did something stupid, I want to know too!! :) <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Robert</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Maintain Database Users<br />
<br />
2) Maintain Links between Baan Users and Database Users<br />
<br />
just make sure you are on the Correct database when you convert to runtime - In case you have one database with Audit and one without Audit. Sometimes Baan does not default to the database you want to use.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Benito,<br />

I'll keep that in mind next time I add some users to the system..<br />
