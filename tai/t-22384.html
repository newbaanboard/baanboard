Windows and Informix have been installed (seemingly successfully).  During the install of Baan we are encountering a puzzling error message.  The message is shown below and occurs just after we answer the questions regarding the Baan Group Account and Password.<br />
<br />
Error #1 - Unable to connect to Database server as current user.  Please check the password and current user privileges and restart the installation - this message occurs if we use the default &quot;baandb&quot; offered by the installation<br />
<br />
Error #2 - The Baan group account exists but the password you entered is incorrect.  Re-enter the password or enter a different group name. - this error message occurs if we use an exiting user name and password (correct password)<br />
<br />
We have been equally unsuccessful supplying a &quot;group&quot; name instead of a &quot;user&quot; name, but, of course, Groups do not have passwords and the password is &quot;required&quot;.<br />

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

that could install on Win2k.. and how new is that informix version? it might not be supported by the ancient porting set...<br />
<br />
Why don't you copy your current environment over manually?<br />

<br />
We have actually had the media for quite some time, but downloaded the porting set from Baan Support.  Our production server is running the 2217 porting set (6.1c.07) so we want to make sure we can replicate everything as it was from the most recent backup.<br />
<br />
Informix 7.31.TD8 is the most recent release I am currently aware of, but since our production server is using TD6, we are using that for our rescue scenario.<br />
<br />
Since this is a disaster recovery scenario, we must assume we cannot copy over from a server that has crashed (or under 3 feet of water etc...).  We are trying to work out documentation to build a completely new server (for emergency purposes even from a high-end desktop system) which has a completely different hardware architecture.  We have the OS on drive C and have Baan/Informix on drive D so they are isolated.  Even if we could do a direct copy, the different hardware would cause the system to be unbootable (a windows problem because the copy would have to include the registry since that is how windows maintains program installations/variables).<br />
<br />
I hope this helps explain our situation better.  Thank you again.</div></div><hr />

My understanding of the windows installer is that you cannot switch out the porting set until after it is installed... So with old c3 media you're using an Old porting set (until you get baan up and running). then you can switch it over..<br />
That old c3 portingset (whatever it is) may not support your informix version.<br />

<br />
It's certainly possible to copy the Baan portion over directly, baan comes with the ability to re-create the registry entries.. then you'd just need to export / import your informix data to the new server..<br />
<br />
A more true to life scenario would be for you to restore the Baan system from tape to the new server. Even with different hardware, I believe this would work and you would probably be a lot happier with it.. A new install would take you weeks on your DR box (you need to apply service packs, customizations, etc until the system matched your tables!!)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some!<br />

<br />
Actually we have tried the full tape restore and it died almost immediately because the OS would not boot due to the vastly different hardware.  If the OS doesn't boot (and it couldn't be repaired without blowing it away again), we are snookered.<br />
<br />
We are installing Baan directly from the downloaded porting set instead of from the media because, as you stated, the old porting set is not compatible with Informix (nor Windows 2000).<br />
<br />
I am not sure I fully understand your statement about copying over the environment if the production server is dead.  The registry copy would most likely copy everything over for an identical server, but usually they aren't something you pick up at your local RadioShack so it would take taime to get it.  While waiting for it to arrive, we want to be able to run on a much smaller-scale configuration that is available in the area.  For us, this is a very real possiblity because the building is very prone to lightning strikes (I have no idea why...) and we have lost equipment before but were just lucky it hasn't been the server... yet.  Could you elaborate on this part of the procedure since I haven't heard much about it?  It could speed things up a bit if it works!<br />
<br />
So far our scenario, which includes building an emergency server, loading the OS, Informix and Baan then restoring data from backup will take approximately 7-8 hours.  We have already calculated actual restore time to be approximately 5.5 hours on this hardware spec., so the rest is actually pretty quick because we have everything documented key-stroke for key-stroke.  Assuming we can get past this error message, all we have left is the install of our backup software to complete the procedure (approximately 25 minutes).<br />
<br />
Our general strategy is:<br />
     Build Computer<br />
     Install OS<br />
     Install Service pack<br />
     Install and configure drivers<br />
     Install and configure Informix<br />
     Install and configure Baan<br />
     Install and configure backup software<br />
     Restore from backup to get back to where we were when everyone walked in the building in the morning<br />
<br />
For the procedure, we have created a CD with all necessary software, drivers and config files to speed up the process dramatically.  Because of our drive configuration (OS on C:, Apps on D:, Data on E:, F: and G:), the data with all customizations etc... will automatically be installed and working upon final reboot.<br />
<br />
We have actually done this successfully (once), but did not fully document the procedure because we were in a time-pinch to get it working.  Once complete, we would be more than willing to share this document with anyone (it will of course be customized for us, but the concept and procedure would remain the same).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still seems a little overly complex to me - why not just restore the Baan and informx software to the new server and leave the OS out of it?<br />
<br />
As for the rest, I'm out of ideas, does the event viewer say anything?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdbailey</div><div class="date">19th November 2004, 23:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Dave,<br />
<br />
I tried doing that, but the software wouldn't run without all the registry stuff put it properly.  That is the real pain (excuse the pun) with Windows!  Even if you install stuff on a different drive, it still plants a bunch of crucial information on the C: drive.  So, Baan and Informix won't work without restoring the registry too.  I thought about saving off copies of the registry hives to restore to the DR server, but the hardware differences would make this an extremely complex and time-consuming process which would only work within limited variations in hardware.<br />
<br />
We are trying to come up with as generic a process as we can to get everything up and running in fairly short order (because of the ever-changing hardware technology).<br />
<br />
I'll verify the event viewer...  I think I am getting too old for this (I forgot to do that... how silly is that?!?!?)  I'll let you know what I find out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
to recover any application (with registry settings) on a Windows server is always a nightmare. By chance I tried for Baan yesterday the following approach successfully:<br />
<br />
a) Install the fat client on your windows server in the same path as on your origional server. This creates all needed registry settings.<br />
<br />
b) remove whatever you installed.<br />
<br />
c) recover your Baan installation from tape<br />
<br />
d) check the registry settings. You want to delete any references to a setting called &quot;BSE_REM&quot;<br />
<br />
That's it!<br />
<br />
