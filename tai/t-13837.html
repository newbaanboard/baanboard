<br />
I am looking for the session name or code for exporting the customized components on a Baan IV c4 system. <br />
<br />
In Baan ERP we maintained a patch code and added software components to it and then exported it thru the specific option on the session menu.<br />
<br />
I am not able to find the export option or the session itself .<br />
<br />
Any information in this area is welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Max</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are looking for the session ttiex4100m000,  ttiex4110m000 and ttiex4220m000.<br />
<br />
With the session ttiex4100m000 you can create the PatchCode.<br />
With the session ttiex4220m000 you can connect all the cutsomized components, which are connected to a customization Project to the created PatchCode.<br />
With the session ttiex4110m000 you create the Dump.<br />
Afterwards you can import the dump with ttiex1284m000.<br />
<br />
If you have c4 System with newer service packs all the session should be present. In c , c1, c2 or c3 systems only ttiex4100m000 and ttiex4110m000 are present. You have then to connect the components manually to the session ttiex4110m000.<br />
<br />
happy working...<br />

I see you have this solved using patch management and some custom code.  If anyone else is interested, we have a little utility that does the export as you described.  Below is our write-up:<br />
<br />
The Customization Exporter fixes a shortcoming of standard Baan by allowing users to export all of the Baan components associated with a given customization part.  Not only does this allow the selection of components that are not alphabetically consecutive, but it also allows the user to select components across packages in only one export operation.  The Exporter, which is available for Baan 4c and 5c, also provides users with the option of including or excluding functions and script source.  Users simply enter a customization part and the path to which they wish to export.  The Exporter creates one subdirectory for each package associated with the customization part.  The directories and files that are created may then be imported into Baan using Baan's Import Data Dictionary session.   <br />
<br />
It's supported by us and has been in use for over a year.  Sorry, it's not freeware, but it is very cheap if you do not have our other solutions, and no charge if you are using our rmc3 or other solutions already.  <br />
<br />
Please contact Kathy Barthelt at kbarthelt@rmcis.com if anyone has further interest.<br />
<br />
Sorry to spam advertise - I have seen this come up a few times, and there have been coding solutions for it.  Those are all fine, it's not rocket science.  Just wanted people to be aware there is a pre-packaged solution out there.</div></div><hr />
