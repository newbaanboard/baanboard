<br />
I need to copy an existing company from one VRC to another VRC.<br />
Which sessions do I have to use and what are the steps to do this.<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
I follow the procedure below for 4c4, this is for an existing company to company copy.: -<br />
<br />
1. ttaad4226m000 (company in original vrc) - Create seq. dumps of tables. We normally get away with doing the tc, td, tf, tg, ti, tp, tr, ts and tt. You may have to include others, you will need to check.<br />
<br />
2. ttaad4231m000 (company being updated) - Delete tables in the company you are UPDATING (your 2nd VRC) in to.<br />
<br />
3. ttaad4230m000 (company being updated)- Create tables<br />
<br />
4. ttaad4227m000 (company being updated)- Create table from seq. dump. Use files created in step 1.<br />
<br />
5. tcmcs0295m000 (company being updated) - initialise Params<br />
<br />
6. tfgld9004m000 (company being updated) - Correct company number after copying. This will need to be run if your company numbers are different. i.e. If you are using company 100 data to update company 110.<br />
<br />
7. ttaad4225m000 - (company being updated) - Reoragnise tables<br />
<br />
If you are wanting to create a company from new I have attached a quick guide on how to do this.<br />
<br />
Other people out there may do it differently but this is the way I do it and I've carried out this process quite a few times over the last 18 months.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<br />
PJ's method is used for copying lets say company 100 to company 200 in the same VRC. By the way I do not think, you need the step &quot;Initialize Parameters&quot;.<br />
<br />
If the two VRC's (or to be correct Package Combinations) have the same data definitions, then this will work fine.<br />
<br />
If you want to change the Package Combination of a company then you have to user the session &quot;Change package Combination by company&quot; ttaad1101m000.<br />
<br />
This session will dump the changed tables, recreate them with the new data definitions and load the data again.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caner.B</div><div class="date">26th March 2002, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All ,<br />
In our developers VRC we don't have any company.<br />
and we need to test something there . <br />
We have a test company (915) in OPER_MCR package Combination  and want to  use this company in our developer VRC <br />
And our developer VRC's Package Combination is DEV_MCR.<br />
<br />
- Can I run &quot;Change package Combination by company&quot; ttaad1101m000 when user are logged to baan  <br />
- What are the next steps after running ttaad1101m000 <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
if DEV_MCR and OPER_MCR have the exact same datadictionary, then you can do two thing.<br />
<br />
a) just put your test user on company 915 and Package combination DEV_MCR.<br />
<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
b) just change in general table Maintainance the package combination of company 915 to DEV_MCR.<br />
<br />
if not, you have to do the &quot;change package combination&quot;. Baan can be up and running, but you have to make sure, that users are not working in company 915. Any other company (as long as they are not logically linked) is ok!<br />
<br />
If a user is working in 915, when you do it, then you might get locking problems or you might loose some data or the user might get error messages. So do not do this.<br />
<br />
After &quot;Change Package combination&quot;, you just have to change your user settings and that's it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 01:58</div></div><div class="posttext">OK.  Same situation (copy company...) BUT<br />
<br />
the original company (333) is on a server running Baan IVc4.  This company and all data needs to be loaded on a different destination server that is running Baan IVc2.<br />
The destination server is production with live companies (111, 222).<br />
The company to transfer over will be for reference purposes, and users should be able to 'switch' to the reference company (333) if needed.<br />
<br />
I have gotten so far as to create the company 333 and load the tables from the IVc4 dump - EXCEPT - there are a few tables that did not load - these tables have a different layout (additional fields) than my IVc2 tables.  I have tried to add the new fields, but still I cannot load the original data.  I can enter new data, but I cannot load  - DD's don't match.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas how I can get this IVc4 company (or just the few selected pain-in-the-b--- tables) into my IVc2?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

One way to do this is to copy the c4 data definition for those tables into your customer level VRC in c2 then import the data.   When the data is in, remove the c4 data definition and convert to run time, it will keep the data and make the necessary changes.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 21:32</div></div><div class="posttext">lbencic,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the fast reply.<br />
That was one of the options on my list of things to try, so I bumped it up.<br />
<br />
It appears that did the trick.  I was able to load the table data and still see everything after putting the original dd definition back.<br />
<br />
I didn't have to do any convert to runtime tho. - should that matter latter?<br />
<br />
thanks again for your quick solution!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you should run the convert.  The data is in is still c4 configuration until the convert is done.  For instance, some table may have more fields in c4 than in c2.  When you import using c4 definition, you have the extra field.  When you delete the c2 definition in Maintain Table Definition, you still have the extra field until the convert to runtime is done.    When the convert is run, the table will drop the extra field, and make any other changes needed to conform to the c2 definition.   You should check the reconfigure option.<br />
<br />
Edited:  Just thought that you may not have done this through Maintain Table Def.  If you moved the dd's around through the file system, I really am not sure if the convert is needed.  Check the data through General Table Maint. to be sure it is in c2 format....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 22:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Moved via the file system is just what I did - copied the definitions from the IVc4 server to my IVc2 server, imported the tables, and then put my IVc2 dd files back.<br />
<br />
I modified a record via maintain table def, as well as the actual session, and ran a report.  Everything worked great.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.</div></div><hr />
