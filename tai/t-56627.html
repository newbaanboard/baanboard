<br />
We ran into permission problem while setting up audit trail. The Baan manual says we need to create runtime audit definitions using the user root. But due to this the audits do not happen when users do transactions. The log file gives a permission error for the file audit_cols in lib directory. On close examination we found during create runtime the file audit_cols gets permission -rw-rw---- and owner as root. Root belongs to group sys. It looks like if I add user root also to the bsp group and do a create runtime, audits will get logged while users do transactions. Is this correct? Is it a general practice to add user root to the bsp group in Unix installations? My problem is whenever I use user root in Baan to do administration activity, I get into permission problems for other users later not just for audit trail alone. Usually we do any administration activity using the user bsp which is Infor's recommendation. However Infor recommends to use user root for audit set-up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srikarthy</div><div class="date">1st September 2009, 08:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the information. Now I have a general question. Is it dangerous to use the root login for doing any kind of administrative activities? Once I imported a patch using root and got into problem when other users used sessions related to that patch. I had to delete the object files manually and then re-install the patch. All those object files had root as the owner and permission -rw-rw----.<br />

For  wrongly created files u can change the file/directory ownership and permissions through chown / chmod (with -r option if required )  commands .<br />
<br />
Even binperm6.1 in porting set can help u correct permissions in $BSE/bin .</div></div><hr />

<br />
for example: if you made a patch objecets after system crash with user root, you can only work with user root!!!!</div></div><hr />
