<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TAAtic</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a simple query based on the tdsls045 table and would like to summarize it by year, keeping the details.  I created a date format for year and used that on the tdsls045.invd field.  I then used it in the layout as a before.field.  It returns the invoice date as a year.  However, it is not grouping properly because it still considers each invoice date unique.  So in actuality, it really is not converting the date to a year.  Can anyone offer any guidance.<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

Two alternatives on top of my head now<br />
 Keep working on your customised report. What you have to do is find the year number in the program script, not report script. Do this calculation before sending the data to the report engine. Then in the report spec, you set the year number as the first sort method, then it will be grouped properly<br />
 Use sales statistics. This is a small data mart module for sales activities. Because you extract data from your sales activities to cubes here, it's much faster to produce large sales report,eg total sales deliveries per product line per year for the last 5 years. Much faster<br />
