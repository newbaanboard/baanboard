<br />
I am not a BAAN Admin. i am a BAAN user. and new to BAAN.<br />
<br />
i have few question about BAAN test and production server. <br />
<br />
* in my company, we have test server, and we are not using it for any work. in production server only we do all our changes like updating BOM's codes, edit BOM's. etc...<br />
my idea, we have to work all projects in test server and admin has to move the data from test server to production server.<br />
Reason want to work in test server, this will help us to prepare all our work before our projects effective date.<br />
but my admin said pushing data from test server to production server its not possible. <br />
can any one suggest this can be done in BAAN and what are the steps we have to follow for that.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure how you would keep everything in sync.  Can you do it - sure - not easy when it is selective data you want to move.   I have used exchange schemes and table dumps to recover a small portion of data for a specific table,  I would not recommend this and we even have a simulation company so the users can see what would happen with changes, but then they still have to manually make them in production.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If its a recurring activity and is consuming your important time every month/week/day, then you will need to prepare a case for a new program development and get it approved. This new program will be used to to import required data into LN production environment. I assume you already have a development team with you who can get this done for you. (If its possible through coding)</div></div><hr />
