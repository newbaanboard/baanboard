<br />
I have to set authorization on Price lists,  and I was asked to assign separate access to &quot;sales&quot; price lists from &quot;purchase&quot; price lists to different users.<br />
Price lists codes are totally mixed, so there is no way to filter sales/purchase basing on price list code  (using Table data Authorization), so I was thinking of using the Price List attribute called &quot;module&quot; , an enumerate which can be set to &quot;sales&quot; or &quot;purchase&quot;. The problem is that attribute sales/purchase is on table tdpcg011, while price lists are on table tdpcg031. <br />
<br />
I am quite sure there isn't a way to set a table data authorization based on a value which is set on another table, so I was wondering if someone has ever found out another simple way to do it.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
use session ttams3146m000. With this session you can assign authorizations for tablefield values.<br />

thanks for the reply, but I don't know how it is possible to set a filter on a field, based on the value of another field in another table.<br />
My requirement is : filter only prices (on table tdpcg031) when the price list has mode &quot;sales&quot; (on table tdpcg011).<br />
I don't know if there is a way to do this using session ttams3146 or any other ttams session.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, now I know what you mean. I think you can resolve this problem only with customizing in the program script of the session. You have to check which company was switched at starting the session and than you have to set the filter with query.extend... functions or with sql statement in the program script section before.display.object.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">1st March 2011, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">In ERP LN you can add field level authorizations where you could have the following scenario... You want two groups of users to open the same table the same company but you want one group of users to only see regular POs and another group of users only see EDI orders. It is possible. Think of the same scenario where you let one group of users open as session and only be aware of certain jobs they can run and another group of users open the same session and only see records that match an opposite or specific criteria, and so on... If you open an incident in infor365 support can give you a solution with detailed steps on how to do that. I can tell you it can be done with table field authorizations in the authorizations module.</div></div><hr />

I understand what you are saying, but I think that in this case the problem is merely technical. In our Company we often use the data field authorization, in some other cases like the ones you were describing (i.e.: a group of our users see only a subset of Sales /Purchase Orders, while another group see a different subset, and so on).  BUT, in these situations the filter is put on the same table where you extract the data (i.e : filter SLS Orders headers where the order type is &quot;XXX&quot; , and the Order Type field is on SLS header table).<br />
In my situation, I need to filter data from table A, but the field to put the filter on  is on table B !<br />
I think , as Michael confirmed, this kind of filter cannot be set using the standard AMS tools.</div></div><hr />
