We do have several hundred users which has the same configuration on the clientside, but just a couple which gets this error. I've tried to upgrade the webtop to latest release and also installed java 6.21, but no luck.<br />
<br />
Anyone here know's why this is happening for just these few users and not the other ones?</div></div><hr />
