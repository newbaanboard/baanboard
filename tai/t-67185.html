<br />
Below is the brief of the problem we are facing:<br />
<br />
Baan 4c4 installed with SP33 and translation pack installed till 22 for Simplified Chinese <br />
Itâ€™s a multy byte installation with DB collation as Chinese_PRC_BIN<br />
We are able to login in English and all function working properly.<br />
But when we login with user language as Chinese most of the menus are not opening (found missing menus, and menu fields in o language, and even labels are also missing for the session which are opening).<br />
In this setup we have already created all the required package combination, VRCs, and companies and data of these companies is also migrated using seq dump, which is working in English language.<br />
If there is a way to correct it please suggest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
