<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">22nd March 2002, 23:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep seeing the following error in our log.filter file. <br />
<br />
Log_mesg: Barcode script '..../lib/barcode/hplj4/type10' not found or executable<br />
<br />
When I contact the users, they are not aware of any problems or errors. The directory obviously contains barcoding fonts support and all that's in there is a type01.<br />
<br />
My question is, what is generating this error message and how (and where) do I change a type10 to a type01?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">25th March 2002, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Francesco,<br />
<br />
barcode printing is actually done in Baan in a very primitive way:<br />
<br />
If a report specifies to print a barcode, then it specifies also the barcode type, which is just a number. When printing, the filfter6.1 looks in the printer driver to find the barcode directory and in this directory looks for a script called &quot;type&quot; + NUMBER.<br />
<br />
If the script is not there or not executable, then the filter6.1 will write your log message and will just skip the barcode.<br />
If the script is there, then filter6.1 will execute it, whith the barcode as a parameter.<br />
<br />
So obviously in your case, the challenge is to find the report, which tries to print barcode &quot;10&quot;. Maybe this is just a mistake and it should be barcode type &quot;01&quot;?<br />
<br />
If you just want top get rid of the log message, then just copy type01 to type10 or create an empty script.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
I already had copied type01 to type10 but that didn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it executable for group bsp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">It was not, but then neither was script01 (fixed that).<br />
<br />
In the mean time I managed to trace the report, by comparing the log.filter6.2 to the device queue.<br />
<br />
The report (customized, developer unknown) uses barcodes in the footer.<br />
All I can tell from the script and lay-out is that it uses a domain called barcode.20 (also custom). Nowhere is a mention of type01 or type10.<br />
<br />
Since these scripts are in a printer 'specific' directory (.../hplj4/), shouldn't I be searching in that direction and maybe change something in the bwprint set-up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">28th March 2002, 05:35</div></div><div class="posttext">For the offending field, take a look at the 'Font/ Barcode' attributes in the Maintain Report Fields. Is the Barcode field filled in with a 10?<br />
<br />
Thereafter, the corrective actions depend on what is the requirement. You can change it to 1 or 0 or simply delete the field.</div></div><hr />
