However there are things you can do to find suspicious processes at least.<br />
<br />
I was wondering what ideas you guys have for this but before asking for them let me share my imperfect system.<br />
<br />
This is for UX (gotta think about windows but that will come later)<br />
Check for cumulative cpu time 3 times in a row separated by 2 seconds. If the last 2 checks show cumulative cpu time increase compared to the previous check then it is looking like the process used a cpu 50% of the time or more. As I said it might not mean anything but it is at least suspicious.<br />
The check can be repeated after a sleep of say 2, 3 or maybe 5 minutes. If you have a second hit for the same process then... it is only more suspicious that's all.<br />
<br />
Please send your ideas and thoughts.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much,<br />
