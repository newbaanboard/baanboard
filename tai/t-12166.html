<br />
I want to know what is the best practice on Audit. What are the tables which are critical and are to be auditted. I have a audit management system but i think i am missing some tables which should be included to make it more secure &amp; auditable.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you suggest?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">14th July 2003, 03:44</div></div><div class="posttext">There are about 40 tables which need to be audited and are manditory for Baan to run.  You will see these if you look at Maintain tables by Database and see that most of those are parameter tables.<br />
<br />
Other tables that should be audited are totally up to your descretion.  Uusally auditing is only done to facilitate data exchange (i.e. using exchange with audit).   I have been at over 40 clients, and none used auditing as a security measure or needed to keep a handle on what fields changed and by whom.<br />
<br />
If you really need to audit tables to ensure some users do not modify data unwittingly, there are other methods of appling security by session, company, table, field or field data by value which can be used.  You will find that functionality in authorizations,<br />
<br />
I would look at auditing at a last resort since it can produce a lot of log data and can slow down your system if you audit too many tables.  I would only use audit in concert with exchange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsteenwi</div><div class="date">14th July 2003, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes the accountancy-companies, the ones who actually &quot;audit&quot; another company, have specific data-types prescribed that must be audited. For example banktransitions. So there are three criteria to consider when you implement your audit-trail:<br />
<br />
<br />
 BaaN<br />
As already mentioned: a number of tables must be audited, otherwise BaaN won't run at all.<br />
<br />
 Accountancy<br />
Accountants wish to be able to see (most of the time annual) reports of who changed specific data. The list of tables to be audited should therefore be discussed with the specific accountancy-company.<br />
<br />
 Own wishes<br />
Which data is crucial for your specific company? This will differ per company, ofcourse.<br />

<br />
U7795AUS - Tools Technical Manual.pdf<br />
<br />
It should be located on your documentation CD or try to get it from the BaaN Support site.<br />
<br />
Tools Technical Manual<br />
General<br />
This chapter introduces the audit management facility provided with BaanERP<br />
Tools from Version 6.0 onward. It describes the audit server, the audit<br />
management utility, and where audit-data is stored. It also describes the structure<br />
of the audit files and how to give users permissions to print, maintain, or clean<br />
audit-data.<br />
<br />
There should be a similar document for your BaaN version.</div></div><hr />
