For my user (bsp, text interface), I use .profile to set $BSE_TMP <br />
<br />
but for users that use BW, how I do for change this simple parameters?.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I wrote wrong my questions....<br />
<br />
Which is the default file for users that they doesn't write anything on his *.bwc?<br />
<br />
I've one server, with two BaaN applications, for two differents factories (two diferents binaries too).<br />
a) $BSE=/prod/baan/bse<br />
b) $BSE=/baan/B40c/bse<br />
<br />
and actually I've for both Baan's $BSE_TMP=/tmp<br />
and I want to separate this with out modify the 103 *.bwc, due to the users are in differents countries...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">27th August 2005, 00:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You could also try using $BSE/lib/bse_vars<br />
and setting BSE_TMP in there, that file is selective though and may<br />
or may not pick it up.<br />
<br />
You could Remove your $BSE/tmp directory and create a symbolic link to the new directory. <br />
<br />
Not really reccomended though, a lot of adding and deleting goes on in that directory.. too much of a chance for Baan to step on itself..<br />

<br />
The cleanest way of doing it, is the following:<br />
<br />
1) Change the ipc_info in $BSE/lib entry for bshell to point to a self written small script.<br />
<br />
2) In this script set all environment variables you need, maybe even depending on your hostname odr username).<br />
<br />
3) At the end of the script call<br />
exec $BSE/bin/bshell6.1 $*<br />
<br />
The procedure is described several times here on the board, just search for ipc_info. This approach is perfect, because both ASCII and GUI users will automatically use it, it is completely server based, no bwc entries etc.<br />
<br />
You can also use it to implement features like password aging, blocking the application for specific user groups, avoiding double logins etc.<br />
<br />
Man possibilities,<br />

Be careful if you use BaanLogin protocol, all BSE_TMP using it defined in rc.start_blogind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">What's effective in rc.start is only effective for the processes started in there:<br />
<br />
shared memory timer<br />
licence daemon<br />
printer daemon<br />
bisam<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
It will not effect the user processes. Wether the environment of blogind is inherited by the bshell processes is a interesting idea. Did somebody actually test this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Refer to Jim's posting - Environment Variables (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=446&amp;highlight=environment) <br />
<br />
2. I think Markus idea will work as you can control the log files for all the users.<br />
<br />
3. Whether the environment of blogind is inherited by the bshell processes is a interesting idea. Did somebody actually test this?<br />
Yes. We have 3-5 different environments on a single Unix machine. If you have only one Blogin daemon per system, then it picks up all the environment variables belonging to the one you started up. Its more obviously visible if you define your own env variables in $BSE/lib/bse_vars (Refer to my #1 posting).<br />
Therefore, we have 3-5 blogin daemons, running for each environment so that even if you bring down one environment (the one which has started the blogin daemon) the others can still work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joshua_ke</div><div class="date">2nd September 2005, 03:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We have multiple BaanIV and V environments on the same server, and they can share the same blogind(port 7150.) We realized this because BaanV users generate big tmp file filled on BaanIV enviroment as we started blogind from BaanIV. You can login 2nd env. and echo $BSE_TMP which is the same as defined in rc.start_blogind.</div></div><hr />
