2.The other one is installed in B40C_c4_m610, this PVRC is derived from Baan standard sp10.For this, select option 2.<br />
I check the file system.Take td module as an example, Components under tdB40C_c4_m610 has much more components than tdB40C_c4_m600.<br />
<br />
But compare PVRCs(ttadv6450 Compare Package VRC's) for td(PVRC1: B40C_c4_m600;PVRC2:B40C_c4_m610), and &quot;No data is selected&quot;.This means components in these two are no different.<br />

Could anybody explain something!!!  :confused: :confused:</div></div><hr />

From the screen shot you sent - <br />
<br />
1. Only forms or menus of the VRC itself.<br />
--&gt; Only the forms or menus given in the VRC ranges are dumped/compiled.<br />
<br />
2. Only forms or menus where labels or messages have been changed.<br />
--&gt; This is the general recommended option by BaaN. <br />
<br />
3. All forms or menus <br />
--&gt; all the forms or menus  along the parent VRCs are dumped/compiled to the current VRC or  VRC specified.<br />
<br />
I will add more notes tomm from work after referring to my notes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">27th September 2002, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I will try to give some explanation. <br />
In most cases if you want to customize a form by adding/changing fields or field properities you copy the form to derived VRC level and do the changes. But if you want only to change a label text, you dont have to copy whole form, but you may only copy a label and change it. In that case your form does not exist in derived VRC, only label does.<br />
So, if you create RDD with option 1, that form will not be dumped and you will stil see old label text. But if you choose option 2, system will check for such situations and the form will be dumped. More, if you change a label present on many forms, all of them will be dumped automatically with option 2.<br />
The same is valid for report layouts of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks!<br />
Now although I am not understanding it very clearly, but it make more sense, and more detailed than the explanation on Baan's help<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Here are more notes from the BaaN manuals -<br />
<br />
 Dumps <br />
Type or Select how you want to create the forms and menus in the run-time data dictionary. You have the following options <br />
<br />
 Only forms/menus in VRC   to create the forms and menus of the specified VRC in the same VRC.<br />
<br />
 New labels/messages  to dump the forms and menus of previous package VRCs, if the labels or messages are changed in the derived from VRC.<br />
<br />
 All forms/menus  to dump all forms and menus of previous package VRCs, even if the labels or messages are not changed in the derived from VRC.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps you out. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">1st October 2002, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">May I add to DON'T use option 3. This leaves a mess of forms dumps from previous VRC's into your selected VRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">1st October 2002, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Victor's right.... the preferred option is 2. <br />
<br />
That option was built so the tools programs gain performance with the vrc search algorithms for menus/forms-dumps/objects.<br />
<br />
But if you have multi-level package combinations and users being linked to different package combinations then its better to use the 2nd option than 3rd.<br />
<br />
More info...<br />
<br />
<br />
One source of a form / menu may have dumps (objects) in more VRCs         <br />
Example: the form                                                          <br />
tf acp1100m0001  VRC 30 b may have a form dump in tf 30 b, in tf 30 b cust and in tf 30 c, where 30 b cust and 30 c are derived from 30 b                         <br />
<br />
The reason why you may have a form dump generated from a form of a &quot;previous&quot; VRC, is that labels / messages used on that form may change in the &quot;derived from&quot; VRC                                          <br />
<br />
The reason why you may have a menu dump generated from a menu of a &quot;previous&quot; VRC, is that labels / session descriptions used on that menu may change in the &quot;derived from&quot; VRC <br />
<br />
Example: form tf acp1100m0001 VRC 30 b has a label tfacp000xxxx which has been changed in 30 c The change of this label becomes only visible after dumping the form to a 30 c form dump EXPLANATION POSSIBLE OPTIONS                                               <br />
<br />
1 = Dump only forms/menus in the specified VRC to form dumps in the same VRC  <br />
Example: You specify to dump the forms of package &quot;tf&quot;, &quot;30 &quot;, &quot;b &quot;, &quot;cust&quot;: only the forms in that VRC will be dumped to dumps in the same VRC <br />
<br />
2 = Dump also forms/menus of previous VRCs, when labels or messages have been changed <br />
Example: You specify to dump the forms of package &quot;tf&quot;, &quot;30 &quot;, &quot;b &quot;, &quot;cust&quot;: also forms of previous VRCs will be dumped to dumps of VRC  &quot;30 &quot;, &quot;b &quot;, &quot;cust&quot;, when labels or messages have been changed in this VRC (see before)<br />
<br />
3 = Dump all forms/menus of previous VRCs, even if labels or messages have not been changed A reason to use this option may be to increase the performance of the system: all forms/menus are present on the first level, so the bshell will always find the form / menu dump straight away.<br />
You are recommended to use option 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mwolfere</div><div class="date">2nd October 2002, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">If option 3 is used you can clean the mess with session ttadv3262m000 for menus and ttadv3205m000 for forms.<br />
<br />
The possibilities in the session RDD forms and menus are also available for reports ttadv3240m000 and scripts ttadv2230m000. This mess can be cleaned with the sessions ttadv3236m000 and ttadv2239m000.<br />

<br />
So as mentioned, all forms and menus were compiled with the option all forms/menus, resulting in lots of undesired form/menu dumps in our own customization vrc's. I ran the sessions ttadv3205m000 &amp; ttadv3262m000 to clean up that mess. This worked for a large part of the dumps, but many are still there and running those sessions does not help a thing for those. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have an idea?<br />

<br />
There might have been label changes, which changed the dump size so they might not have been deleted.<br />
<br />
Try to run ttadv6450m000 (Compare P-VRC's) for Labels to check if you have any label changes.</div></div><hr />
