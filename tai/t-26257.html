I have to create some normal users in BaaN. They all have the same system login user &quot;testusr&quot; so the command &quot;-- -set USER=newusr1&quot; is used in the BW configuration.<br />
&quot;testusr&quot; is also defined in the ora_users file so that group, authorizathions and privilegies are already defined. The line in ora_users is like that:<br />
testusr:bsp:UN.......:baan<br />
<br />
Now the question is: the normal user &quot;newusr1&quot; can acces BaaN? The answer is no because of the error 514 &quot;Security error: probably no permission&quot;.<br />
So this means that in ora_users must be present the line:<br />
newusr1:oracle_user_used_for_testusr:password:group.<br />
To add a new user ora8_maint6.1 can be used, but what about the password? encrypt6.1 can be used, but how does it work?<br />
I must confess that my hope was it was no due to add new oracle user as the system login user was already defined as an oracle user, but I wasn't right.<br />
I 've just read the threads in the Board concerning BaaN user creation and I found that the use of sessions in Tools&gt; Database Management&gt; Miscell &gt;RDBMS is suggested, but the platform in use is on LINUX so that  this part isn't present.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
shouldn't be testusr but newuser1<br />
<br />
The mapping is<br />
&lt;baan user&gt;:&lt;database user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;:&lt;group&gt;<br />
<br />
testusr is your system user<br />
newuser1 is your baan user.<br />
