I have a scheme that exports based on table-audit, but a range for the export does not have an any effect. I generated the export program with debug and checked that the range goes to the export program correct into &quot;where&quot;.<br />
<br />
Baan IV's help does mention something about that conditions does not apply when using export based on audit. What about range and in LN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">11th August 2011, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you enable the range in the Batch? When you create a Range for an export scheme it does not automatically become active for that batch. Check first on the batch or table relations export whether your range is active. Then recompile the scheme and try again. I do not see why it shouldn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jvp123</div><div class="date">12th August 2011, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes the Range is active. I complied the export program in debug-mode and checked the script, and found the range criteria in the where-clause. Still it exports records out side of the range.<br />
<br />
I tested the export without &quot;based on audit&quot; and then it functioned perfectly. Only got records from within the range.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">26th August 2011, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I used to be the Infor exchange expert up to a couple weeks ago. I would request that they attempt to replicate it and get an explanation from development. I have no access to that solution at the moment but I could look and see if it was a solution created by myself or someone else.</div></div><hr />

Just out of curiosity, &quot;No&quot; to what? :)</div></div><hr />
