<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy.Gray</div><div class="date">7th July 2009, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We are migrating from Baan IV to LN. <br />
We have a single logistic/multi finance setup. <br />
In LN we will have company 100 setup as both Logistic and Finance, the other four companies will be Finance only, pointing to company 100 as the Logistics company. <br />
Do I need to share all of the Logistics tables in company 100 with each of the Finance companies (as in Baan IV) ? <br />
I have been told both that the tables don't need to be shared and also that they do.......I'm hoping for a more definitive answer.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I tested, if you don't share the logistic tables, the &quot;create table&quot; session will create them for each and every of your finance companies. So, you end up with a lot of tables in the database that will never be used but eat up space (twothousandsomething tables for each company!). <br />
<br />
Another thing I would recommend is to use the table sharing modeller. It's a little effort to get used to it, but afterwards new company numbers are easily integrated and it' not so error-prone as doing everything by hand. There you should also find some predefinied table sets telling you which of the finance(!) tables you will have to share<br />

Hope that helps<br />
