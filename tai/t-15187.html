<br />
We have the following situation:<br />
<br />
                                     B50_c<br />
                                     |<br />
                  ---------------------------------<br />
                  |                             |<br />
              B50U_c_stnd                  B50U_c_sp10<br />
<br />
                   |                             |<br />
              B50C_c_cus1                  B50C_c_cus2<br />
<br />
<br />
We used B50U_c_stnd to install the SP's (from above 10 to 14). B50U_c_sp10 is the old standard. &quot;cus2&quot; are the old custs. cus1 is used to merge corrections from the solutions to our custs.<br />
<br />
<br />
During installation of SP's run different  correction programs. It seems the correction programs change &quot;DATA&quot; in the tables. <br />
<br />
<br />
If we now copying our data from  the &quot;sp10&quot; part back to the &quot;stnd&quot; part, I fear we habe to run all the correction programms again ?</div></div><hr />

I don't really understand. what you mean<br />
while speaking of &quot;correction programms&quot;.<br />
I would like to advise you :<br />
Never modify the Baan-Standard without<br />
using the offical method pmc (e.g. copy software). You will run<br />
the risk of losing your complete software<br />
structure.<br />
E.g. not only tables but the structures of many tables are changed during the installation of a service pack..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">3rd May 2004, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">during installation of SP's Baan run certain programm's, which correct, if neccessary data, or things, if there are changes, for example in a table definition</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">18th May 2004, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess you may be talking about Post installations instructions. Last month we did loaded the SP12 on Baan5c and BaaN ask us to run the tfcor2245m000. First we ran this program in all companies linked with Standard VRC (where we loaded our SPs) and after that we did ran the same program in our Customized Package VRCs all companies also. (Because customized VRC is derived from the Standard VRC). Thats answers your question?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">19th May 2004, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it's a little bit more complicate. Like the from you mentioned program &quot;tfcor2245m000&quot; run more programs automatical during SP installation (I heard).<br />
<br />
If you install SP14 in a test-VRC, like we did, this programs run also in this VRC and correct DATA there. This test-VRC is actually B50U_c_stnd. The untouched old B50U_c_stnd is now called B50U_c_sp10. Within this VRC production is running.<br />
<br />
An other try: Before installation we copied the whole standard to B50U_c_sp10 where the users continue to work. In the B50U_c_stnd we install SP14. After testing the new SP we would like to copy just the data from B50U_c_sp10 to B50U_c_stnd. But we fear, that we will miss the corrections which are done from the programs mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Hope this is more clear!</div></div><hr />
