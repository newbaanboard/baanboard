 Would anyone have an idea as in how I can disable shell access for a user but at the same time allowing the user to boot to baan.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have a couple of options here:<br />
<br />
First of all you can set the user shell to 'None' in Maintain User Data but that doesn't really help in case of a Baan Super User<br />
<br />
Secondly you can make Baan 'auto start' from the .profile or alternative login profile for that user. Together with a trap command you can avoid the user breaking out into the UNIX shell<br />
<br />
Another option is to change the permission on the ottstpshell object but I am not really in favour of that.<br />
<br />
There will be more possibilities but my preference would #2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nancy Mathew</div><div class="date">18th June 2002, 21:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pat,<br />
 Could u elaborate on those</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">18th June 2002, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Any specifics you want to know Nancy?<br />
<br />
1) Check the session Maintain User Data, 2nd form (I think)<br />
<br />
2) With the .profile route you have endless options. You could e.g. set up a little ASCII menu to present the user at login time or simply start the ba6.1. For e.g. you could give the user the option to log into Baan and/or change the password.<br />
<br />
3) Make it bsp accessible only<br />
<br />
Another option I actually never tried myself is to define a false or restricted shell in the user definition in /etc/passwd. I would have to check if that holds up yes or no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can 3 check points -<br />
<br />
1. when a unix account is created, the administrator can specify no shell access.<br />
<br />
2. If you are using the worktop, you block the shell access from the drop down box where you type in !ksh -v by disabling that option from the user data.<br />
<br />
3. Instead of removing the permissions on Unix $BSE/tools for the shell programs, we implemented it from the role templates where we gave no authorizations to the sessions, ttstpshell and ttstpvtemul, ttstpvtemul_r, ttstpivtemul, ttstpivtemul_r (terminal emulator's).<br />
<br />
Now, our system is quite secure and the user's cannot log into the Unix, or shell access from BaaN too. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nancy Mathew</div><div class="date">18th June 2002, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
 I got that. We also have ksh -o vi disabled. but what we want is in option dialog when we do a start shell the &quot;normal user&quot; should not be able to go to shell. Is it also possible to do it for superusers? Also Pat u were saying something about auto start for baan in .profile can u discuss on that....<br />
<br />

<br />
The step-3 I mentioned stops the users to get into the shell from the option dialog. <br />
<br />
I dont think you can stop the superusers from using the shell access. But one possibility is that in Unix, if you have the users in a different group as the BSP then you can set 750 permissions on the $BSE/tools/../ottstp/ostpshell etc objects. The even if they are normal or super users they cannot execute that object.<br />
<br />
I am curious of Pat's idea of autostart option. I am guessing Pat's idea might work on the BaaN-4 ASCII series and not on the BaaN-5 series.<br />
<br />
But when a user logs into a BaaN environment, the user's .profile is not read/picked up. If the settings have to be invoked you have to use <br />
<br />
!ksh -c .profile<br />
<br />
So can you please let us know which version of BaaN are you using ? and maybe fill up your info in the profile that everyone can look up before they reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

  Could you specify the other setting u did other than session authorization by session. I still cant find any success.<br />
<br />
What I did was just added these sesison in &quot;session authorization by session&quot; with no authorization marked.<br />
<br />
But I can still access the shell thru option dialog (normal user)<br />
<br />
Its a Baan5.0b environment.<br />
<br />

<br />
I did the session authorizations by session. <br />
<br />
Did you convert to runtime DD, logged out and logged back in for the changes to be effective ?<br />
<br />
We are on BaaN-5.2 environment with Worktop etc.. So I do not have any option dialog box here to check up. I guess other might help you out.<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of the bw file which comes down on my start bar and the start shell is blocked.<br />
<br />
Another alternative is to find the session code of the &quot;option dialog&quot; session, and check the table ttadv314 for that button, &quot;Start shell&quot;, which has the session code to it and block that session in the role templates.</div></div><hr />
