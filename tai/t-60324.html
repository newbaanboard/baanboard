<br />
I know how to create a company in Venezuela... i know the steps.. but the thing is that this company is for another country (colombia), is there any special changes that i have to apply?? i dont know... do i have to change the VRC? or the application in some way?? or maybe the BaaN localization?? <br />
<br />
I need someone to explain to me, (like a 5 years old boy), what are the steps to create a company in this scenary...</div></div><hr />

<br />
teorically, you need to install colombian localizations,<br />
create new package combination, and then create the company.<br />
<br />
Check it with Infor support.<br />
