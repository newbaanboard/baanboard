i have a problem at a customer:<br />
we changed from a unix system to a windows server 2003.<br />
the customer have much Dot Matrix Printers for printing.<br />
at unix we have installed them as direkt printer (the driver from $BSE/lib/printif) was used, and the spool was sended via PCL escape sequences. Everything was fine...<br />
but now at the windows server, we have performance problems at printing. shure i know that windows dont print about pcl escape sequences, he user the pixel printing... it look like the printer is (painting *gg*)  i think you know what i mean.. now my problem is, is must get a solution for the problem, cause the printing is to slow..<br />
i tried it with the generic text only driver, but it dont look like verry well.. i also installed a linux printserver to spool the spools true this server and get a pcl escape sequence... but the linux pc also printing about pixel :-(<br />
<br />
a correct driver for a x64 system for the printers are dont avaliable.<br />
<br />
have anyone an idea? printserver ? driver ??? <br />
<br />
please help me !!!!</div></div><hr />

I would be quite keen to learn about any ideas on how to operate dot matrix printers under Windows OS like UNIX/LINUX in text mode rather than in the far too slow graphic mode.<br />
<br />
If anyone of you guys has an idea on how to achieve this - please post a reply.<br />
<br />
@HomerSimpson: As your post is now quite a while ago: How did you manage the issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
At least that's how we solved this before at other customers. Do you have a programmers manual available of the printer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kdhagemann</div><div class="date">24th May 2011, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Han, thanks a lot for the info!<br />
<br />
I did some tests with the driver &quot;Generic / Text Only&quot;. It allows to specify ESC sequences for Job-init and -exit plus some ESC sequences for font sizes and -styles. Problem is that using this generic driver the whole text-formatting as specified in the report is lost (&quot;Text only&quot;). Means for our invoices/packing slips etc: No bold font, one font-size only, etc. :(<br />
<br />
Just a thought:<br />
If I would be able to generate a textfile having all the required ESC sequences (ie. like specified in $BSE/lib/printinf/i/ibm_pro) it would may be possible to output this file by a shellscript to the printer queue on the server...? Propably ttstpconv opens some doors here? <br />
<br />
Backgrounder: We are using 7 OKI Dotmatirx Printers with tons of pre-printed stationery (fanfold)...<br />
<br />
Would be glad for any ideas in this matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you already get support involved in this? I understand that you are quite dependend on these printers ...<br />
And the printer supplier? Are they not willing to deliver you a driver? Or do they have only 32-bit drivers?<br />
<br />
Would have been more easier if you sticked to unix or went for Linux (which is quite popular in Germany). <br />
<br />
What version are you running? ERP-LN or BaaNIV?<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

For some reasons Linux is considered as being &quot;stoneage&quot; in some minds.<br />
<br />
Support told me there are known issues with Matrix printers on a Windows server. Hm - that helps.<br />
<br />
I am a little step further:<br />
The issue seems to be located in bwprint.exe on the Windows server. Found the way to change the settings of bwprint for all users (registry; HKLM) - now I have to find a way on how to use/set the device internal fonts, as printing with those is by far faster than pixel-graphic-mode. Will post further findings here, if of interest.<br />
<br />
Our Version is IVc4_SP25 (currently on SLES10.2, soon Win2K8R2).<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
