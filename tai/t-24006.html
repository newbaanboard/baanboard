Until now I have linked users to one role only that this has worked very well for authorisations etc. I now need to give many of these roles access to  viewing inventory in all warehouses not just their local warehouses. I tried adding an additional role which had read only access to data but it appeared to open up all data for update. Therefore how should the multiple role linking work if at all? Can it be used to help me in the above scenario.<br />
thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />
