I have seen a few  instances where data from BaaN IV to ERP Ln have been migrated. But that all is restricted to Master Data and Open Transcations.<br />
But all the way I have been trying to find instances where full data Migration has happend with all transactions (fully Processed ,Semi Processed &amp; Completly open transactions).<br />
<br />
Has any body having information of such instances?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thnaks In Advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been involved in many BaanIV to ERPLN migrations with with different scenarios. A &quot;full&quot; migration is definitely one of the options to migrate almost all data(there are exceptions), including transactions and history data. In december last year we migrated Ferrari from their baanIVc2 environment to ERPLN FP7 with open production/sales/purchase orders. <br />
<br />
Please note that when you want to change your setup/way of working in ERPLN, it is oftern advised to do a masterdata migration.<br />
<br />
