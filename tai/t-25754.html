Oracle 8.0<br />
Win2K server<br />
Company 111 - main company (logistic+finance)<br />
Company 122 - financial company <br />
Company 133 - financial company<br />
<br />
We have a live and test server, which were both running ok, without problems. I realise now, that we have a problem on our test system: when zooming to a field using logistic tables from within a finance session in company 122, we get an error 506 &quot; Table does not exist &quot;.<br />
<br />
Example: in session tfcmg4120s000 (direct debit advices) on second form the field debiter's bank (table tccom115), when zooming to select the bank via session tccom4515m100, error 506 and fatal error &quot; cannot continue in tccom4515m100 &quot;<br />
<br />
This happens only in the test system, not the live. This test server is running since about 1.5 years. I cannot say for 100% sure that the problem didn't exist in the past, since normally we test in the main company 111, which doesn't have this problem.<br />
<br />
The logical tables seem ok. When I call the logistic tables via GTM for comany 122, it works fine without any error.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me with this? <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance!<br />

Check if the logistcs companies by finance companies are correctly set. (session tfgld0100m000)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th November 2005, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually our configuration works fine for over 5 years already. It is just that on our test server something must have gotten messed up...<br />
<br />
The logistic companies by finance companies are alright...<br />
<br />
Anyone different idea?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that be the case  ,restore this file from backup and c if the error still comes.</div></div><hr />

However, it seems that when migrating to higher service pack, only existing tables were created for the financial companies, but the new added tables (/fields) were not created...... (??!!)<br />
<br />
After create tables for all tables in company 122, the problem was solved.</div></div><hr />
