<br />
I was wondering if anyone has experienced any issues with Baan printing from a client with Windows 7 (64 BIT).<br />
<br />
We have found that all OS levels of Windows up to Windows 7 (32 BIT) work fine and use the defined font settings (custom user fonts/Baan stnd).  However, we have select few users that get totally different font settings results from the Windows 7 (64 BIT) system.<br />
<br />
In all cases the font is larger than the Baan defined, as well as, the font spacing is larger.  This results in some information that should have printed on the page doesn't print.  It doesn't auto move what it couldn't fit to the next page either.  Some users may not realize that they are only seeing a portion of their report data.<br />
<br />
We currently have our database and app server running on virtual machines with SQL 2008 and Windows Server 2008.  I've updated my BW client to the latest version available (103).  We run Baan IV c4 NAS0 w/SP19 as our last service pack loaded.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Infor has introduced a new parameter to scale the output onto the selected page-format, when printing with bwprint.exe:<br />
<br />
 -set WINFONTCORR=1<br />
<br />
Using this setting the output will fit on the selected pageformat. (It will even scale a landmark output to fit on a normal page.)<br />
<br />
I havn't check wether this works on BaanIV but Infor KB 699923 lists it for BannIVc and BaanIVb, too.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

Thank you for your reply.  I did try the setting, but it didn't seem to make any difference. <br />
<br />
What I've learned since logging my thread is that there is a separate directory for 64 Bit machines in the registry settings called Wow6432Node.  It's there that it appears to be holding my setting when I set the fonts manually.  <br />
<br />
So, I have my machine working now.  My current problem is that even though I export the settings and then import them into another system with 64 Bit it doesn't find the changes.<br />
<br />
I'll make sure to update this thread when we do finally figure this out as I'm sure others will encounter the same issues at some point.  <br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
