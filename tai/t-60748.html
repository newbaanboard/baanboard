<br />
I'm trying to setup a Baan IV test installation on a new server. I'm trying to export the User &amp; Device Data from the live system using ttcon61export<br />
<br />
I put all the details in, including the output file name and path and say yes to everything but it always stops with the following error:<br />
<br />
Fatal error: Illegal shell (&quot;test -d D:\baan\tmp\Users.dmp 2&gt; D:/baan/tmp/tmp058752080&quot;,0)<br />
<br />
The baan tmp folder exists.<br />
<br />
I've tries the slashes the other way round.<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 2003 Server with BaanIVc4 SP 27 and Porting Set 6.1C10<br />
<br />
I've seen this before but can't remember for the life of me what the solution was.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help please?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

See solution 22874658 in Infor365 for a newer version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mlahey</div><div class="date">24th June 2011, 13:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I've managed to solve this one. The tools SP level on this server is 27 however it was built with a batch installer up to SP 23, with the later SPs installed from the PMC dumps.<br />
<br />
The patch in solution 22847658 is actually 205413, which was delivered as part of the SP20 tools dump.<br />
<br />
The new server was built the same way, with the batch installer, but hadn't had any data imported so I had a test bed to experiment on.<br />
<br />
The new server exhibited the same behaviour as the production system, throwing the error when I tried to export the data.<br />
<br />
My fist thought was that the batch installer hadn't written the object files into the tools folder correctly as there was no user range selection on the export screen.<br />
<br />
However looking at the time stamps on the object file in the tools folder showed that the batch installer did replace the object file and it roughly matched the time the tools dump was installed.<br />
<br />
However it seems to have installed an incorrect version of the object file into the tools folder. I guess infor put the wrong object into the tools batch installer.<br />
<br />
I couldn't import the patch from solution 22874658 as the PMC registry said it had already been delivered as part of SP20.<br />
<br />
I therefore used GTM to change the status of the entry in ttpmc201 for solutuion 205413 to Available. I then deleted the entry from ttpmc150 that linked the solution with SP20. <br />
<br />
I then scanned the standalone solution 205413stnd with overwrite checked into PMC, to load the patch into the PMC dump directory.<br />
<br />
I then checked and installed 205413 and everything now works.<br />
<br />
I copied the object over to the live system tools directory and it works correctly on there too.</div></div><hr />
