<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">1st June 2004, 00:10</div></div><div class="posttext">There was an ealier post (2 years ago) about the possibility of starting QBF automatically in a session.  While there were lots of posts about other suggestions, I am interested in the original though and how QBF communicates with the session.  I would like to create a display session that is sorted on a non indexed field.  <br />
<br />
I am on BAAN IV so I can not use the extend query feature for sort order (don't remember the exact name right now), I can't add an index to the table as that is a policy our company has adopted (which I agree 100% with) - and I would rather not add a new table that I fill every time a user starts the session with a copy of all of my inventory data just to have an index available to use.<br />
<br />
I will be creating the session so I will have the ability to code - if I knew what the variables that QBF used, I think I could set them to acheive what I need.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

session ttadv2100m000 just write the startup choice as 46 - query . It will start the QBF . <br />
<br />
Further in the 2nd form of ttstpqbf there is sort sequence which u can use to sort the session <br />
on non-indexed field even in descending mode.<br />
<br />
As to  the communication with main session , I guess the it must be using dynamic query <br />
and storing the compiled sql ids (next , prev , first , last etc)  in the sql ids of <br />
main session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">1st June 2004, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I will be creating a new session as there is not one there with the layout that I need.  I see the advantage to setting the start option to 46 to get part of the way, but as the user wants to sort by date EVERY time, I would like to just set the arguments.  Anybody ever tried AFS on the QBF session   :eek: <br />

Thanks for the response<br />
