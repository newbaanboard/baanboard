<br />
I am working on a project where we want to use a mobile computer/scanner (i.e. Falcon 4400 series) to do inventory movements within Baan.  <br />
<br />
What I want to do is create a smaller version of the Enter Inventory Transactions session (I have this already) that will be accessed via the user using this mobile computer/scanner.  There will be some fields they will scan directly into the Baan field.  Or, this is what I want to do.  I do not want to store the data up on the gun and then download it.  I want the wireless mobile computer/scanner to do it all. <br />
<br />
The issue we are having is getting Baan on the gun.  I'm not on the admin side, but I've been told that terminal emulation should work.  The gun has Windows CE on it, which is not supported from Infor (Baan).  We just don't know how we need to set this up even just to try it.  It seems like it should be a simple thing, but it's becoming quite a struggle to get information on terminal emulation from Infor.  We currently are attempting to see if we can get a java version downloaded on the gun that may allow us to access Baan via the Webtop URL, but again new territory.  If anyone has done this we'd love to hear how.<br />
<br />
We have Baan IVc4 NAS0 sp19 on an Itanium Windows OS, database SQL system.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone use a scanner this way?  If so, can you direct my group with how we might be able to get this to work.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

This could be used with a Windows Terminal Server to support multiple desktops from one server. <br />
<br />
You can also do a search here, seem there was a Web based Baan client interface being developed awhile back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the easy way (telnet client on the &quot;gun&quot; starting ascii interface on the server) doesn't work on your machine, as you lack the ascii interface on M$.<br />
Besides generally advising you to think of dropping the NT machine (in favour of a linux system :-), I would think that the following should be possible:<br />
<br />
Version A: You only want to write to Baan. <br />
Write a standalone program on CE enabling you to scan barcodes and quantities.<br />
Then transfer the data read to your server (via ftp) and process it by reading the data with the session you already created.<br />
<br />
Version B: You have to read Baan data too.<br />
Try to lay hands on an odbc driver for the handheld so that you can connect to the Baan database. (The processing of the data entered into the &quot;gun&quot; will still be handled like in Version A!!)<br />
<br />
Version C: You really, really need to start the Baan session on the handheld.<br />
Get webtop running. This should be possible, but I haven't done it so far.<br />
