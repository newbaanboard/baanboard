The thing is then you print a report to Winprinter (bwprint) and check &quot;printpreview&quot; checkbox, then a report appears on screen. But the session is fully locks until the report is closed.<br />
It was before and now it returns after we install last Service Pack (25) and Portingset (19).<br />
<br />
I searched throught Infor knowledegbase, and got only one note, that maybe it depends on &quot;silent mode&quot; which is used before and changed to normal in 19 servicepack in order to fix another problem.<br />
<br />
How to unlock sessions without closing reports? How to run bwprint in silence mode?</div></div><hr />
