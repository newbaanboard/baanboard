System is validated, application is working fine. However if I try to compile my reports I get errors telling me that e.g. true, false and functions like spool.line() are not defined.<br />
<br />
I have installed the latest includes but that didn't solved the problem. Looks like my include folder is not found/considered.<br />
<br />
Anyone having some clue what's wrong?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">2nd February 2005, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">The files in include6.1 are a bit crypted, but they have a line-by-line structure. So I could imagine, that your copying was a ftp? If so, did you use ascii or binary mode? You get the idea?<br />
<br />
Another test: try to compile something like &quot;#include &lt;invalid&gt;&quot;. That gives on my system lines like &quot;${BSE_REM}!${BSE}/include6.1/invalid: No such file or directory&quot;. So maybe you should have a look ath these two environment variables, and on directory and file permissions?<br />
