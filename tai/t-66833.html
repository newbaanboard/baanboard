<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">9th September 2014, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We are at a point where users are beginning to receive 'no more licenses available for bshell' messages.  This started back in January, but I instituted the use of the Session Timeout functionality (set to 25 minutes) and that has bought us about 8 month's worth of time.  <br />
<br />
Due to growth, we anticipate that we will indeed need to purchase licensing, but are unable to acquire additional licensing at this time.<br />
<br />
Now we are at the same crossroads.  We have made the following requests to our users:<br />
<br />
1.	Log out of Baan when you are not using it.  Please do not try to ”protect” your current session by not logging out of Baan when you do not need to be in the system.  Please do not log into Baan more than one time.<br />
2.	If you are not required to be in Baan all day for your particular job, please try to access Baan during off-peak times when possible.<br />
3.	If you use Baan only for periodic reporting or data gathering, please contact me.  IT may have alternative methods to provide this data without requiring you to use Baan directly.<br />
4.	Please refrain from sending an email blast to all users asking for them to log out of Baan.  Assume users are following the above guidelines and recognize that these email blasts are disruptive to the majority of users.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While doing some research, I noted that SLM's default 'Confirm Time' is 15 minutes.  We have several batch jobs which run frequently (some every 5 or 10 minutes) for processing data.  Depending on timing, these licenses may not be released as timely because of the Confirm Time.  KB 1023275 does not recommend changing the default to check/release licenses sooner because of the amount of network traffic it could impose.  I am not a network admin so the reasoning appears sound, but in practice does it affect systems that much?<br />
<br />
Our SLM server is separate from our Baan and DB server... not sure if that affects how SLM traffic would be handled on the network.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any experience with this that they could share about the SLM Confirm Time or other alternatives you may have employed when faced with inadequate licensing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any information would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it becomes a heck of a problem for the Admin. What I did is I created a bat file which will restart the SLM process on my Server. Now, either you can add it as a Scheduled Task or run manually whenever you get a problem.<br />
<br />
I do not see any harm doing it as I had this practice for more than an year and did worked well.<br />
<br />
About changing any standard parameter's, I would say this is a better and safer method to tackle that.</div></div><hr />
