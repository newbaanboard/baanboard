   Does everybody had experiences about Baan User Control ?<br />
   My customer used 100 users licnese on Baan4C4,<br />
   they plan to restrict user login by company unit.<br />
   for example, <br />
   It only allow Purchase unit can consume 10 user license, <br />
                    Sales unit can consume 20 user license ...etc.<br />
   <br />
   I am not sure that what kinds of third party software can do it ?<br />
   (Except Citrix Solution)...<br />
<br />
   How about your company's solution on User Control ?<br />
<br />
   Thanks &amp; Regards.<br />

<br />
As far a I know this cannot be arranged in Baan itself as the licence meganism is just checking the number of users and not which module of Baan is used. The only solution to arrange this is with (login) scripting.  Therefor you could create a file with the users and the deparments they are working. When the user log's in to Baan you need to check the file with logins and departments, you can compare the users in the table with the users currently logged in into Baan ( licmon61. -w ) or create counters per department. Based on the counted users per deparment and the maximum number of users you allow per department the user can login to Baan. <br />
