In old LN FP7 I have something like &quot;Data table authorizations&quot; in new 10.7 with Enhanced AMS enable I don't have this option.<br />
How I can do this?</div></div><hr />

It is still there in 10.7 version and changed a bit and you have to use the condition text. Refer to the screenshot -</div></div><hr />

I don't have access to all other companies except 911 and 912 - that's good but I can't select them from the list and the list looks like attached. I would like to achieve the effect of FP7 (so that only two companies can be seen)</div></div><hr />
