	We are planning on upgrading our porting set to 6.1c.07.03 from 6.1c.03.01 on our production server and also to 6.1c.07.03 from 6.1c.05.01 on our development server. Does anyone if there are any intermediate steps that need to be done before going to 6.1c.07.01.<br />
<br />
	Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

	Yes, understand we need lots of patches but I was wondering if we need to go to a porting set like 6.1c.05.01 or 6.1c.06.01 and then go to 6.1c.07.01. Or is it ok to go directly to 6.1c.07.01and apply all the patches required?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />

<br />
there are lots of external things like if you have APIs, etc, also<br />
you need to make sure you upgrade your $BSE/include6.1 directory.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">17th July 2004, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">As dave said you will need to check your include6.1 directory, but also you will need to get to a pretty recent tools patch level. Even though the portingset version and the tools version are not directly related, there are some dependencies. Also you should be aware, that the combination of old tools version and new portingset version was never tested by Baan.<br />
<br />
Also check things like printing barcodes, as this was changed inbetween.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

<br />
You can do that either through the installation media or through downloading the zip/rar for the installable units. The installation will update the contents of $BSE/bin.</div></div><hr />
