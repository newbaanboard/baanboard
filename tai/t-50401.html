<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StacyWebb</div><div class="date">8th April 2008, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering is there a &quot;how-to&quot; for moving one license server to another. We are migrating our test environment to another machine. I have SLM running on the new machine. But when I attempt to start the license server (using Baan NT manager) it fails to start. The SLM does perform correctly. I cannot locate documentation on the files that need to be moved, etc...<br />
<br />
Thanks for everyones input.</div></div><hr />

Without actually seeing your server configuration is it difficult to suggest what steps need to be taken other then the generic ones.<br />
<br />
Refer to the SLM Documentation (you can get them from the Support Site or the installation CD) to start with and post any specific Qs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StacyWebb</div><div class="date">8th April 2008, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The server is Windows 2003/SQL Server 2005<br />
We have an existing License server (not SLM) and that is what I am trying to move. The SLM is on the new machine and would that cause an issue with the regular license manager (on the new machine) from starting.</div></div><hr />

Revalidating Baan IV on Windows<br />
<br />
First, all of the validation sessions are in the Tools &gt;&gt; Software Installation &gt;&gt; Validation menu.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you need to make changes to the dates of the current license:<br />
1.  Open the Maintain Requested System Configuration (ttiex3100m000) session.<br />
2.  Go to the appropriate field and key in the change.<br />
3.  Save and Exit.<br />
<br />
If you need to make changes to the number of users or commercial functions:<br />
1. Open the Maintain Requested System Configuration (Tools) (ttiex3101m000) session.<br />
2.  If you changed the dates on ttiex3100m000, above, click the Group Insert (bowtie) button and tab to the date fields and enter the new dates. <br />
3.  Make the changes needed to the number of users and/or commercial functions marked runable.<br />
4.  Save and Exit.<br />
<br />
From this point, revalidation takes place in two parts.  The first is generating the new Requested System Configuration (RSC) with changes made in the steps above and the second is applying the new validation keys to the server. <br />
<br />
Part 1  Generating the RSC<br />
1.  Open the Print Requested System Configuration (ttiex3400m000) session.<br />
2.  Click OK when the warning about overwriting the security code appears.<br />
3.  Make sure the information shown, including the License Code and Sequence Number is correct.<br />
4.  Click Continue.<br />
5.  Select a rewrite device to save the Requested System Configuration (RSC) to a file.<br />
6.  E-mail the RSC file to keys@ssaglobal.com.<br />
<br />
The validation group will process the RSC through the validation server and new keys will be e-mailed back to you.  This process usually takes 24 to 48 hours.<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************************<br />
Part 2  Applying the new validation keys<br />
1.  Log into Baan.<br />
2.  Open the Maintain Security Code/Validation Key (ttiex3102m000) session.<br />
3.  Enter the new keys for Validation Key (Tools) and the Validation Key Software (Standard) if the latter was changed.<br />
4.   Save and Exit.<br />
5.   Run the Validate Tools Set (ttiex3220m000) session.<br />
6.   Log out of Baan.<br />
7.   Restart the Baan license service. <br />
8.   Log into Baan.<br />
9.   Run the Configure Application (ttiex3225m000) session.  Validation is complete when the message Patch Process Ready appears.</div></div><hr />
