We have a new client for which we need to compare extension in all three environments, to check whether they are sync or not.<br />
<br />
Other than manually checking source of all the extension in all three environment, is there any way.<br />
<br />
As we are in cloud we can not check how old is object is.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

It was a lot of work and not perfect.<br />
<br />
I don't recall any tools around this, but maybe someone who knows LN better has some recommendations.</div></div><hr />

You can run session ttstpobjinfo to get information (e.g. compile date) about the generated tx-object of the extension.</div></div><hr />

In the Extensions select an extension and click References - History<br />
There you would be able to see (on one system of origin) the edit history and on the others the installation history of the PMC solutions to update the extension...</div></div><hr />
