My customer is using Oracle for BaanIVc4, we need to copy a live company to a test environment but we have no enough space,<br />
can we copy to a Bisam database? (needs lower space)<br />
i. Can Bisam support BaanIVc4?<br />
ii. If no, is there any other way to do that? (rememeber is having space constraint)<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">17th October 2003, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, BaaN IV supports BISAM. <br />
It's quick and also doesn't requires so much space as Oracle.<br />
I've a development installation that use BISAM and I've not problem at all.</div></div><hr />

If your original installation is not able for TBASE/ Bisam, you have to change the lincence to make it work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">18th October 2003, 09:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Lastly check ur kernel settings / tbase settings (in $BSE/lib/tbase) and oracle buffer requirements. U need to make sure all these are set properly and both environments are able to start together without any impact on overall Baan performance which I believe is of utmost important.<br />
<br />
So little  bit of testing on a holiday by IT guys with both environments up together is recommended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't bet any vital body parts on this though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">22nd October 2003, 09:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if your OS allows mor then 2GB files, than the bisam restriction stays. <br />
<br />
The OS and the application must support it, because the normal C Filestruct for handling file positions uses a 32 bit Integer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaymukh</div><div class="date">28th October 2003, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">what is the limitation is TP Base?<br />
Which one is better BBase or TPBase.<br />
Can I switch company between Oracle db and BBase company in in same login (bshell).<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">29th October 2003, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Limit is the same.<br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge, TP is not used by any (or few ??) customers due to the performance issues though it offers more security. <br />
<br />
As per information somewhere in this board , u should create different Baan user for different database company. This is no big problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">29th October 2003, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">The limitation for tbase is the max file size, that is 2GB. I am not sure whether tbase will work for larger files even if your OS supports larger files, but i strongly believe that tbase still won`t work if files grow larger than 2GB.<br />
We tried to run tbase TP a few years ago, but with no success, instead of providing more security, it caused additional errors. I don`t know whether TP runs better now, but I don`t think so. If anyone here uses TP and it works fine I would be happy to be informed.<br />
But on the other hand I would like to add that tbase is running very fast and stable on all installations I have seen so far.<br />

Even with TP you will occaisionally have to rebuild your indexes. However since it uses a transaction log it will keep your data consistant. <br />
