<br />
This might be an easy or a very tough problem. Let's see:<br />
<br />
can you enter other chines characters?<br />
What is the characterset of your database?<br />
Is your Baan installation a multi byte installation?<br />
Which windows version are you using? <br />
Does it have the chinese characters installed?<br />
What is the NLS setting in your Baan GUI?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ka.kevinliu</div><div class="date">7th November 2005, 03:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Markus:<br />
<br />
   Firstly, Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
   Regarding your question, I will answer to you below the following.<br />
   <br />
   1.can you enter other chines characters?<br />
      Yes, I can input most of chinese characters, but some characters.<br />
   2.What is the characterset of your database?<br />
      Oracle NLS chrarcterset is TRADITIONAL CHINESE_TAIWAN.ZHT16BIG5<br />
   3.Is your Baan installation a multi byte installation?<br />
      Yes<br />
   4.Which windows version are you using? <br />
      Windows XP  and Windows 2000 Trditional Chinese Version<br />
   5.Does it have the chinese characters installed?<br />
     Sure<br />
   6.What is the NLS setting in your Baan GUI?<br />
      Big5<br />
<br />
<br />
   by the way, someone tell me to modify the big5 code range  in c:\baan\lib\TSS_BW , But it doesn't work<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
<br />
 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">7th November 2005, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">In principle your setup look ok, which is also proven by the fact, that you can enter some, but not all characters.<br />
<br />
The chines installations I worked with, das all the GB something characterset in the database and also the GB (simplified chinese) setting in the bw GUI. But I am no chinese expert to tell you the difference to the traditional chinese settings.<br />
<br />
Anyway the hint about the tss files could be correct. You talk about tss_bw even though your profile states, that you have a solaris server? Or are you talking about the client settings?<br />
<br />
Then you might as well take another look at the tss files in $BSE/lib. There are Baan sessions to manipulte these, but there are nowhere in the menu. If you print all tools sessions on display, you will easily find them &quot;tttss....&quot;<br />

<br />
the tss.old is a copy of some file and can be deleted.<br />
the tss_mbstore configures, that you are a multi-byte instalation<br />
the rest have all got to do with the chacacter set configuration.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I have no detail info about these files. Maybe somebody else on the board has?<br />
<br />
What does SSA support say to your issue?<br />

Maybe, it is very difficult .<br />
<br />
Now, I pray for God help.<br />
<br />
   <br />
<br />
If you are a member in Baan, you should be able to give me some hint.<br />
<br />
I will appreciate that .<br />
<br />
Thank<br />
<br />
If no help, maybe I should change the ERP system.</div></div><hr />

Finally, I should skip those character with alternate word with similar meaning or change the codepage to utf-8 to get through the problem.<br />

Didn't know the Baan can support utf-8 codepage or not?<br />

<br />
Only at Ln 6.1 FP2, Baan system comes to support UTF on AIX+Oracle platform. Kevin Liu's problems seems related to TSS code range. Every big5 customer has encountered such inputting problmems before and can manage to fix it with extending the TSS code range. Suggest Kevin to call SSA support to fix the problem.</div></div><hr />

Are you trying to input GB characters on BIG5 server? In that case, you will hit such problem.</div></div><hr />
