<br />
I need your suggestion about recovery scenario on this situation :<br />
<br />
1. the operating system or hardware crashed which the server can not be started up at all. <br />
2. We have an oracle online backup (datafiles, log files, and archive files)<br />
<br />
How to restore / recovery the Baan data from the Oracle Backup to a totally new server?<br />
I meant, what is the steps to do it? (i.e. Installing Oracle, installing Baan, then recovering the database?)<br />
<br />
Is there any document about the above situation?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />
Handy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't worry and hurry, we can recover your data, I have experiance on this type of situation at least dozen times on Prod. as well as Test.<br />
<br />
Just let me know, about BaaN's side.<br />
<br />
1. Do you have Baan folder backup/ 000 seq. backup?<br />
2. Or the DB server is different than App? I mean 3 Tier.<br />
<br />
DB side:<br />
1. You will get data upto your last backup. Dont know your archive log handling procedure.<br />
2. Do you know structure of your database or last control file backup may be in trace?<br />
<br />
Ask your hardware person to recover crashed server parallely.<br />
<br />
Here I am providing rough steps, keep posting to know us more about your situation. <br />
<br />
01. Install OS<br />
02. Create &quot;baan&quot; user and add it into admin group, and login throgh baan<br />
03. Install Oracle<br />
03. Install BaaN using BaaN Master CD under same folder <br />
04. Install Porting set<br />
05. Rename baan folder and paste here backed live baan folder<br />
06. Set the path and environment variables i.e. BSE=d:\baan, BSE_TMP=d:\baan\tmp, USER=BAAN, ORACLE_HOME=e:\oracle, ORACLE_SID=baan<br />
07. Rename Oracle DB folder and move backup folder to olde one.<br />
08. If you have so many Archive Logs then you have to perform cancel based recovery.<br />
09. You have to issue Oracle Recovery commands, something like:<br />
 1. ALTER DATABASE RECOVER AUTOMATIC TABLESPACE &lt;tablespacename&gt;;<br />
 2. ALTER DATABASE &lt;tablespace name&gt; ONLINE:<br />
10. You have to validate your BSE so need to send them RSC and Mantain security key.<br />
10. Validate tools set (ttiex3220m000)<br />
11. Configure Application (ttiex3225m000)<br />
<br />
Try this with confidence. During this, I will search more info. on this.<br />
<br />

<br />
I assume you are askeng this in a proactive way and not in an actual crash situation.<br />
<br />
In case of an urgent crash situation, do not waste your time and call up oracle support.<br />
<br />
In case of a proactive question, some comments:<br />
<br />
- make sure you backup all required components, meaning the complete Baan app, the complete Oracle installation, the datafiles, controlfiles, archivelogs, etc.<br />
<br />
- then recovery everything and do not install from scratch. Installing Baan from scratch will take you several days and is not required.<br />
<br />
- then roll forward your archivelogs and open the database<br />
<br />
- Start Baan and execute &quot;Patch objects after system crash&quot; to &quot;unvalidate&quot; your installation and be able to work for thirty days.<br />
<br />
- Get a new license key from Baan and install it.<br />
<br />
Finished!<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually the whole recovery procedure has not much to do with Baan, but more with Oracle online backup recovery and is very well documented.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your kind replies.<br />
Actually I faced the problem sometimes ago and I did install Baan from scratch. It takes much time.<br />
That's why I need to make a trial / simulation on the above situation.<br />
<br />
To Suhas : Thanks Suhas. I'll try the steps from you.Btw, I don't understand step no.8. But It's OK, I'll try to find it out.<br />
<br />
To Markus : Thanks Markus. As you said that the Oracle Online Backup recovery is very well documented, actually I have a document about it but I am afraid I can not use it in the sitauaion I described above (I can not find the scenario in there). If available, would you pls send it to me?<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Handy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry I missed to answer your question about BaaN's side : <br />
1. Yes I have both Baan folder Backup and 000 seq. backup.<br />
2. DB and application are in the same server.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
