<br />
We've been experiencing a problem lately: some developers don't pay attention to the code they're about to modify and take a version already under development .... if the changes go unnoticed during testing, the software gets to production and causes problems.<br />
<br />
We know we could use customization projects, but we'd like to, somehow, restrict the access to the code  .....<br />
<br />
Any idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one question: you use a separate VRC to TEST the custoimization before to put in PRODUCTION VRC or TEST directly in the DEVELOPMENT VRC?<br />
If you use a separate VRC, and this VRC is always keep clean after the customization go in the live company, and there is only one customization at time in test, and the test is done properly, it's almost impossible to cause problems of this entity....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">migramir</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we even have separate BaaN instances for Development and Test. <br />
<br />
We do clean our VRCs, but the problem is that we've too many people working on many different things and, sometimes, two different projects impact the same object. The developers, trying to get their work done, just start modifying whatever version they find and cause the conflicts.<br />
<br />
We've tried to school everybody, but there's always someone new in the company that causes these kind of problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">There are couple of ways to manage this issue, I know they can not take care of this problem 100%, but upto some extent it can be worked out.<br />
<br />
1. You can set up authorizations like Allowed to modify other developers s/w components option  or controlling it by packagewise leadership to the individual or group. I know this is difficult, but if some administrative care is taken it can be worked out.<br />
<br />
2. Develope another Baan session, in which call the Unix script which will change the permissions of the &quot;p&lt;program_name&gt;&quot; file at unix level and the owner of the file. This session can be put in authorization of one person, who will be releasing the same for any developer and unless the developement is complete to it, he will not revoke the permissions.<br />
<br />
But in either of the approaches there is some administrative control required.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">5th February 2003, 08:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Amir,<br />
Use session ttadv0141m000 to achieve this. BaaN would not allow to change the software component for which the user is not the owner.<br />
Good Luck!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some product in UNIX platform?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">what we used to do is have a shared folder that the programmers would update with the comps they were working on, and then remove when done.<br />
<br />
Also another rule was as soon as you saw a comp in the dev VRC that you would know someone else is the &quot;owner&quot; of it, so you would double check with the person as maybe it was supposed to be cleared out...........<br />
<br />
Maybe there is a check in / check out utility that can be bolted on to Baan, or even implmented at unix level.......</div></div><hr />

<br />
The classic - and free! - product for code management on most UNIX systems is either RCS and/or CVS.</div></div><hr />
