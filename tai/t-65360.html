<br />
I have just one question and a little history behind it.<br />
<br />
The question: is there any way of exporting data (.txt file) from a Triton's .dat file aside from bdbpre tool in the Triton server ?<br />
<br />
The history: we are in an archive project, and need to ETL the data of 100 Triton dumps to an Oracle database. And, in each dump with have the .dat files where the information is now stored.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any suggestion,<br />

Within the application you can use the so called exchange module which can be used to export tables to ascii files.<br />
<br />
Without the application it's probably a bit more complex. You are telling us you have .dat files containing the data. Does that mean you did use c-isam to store the data? Because the baan own isam version did store the data in .bdt files if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
If it's indeed c-isam than you can use the c-isam libraries to develop some own code to read te tables. <br />
If it's bisam and you can't use the application than you can filter the lines from the file. If I remember correctly deleted lines where ended with a null character and the others with \n.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, we can use the application. In this case, the problem is that we will have to run  exchange or bdbpre once for each dump, 100 times total...<br />
<br />
The server we are going to work with is c-isam (according to documentation), I will take a look in its libraries in order to evaluate your tip of development...<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">31st January 2014, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You can automate the extraction with some simple scripts. No need to run the application for that.<br />
Just make a list of the files in the runtime dictionary and convert that to table names which you can use to run the bdbpre command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mferreira744</div><div class="date">3rd February 2014, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Mr. Brinkman, you are right. The script with bdbpre will be a wonderful part of our solution.<br />
But, the dump issue it alone doesn't solve, because we will have to restore 100 dumps and each time run that script...<br />
The ideal solution would be if we could copy the contents of each dump in a directory (dic1, dic2....dic100), and could make a more complex script to do the &quot;bdbpre&quot; action in all those, running it only once.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion ?<br />
<br />
Thank you again</div></div><hr />
