<br />
our subsidiary in Norway is running BaaN IV c4 and has updated to portingset 6.1c.06.02.<br />
<br />
Since then it happens that the users are randomly losing contact to the server. They get an error message like this:<br />
<br />
Connetcion with server lost<br />
Start BW again to re-connect.<br />
<br />
All the processes in bshell disappears, but the users are still &quot;hanging&quot; in the licmon6.1 Because of this it gets full during the day and have to be killed (licmon6.1 -k) to remove the &quot;hanging&quot; users.<br />
<br />
Did any one face this problem before and has got a solution to solve this matter?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Thomas</div></div><hr />

What was the previous porting set?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">We experienced this problem a few times without really getting to the bottom of it.<br />
<br />
It was happening to a few users in Finance when the connection was dropping during a long process. I think we cured the problem by updating the clients to win2000, not an ideal solution I would agree but we believed that the problem was more client / LAN connection related.<br />
<br />
I'm not convinced that this problem is porting set related and the first thing you really need to do is try to establish a pattern. <br />
<br />
You could try the later porting set or maybe update the GUI.<br />
<br />
Hope this thread develops because I'd like to know myself if there is any explanation.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

We have not been able to determine any type of pattern.  One person in our office can lose her connection every 10 minutes, while I can stay on and connected without any problems.<br />
<br />
We tried connecting sniffers and tracing the problem but have been unable to identify where the drop was happening.  Also we just went to windows 2000 clients and still have the problem. <br />
<br />
We are using 4C3, porting set is 6.1c.04.01, Baan client is B40c.044.  As far as I know we are the only remote site in our company experiencing the problem. So I hope someone has a good answer. <br />

<br />
Loads of problems happen if your portingset, BW and standard objects (just search for error 509, a known indication of this) are not sync'ed, e.g., more or less from same release date). Make sure that all of them are updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomas Nolte</div><div class="date">12th June 2002, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Francesco,<br />
<br />
it started when they updated to portingset 6.1c.06.02 (from 6.1c.4). In the meanwhile they updated the system over 6.1c.06.03 to 6.1c.06.04.<br />
<br />
To be able to install 6.1c.06.02 they had to install java (JENV 1.3) on the server.<br />
<br />
Please find some more system information:<br />
<br />
Last Appl. Version B40 c5 SP7<br />
Last Tools Version B40 c4<br />
Portingset 6.1c.06.04<br />
Port. no. PA.1980<br />
OS Portingset ReliantUNIX_<br />
Operating System SINIX-N<br />
Version OS 5.43<br />
Database Oracle7 L2<br />
DB Version 7.3.4.4.0<br />
<br />
It seems that it doenÂ´t matter which BW version they are using. Most of the users use BW 6.1.3.63. Some of them have got BW 6.1.3.65 and others BW 6.1.3.62. But all of them are faced to the same problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for further feedback.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Thomas</div></div><hr />

Comming from a 6.1c.04 to a 6.1c.06 bring loads of new stuff with it, also have a look at the following thread http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1735&amp;highlight=close+connection related to disconnection of idle clients. Try to set the values to something really high.<br />
It's also worth to keep monitoring the network to know if you have a bottleneck somewhere.</div></div><hr />
