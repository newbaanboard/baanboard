<br />
We plans to switch our environment on Citrix XenServer.<br />
Have anyone tried this ?<br />
Is there any disadvantage with this solution ?<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">27th April 2010, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using it. It depends if you have one or more VM on the Server. If its one then it is quite simple. If multiple then it gets a little more tricky and complex, because the Worktop's WTD files have machine names encoded in them, shortcuts are saved based on those wtd's.<br />
Also, the server should be 32-bit based OS than 64-bit as BW/Worktop etc do not seem to handle the x86 paths.<br />
You also have to watch out for the latest BW/Worktop release notes for bugs/fixes.<br />
List of changes for portingset: 8.5a.03<br />
MaintBeethoven: # 43876 (BDNT35541): Performance problem with Citrix<br />
Date: Thu, 10 Sep 2009 14:58:15 +0200 (CEST)<br />
Created on:  MaintBeethoven<br />
Type:        bugfix<br />
Problem Description (Customer terms)<br />
When scrolling through an editable grid with a lot of date columns, the performance is very bad when running it on a Citrix server. It sometimes takes 7-8 seconds.<br />
<br />
When the date columns are hidden it becomes a lot faster. With perfmon we noticed peaks with 100 % CPU usage on the bw.exe process.<br />
<br />
Workaround<br />
Hide date/time controls in the session.<br />

MaintChopin: # 36271 (BDNT28382): Force BW windows to become foreground windows<br />
Date: Tue, 31 Jul 2007 10:46:44 +0200 (CEST)<br />
Created on:  DevDesprez<br />
Type:        bugfix<br />
Problem Description (Customer terms)<br />
When using the Worktop client in a Citrix environment the following behavior is observed. When you open a second session, the first session you opened disappears behind the Worktop. The only way to retrieve the first session is to minimize Worktop, first session is now<br />
visible again. The first session should be minimized to the bottom of the screen, or into the tool bar, it should not disappear behind the Worktop Test Procedure<br />

<br />
I haven't seen anyone using it, it probably works. However please note that it will not be officially supported. Check the technical notes of the portingset at the chapter 'Virtualization'.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">29th April 2010, 01:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Han is correct. Refer to the Technical notes of the latest Porting Set.<br />
<br />
Virtual Server support<br />
VMware<br />
The following statements apply to the Infor ERP LN 6.1 and ERP 5 Microsoft Windows x86 distribution and Linux x86 distribution: <br />
With Enterprise Server 8.3 and later, it is supported to run ERP LN 6.1 on VMware for demo and test purposes. However, benchmarks show that ERP LN in OS environments directly on the hardware performs better than ERP LN in a VMware Server environment. Therefore, Infor will not handle performance support calls when ERP LN runs on a VMware Server environment.<br />
Distributions on VMware ESX 3.5 and ESXi 3.5 are supported for all purposes, including production. When you size the system, take the overhead of VMware ESX/ ESXi into account. For guidelines, see the ERP LN sizing guide. 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and 32-bit and 64-bit Linux are both supported in combination with VMware. <br />
Note: Since the Infor SLM Server (Solution License Manager) is not supported in a virtual server environment it must be setup on a separate nonvirtual server. SLM Client is supported in a VMware environment. <br />
Disclaimer: The previous support statement of VMware ESX/ESXi 3.5 does not extend to any third-party product. For example, if the DBMS vendor does not support VMware ESX, the porting set is still supported on VMware ESX, but the DBMS is not. In this case, a solution is to run in 3-tier mode and configure the DBMS on another, non-virtual, system.<br />
<br />
HP Integrity VM<br />
With Enterprise Server 8.3 and porting set 8.3a.01 or later, it is supported to run ERP LN 6.1 with HP-UX on HP Integrity VM for demo and test purposes. Infor Global Support will not handle performance related inquiries about running ERP LN with HP-UX in a HP Integrity VM environment; support is limited to test and demo environments.<br />
HP Integrity Virtual Machines with the ERP LN 6.1 HP-UX IA64 distribution are supported.<br />
Note that the Infor SLM Server (Solution License Manager) is not supported in a virtual server environment. SLM Client can run on a virtual server<br />
environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since there are no explicite informations about CitrixXensServer in Technical notes of the latest Porting Set, i think i'd better ask confirmation from Infor365.<br />
<br />
@NPRao :are you using virtualization for the server or for the client ? Is there an important slowdown ? are you satisfied with this solution(citrix) ?<br />
@Han Brinkman : indeed, we are considering the opportunity to use xenserver to virtualize our baan environment.</div></div><hr />

Is there an important slowdown ? are you satisfied with this solution(citrix) ?<br />
No, our App Servers are on HPUX and we have only the BW/Worktop on Citrix. Performance also depends on the network bandwidth of the sites connecting directly to the server or through Citrix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medtun</div><div class="date">30th April 2010, 13:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you NPRao. I asked infor about xen server and they confirmed me they don't suppot XenServer.</div></div><hr />
