<br />
Good day to everyone!<br />
<br />
We plan to upgrade our current Informix Database 7.31 to IDS 9.3. Will IDS 9.3 run to our existing platform?<br />
<br />
Operating System = AIX 4.3.3 but we plan to move to AIX 5.1<br />
Application = BaanIVc4<br />
Database = IDS 7.31 plan to move to IDS 9.3<br />
porting set = 6.1c.06.06  <br />
<br />
If the current porting set will not support IDS 9.3 what is the porting set appropriate version?<br />
<br />
Hoping for your immediate reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Julia</div></div><hr />

certified it. Their porting sets go from IDS9.2 to IDS10<br />
<br />
How do you find out for sure? Go to solution 15219 <br />
Look for your porting set, read the Technical Release Notes that are<br />
assigned to each porting set. <br />
<br />
This contains info on DB version that is certified as well as OS level, etc.<br />
Much better than in the old days.<br />
<br />
Keep reading the technical notes until you find your database version or run out of porting sets =) then you'll have the answer for sure.<br />
