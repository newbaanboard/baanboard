use import data dictionary session(ttiex1287 and ttiex1288)<br />
What is the difference between these two?<br />
in which situations which one to use??<br />
In my view both does the same work(Software upgradation)<br />
 import data dictionary session not only imports dd but also imports sessions,forms reports :-).This is contradiction to the name right??<br />

<br />
The Patch installer is used for Service Packs, etc.  It can span multiple packages.  The Import DD install goes only into 1 package, and in fact imports only 1 dump from 1 directory.<br />
<br />
Import DD is the older method, the Patch installs are newer and are generally a collection of smaller updates.  Patch installs also are kept track of in PMC (Patch Management), so all the dependences are tracked.  In Import DD there is no dependency tracking (pre-requisites) or history kept.<br />
<br />
Hope that answers your questions - let us know if you need anything specific answered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Import DD is the basic way of getting SW components into your system and you are right, this is a misnomer, because it might contain sessions/forms. This method existed first and was used for importing both customizations froma test system, development from a Baan partner and patches from Baan.<br />
<br />
<br />
Import DD proofed difficult to use for a lot of clients. They first had to uncompress/tar a file and so on. So Baan came up with &quot;import Patch&quot;. Which is the same as import DD, but instead of working on a directory, it works on a compressed file. Actually I think under the covers it calls import dd.<br />
<br />
Import Patch was an improvement for a lot of clients, but in there was no dependency checking, you could not uninstall patches and you could also install patches in the wrong order. To improve this, Baan came up with the PMC, which again calls import Patch under the cover.<br />
<br />
Today you would:<br />
<br />
a) use import DD for exchanging customizations mostly and honestly localization packaes and addons are nothing than this really.<br />
<br />
b) use import patch to get the &quot;batch installer&quot; into your system, which is really just a collection of patches.<br />
<br />
c) use PMC for all other patching issues.<br />
