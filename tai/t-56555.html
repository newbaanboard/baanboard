You could check the event viewer on the server to see if you can find out why.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a system as ancient as yours, i dunno, i'd probably just deal with rebooting it every night.<br />
<br />
trying to patch to fix it might be disastrous.<br />

Hello,<br />
maybe the number of rexec connections on the server are limited ?<br />
Check if a specific number of connections is used an the next connection is refused.<br />

<br />
If it's that essential to your company than, and this is my personal opinion, you should use supported components.<br />

<br />
How to check Number of connections allowed?<br />
<br />
I am also working on the aspect of upgrading it to higher OS/MSSQL version but that process is a long process and needs a test server to be installed and after sucessful installation of Baan and data transfer, i do the same on live server.<br />
<br />
Reinstalling same porting set can resolve it?<br />
<br />
Before doing any of these activity i would consider making images of all the partitions for safety on the event of any failure.<br />
<br />
Please suggest...</div></div><hr />

Also on most of the times on this event CPU usage is 100%, but memory usage is approx 40% and it doesn't go beyond this.<br />
<br />
I have 2 GB of RAM on my server, Is there any restriction of RAM usage for baan application, any configuration etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nmolinaa</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">What is your policy on orphan licenses? Do you clean orphan licenses regularly via a job? <br />
Also, do you let users to leave open connections to baan for a long amount of time? You could avoid that via the session_timeout setting. <br />
<br />
a) License daemon can be purged regularly via licmon command or simply restarting the licd service once a week or so.<br />
b) Look at solution 110907 in infor365 for information on how to set up session_timeout. This will kill inactive bshells. If you implement this you might want to consider to set session_timeout=0 for jobs because you might not want them to timeout if they are idle.<br />
<br />
