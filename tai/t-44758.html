These process leave orphan connection on the server and the database, sucking up memory and other resources<br />
<br />
To be precise, we use vertex as tax software, integrated to Baan. When ever baan makes a call to vertex, it uses an excutable api.exe. This executable is started on the server. In normal situations when the user log out of baan api.exe proces is terminated. All fine!<br />
<br />
However, if the user connection is lost (this happens some times, laptop user pull their latop out with an open baan connection. Also it can happen with any glitch in network). At this point ntbshell.exe is terminated also sh_server.exe is terminated , but the associated api.exe is not terminated and sits there as orphan, sucking up system resources<br />
<br />
If any of you faced this problem? Any ideas? or point me in some direction? <br />
I was wondering if there is some utilities avialable, which can run on the server and periodically look for orphan and kill them??<br />
<br />
Even if you are not using vertex, any ideas in this direction would help<br />
<br />
Thanks much</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Do look around for &quot;Orphan process&quot; in Baanboard and you would get more ideas..better ones perhaps..<br />

Sorry - no matches. Please try some different terms.<br />
<br />
SK,<br />
licmon -c only releases license slots of dead ntbshells<br />
<br />
Sujith,<br />
PsTools v2.44 which can be downloaded from www.microsoft.com has a utility called pslist which can give you processes' trees. Any api.exe with no ntbshell in its tree can be killed. It should not be too difficult to build a script based on this.<br />
