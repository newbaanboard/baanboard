 If we clone the production server and create a test server from the clone and both servers are booted up they will both be pointing to the production database at the same time since the Baan services start automatically (and we cannot change config files until the test server boots up).

<br />
One thing that is not really clear is whether you are creating a virtualized environment to test the VMWare set up before cutting over or you are creating a test/development environment in addition to a production environment on VMWare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">17th September 2013, 22:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We already have three virtualized servers (one for Baan, one for the database, and one for SLM).  It is up and running.  Users finished testing last week.  All customizations and company 000 data is ported over and we are performing the final data migrations this weekend (keeping fingers crossed).  Once we are up and stable for a few days we are going to focus on getting the development environment up and running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">18th September 2013, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Eddie,<br />
<br />
The tabledef6.1 or tabledef6.2 contains the link to your database. Change that with an editor and then login, change it in your dd and convert it to runtime. That should do it.<br />
<br />
Regarding SLM? Why having a separate server if you only use one infor product on one server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">18th September 2013, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I will make note of the tabledef6.1 files.  Thank you. <br />
<br />
Regarding SLM, we have recently purchased Infor Mobility and Infor TimeTrack which will be implemented soon after the migration and creation of the test environment.<br />
<br />
There is also a PLM initiative for 2014 and Infor PLM is a candidate.<br />
<br />
An LN upgrade and Ion are potentially part of a 3-5 year strategy as well.<br />
<br />
Wow.. now that I think of it, I should be getting an Infor T-shirt, key fob, or some other Knick-knack... I'm going to have to contact our rep!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does it mean when I have this line in my tabledef file:-<br />
<br />
*:*:msql7(MSQL_SERVERHOST=.)<br />
<br />
Does that mean it points to the database on the server itself and not a remote database? Sorry Eddie, I guess this post doesn't relate to your question, but I was just curious about Han's post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct, it refers to the local instance. The name of the database can be found in the msql_groups file.<br />
<br />

<br />
How did you manage the migration? Was it from scratch or did you use a P2V process to virtualize your Baan application?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Olivier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">2nd December 2013, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes the migration was completed.  We did not use the P2V process.  We opted to utilize a 3rd party consulting agency to assist and performed a fresh installation to take advantage of upgrading from the 6x porting set line to the 8x porting set.  We also changed from the classic licensing model to SLM.  Overall everything went very well.  The biggest problem we had was correcting permission issues as the user's session/module permissions did not migrate over properly.  We also had a few issues with some runtime data dictionary hang-ups.  It took the first 'go-live' week to correct all the little bugs and glitches but everything is running very well now.  <br />
<br />
Since everything is virtualized, creation/refresh of the development/test environments quicker and easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uxue__</div><div class="date">10th December 2013, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Eddie,<br />
<br />
I would like to know if you have experienced any decrease in the performance of BAAN IVc4 in the virtualized environment. We migrated some months ago and we noticed that the refint.exe process has doubled and even tripled the execution times.<br />
This is a big issue for us as the weekend is not long enough to run this reconfiguration process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pradeepcr</div><div class="date">29th November 2017, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Eddie,<br />
I know this goes back 4 years. We are in a similar situation now in addition to changing the OS from HP UNIX to Redhat Linux and DB upgrade from 9 to 12. Your steps are very good but wan't sure if they would work in our situation as well. Any suggestions and recommendations? <br />
<br />
Also have a question on one of the steps below in the quotes. Can you mention what are the config files to be changed to point to the new DB.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change necessary configuration files on the Baan Test Server (still to be identified) and point it to the Baan4Test database&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">30th November 2017, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't comment on your Unix/Linux environment.  We are solely a Windows shop (Baan was the only Unix application we had until we migrated to Windows many years ago)...<br />
<br />
However, the only files that needed to be changed were in the $BSE\lib\msql\ directory.  They were:  msql_users and msql_groups<br />
<br />
These were the only files that we needed to change when creating the test environment.  I thought that there might be others for the Baan application but there were not.  We did disable all of the automated batch jobs on the new server so that they would not continue to run (some of them send notification e-mails out to users).<br />
<br />
The only real issue we ever came across was that since out 3rd Party DBA was not Baan savvy, the group permissions on the new database would not be set up correctly because they would have to correspond with the new database name.  Once those were re-established we were fine.  We use a NazDaq-IT product to change the color of our environment so users would know they were in the test environment vs production.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Also, Oracle connectivity and parameters are a bit more complicated...</div></div><hr />
