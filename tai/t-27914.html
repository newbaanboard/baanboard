While installing service pack 3 with PMC, I got an error 1134.  I found another thread with the same problem here:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=10357&amp;highlight=1134<br />
<br />
which leads to a problem with &quot;locks&quot;.  Following the advice, I increased the lock parameter from 50,000 to 60,000 but the error did not go away.  Please see attached screenshot for more info.  Anybody encountered this problem and know what to do?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Substract 1000 and you get your database error: 134, check the error documention of your database.</div></div><hr />

As it turns out, the problem was related to Baan trying to write too many records at once because there were too many update VRC's in the package combination.  Once I removed those and only left the required ones, the service pack installed without a problem.</div></div><hr />
