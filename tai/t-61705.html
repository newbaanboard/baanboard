Now I have a requirement wherein I have another Job which should be executed only after successful execution of the first Job. The second job is setup such that it will run every day at 1am. If the first job gets completed before 1am then still the second job has to schedule at 1 am, but if first job gets completed after 1 am then the second job will be scheduled immediately after that.</div></div><hr />
