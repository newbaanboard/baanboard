Im trying to print barcodes from Baan using the Barcode field on Maintain report Fields as per the document QG1307.<br />
<br />
No matter what value I set this field to (1,2, 9 etc) it doesnt print anything to the printer.<br />
<br />
On checking the log file $BSE/log/log.filter6.1, it shows an error:<br />
Barcode script '/am1t/naan4/bse/lib/barcode/hp_barcode/type09' not found or executable.<br />
<br />
Obviously this file type09 is not present in our system. However, we do have type01 and type02. What values do I need to enter in the field Barcode so that it maps to type01 or type02 ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Try changing the field   FONT    /   BARCODE,   on the field definition screen for the barcode field, to  blank (for font) and a 1 or 2 for the type of Barcode to print (since these are the only 2 types your currently have).<br />
<br />
You could also copy the type01  or type02 to type09 and modify<br />
it to meet you needs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a simple report....Say tiitm0401m000 (Print Item Data)<br />
(1) Take the first report i.e. tiitm0401000, copy to your VRC<br />
(2) In the layout, Add another DETAIL layout and insert a field called say item.barcode with tc.item as domain<br />
(3) Save Exit<br />
(4) Open the REPORT script, add in the declaration section<br />
domain tcitem item.barcode<br />
and add the below: <br />
<br />
detail.5:<br />
before.layout:<br />
item.barcode = chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp; &quot;*#0&quot; &amp; tiitm001.item   |Working  *-code 128, 2 , 0-16 string length<br />
<br />
compile and exeute the session ....<br />
<br />
Hope this works.<br />

Sorry missed out the last step....<br />
When this report is executed for an item, go to FORM 2 and make the Detailed REport = Yes and then select Item General Data from selection and this should show you the Barcode on Printer OR in the print preview of BWPRINT.<br />
<br />
Thnx<br />

Not sure if anyone has answered your questions.<br />
<br />
First of all the printer you print with has to support bar code printing.  THe barcode print drivers are stored in a different directory than the regular print drivers.<br />
<br />
i.e. print drivers are in BSE/lib/printinf/&lt;letter&gt;/&lt;printdriver&gt;<br />
<br />
while barcode drivers are in lib/barcode/&lt;whatever&gt;/&lt;typeN&gt;<br />
<br />
the whatever is defined in the print driver ... the typeN is type01 or type02 or type03 etc. for the type of barcode that you want to print.  <br />
<br />
If you're using a weird printer, it's up to you to code the correct escape sequences in order to setup the printer for the bar code type that you want to print.<br />
<br />
Printing data out on a report as a barcode format is a simble as defining the barcode number to define the type, but remember all the above must be satistied first before you will actually see a barcode printed.  If you enter a 1, you'll be using the type01 driver, 2 type02 and so on.  If you used a 9, it would expect there to be a type09 file in there, and that is the error message you got.<br />
<br />
Look at the standard files that Baan gave you for HP printers and barcodes, and you'll probably be able to figure it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even I think the problem is with the printer. The thing is that I want to test this iwth a HP printer ... but I found just one HP printer in our site that is setup in Baan. And Unfortunately I cant find where the printer is physically located .... :D <br />
<br />
Its been a coupla weeks but the hunt is still on ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">22nd June 2003, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">What specific printer are you trying to print a bar code to?  I have developed some bar code print drivers for other types of printers, so may be able to send you the drivers.<br />
<br />
It sounds like the printer you are using (from your first question) supports HP PCL, since you are using an HP driver with it?  Am I right with that assumption?  <br />
<br />
Check the programming manual for the specific printer you are using to make sure it support bar code printing.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finally located a HP printer. However, now when I print to this printer, I dont get any error, but it just prints some junk characters.<br />
<br />
I guess I will have to find the manuals of this printer now.:(<br />
<br />
Our other printers are Xerox printers.<br />

<br />
I've been setting up reports with barcodes for 4 years now, using bwprint client, and never came up with a problem. Just create a printer (windows) using a standard hp laserjet 4 driver and on 99% of the available printers the barcode will be printed, no extra font cartridges needed. I wrote an include which can be used for printing barcodes, with this it will take about 2 minutes to create a report with a barcode on it.<br />

Actually even I was able to get the barcode to be printed using BWPrint. But we dont want to use BWPrint. <br />
<br />
The reason being that we want to create a report which will be printed from Connectware. And I dont think as of now we have any setup to print to BWPrint through Connectware.<br />

Barcodes on PCL-HP Printers uses specific character numbers (cartridge fonts). that means font numbers above no. 24600.<br />
For example No. 24700 is Code128auto.<br />
To access thes fonts you have to upgrade your firmware with an<br />
barcode chip module like &quot;JetCaps&quot;<br />
This modul is hooked to font calls within the LJ PCL5 interpreder.<br />
Typeface Numbers from 24600 to 24800 activates the inteligence for barcode printing.<br />
The data mapped to those special fonts are analysed and converted into barcode directly by the firmware.<br />

<br />
The instructions in the Quick Guide #1310 - Barcode Printing &amp; BWprint, do mention that you may have to register the 'dbcocx32.ocx' in the registry.  But the file name it refers to does not come as part of MY BWprint or anywhere we could fine, maybe the doc is out of date.<br />
<br />
Regardless, we were able to update our bw print version to the latest, which apparently will do the registering for you.  We were able to print preview and print the bar codes after that.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

You have define a barcode height of 4 lines (sign $). Have you leave space in your report layout? Is this layout 4 lines height? Try to decrease the barcode height.</div></div><hr />

The barcode is here but I can't still see it<br />
I have changed the minimum aspect ration in the bwprint screen result from 1 to 4 and no change.<br />

Maybe it is an incompatibility between the datas, the barcode type and height. <br />
