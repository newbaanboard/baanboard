<br />
According to Solution 19276 on the support site, it says it requires a reg entry.  The Password lockout works.   The other option to lockout the configuration file does not for the Baan IV GUI (the solution will be updated by Baan Support to correct this).<br />
<br />
Has anyone had any luck with locking out access to change the .bwc configuration file?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The blocking must come from disabling the &quot;Configure&quot; button, so application related... I think you're stick with that solution and if it does not work (haven't tested it yet) wait for the next solution.</div></div><hr />

The solution works with the Baan V GUI, but they aren't going to fix this one.  Boooooooooo!<br />
<br />
But, be sure to check out the solution.  It does allow the password to be blocked.</div></div><hr />

Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 11:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest try the implementation of a wrapper script solution. In the ipc_info file make an entry for the common bshell file that does not point to bshell6.1 but to wrap_bshell. In the script you can start the bshell6.1 with your own options... I think the command line options from the client are not passed...<br />
<br />
You have to test this because I am not really sure this will work out right for you.</div></div><hr />

U have another sol to change the permission of that bwc file and take out the authorizations from the normal users(only in NT). <br />
Hope it will solve ur probl.<br />
