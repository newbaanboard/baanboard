<br />
In Baan IV, there was only one client component, and that is BW (Baan Windows). In ERPLn there is BW and Worktop. <br />
<br />
I do not understand the underlying functionality of these two.<br />
<br />
Can anybody shed light on this ?<br />

<br />
While the functionality of BW remains the same i.e. connecting with the server via bshell, Worktop adds feature to it. It simplifies the user interaction by providing you multiple functionalities. Following are some functionalities worktop adds - <br />
<br />
1. Easy to use and intuitive keeping the underlying technology hidden.<br />
2. Lets you configure the BW for multiple environments on a single window<br />
3. Lets you connect multiple BW without any hassles<br />
4. Multi-language support<br />
5. Enables Central Deployment Mode<br />
6. You can switch to multiple environments at a same time very easily<br />
<br />
Other features are - <br />
1. Creating your own shortcuts<br />
2. Creating your own Navigation Area, Work Areas<br />
3. You can manage the appearance and customize it<br />
4. You can browse the websites through it<br />
<br />
And there's more.. <br />
<br />
To sum it up, worktop is an enhancement to the BW which still requires underlying BW to get itself working.<br />
<br />
Someone else can come up with other features as well. There are numerous ones.</div></div><hr />
