<br />
I am not sure if this topic is covered earlier or not.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Basically we are Live with baaN 5c since last couple of years with huge vol of data, the site works 24/7 which means no shutdown / downtime. <br />
<br />
Currently i would like to schedule seq. dump backup for 000 co. along with other Jobs which execute during night time. I am suspecting that since jobs are running all the time i might face issues if the backup for 000 is scheduled at that time.<br />
<br />
I am thinking to skip some of the table like Audit, Job to avoid problems. :o<br />
<br />
Any hints/tips to let the backup happen smoothly. Any other table which should not be considered while executing backup for 000 ? :rolleyes: :confused:<br />
<br />
We are also taking other co.'s backup (8 co.' ) also during night which finishes in morning. <br />
<br />
Any advice/hints would be appreciated. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

If these tables are locked for backup, wont that cause a problem while running any session in Baan?<br />

<br />
I have a suggestion - prepare a DR site for your database and then take your whole baan dirctory to that sever. prepare a script which take back up of tables in seq. format using bdbpre6.1/6.2 script of baan. You may require baan to be run on that.<br />
<br />
Any query please ask me. This is the current scenario which we are using in our Multinational organization.<br />

By the way if anyone has infos on the tool i am interested<br />

<br />
Also bdbpre locks tables, so it will cause you problems no matter what tables you use.<br />
<br />
Best option is using your DB hot backup facility. or an oracle export if you're using oracle and want an export style backup.<br />
<br />
Madbull there isn't an option in Baan to backup the data, (and maintain referential integrity) online. <br />

<br />
The main reason for doing 000 Co. backup is to recover from a situation where in lets say i loose an important table like Report Master or may be some other imp. table. I know it might sound a little bit strange about the theory of loosing a table .... but it's better to be fully equipped, if this sort of situation happens otherwise in Co. we can safely ignore taking backups. <br />
<br />
*Also bdbpre locks tables, so it will cause you problems no matter what tables you use.<br />
Yaah i agree it locks table ,but effectively if user is doing a transaction in a Application Co. , it wont effect him much , lets say my user is raising PO, now at the same time a 000 table is backed up example User Data ttaad200 so it wont effect him, but of course if he is using a device and at the same time that specific 000 table is being backed up, it would effect him.<br />
<br />
*Best option is using your DB hot backup facility. or an oracle export if you're using oracle and want an export style backup.<br />
Hot DB backup is good but it will take complete DB backup not one single co. backup , and even recovering only 1 single table from a hot backup is not possible unless n until u transfer or recover this complete hot db backup on to other system &amp; then re-recover from there. <br />
<br />
I am yet to try Oracle export because that would atleast make sure i dont lock tables while doing backup. Oracle export looks a good option.<br />

That should only be a concern if you're actively developing in production.<br />

<br />
Well, depends on the table. For example Text is often stored in co000. Also, session defaults, etc.<br />

<br />
<br />
That's correct, but it very rarely works that way in an ERP system. because of the referential integrity between tables.<br />
You could save your report table but maybe lose labels, text, domains, etc.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oracle export doesn't lock tables (I just researched that this week =) )<br />
you can use the &quot;consistent=y&quot; flag to help with referential integrity too.<br />
