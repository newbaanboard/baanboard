I have a problem executing a job -JobDeamon service being started: <br />
I made an periodical job to be executed from 15 to 15 minutes. I added the session for this job and I put the status In queue. And I loged out of Baan.<br />
The job was executed only first time after I loged out... when I loged in in Baan again, my job has the status Free... so the job couldn't be activated by JobDeamon.<br />
Why?<br />
What I should do for my job to be executed from 15 to 15 minutes?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

<br />
There is boolean 'wait after job completion' which needs to be set to true (or yes) so that job gets activated every 15 mins.</div></div><hr />
