<br />
Currently where installing a new Baan IV server to replace the old one.  The basic installation has been set up. As the new system is not validated yet I want the new server to look at the licence of our current production server. Both machines can ping each other by hostname ( etc/hosts have been filled ), as far as I know the only thing I need to do is modify the licence6.1 file on the current production machine and add the hostname of the new server. Are the hostnames in the licence6.1 separated by comma's?<br />
<br />
So is it:  server_1, server_2 or just server_1 server_2 ?<br />
<br />
Are there any other actions I should take care of to run both machines on the licence of the current production server?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

You must only modify the file licence6.1 on the new server and add the<br />
name of your production server.<br />
Ex: if the name of your production server is PROD, the file licence6.1 on the<br />
new server must contain this name..<br />
Good lukc<br />

<br />
In the meanwhile I already tried this but I think this trick only works when both servers are running on the same type of operating system. In our case we're migration from AIX to Suse Linux. <br />
After I modified the licence6.1 on the new server and tried to log on to Baan the message that the licence was not valid for this operating system appeared on the screen.<br />
I logged an inquiry at SSA to retrieve a temporary validation till we have migrated the data from the current production environment to the new server, after that we want to revalidate the new system.<br />

try ip address in stead of hostname in $BSE/lib/licence6.1. <br />
Is the old server listed in hosts table on the (new) linux server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">3rd August 2006, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I filled the /etc/host on both servers and I can ping/telnet both servers by hostname.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a thought, check if the IP address scheme is same for both servers. I have the similar situation and have no problem to access the License from the production server.<br />

<br />
For Suse Linux you need an extra commercial function to be validated by SSA, so in this case you can not use the license daemon on your old server....<br />

<br />
It is not possible to run a new linux server on an existing license without re-validation. With a new validation it is possible to validate a linux and unix server on the same licence.<br />
<br />
If you are installing a new Baan server on Linux be sure to set the commercial function for Linux to 'Yes' in maintain system configuration. In case this option does not show up in your maintain session first run the session ttstpcorlinux, afterwards the Linux commercial function should be available in maintain system configuration.<br />
<br />
Currently we have our HP Proliant server with Baan IVc4  up and running and validated.<br />
