<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly , the main problem is to get hot IP adress. For this look at this thread<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=22761&amp;highlight=host<br />
After that create table that contains configuration file for user names and their fixed IP adress and then create session for check user connections. If there is a problem then kill user's process. Don't forget to add this session to baan.startup sessions.<br />
<br />
That 's All. But it is very complicated. I hope this gives you any idea.<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />

i am checking the related information .<br />
one option ?: to write a sript to check if the lognam is matched with IP and run it before bshell ,  problem is that if i can find a way to get client IP before bshell is performed<br />
<br />
the second option /: write a session and add it to be a boot session . and this session call a unix script to check and kill . after bshell is performed ,we can get the information like that &quot; baanuser@&lt;clienthostname&gt;<br />
<br />
i am trying the first option...</div></div><hr />

What we have is a proven method, and one that we have been using. Just use the &quot;/etc/host&quot; file on your AIX server. If they don't have an IP address entry in our &quot;/etc/host&quot; file, then it does not let them in.<br />

it is different . i wish user  A can only login baan from his own client machine.<br />
he cannot login from any other client computer . so each computer has a fixed IP in my company . so i wish bind Ip with logon user</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">21st December 2006, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">What about doing the following?<br />
Setup a config file in the server where you specify pairs of IP and usernames (so that the system knows from where each user is allowed to login)<br />
Build a script that is run before calling the bshell that<br />
- gets the corresponding line of the current user/PID from a netstat -p|grep ^tcp (you can further tune to specific ports, etc.) and then compares the resulting IP against the previous list: not matched, the user is not logging in from his PC and thus is not allowed to continue<br />
<br />
This can be further tuned allowing user to login from multiple IPs or entire LANs, etc., all depends on the check script and config file.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">22nd December 2006, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">netstat -p only gives PID/login if run as root.<br />
Make a small batch script (with traps) that is run with root suid that runs a netstat -p|grep ^tcp to generate the list that the remaining bshell wrapper will use.</div></div><hr />
