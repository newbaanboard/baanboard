<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gigaman</div><div class="date">18th January 2006, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using baan erp 5.0c system. Our former system environment is base on sp12, and we make some easy customization, such as new domains and new form fileds, and then we upgrade the system to sp17. However, after upgrade, we found system error when new purchase order line. We know that is casued by conflicts among customizations and upgrade, but there is still something we are not very clear. New patchs are installed onto update VRC, which is prohibitted to user to change, and what we customized are base on customized VRC which is derived from update VRC. When upgrade finished, error occurred, and then we delete customized parts in customization VRC, we think things should be OK. But It is not. Error still exist. So we are puzzled why it still does not work? If customization VRC impacts upgrade process and causes update error? In other word, this update is not a right one? Anyone who can give me clear explanation about the error will be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

If let's say the problem occurs in tdsls4101s000 - sales order lines, it could be the conflict is in tdsls4101, or in the DAL tdsls401, or in dll tdslsdll1234 or tdslsdll4101 etc etc; could be in minimum 30 different scripts. <br />
<br />
So if you give a bit more details about your problem, your environment and your customizations, and the errors given, and at what moment they are given, then I am sure we could help you further...<br />
