<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone done anything in the area of auditing all program code changes no matter what table is used?  Or better yet a plan for standardizing programming changes.  Here's my situation:  There are four programmers making changes in both development and production environments.  When a dev. program is ready to go live, the programmer installs it.  Is there a way to track the change for the code?  I don't want to turn on auditing for every table.  But that is basically what has been asked of me.  Does anyone have any suggestions? <br />

Thanks,<br />

Changes should be made in development (never production!).  When complete, you can run a difference check between development and production to see the exact coding changes.  Also, with multiple developers especially, you should have a Development, Test and Production VRC setup.<br />
<br />
In Baan V, this has been addressed much better (not perfect) with Software Configuration Management.  This is a tools enhancement that allows developers to check out components for developement, locks the components for other developers, automates documentation of the components, and saves versions for backout.   Each developer gets their own development VRC (without company data overhead).<br />
<br />
The Baan V setup makes use of standard (windows and unix based) version control libraries....I forget the names of them.  But others have tried using the tools in Baan IV, I am not sure of the success.  You don't have to edit the scripts in Baan, and some programming tools outside of Baan may provide better version control for you in Baan IV.</div></div><hr />

But few ideas to share -<br />
<br />
You don't have to edit the scripts in Baan, and some programming tools outside of Baan may provide better version control for you in Baan IV.<br />
<br />
You can use shell scripts to make a diff/cmp across the dev/qa/prod environments to verify if the scripts are in sync or not.<br />

<br />
You can audit the tools table ttadv230 for changes.<br />

I am not sure what Lisa meant to say.<br />

I think the BaaN-5 series on Windows-NT installations do not have the SCM(Software Configuration Management Tools). Only the Unix installations has the SCM enabled. The BaaN Tools uses the Unix OS features of RCS/SCM libraries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th February 2003, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx for expanding NP - <br />
the rcs stuff is what I was thinking about.  When we installed / activated it from UNIX, we had to go find the rcs pieces from a standard UNIX download site.  If there is not something similar in NT it may not be supported on that platform.   My Baan training material doesn't mention that, but I have not tested on NT.  It requires outside libraries to run for sure.  <br />
<br />
As for the company overhead..when you use SCM, you have a checkout VRC created for you to use, but you do not need your own company.   So, little space used, just directories created and storing what you check out.</div></div><hr />
