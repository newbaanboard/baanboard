<br />
I set the BI for my customer. and it's working good.(local network and Internet Explorler):D<br />
but I received some asks from my customer.<br />
They wanna acces the ERP(Corelli) on ADSL.<br />
So I tested of it..It's also working(on static IP). <br />
but some environments make the error.<br />
May be... BI don't working on non-static IP env?<br />
I'm wondering of it.<br />
<br />
If I have to use on static IP, It's useless.:o<br />
They use the firewall and AS-400machine.<br />
they don't have DHCP Server.<br />
And I know the firewall P/W.<br />
<br />
If you have any idea of it, please let me know.<br />
<br />
regards<br />

<br />
the system is very fast and stable...I'm not a technical person but I will find out for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sbdmark</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I have setup the BI several times and it runs securely over the Internet with 5.0c.   I assume that is what you are trying to accomplish.<br />
<br />
All of your servers should have static IP's to start with.  Get a public Internet address and use NAT (Network Address Translation) to protect the BIserver.  The best way is to make a dmz off your firewall and place the server in the dmz.   This will securely protect your server and your LAN. <br />
<br />
The method that you access whether it is DSL or whatever will just affect the speed.   BI Server is not lightning fast because it uses Java, but not that bad.   You can use SSL to encrypt the connection made and it can easily run securely over the Internet for more than one customer, but port 443 has to open.   <br />
<br />
It has been a while since I did the setup, but would be glad to check it out if you would like any additional info.<br />
<br />
I have to ask why you think you need to use DHCP and a static IP presents a problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's just problem of mis understanding about it..<br />
<br />
BI is working good on all environment.(ADSL,Cable,phone etc..)<br />
<br />
there is noting to do for network ....I just need the firewall ID/PW<br />
<br />
But as you said, sbdmark...BI working on JAVA VM. <br />
<br />
So I'm worry about the speed.<br />
<br />
I don't have experience of BI on real transaction. <br />
<br />
My customer has subcontract line on China.<br />
<br />
And so will have to use ERP with BI.  <br />
<br />
Anyway ....thank you acapulco, sbdmark..<br />
<br />
bye<br />
