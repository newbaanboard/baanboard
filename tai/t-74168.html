<br />
We've encountered and issue with personalized reports.<br />
If we print the report to not physical printer everything is ok, the report shown as it should be, but when we print to a physical printer it's shown strangely.<br />
The images are not shown, only code.<br />
<br />
Is there any suggestion?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there is no problem with LN output, most probably the problem between PC-printer settings. Have you checked other standart LN reports  or with another PC, printer?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">7th January 2022, 09:00</div></div><div class="posttext">We still use classic report customization an printing to windows server printers in LN 10.7 (after migrating from LN 10.2). <br />
As far as I have researched the new report designer (personalized reports) this is based on generating pdf. So, this will not work with our given windows server printer setup.<br />
<br />
I'm planning to evaluate the possibilities with LN Transfer Service, but did not use or install LN Transfer Service yet. I know you can use printers with direct pdf output or use a pdf client to print the pdfs generated by LN.<br />
<br />
What's your printing setup looking like? Did you use the LN Transfer Service?</div></div><hr />
