<br />
we found out suspicious job processes that have the parameter &quot;-set TRACEPARBSHELL=ottstpparsrv&quot; set. I've only found one document (Tracing and Tunig Guide) on inforxtreme and nothing here!? :eek:  <br />
<br />
We have job processes like this with ps -ef on AIX:<br />
....  bshell6.2 -server -set TRACEPARBSHELL=ottstpparsrv -port=11600 -tracepid=&lt;the_pid_of_the_job&gt;<br />
<br />
Did anyone know what this parameter is exactly for (I know: tracing, but in wich case do one set it and what is the output).<br />
<br />
The docu says that something is logged in $BSE/log/log.parbshell. We have this file but there are only few entrys like &quot;Unexpected close from client received&quot;.<br />
<br />
So the Trace has, for us, no meaning. We want to know where this processes in the night come from and how we can get rid of them...<br />

<br />
Its related to Parallel Processing Mechanism.  About the log, check KB 1364681 where it has been fixed. Also, check KB 1486440.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">30th June 2016, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. That was a good hint. The session tipcs3250m000 Calculate Cost Prices by Project was was set to to use parallel processing in the mode &quot;Manual and Job Process&quot;.<br />
I now think it's not a problem and we let it all be.</div></div><hr />
