<br />
The midaemon is a process stat data collection process which runs in the background. This daemon is used by tools like glance etc. This particular process is taking up too much time &amp; starving one of the two CPUs on the system. Does anyone have any idea about what can be done?<br />

<br />
This is a known problem on some systems due to a combination of OS patches and/or Measureware/Glance versions. It can also be that the midaemon is eating CPU because it's trying to catch up reading buffers from the KI (Kernel Instrumentation) if you have an extremely busy system (many transactions). You can check this condition by looking for following messages in the scope-ux status file:<br />
WARNING:<br />
  Measurement Buffers Lost see metric GBL_LOST_MI_TRACE_BUFFERS.<br />
                                                (PE221-50)<br />
In any case you should contact your local HP Response Centre and log a call with them to have the problem investigated.</div></div><hr />
