<br />
I have manually updated the ASCII file that was created via Export Data (tuxch0233m000) with new records and I want to update the table with these new records during the Import using<br />
tuxch0223m000).<br />
<br />
I know that in order to add new records into the table during import, a condition need to be specified in Maintain Conditions (tuxch0114m000).<br />
<br />
However, I do not have the slightest idea of how to enter the condition.<br />
<br />
Can someone please help.<br />
<br />
Thks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normally, it is not needed to add conditions if you just want to add new records.<br />
<br />
In order to add records, in session &quot;Maintain Table Relations(import)&quot;(tuxch0121m000) in the form 2 there is a column &quot;Add Record?&quot;, if you select Yes, new records will be added,<br />
<br />
I hope this help you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Be forewarned when adding records to make sure all references in the table (for the new record) exist and that you satisfy the indexes of the table with unique information.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conditions are mostly used (at least at our site) for a single field, but can be written for adding or modifications of a record.<br />
<br />
But if conditions are still needed, you may want to check the BaaN support site for information on condition coding, as I know at one time there use to be a gudie/manual on exchange schemes whcih included a section on condition script coding.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have initially did what edgar_luna_h said of just to turn the flag of Add Records to YES but the new record was not updated and that's why I though a condition is needed for such function.<br />
<br />
However, I have been going thru the Baan Field Help and from what I understand, it seems maybe indicators need to be use in each record of the ASCII file to suggest if the record is to be added, updated, deleted etc. <br />
<br />
I have found the Based on Indicator field in Maintain Exchange Scheme and have set it to YES but how and where do I define which indicators for each type of function.<br />
<br />
I don't know if my assumption is correct, honestly I am lost and I don't know much of setting up conditions as well. Basically I just want to import records into a table.<br />
<br />
Anyone can pls advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already created several exchange that add records to existing tables without any problem, just taking care of the references as ssbaan said.<br />
<br />
And I was checking some on exchanges that we have and based on indicators is set to &quot;NO&quot;, control charactet y/n to &quot;NO&quot; and the separator we use &quot;;&quot;<br />
<br />
Please try this:<br />
-Create a Export Exchange with these settings for the table that you need for all fields, that you will use as a source for the import. <br />
-Once you have the ascii file, add the records that you need respecting the format,<br />
-Create the Import Exchange using the same settings.<br />
<br />
Normally this is the way that I follow and if there are errors when the import is executed, a log file is created and there you could check what happened (normally errors 606).<br />
<br />
I hope this help you.<br />
<br />
