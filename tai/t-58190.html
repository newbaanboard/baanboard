Have you used a third party product ?<br />
Have you done this through a partner ?<br />

We use FormDesigner from Hidox ...http://www.hidox.nl/en/<br />
<br />
The standard LN Invoice is pretty ugly. I can't show you our Invoice because of sensitive data, but attached are examples of our Packing Slip and Routing Sheets ...<br />

<br />
We have done it manually and are using the font replacement of bwprint.<br />
<br />
Be aware that with Solution 242467 the complete printing functionality related to invoices has been revised. Beside other changes, Report cisli220011000 (Invoices) is replaced by report cisli120011000 (Invoices).<br />
<br />
From Solution description:<br />
<br />
<br />
If one of the reports that have been replaced, has been customized, then the customization needs to be ported to the new reports<br />
<br />
<br />

dit it took a long time to customize ?<br />
Are you satisfied with the result(i think it's not possible to insert logo..).<br />
If possible what is &quot;the font replacement of bwprint&quot; ?<br />
<br />

i did it the second time. First some years ago in our 5.0c environmemt and some weeks ago as a Migration to LN.<br />
Because of the mentioned Solution i was not able to use any of the 5.0 logic so i have to build it from scratch. It took me nearly 3 weeks.<br />

<br />
You are right. We are printing our Invoices into a pre-printed Form which contains our Logo and a footer.<br />
Font replacement means you can substitute resp assign a windows font to a Baan font (f.i Baan Userfont 11 -&gt; Arial 10pt bold)<br />

<br />
It is usual to customize the reports as Infor only supply basic reports, 1 to 2 days work. With logos the easy way is to print on paper with the logo already printed.<br />
