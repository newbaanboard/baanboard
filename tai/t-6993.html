 Could anyone explain the correct difference between light and heavy users? I have got two versions to what they really are.<br />
<br />
1. Light Users only have read access and Heavy Users Both.<br />
2. Light Users are for ASCII Mode and Heavy for GUI Mode.<br />
<br />
Which one of these is true or none!! <br />
Secondly We haven't on our system really seen any difference in the kind of access users have even if our consumes licences exceeds the number of heavy Users we have.<br />
<br />
Secondly could we by any means restrict the number of licences consumed on a particular system if the licence server is shared among number of systems!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
for Baan4 and earlier there is a difference between ASCII users and GUI users. The ba6.1 is taking an ASCII license and if no one is available then the BW licence is taken. A BW user in Baan4 can only take a BW licence. If there is no longer a BW licence then the BW will not start.<br />
<br />
For Baan5 there is the light/heavy user difference but as far as I know there was never a way to define a user as light user. You are true that a light user should have been a read only user.<br />

<br />
In responce to your question about restricting the number of licences being used from one system on a network licence service, unfortunatly the answer is no.<br />
<br />
When you run a network (or multi-tier licence),  the bshell checks first the licence6.1 (2) file to find out where the licence is running. After that, the bw goes to the licence server to check if a licence is avalible. There is no way to set a &quot;trigger&quot; to prevent server 'A&quot; from using more than x number of licences.<br />
<br />
The one thing that I would recommend is to break up your network licence to two unique licences.  This would require revalidation however. Contact bvna@baan.com for info on revalidation.</div></div><hr />
