<br />
Is there a command setting (-- -set xxxxx) that can be added to a bwc file that can specify a second hostname?  <br />
<br />
Example: We have a bwc file that specifies hostname 1 (an alias which is different than the application server hostname in Help/About Infor ERP/System Info).  If you do a &quot;send to&quot; within the GUI, the .bwl file will contain the hostname of the application server and if you try to open it with your configured .bwc file, it will not &quot;find&quot; the hostname.  <br />
<br />
I know, I know, why not add another configuration to the BECS with the right hostname and it will find it.  The answer is that it's legacy and there are other factors.<br />
<br />
So, I was curious to know if there is a command that will allow the bwc file to have a setting that will switch the hostname to the application server hostname as opposed to the alias to which we have the bwc configured.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />
