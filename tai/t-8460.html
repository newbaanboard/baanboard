<br />
We are using baan4c3  on host mode on Hp-Ux with informix db backend.<br />
<br />
We are thinking to move aplication server and data server to be on defferent machines and Now we have two different choice for it ; Informix c/s or baan c/s <br />
<br />
What is the difference between two of them;<br />
<br />
Which alternative baan would be recommended?<br />
<br />
Thank you for help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The Informix client server uses a product called ICONNECT that is part of the Informix Client SDK.  In this model you will install the Informix client on the Baan application server and use an Informix connect string in the inf_storage file to connect to the database server.  The database driver will run on the application server.<br />
<br />
If you use BaanNet, you will install a small, minimal Baan environment on the database server.  The database driver will run on the database server.  The inf_storage file will simply reference a host name which will direct Baan to attempt a remote connection.  Baan users must be maintained on both servers or you must map users to a user with rights on the database server.  This is generally a more complicated environment to setup and maintain so most sites now use ICONNECT.<br />
<br />
This also has an impact on the sizing of the two systems.  ICONNECT will result in a larger application server than BaanNet.  So keep this in mind as you decide how to go forward.<br />
<br />
Both of these options are slower than host mode if you have a server able to run everything in one box (as long as you are not CPU bound).<br />

baan c/s: client = bshell, server = db driver + database<br />
<br />
Advantage default c/s: ease of configure<br />
Advantage baan c/s: better performance<br />
<br />
I always prefer full host mode and I think that much more users could benifit from it as currently installed. But when having bought a too small box and need more total CPU power an addtional box can help.<br />
Take a look at:<br />
- the CPU power on both boxes<br />
- Cpu consumption on bshell, driver and db<br />
Answers on these questions can tell you the best what to use. E.g. when having a fast db server compared to the application server and  lots of CPU free you will probably prefer baan c/s.<br />
<br />
Baan doesn't have a preference so it is up to you.</div></div><hr />
