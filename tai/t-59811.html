<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">6th January 2011, 21:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I have recently obtained new printer model HP LJ P1606dn and I have not been able to use it for printing from Baan and HPUX system.  At first, I tried printing PO and while the PO did print, 2 additional pages printed with garbage characters.  Then I created a file with one line of text and sent it to printer using unix commands and it did print the content of the file plus a few pages of garbage characters.  At this point, I concluded the problem resided between the printer and HPUX.<br />
<br />
I have been corresponding in HP forum trying to resolve this problem and have been advised the printer will not work on UNIX system because the printer is host based.  Also, the name of the installed printer server was NPI434DFB.  NPI means Network Printer Interface and this also is contributing to our problem.  Bottom line, we selected a printer that won't work in our environment.<br />
<br />
Up till now, we have successfully added remote printer to HPUX for all printers with either a print server installed in the printer or externally attached for network connection. Since the HP LJ P1606dn had a print server installed, we thought it would work.<br />
<br />
Given the technology changes, will anyone provide advise about what to avoid regarding our future selection of printers?</div></div><hr />

Could the problem not be caused by the fact that you perhaps use a printerdriver in HP-UX? Or did you use a so-call passthrough filter? Use that or a 'generic' printer. Than a normal print command on the command prompt should print the right output.<br />

Hello Joy,<br />
i've done such a wrong decision some years ago.<br />
HP LJ3500 with JetDirect interface.<br />
Thought, no problem in HP-UX11i, but Host-Based printing :-(<br />
<br />
I solved by using CUPS at a linux host.<br />
From HP-UX -&gt; via remote printing to LINUX (CUPS, Postscript driver)<br />
<br />
Maybe a option ?<br />
<br />
