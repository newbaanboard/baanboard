The application server shows the right time.  Is there a way of adjusting the time in the worktop?<br />
<br />
For example:  when running a job, it shows the job kicking off at 5:30 PM but it's really 6:30 PM on the application server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A : Yes it the same in LN as well ... all the data in database is also stored w.r.t. GMT as well ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you mean by this? Are you suggesting that all time related transactions (other than job related ones) are entered in GMT rather than using the timezone??<br />

As I guess, you are runing this job on daily basis. In session ttaad5100s000, in Period instead of 1 day, enter period as 24 Hrs.<br />
<br />
If you enter 1 day, my experiance is, 1st time job executes at 5.30 pm and finish at 6.30 pm. From next day, it executes at 6.30 pm. Where as if you enter period as 5.30 pm, daily basis it will execute at 5.30 pm only. Nothing to do with GMT timing here.<br />

   First of all, yours look like an isolated case as i have been using Baan Jobs for a long time now and havent experienced what you mentioned. I use 1 Day as the frequency/period and on a daily basis the job executes at the scheduled time. There has been a number of new jobs created recently (that runs on a daily basis) and even those executes within the scheduled time (on a daily basis). So do check your SP or settings. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the forms (Display Job History for instance) shows the correct time of execution but when one goes to the table, it shows in GMT time. <br />
