There has been developped a new license meganism called the Baan license manager. ( BLSM ) I think this is causing your problem however you should be able still to use the form license manager.. Take a close look at the documentation delivered with the servicepack and look for the changes on the license megenism.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">3rd September 2007, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hardei, you need to be carefull with installing servicepacks and portingset. You can't just install any portingset on any servicepack. Servicepacks are related to the version of you portingset and the portingset is related to the version of your operating system.<br />
<br />
First make the analyses below,<br />
<br />
To which level of servicepack do you want to upgrade ( f.i. SP20 )<br />
Which portingset is needed at least for this servicepack, <br />
Find out which current portingset you are running and if it is suitable<br />
In case you need to upgrade your portingset, find out the current level of your O.S. and check if this is suitable to run the needed portingset.<br />
<br />
Good luck again!</div></div><hr />

Did you go through the documentation of porting set 15 before installing it? Were there any pre-requisites to it? Get hold of the document and check if there is any pre-requisite solution or conditions that has to be satisfied. Last but not least, check out if they have mentioned how to uninstall this porting set...<br />
 <br />
Jp,<br />
Baan license manager, isnt that for Baan5 or Ln? Or have they started distributing it for Baan 4 too?<br />
 <br />
sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">3rd September 2007, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep SK,<br />
<br />
Baan license manager is also used for Baan 4 though you're able to use the old license meganisme too.</div></div><hr />
