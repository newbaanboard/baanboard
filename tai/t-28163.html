Refer to the session help to use the LN Tools -<br />
<br />
Generate ftp script (ttpmc2211s000)<br />
Use this session to specify some basic data required to download updates from an external server.<br />
You can download solutions using the Download, Scan and Connect Solution (Multi-Level) (ttpmc2210s000) session.<br />
The figure below shows the form of the session:<br />
<br />
Related topics<br />
PMC Introduction<br />
PMC Overview<br />
Recipient Procedure<br />
Field Description <br />
FTP Site The address of the FTP site, for example: ftp.support.baan.com. <br />
FTP User The username that is used when connecting to the FTP site. <br />
FTP Password The password that is used when connecting to the FTP site.<br />
Note<br />
The password is stored unencrypted in the $BSE/lib directory. If you are unhappy with that, you can leave this field blank. In that case, you are prompted to enter your password the moment you start downloading. However, if you do not specify a password in this field, you cannot run the Download, Scan and Connect Solution (Multi-Level) (ttpmc2210s000) session as a job. <br />
FTP Dir The directory on the FTP server from which you want to download the solutions, for example: /updates. <br />
<br />
Command Description <br />
Continue Saves the entered data into the $BSE/lib/ftpbaan file. <br />
<br />
Alternatively, you download the solutions to your desktop and ftp to your home directory  or any directory on the server, where you can scan in the PMC solutions and install them. You don't need a special FTP software to do this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">18th September 2006, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe a little bit besides the original subject of this thread, but our BaaN UNIX server does not have direct access to the outside internet, all internet access is by a proxyserver. So far I haven't found a way to let the commandline ftp program use the proxy server, hence the multi-level download script is useless to us. I found that customizing the resulting ftp script is not possible: the session checks if the script is 'hacked'. <br />
Anybody has a solution to have the standard ftp program use a proxyserver on HPUX ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

I had a similar problem - we found that there were 2 FTP servers with the same DNS entry for ftp.support.baan.com. One was being updated, the other was not..  It looks like the one has been decommissioned so ftp problems should be fixed (at least mine are...)<br />
