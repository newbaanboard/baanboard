we have a test and  a productive server. On our productive server (some user found out) it is possible to change to companies which doesn't belong to the actual PVRC. On the test Server everything is OK, it is only possible to switch to companies, which belong to the actual PVRC.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to adjust this behavior?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I checked the links. Seems to be our problem. Will check this tomorow, when I'm at the system.</div></div><hr />

Companies are linked to Package Combination and not Package VRC.<br />
If you like to stop this feature of switching between companies of different or same package combinations, then you can just give no authorization to the ttdsk2004m000 - change company session for all the normal user role authorization templates.<br />
If you like to stop their access from specific companies then you have to enable authorization for that session, and then setup company specification authorizations on the role templates. If the companies are across databases then if you dont create database users for them in the other databases, then they cant access that company info even if there is authorization to change company session or all company authorization.<br />

Above Statement is valid for BaaN-ERP/5 Series</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have experienced exactly the same thing ie. being allowed to switch to a company in a different p.comb.<br />
<br />
At the time the s/w standard in both package combinations was identical. This was because I'd created a new VRC level below the original package combination. I then generated a new package comb pointing at this new level. Before the new level was populated with s/w (ie. both combinations were identical) I was able to switch between companies in the different p comb's.<br />
This supprised me.<br />
<br />
However, once s/w was installed into the new vrc's &amp; the s/w standard in the new p.comb became different, I was unable to switch companies.<br />
<br />
So - Is the s/w standard in the 2 package combinations different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Good question!<br />
<br />
The reason for this problem is most probably that there is no difference in the data dictionary between the two package combinations.  And like cs suggests, as soon as you have a slight change in a table, the possibility falls away.  Probably it is enough to change a relation between two tables that you are not using. (Who ever uses all tables in Baan?)<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to test this in BaanERP as well.  NP, can you do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">NvanBeest has completely reason. <br />
You can switch between companies on different Pcomb only if the Pcomb data dictionary are identical. <br />
My question is - How BaaN can understand that the Pcomb are identical? <br />
The runtime data dictionary is made of a lot of ascii files (basically all the domains and table definitions) and it will take a lot of time to compare two rtdd of different pcomb. <br />
Maybe some table of the application DD take in account this? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to satisfy my curiosity, I did a company change to a company in another package combination.  And I was astonished to see the number of queries executed:<br />
<br />
1. Check package combination of new company in ttaad100<br />
2. Count the packages for the current PC in ttaad121<br />
3. Count the packages for the new PC in ttaad121<br />
4. For each package in the new PC:<br />
4.1 check for entries in ttadv400 (domains)<br />
4.2 check for entries in ttadv420 (tables)<br />
<br />
If it finds any entries in one of these last two tables, the error message is read and displayed.  Probably, if no entries are found, it will redo this query for the current PC.  And after that check whether all PVRC's in both are derived from the same parent.  And then OK the company change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to satisfy your curiousity, I would suggest you to test the following steps- :D <br />
<br />
If I add a new field in a existing table with an existing domain, will that work ?<br />
   I am guessing that it will fail as the DD are mismatched.<br />
<br />
After you make the table change try to write a small 3-gl with a select table-name.* as against select &lt;table-fields&gt; and then trap the Error-e values on the selecterror statement running this sql against both the companies.<br />
<br />
Also, what happens if I change the domain of one of the table fields?<br />
<br />
Please post your results. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

I am guessing that it will fail as the DD are mismatched. Correct.  The &quot;selectdo&quot; of the ttadv420 query will be executed, again resulting in a mismatch!<br />
<br />
then trap the Error-e values on the selecterror statement running this sql against both the companies. Error: Data dictionary mismatch!</div></div><hr />

I am on Triton and ERP. The actual Problem is from ERP. <br />
But I think the problem could be explained with the DataDictionary. This explanation meets our environment.<br />
<br />
I do not personally work with that problem. But as soon as I will know if the problem is solved or not, I will keep you informed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Victor<br />
<br />
From the testing it seems that to stop this behaviour, all is needed is to copy a domain/table to the new VRC, and create RTDD.  No changes necessary :D, since the query doesn't look for specific changes on field level.</div></div><hr />
