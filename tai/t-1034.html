<br />
We have problem on resetting license like when users hang we can not free the license even we already kill the users login and tbase.<br />
<br />
The only thing we can do to reset the license is to kill it using licmon6.1 -k. Afterwards I will  restart the license using the command:<br />
<br />
# licd6.1  sleep 60<br />
<br />
Is  killing of license will  cause  problems if there's ongoing transactions/processes on Baan?<br />
<br />
Is there any other work around available?<br />
<br />
thanks and best regards,<br />

<br />
We are using the same procedure like the one you said. In fact, we have a script which does this and this script is in crontab. It is run every morning at 6. I did not notice any problem because of that, although there were job daemons that were running. <br />
<br />
 There may be problems with users who try to connect in the timeframe between running licmon6.1 -k and licd6.1. But I guess this is not a problem for you. You should not have job daemons that start at that hour.<br />
<br />
 There is another problem that I faced: I was running session &quot;Delete Tables&quot; exaclty in the moment when the licence daemon was restarted. I got an error message &quot;No licence server available&quot; in a white bw window. But the session kept running, so everything was all right. I did not notice any other strange behaviour.<br />
<br />
 Maybe other people have seen more than me. I am looking forward to what they say.<br />
<br />
 Cordiali saluti / Best Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your licenses keep hanging due to bw failures you can use the resource parameter ds_timeout_detect (see solution 3312).<br />
<br />
If the bshell crashes you have no other possibility than resetting the licence deamon.<br />

Compare it to a program that a small memory leak. The easiest solution is indeed to have the license daemon restarted in automated way. Existing user connections should not experience any effect from the restart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We too use to restart the licence daemon via Cron during the night but found that planning engines that we left running over night would be aborted by the reset process. <br />
<br />
So you may find some existing user connections do indeed get affected.<br />
