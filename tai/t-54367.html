I was able to repair it by opening 'Add/Remove Programs', Use 'Click here for support information' and use the repair option.<br />
<br />
Or just reinstall bw.<br />

<br />
Although I dont know the exact reason for this, but we do face such error occasionaly and can be reproducable... main reason i guess is &quot;Is THE USER ADMINISTRATOR ON HIS LOCAL MACHINE&quot;<br />
<br />
Here goes our situation or our baan setup<br />
<br />
People in our co. connects through centralised worktop , they just have worktop shortcuts on their desktop, also couple of users have baan client on their machine. <br />
<br />
So when they try to connect for the first time, by first time i mean to say they were given new laptop and earlier they have never used baan on that machine ..... then they normally receive this message, and then in order to resolve the issue our Network admin has to come on to their local machine and login as Admin , since they are not the local administrator on their machine, so once he logins as admin, all he has to do is logout and let the user login via his id, and then it works without any issues.<br />
<br />
Not sure, if i confused u with my english, but the bottom line is i believe the user who is trying to execute bwc is not a Admin on his local machine, so in case if u know the local machine admin password , then just login/logout once, and that should resolve the issue. I know its not a good solution assuming u have all the users in ur co. who are NOT Admin on their machine, but till the time u dont find a solution, this workaround might work for u without need for re-installing the client.<br />
