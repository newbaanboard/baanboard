<br />
we have an aix server where there are 4 Baan environments and another server aix with one Baan environment. The two machines are in a HACMP cluster and share the Baan licence.<br />
Sometime happens that starting a bshell it spends a lot of time to connect with the application, and often it get a timeout error. So I have to kill the licence process in one of the two machines and restart it. After that everything goes fine for some days.<br />
<br />
We have done a lot of network test, but we still don't know what happens and why.<br />
<br />
Can someone have experienced the same problem or have some hints to give me?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Server A it should be: serverA,serverB<br />
<br />
On Server B it should be: serverB, serverA<br />
<br />
Additionally: think about changing from serverB/serverA to<br />
&lt;IP Address of ServerB&gt;/&lt;IP Address of ServerA&gt;<br />

<br />
we have the configuration of $BSE/lib/licence6.1 as you have described.<br />
We have also used the IP address instead of the name server, and the IP of localhost as suggested by Baan, but it didn't solve the problem.<br />

<br />
I am suspecting, that you might not have both the high availibility and network option licenced.</div></div><hr />

This is the output of licmon6.1 -B<br />
<br />
From which data I can understand if I have the high availibility and network option licenced?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
The option string tells you, which options are validated. I do not know, what the single digits actually mean, but it seems, that clients without the two mentioned options have a very short option string and clients with the options, have a string like yours.<br />
<br />
I would say, you have the two options. Obviously you can look in Baan in &quot;Maintain system configuration&quot;, but having these two options maintained is not the same as having them licenced.<br />
<br />
Still your licence seems ok.<br />
<br />
What happens, if you actually only run with one licence daemon and just start the second in case of a failover/crash?</div></div><hr />
