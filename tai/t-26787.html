<br />
We have plan to change our Baan server into a new one. We are now in service pack 7 with many solutions installed in it. <br />
<br />
My question are:<br />
1. How to move all the solutions that we have installed, the all settings that we have made in the old server into the new server?<br />
<br />
2. Do we have to make all the folder setting exactly the same as the old server?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question 1: On Unix you would just copy your BSE folder and be done with it. Because you are on windows, you should first make a duzmmy installation (to get the registry settings) and then copy your old installation on top.<br />
<br />
Question 2: Keeping the old folder structure is the most easy, but you can also change it. If you do, then you need to manually change some runtime files in $BSE/lib and also in certain Baan admin tables. This will need a good deal of Baan knowledge!<br />
<br />

<br />
Regarding your question on number 1, what do you mean by dummy installation, do i have to install Baan again?<br />
is there any manual to do that?<br />
<br />
To keeping the old folder structure, just simply copy it?<br />
<br />
Please advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as you run on windows, you will have to make an installation to get the required registry settings (for windows services etc). This is independent from the fact, wether you keep or change the folder structure.<br />
<br />
I call it a dummy installation, because you do not need to bother with any configuration steps. This is all covered, when you copy your existing Baan on top. On the installation CD you will find a document describing the installation. But it will be something of an advanture, if you have never done it before or at least have seem somebody doing it. You might seriously consider getting some outside help for an activity like that.</div></div><hr />
