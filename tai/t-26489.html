<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danielv</div><div class="date">23rd February 2006, 21:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the following scenario:<br />
1. - Baan IVc4 3-tier setup (App Server, DB Server, BW clients)<br />
2. - WebTop 4.0 installed on a different server (Web Server)<br />
3. - Need to install License Manager 2.4 to only validate WebTop 4.0, since according to Baan support BaanIVc4 does not validate through SLM, but through License daemon<br />
<br />
My questions are:<br />
1. - Where should I install SLM server?  Should it go In the Baan APP Server or in the Web Server?<br />
2. - How everybody else is validating WebTop on similar environments?<br />
3. - Does it make any sense to have a SLM failover server since if SLM server fails, the only users that would be affected are the WebTop users?<br />
<br />
Any info on regards this would be much appreciated<br />

We have a similar configuration.<br />
<br />
1. I would use the webserver because Baan IV does't use SLM<br />
2. ?? request a validation key from SSA support and install it on the SLM<br />
The SLM doesn't need much CPU power.<br />
3. If you use the webserver, it doesn't make sense because if the server is down you also don't need the SLM... .<br />
<br />
Only keep in mind that you don't need a licence for the WebTop itself but for every Baan Server where the Webtop is connecting to.<br />
I.e. we have 8 (7 and developing)  Baan Servers and so need 8 WebTop licences.<br />

this is very helpful. <br />
Somehow I understood that by installing SLM server in the Baan application I could benefit by having both applications (ERP &amp; SLM) in the same box, thus eliminating any latency from the network. But since SLM only validates Webtop there is no sense to install it on the Baan App server.<br />
<br />
thanks again</div></div><hr />
