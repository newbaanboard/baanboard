<br />
We are still in SP6 (+ weekly almost SP7) since early 2001.<br />
We have a lot of customizations, interfaces and companies on the same system. So the migration would cost about 3 monthes for 2 persons.<br />
In my company, I have difficulties to convice the deciders that the should change for the newest SP.<br />
<br />
Do you think we can go on for years in SP6 (up to 2006) ?<br />
What do you think about ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Why not?  The only reason to upgrade would be if you have a lot of problems, and these are fixed by the newer SP's.  If the system is stable, leave it!  If not, the upgrade is worth it.<br />
<br />
 (up to 2006) And beyond... as can be seen from the fact that there are :)happy:) Triton 2.2 customers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
sure it is possible to stay on SP6.<br />
<br />
If you try to convince the deciders to update you should refer to that an SP-Update is not just bugfixing but also brings functional enhancements (e.g. use of Worktop as GUI, international bank number(?)). You can find details of the enhancements in the SP documentation.<br />
<br />
Take care.<br />

<br />
You can choose to stay on a certain SP, of course.<br />
The problem is that, one day you can find a problem and BGS tells you to install a solution that is in SP12, for example. <br />
Just imagine the solution has a few precedences, that have a few precedences, and so on. This happens a lot... <br />
<br />
If that is the case, that means big trouble...You are going to have to install a few hundresd solutions with no time to test, or install the full SP's in a hurry. Not a good scenario.<br />
<br />
So, my advice is to install two SP's a year, trying them first on the test server, taking our time. This way you'll be better defended.<br />

P.S.: I noticed you are based in France How did you migrate to the EURO? The minimum SP for the migration was SP7...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">With lots of customizations, SP's are a real pain.  Apart from the time needed, it sometimes happens that Baan reintroduces old bugs, therefore needing yet another SP! And it has happened to  me in the past that Baan closed a call &quot;due to the customer not using the correct procedures&quot;, so the issue was solved with a customization.  The next SP however, included the fix we needed in the first place, so the customizarion could be dropped.  Unfortunately, the &quot;fix&quot; was not complete, resulting in even worse problems!<br />
<br />
Maybe Baan should invest in tools to make detection of problems with regard to upgrading a customized system easier.<br />
<br />
P.S.: I noticed you are based in France How did you migrate to the EURO? The minimum SP for the migration was SP7...Not everybody used the &quot;standard&quot; migration tool.  And for a short period the migration software was available as a stand-alone dump as well. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are talking about the drama of using software nowadays...The problems are always the ones you describe. If you think Baan is buggy...you should ask people around you. All the software is buggy nowadays.<br />
<br />
In my view, you have no alternative to always try to migrate and try to be as current as possible. If not you'll pay a higher price later...<br />
<br />
But, in the end it is just a question of faith and philosophy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, if you have a software problem and you are behind with installing sp's, you give support a possiblity to state that you first have to install the latest solution first. The other side is that if you allways install all weekly dumps from baan, you're the victime of all the new bugs.<br />
<br />
Realizing this, I made my own installation procedure, which enables me to install the latest solutions, while still controlling what might be the consequence of it.<br />
<br />
Procedure:<br />
- download and scan weekly dumps every week<br />
- use a query on pmc tables to get a list of solutions that can be installed without installing other solutions (dependency), also stating type of solution (script or table change)<br />
- check the components and the short description of the solution using pmc, check on customization<br />
- for the more important sessions and &quot;heavy&quot; solutions, check knowledge base on latest solutions<br />
- install solution<br />
<br />
This takes up time every week (about 1 hour), but at the end there is no problem in installing sp's (installing sp13 took me about 15 secs). You might consider to only scan weekly dumps up to 4 weeks ago, and to write a query to get a list of solutions by component (sessions).<br />

<br />
Since there is no more user-club in France, the BaaN-Board forums are really gratifying. It's the best source of information with the BaaN Hotline.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">15th September 2003, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We use a same sort of procedure as kbartelds, also having created our own query that lists solutions that need updates on customized components, and/or solutions that can be installed without effecting any customizations. <br />
From the results of the survey BaaN did about PMC usage, I understood they will improve the PMC tool on this functionality.<br />

<br />
You have to think that in few years it´s possible that BaaN try to close the support of BaaN IV and in this moment you will have to migrate to BaaN V o highier and this wil be the big change.<br />
<br />
If yu change to SP12 now, you will have a lot of customization to rewrite, sure. I know because we had to do it.:(</div></div><hr />

Or, like the Triton 2.2 customers, you could stop paying licence fees, and happily stay with BaanIV till the end of the company!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaime_Lopez</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">It´s ok.<br />
<br />
But one question: If your licences daemon doesn´t work because you have change the ethernet card or you have to change the machine?<br />
<br />
Will BaaN generate a new code of a system withour support? I don´t believe it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">No idea about the new licence codes!  Maybe somebody else could clarify this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmorais</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I think baan will send you the licence key.<br />
<br />
I had a couple of situations where the installation was in SP7 or SP8 and they made no problem of it.<br />
<br />
In my point of view, licencing is one thing, support is another. Will they risk losing a customer?<br />
