does anyone know how is composed the message ID of  the eMessage connector? <br />
The Infor Enterprise Server eMessage Administration Guide writes: &quot;The message ID is a 40 character string max. The first 10 characters is the UTC date and time (...) followed by a &quot;.&quot;. The next five characters are the bshell pid (mod 99999) ..&quot; and so on, but it's clear that the message ID is something different as it appears like this: CC8D0E76-6ED1-431A-9F9B-1C64CBF6A1F7.<br />
<br />
I know the message ID is the name of the folder where I can find the file header.xml to get the email subject, the attachment name and the recipient name: cmf.get* functions already can do it. <br />
If the mail generated by the DOM are sent via eMessage connector, can I find a &quot;direct and unique&quot; link between the DOM document (batch, document id, distribution id and destination id) and the CMF message? The DOM distribution date could be helpfull in finding the corresponding CMF message. So, here comes the question: does the message ID contain useful information to get the linked DOM mail?<br />
If the answer is no, it's still possible to find a relation between the CMF messages and the DOM mails, but better asking before re-inventing the wheel.<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
