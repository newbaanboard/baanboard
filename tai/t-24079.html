<br />
 A user has full table level access to tcibd001 table in Baan Vc. I've created a table level role and attached it to his username. <br />
I dont want him to access only one field. So, I created another role (at table field level) and gave him read only access only for that field. Then, Attached the second role to the user and did a convert runtime for the user and the role as well.<br />
<br />
The user is still able to modify that specific field. Is there a precedence set here ? Do I have to give access to each and every single field of this table to this user, individually... kinda laborious<br />
What am I missing out.... is there a better way to do ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

Do I have to give access to each and every single field of this table to this user, individually Yes.</div></div><hr />
