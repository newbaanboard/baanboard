<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SriksAdi</div><div class="date">19th February 2005, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I have installed Baan on a lap top with Windows 2000 server.<br />
I could not connect to Baan, I keep getting the message Connection to server lost. Error 10053.<br />
<br />
I have checked out various post on baanboard, most of the posts talk abt this error when, the server is being acessed from a remote location.<br />
<br />
In my case, the server and the client are one and the same. What is the possible solution for this problem.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">21st February 2005, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">This error can be produced by a number of components.<br />
First there is your winsock (even though you are running locally, you may be looping your requests over the net).<br />
Then there is SQL Server (attempting to write a null where it isn't allowed).<br />
<br />
Since you say it is related to a disconnect, I assume it is in the first category and as such it is more of a notification than an error. It basically says that you're connection was lost before a close signal was received.<br />
<br />
Check your database settings and make sure you run everything locally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SriksAdi</div><div class="date">23rd February 2005, 06:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Francesco,<br />
The installation is on Oracle 9i, hence the problem with SQL Server doens't arise.<br />
I could not figure out the problem, I have reinstalled OS, Database and Baan.<br />
<br />
I could connect to Baan, but it was for a small amount of time.<br />
<br />
While I was tring to install SCM extenstion through the Update CD, I could not connect again. It started giving me error OS 997. <br />
<br />
I persume problem with Winsock, but donno how to fix it. Is it possible to install new set of winsock related dlls ?<br />

Do you have your W2K laptop setup as a domain controler?<br />
<br />
If so, check out this KB article:<br />

Actually I am also new to this message.<br />
<br />
When I gone through Ora Docs, I found following description. Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
ORA-00053: maximum number of enqueues exceeded <br />
Cause: An operation requested a resource that was unavailable and the enqueue list for the resource had reached its maximum length. If a request is made for a resource that is unavailable, the request is enqueued to wait for the resource. The number of requests that may be queued for a given resource is specified by the initialization parameter ENQUEUE_RESOURCES. When this maximum is reached, no more requests may be added to the enqueue list. <br />
<br />
Action: Try the operation again in a few minutes. If this message occurs often, shut down Oracle, increase the ENQUEUE_RESOURCES parameter in the initialization parameter file, and restart Oracle. <br />
<br />

I am not sure if W2K is a domain controler. I have gone thru the MS Support text, it needs SP4 for the fixes. I have installed SP4 which is the latest availabe SP of W2K.<br />
<br />
Suhas,<br />
Where do I find the ENQUEUE_RESOURCES parameter ?<br />

Since a couple of mounths we're facing a similar problem. Our clients are on XP and out of the blue, november 2004, we got this 10053 error message. Baan send us solution 105481. It didn't solve our problem, but maybe it solves yours.<br />

I have checked the solution and tried to implement at my end. I could notice that the solution taks abt. the problem when the connection to the server from a remote location.<br />

Just check in initbaan.ini, which may be located at d:\orant\database (location may change).<br />
