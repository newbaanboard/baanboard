<br />
How are you patching Baan IVc4?<br />
Are you applying the weekly dumps? <br />
Are you doing it as they are released or waiting a bit?<br />
Are you not using the dumps and waiting for SP's?<br />
Pros and cons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">telgar</div><div class="date">30th May 2002, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Only applying patches as needed.  Service packs on a 6 month basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">30th May 2002, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">On the servers we manage we download/scan the weeklydumps on a regular basis just to have the solutions available.<br />
<br />
We do regular patch installations (first on test and then on live after confirmation if all is OK). A Service Pack is installed once a year maximum - we are mostly on SP6 (one is on SP4).<br />
<br />
The philosophy is: &quot;if it's not broken, don't fix it&quot;.<br />
Also, any ServicePack is only installed usually after 6 months or later (like I mentioned, we're still at SP6 official level...)<br />
<br />
I would say that pros of keeping up will be having the latest fixes on your system and be up-to-date<br />
The con's are all the rest (like bad fixes, handle customizations, fixes you don't need, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
On our testserver:<br />
Every week, when a weekdump is downloadable, i install it into 1 testcompany. <br />
A second testcompany, the software has the same status as  our 'live'-server. (Because of testing archiving)<br />
<br />
On our 'live'-server:<br />
About 4 times a year, we do an upgrade by installing the weekdumps.<br />
Sometimes individual patches are installed<br />
<br />
Pro: a. If we face a problem in 'live' we are able to investigate, if it is also in the updated testcompany. If it exists, we register a case at once and BaanSupport can do their work.   <br />
        b. I have not to take a look into the Knowledge Base, because all the solutions are installed.<br />
<br />
Con: (On 'live'-server) Because of installing several weekdumps at once: TOOLS solutions are installed too. I get problems with that. (P.e. no dependencies on standarddll's, but Baan is working on that item)</div></div><hr />
