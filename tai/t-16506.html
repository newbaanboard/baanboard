<br />
did I understand you correctly, that you would like to change the domain length of for the item description? Domain tcdsca?<br />
<br />
I would not recommend that, since this domain is used at extremly many places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">9th September 2004, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I think that  when you change  tcdsca properties , this causes chaging all of item properties that used it. I think that you must examine your system data properties. According to its usage may be it won't affect the system . You can use maintain domain for  your resourcing. In my opinion , you should create your domain , don't customize standart domain of BAAN ...<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
i totally agree with Mr Suleyman, only customize domains if there is absolutly no other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maxime</div><div class="date">10th September 2004, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Even Creating your own customized domain for tcdsca will be a problem because you will still have to go and change the domain in all the reports that will be using the Item Description.<br />
<br />
Since you have to do the dirty work anyway, the best thing is to do a where used domain and list out the number of reports/forms that you have. That way you can go ahead and create a new domain and link it to whereever it is applicable.<br />

<br />
Thaks for all your recommend. Actually I tried to extend its length from 30 to 50 (jus t for testing in separeted VRC) and test some reports without modify any program or recompile. I found most of reports and forms look ok. But I'm not sure is there any  object get effect. Just to share with you.<br />
Many Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">13th September 2004, 04:43</div></div><div class="posttext">An approach that I have seen work with out to much trouble is to leave the domain and table alone but add a new table with item/cntr key and a description field with a new domain. (60 char in my experience).  The item maintenace program needs a small mod to maintain the new table and the existing field.  (The existing 'dsca' field was the same as the first 'dsca' (30) characters of the new field.)<br />
<br />
I think you will find that the 'dsca' field is already truncated on many reports. This leads me to the proposition that the long field will not be absolutely necessary on all reports where description is printed / displayed.<br />
Therefore it will be necessary to change only a few programs where the long description is really necessary.  (This assumes that the description will be entered in a sensible manner (NATO coding would be fine)<br />
<br />
Using this approach you can minimise the extent of customisation required and provide the long description where ever it is really required. This will ease the pain of version upgrade in the future.<br />

<br />
Baan told me once that if you modify a domain or a label, all form-objects will be copied into your customisation VRC when you run the next Create Runtime Data Dictionary for Forms and Menus.<br />
<br />
Have a look at the objects in your system (Display Dumps by Form &quot;ttadv3538m000&quot;).</div></div><hr />
