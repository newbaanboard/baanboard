<br />
We plan to migrate huge (approx 100,000 items and 10 levels of BOM) data by using exchange schemes. We would like to know what are the likely pitfalls to be taken care off. We are on ERP Ln6.1 SP3.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />

AFAIK, the best way to import that many records into baan is by using Exchange Schemes. They take care of the references and only lets you push in data if all the existing criss-cross references are met. So i am not sure what pitfall do you expect by using exchange schemes....<br />
 <br />
The major things to take care of before you import would be to make sure all the item codes exist, the data fits in comfortably into the appropriate fields (the importing layout should be the same as the data layout), insert the bottom level up (low level Boms to be imported before the top level), take care of enums and date fields, etc. <br />

<br />
To avoid a lot of troubles pay attention to the alignemnt of field values. The best thing would be to align at least the key fields values in a import condition. You can use the command &quot;tt.align.according.domain()&quot; for it.<br />

By &quot;Low level BOMS&quot; - suppose we have 3 levels in a BOM do we refer to level 1 items as low level items or level 3 items  as low level items - I suppose it is level 3 , but just want to confirm the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I  am stuck with the problem while uploading the BOM thru exchange scheme , only the child item with first position number is getting uploaded. For the remaining child items the log file has an error message - &quot;Item Production Data Not found for Items&quot;. But I checked the tables and find that data exists in tables. Any ideas where the problem could be.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">26th December 2007, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
  If the Bom structure were to be in the following fashion<br />
ItemA<br />
||-- ItemB<br />
|||-- ItemC<br />
.. where ItemC belongs to ItemB which inturn belongs to ItemA then ItemC is considered to be the lowest or ground level. You should be entering all ground level boms ahead of its upper level (ItemB &amp; ItemA in my example) Bom. So you could import the Boms in three different attempts. First attempt for the lowest level, second for the middle level and third for the top level. This could be also done by placing all the lowest entries together and on top, followed by the group of middle level boms and the bottom of the text file filled with top level Bom. <br />
<br />
As far as the error is concerned, are you sure the scheme layout is correct for the table you are importing into? Run the SQL Profiler while creating a BOM manually and check which all tables are being updated. <br />

Many Thanks for the help. Regarding the error yes you guessed it right the scheme layout was incorrect. Thanks again on that. <br />
