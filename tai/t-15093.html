<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">20th April 2004, 14:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for some setup clues. Some of our users are able to use an EMAIL device we've created to take a Baan print output as a Word RTF attachment to an Outlook email message. Others of our users are not. We've tested this in various configurations and it appears to be related to the workstation and Outlook configuration and not the Baan user setup. <br />
<br />
For instance, the email option works on my workstation but not on the station of another IT guy down the hall regardless of the network or Baan active userid. It works for a user in the office next to mine but not for another two doors down.<br />
<br />
We've done nothing specific in the Outlook configurations to allow this - it just seems to either work or not work. I'm hoping someone has had some experience with configuring Outlook to accept the call to create a message with the RTF attachment.<br />
<br />
Baan does generate an RTF attachment, it just doesn't trigger the call correctly to Outlook - either that or Outlook isn't processing the call correctly.<br />
<br />
Our EMAIL device is set up this way.<br />
<br />
4GL Program: ttstpconv<br />
Argument: RTF_landscape:outlook.exe %s<br />
Path: outlook.rtf</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you like to program it, then refer to the link - eMessage Connector examples (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_emessage_connector_examples)</div></div><hr />

Yes, the Baan device works for us because it works for a few of us. It appears to be the Outlook settings on the errant workstations that are incorrect. The question is if someone knows the particulars of the Outlook settings? We have no particular insight into the Outlook settings.</div></div><hr />

It didnt work for us long time ago and we had to upgrade with newer BW version which has the file - C:\Program Files\Baan\Baan Windows\bin\cmfuiadap.exe which actually handles the outlook interface and also some tools patches for the ttcmf dlls, objects.<br />
<br />
You would have to log a case with BaaN support or upgrade with patches and newer versions of BW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">21st April 2004, 07:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Rao,<br />
what version of Outlook do you use ?<br />
Tried to set up cmf a while ago but the cmfuiadap.exe always caused an error (Dr. Watson comes up).<br />
We still use Outlook 97 and Baan Support told us that only versions from Outlook 98 upwards are supported. Can you confirm this?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">21st April 2004, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of our desktops are on Windows-NT, 2000, XP and on Microsoft Outlook 2000, 2002, XP.<br />
<br />
I guess that might be true statement, I know that 2 years ago when many of our desktops had Windows-95, 98 and older BW versions it never worked and we also had issues with BW print etc.<br />
<br />
So I think you have to get newer BW versions, tools patches and also updated the OS, Office releases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just so you know, our users who cannot execute the Outlook function do have current BW clients and do have the cmfuiadap.exe executable on their desktops. <br />
<br />
I'll probably post a case with Baan Support for their guidance. Thanks for your insights.<br />

Just change the argument in device data to -<br />
RTF:outlook.exe %s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">27th April 2004, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Also change your page length from 49 to 66 for portrait.  Also make sure that the User Defaults as setup with their Mail addresses.</div></div><hr />
