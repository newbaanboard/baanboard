<br />
Recently I have setup open suse 10.2 linux and then through wine application I have installed Baan client for linux os.  It is installed and running well (I have not made any entry) from Suse now, it seems that everything working fine, but I have noticed one problem and that is on every form and menu,  icon image does not display it is displays as just black blank square. <br />
<br />
Is there any way to overcome this problem ? <br />
<br />
Is there any other issues related with Baan linux client ?<br />
<br />
With Thanks !<br />

I never understood why users with Linux on the desktop and some form of Unix on the server bother with wine. Why don't you simply logon to your solaris server, export the X display and start bx6.1?<br />
<br />
By using something like ssh and some scripting, you would not need to enter a password even.<br />
