<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms</div><div class="date">21st April 2002, 03:53</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand it,  in Unix to cancel a print request there is a command &quot;cancel &lt;request-id&gt;&quot; where reqeuet id is the id returned from lpstat -t.<br />
e.g. lpstat -t o/p is :<br />
 <br />
prt_zeb1 accepting requests since Mar 14 15:28<br />
<br />
printer prt_zeb1 now printing prt_zeb1-82.  enabled since Apr 13 14:50   fence priority : 0<br />
prt_zeb1-82       mfor          priority 0  Apr 14 13:15 on prt_zebra1  fileout  25953 bytes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When I am  trying to cancel a queue and I get the message :<br />
 request &quot;prt_zebra1-108&quot; non-existent <br />
<br />
Also, when I am trying to print through SAM, I am getting the same message.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions of how do i remove such a queue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">21st April 2002, 22:38</div></div><div class="posttext">a. From your inputs, your cancel command should have been:<br />
<br />
cancel prt_zeb1-82<br />
<br />
[There is no such request ID such as 'prt_zebra1-108' in the queue.]<br />
<br />
b. If there was indeed a report 'prt_zeb1-108' being printed, the situation can been explained as follows:<br />
i.: You are typing in a wrong request ID.<br />
or <br />
ii.:<br />
- The size of the report is too small.<br />
- Between the time you run the lpstat -t command to get the request ID and actually issue the cancel command, the whole thing is out of control of the UNIX system and is sitting in the Zebra Printers own buffer.<br />
- Therefore, you get the message that there is no such request.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i noted the request-ids wrongly.<br />
<br />
lpstat -t gives me:<br />
<br />
prt_zebra1-82    mfor     priority 0  Apr 21 15:49 on prt_zebra1         fileout     25953 bytes<br />
<br />
to cancel the queue I am giving the command :<br />
cancel prt_zebra1-82<br />
<br />
Here I am getting the message:<br />
cancel: request &quot;prt_zebra1-82&quot; non-existent.<br />
<br />
I get the same message if I am using SAM to cancel the queue.<br />
<br />
Also, I have switched  &quot;OFF&quot; my zebra printer so that anything in the zebra printer buffer is clear.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ??</div></div><hr />

<br />
This may be stupid, but I do suppose you are running SAM as root login and not doing an 'su'. The last time I was dabbling in 'lp' and 'cancel' and their 'relatives', they were bit fussy about 'ownership' of the print requests, except when you were logged in as 'root' (I mean, really logged in as 'root').<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that, I think you may need help from someone more qualified than me right now. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The command i'm using on UNIX as root is:<br />
<br />
For all jobs for a printer:<br />
qcan -P&lt;printername&gt;<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
for a specific job for a printer:<br />
qcan -P&lt;printername&gt; -x&lt;jobnr. in the queue&gt;<br />
<br />
p.e. qcan -PP120001 -x150<br />
<br />
If you do on UNIX the command qcan -?, you will see some info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">forsms, what kind of printer is your zebra printer? Is it set up as a remote or network printer? Check the /var/spool/lp/request subdirectory for your zebra printers and see if there any data and/or control files left. You could try by deleting any of these. Also try to stop and restart the lpsched process. Worst case would be to do a lp spooler kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms</div><div class="date">29th April 2002, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for ur inputs !!!<br />
<br />
The zebra printer is a normal(but ver old :) ) label printer.and is set up as a  network printer and networked through UNIX.<br />
<br />
I have removed all the files in  /var/spool/lp/request/prt_zebra1 directory; but still when I have given a fresh set of labels to be printed, it is still printing the leftover stuff of last queue.<br />
<br />
<br />
lpshut can be used to shutdown the printer; but how to restart?<br />
<br />
what is  &quot;lp spooler kick &quot;????<br />
<br />
i know there is a lot of question and appreciate the contributions being made..<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">30th April 2002, 00:39</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Try deleting/recreating the queue but that will probably fail due to pending requests in the spooler<br />
<br />
2) Restarting the LP scheduler: lpsched -v<br />
<br />
3) LP spooler kick: I have to lookup the correct procedure but it's something you should try as a LAST RESORT. If it goes wrong, you will be at the mercy of HP Support :)<br />
<br />
Did you check all LP log files?:<br />
 /var/adm/lp/log<br />
 /var/adm/lp/lpd.log<br />
 /opt/hpnp/tmp/*</div></div><hr />
