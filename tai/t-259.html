<br />
From triton3.1 to Baan IV is pretty straight forward, I believe it's mainly changing a package combination and run some programs afterwards (which are in the standard menu). The tools version is the same and in the table layout hasn't changed. There should be a document about the right procedure, I guess that it will be delivered with the Baan IV software.<br />
<br />
However due to data and or customizations anything can go wrong, but of course all that can be solved. You definitely should run a few tests in order to find the correct procedure, you will have to test your customizations, procedures etc. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">11th October 2001, 02:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Julia, the migration from Triton 3.1b to Baan IVc3 that I was involved in as project manager and Baan sysadmin was also fairly straightward.<br />
<br />
It took a couple of programmers several weeks to migrate code customizations (only a couple involved Baan source code which the company didn't have the rights to so we have to work through another company who did).  The company wanted to bring over all of their existing customizations and add-ons as none were replaced/obsoleted by Baan IV.  This part wasn't rocket science but mostly tedious work looking at the compare pkg vrc output and working with end users to test and confirm forms and reports.<br />
<br />
The data migration went pretty well.  The hardest part was getting the migration to complete over a weekend as the company had 50+ gigabytes of tfgld tables.  We had to do several performance tweaks, scripts, &quot;C&quot; program to convert tfgld tables, etc. to get the throughput to an acceptable level.  The longest process ending up running for around 60 hours.<br />
<br />
The other data issue that comes to mind without having to review my project issues list, is that the standard Baan td conversion program didn't properly convert the Sales Statistics tables as there was a field alignment issue which Baan finally admitted to once we provided them with the data to prove this.<br />
Once we patched the conversion program, the SST data was able to be reported on by the SST sessions.<br />
<br />
All in all, it went very well (on time and under budget).  Much of this is attributable to the fact the I made sure we had 2-3 test conversion runs of the production companies built into the plan.   We also ran several mini test runs on of the smaller companies to prove out our processes before the major conversion test runs.<br />
<br />
If you have any specific issues or concerns, please post a reply or feel free to send an e-mail.<br />
<br />

Sincerely,<br />
