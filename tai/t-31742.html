<br />
I have already gone thru that post...!!.<br />
<br />
Now what I specifically need is to flash message to users who have opened some particular specific session.<br />
<br />
say for example.. I need to flash a message to only those users who have opened the session &quot;Maintain Item Master (tiitm0101m000)&quot;..<br />
how to achieve this<br />
<br />
The logic would be something like:<br />
1) Get list of users who have opened the session..<br />
2) Generate message<br />
3) Send the message to the specific users..<br />
<br />
(now the challange is how to get list of users who have opened the session ?.. may be use bshcmd -p.. but that would require to get the pid of all the active users and then searching)<br />
<br />
And how to send the message using ottstppollmess to a specific user (not all users)</div></div><hr />

Another command I know is the Windows &quot;net send&quot;:<br />

<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<br />
I am aware that net send is one of the options. But it requires that all the PCs on which the baan users are working should be part of a Windows domain and it is implemented at all locations. <br />
(suppose Baan is being used by C&amp;F agents at warehouses, generally all these PCs are not part of any organizations domain)<br />
<br />
And suppose person A with windows and baan login x opens a Baan session on some other pc where the login used to log-into windows domain is y, and later he uses his x login to start Baan he would never receive the message using net-send (to the user login name). In that case we will require to get the ip-address of the client machine on which the user is logged in and send the message to that particular ip-address. Also the windows messenger service should be functional... (there is too much to handle.) Hence the better way would be to some how pass the message via Baan connection using pollmess..<br />
<br />
But before all that how to solve this requirement ....<br />
&quot;what I specifically need is to flash message to users who have opened some particular specific session.&quot;<br />
<br />
Any ideas....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">28th February 2007, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">By activating the  history' (ttams110.hist = tcyesno.yes via session ttams1110m000) there will be a logging of each session any user started. The log can be viewed from within Baan via session ttaad2402m000, or directly in the file ${BSE}/lib/time.his . <br />
<br />
The biggest disadvantage and &quot;handicap&quot; of this feature I find, is the fact that the records are only updated to the file time.his upon the user closing the session (probably since it provides a start- AND end time, and in order to reduce writing activity). So if a user opens a session at 9am and leaves it open till 11am, the logging will be available in time.his only at 11am.<br />
<br />
So depending on your needs and also the type of session (some sessions are normally ran and closed immediately, some activate and disactivate a different session, so these are logged right away during runtime and monitor an accurate situation, etc) you might want to use this standard Baan-feature.<br />
<br />
Two remarks to be careful with when using history:<br />
<br />
1)  Depending on the amount of users (and activity), time.his will grow rapidly. It is therefor recommended to clear up the file on a frequent basis. You can do this manually (you could just remove the entire file time.his for instance every weekend), or via the standard Baan-session ttaad2202m000, which is recommended, because you can filter the selection to remove for instance all records from &gt; 2 weeks old...<br />
<br />
2) When you activate time.his, make sure that your users have writing rights to the file. When not, only the first user who closes a session, i.e. first who writes a record to the file, will get the full rights. All the others will not be able to write to the file, yet no error indicating this will be displayed. The result can be very nasty, when you actually need to consult the time.his for a certain user and then find out this user's history was never logged to the file...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a bit...<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
