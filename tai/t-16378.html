<br />
I'm curious if anyone out there has any sample device drivers for HP laserjet printers, printing from AIX.  We've tried using the standard ones Baan provided, and have run into some problems.  <br />
<br />
Appreciate any feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The problems thusfar include unrecognizable characters printing in place of the lines.  Also, landscape printing wraps at the same character width as portrait. <br />

Appreciate any feedback or advice.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">27th August 2004, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there some one from Nilfisk-Advance (http://www.nilfisk-advance.com) on the board? About five years ago I had a brief consulting stint at that company. The solution turned out to be something in the way the printers were setup in AIX. If memory serves me correctly no changes had to be made to the HP drivers supplied by Baan.<br />
<br />
The problems we had were with the line spacing and line drawing characters.<br />
<br />
Here is one way to troubleshoot your problem. Run the code from http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=5824. You should have an output file. FTP the file with binary option to the windows system and then issue a copy command as follows:<br />
<br />
copy sourcefile \\printserver\printer /b<br />
<br />
If the printout looks good, then you know that the printer setup in Unix is the culprit.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the help.  I ran the script and the printout turned out fine, indicating the problem is most likely in the printer setup. I'm having my unix admin have a look and we'll try it with some different setup options.  If you have any specifics regarding the printer setup, please let me know.<br />
<br />
I really appreciate the help.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Post the device setup of the printer in Baan from session ttaad3100s000.</div></div><hr />

I need to read your responses more clearly :).<br />
landscape printing wraps at the same character width as portrait. <br />
<br />
That is a clear indication that the lp command is formatting the file you are passing it. <br />
<br />
O' Mighty Unix Gurus!<br />
What does Thomas need to do so that lp does not do any additional formatting.<br />
<br />
Will -oraw work?<br />
<br />
While the Gurus think about it, how about changing your device queue to:<br />
lpr -Pgna_pr05 -t -#%d %s<br />
Try that incantation first at the command prompt.</div></div><hr />

Appreciate all the help.  We've pretty much resolved the issue.  There is a printer setting in AIX called Printer File Type, or something along those lines.  Anyhow, there are 5 options, ASCII, PCL, Postscript, Passthrough, and one that I can't recall.  The printer was setup with the ASCII option, so on a hunch, we changed it to passthrough.  This changed corrected the formatting problems we were having. My guess is that the passthrough option suppressed any internal formatting done by the lp command and let the device drivers control the format.  We still have a minor issue with a blank page printing after each report, which we're currently working on.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Can I request you to document this in the Wiki.</div></div><hr />
