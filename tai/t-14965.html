<br />
When I was updating a record by ttaad4100 the computers turn off!!! then when the system started I try again to update the record, but when I press ctrl + z appears the next error:<br />
<br />
Record Closed try again  or in spanish registro cerrado intente nuevamente.<br />
<br />
I try to delete applications locks but there are nothing there!!<br />
<br />
I don't know what must I do.. :mad:<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

This would be a database lock, not a Baan Application Lock, so deleting the Appl. locks will not help.<br />
<br />
Either someone is using the record in Baan somewhere, or it is a hung / stuck lock as a result possibly of your last effort to update the record when your PC went down.<br />
<br />
The catch all for this is to stop and restart Baan.  You can try from the database end to see the cause, but probably not solve. <br />
<br />
Search the forums on 'Record Locked' to see a couple popular threads on this topic.  Mostly saying stop / restart.<br />
<br />
Maintaining in GTM should not be the cause of your PC going down - maybe some system tables??  What table were you trying to update?</div></div><hr />
