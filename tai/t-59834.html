<br />
I would like to know your opinion of the following options:<br />
1. install solution &amp; feature pack only when it is required<br />
- this is the approach that I am taking right now. We only install solution after reporting a problem and proposed by Infor Support.<br />
- there are many ERP administrator practicing this approach<br />
<br />
2. install the latest solution/FP in a monthly/annually basis <br />
- this is the approach strongly recommended by Infor Support<br />
- I only have 1 reference administrator using this approach<br />
<br />
What is the approach recommended by you ? and the reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much !<br />

1) nothing breaks<br />
2) if something breaks there is an already published solution that will fix it.<br />
3) the solution and it's dependencies won't cause more problems.<br />
4) the thing that's broken isn't needed &quot;RIGHT NOW&quot;.<br />
<br />
In a small environment, that's probably acceptable and may actually be the only way you can go. <br />
<br />
Effectively:<br />
(The cost of installing a patch) &gt; (The cost of not having a critical business process for the length of time it takes to patch, and any additional process that break due to the patch)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, most IS managers feel that way, additionally in many of those environment the following is true as well: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yearooichuah</div><div class="date">11th January 2011, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Dave for the analysis. <br />
<br />
I believe you are implementing option 2 in your environment. What is the likelihood of problems with the new solution that need to be transferred to the development and how long they normally take to provide a cure ?<br />
<br />
In average I need to wait for 1 month. I am interested in option 2 but this is one of my concern. Another concern is the amount of effort that key users need to perform the monthly testing. Do you have such concern ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">11th January 2011, 09:58</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact there is a considerable risc of breaking a running system when installing all solutions blindly. So, I would not recommend that.<br />
<br />
With LN, I would recommend installing the most recent feature pack every 2-3 years (depending of the customizations you have - the more standard sources you modified, the less often you will install feature packs, since its some work to do).<br />
<br />
A new feature pack is a major test point that you have to treat like a new software version. Your users will have to extensivly test their processes. So, install the feature pack and solutions for this feature pack up to two or three month before the current date. Not *all* solutions that are avaiable, since the newest ones may contain bugs. Install like this, test, and if an issue arises, install only the solutions you need to resolve that issue.<br />
<br />
Now, assume you install a feature pack every three years. Installing a solution a year after the feature pack may already become cumbersome. So at least after 1 1/2 years you should do a test installation of all solutions currently available (but again, not up to date, but up to two month before now), let the users test(!) this patch level, install additional solutions as needed and then switch the live system to that patch level. <br />
<br />
So, I would recommend to have a basic patch level that's not older than 1 1/2 years, upgrade that level every 1 1/2 years, and then install solutions only when needed. I would not let this basic patch level go much older, since otherwise, when you urgently need to install a solution, you will have so many depenend ones, that you basically will change the whole software without being able to properly test it.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />

<br />
Thanks for the analysis. <br />
<br />
Your approach is less drastic as the option 2 and more proactive than option 1. However by referring to the reasons provided by Dave above, it is also very logical. My management (non-IT) was convinced by Infor that the option 2 is the ideal approach. Since you are a consultant, do you happen to see any of your customers using option 2 smoothly ?<br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">11th January 2011, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have a customer doing it on a monthly basis (on live environments). Of course they are probably downloading and scanning the solutions with PMC, but they are not installing it. Is Infor support really suggesting to *install* all new solutions on a monthly basis? I can agree with doing it ~yearly (as stated above), provided you do it on a test system first and test the basic processes at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">11th January 2011, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave has good points.<br />
<br />
We install the weekly patches regularly, and porting sets every quarter. If there is a bad patch the probability of finding it and uninstalling it is manageable when you have a good environment upgrade path (Sandbox -&gt; Dev -&gt; QA/Test -&gt; Prod). If you find an issue with particular patch in sandbox you can open a Support ticket and work with them and retest a new patch before you apply the bundle to the other environments. <br />
<br />
If you install all the patches in a big bang fashion, then its hard to isolate which one was the bad patch to uninstall. Doing the regular patching also reduces the number of pre-requisites and downtime during the Feature Pack upgrades.<br />
<br />
Note - The above statements are referring to the Tools (tt, ta, tl) patches/feature packs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">12th January 2011, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Tools patches are somewhat different. I agree they can be installed more proactively, the risk that they break something is not that big (since they contain most of the time just a few objects, and since the tools layer can be tested much better by Infor than the application, using regression test suites etc.). Also, most of the time they do not involve reconfiguring tables (which makes a solution hard to install and hard to rollback, too), and the dependency graph is more or less linear (not a tree as with the application)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yearooichuah</div><div class="date">12th January 2011, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all your help. By referring to your advice, I will have to discuss with all the &quot;stakeholders&quot; to come out with a proper strategy for my company.</div></div><hr />
