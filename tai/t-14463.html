<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">11th February 2004, 22:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone experienced a change in how Baan rounds/stores numbers on this port set ??<br />
<br />
The field open.bal is of domain tfgld.amnt which has 4 significant digits after the decimal point.  The domain's display format is A095 which has 2 significant digits after the decimal point for currencies as per Baan suggested setup.<br />
<br />
The report script then checks if the open.bal = 0, if so the record is not printed, but the open.bal = 0 really means if open.bal = 0.0000 (domain).  This check fails as the actual amount has digits further to the right somewhere.<br />
<br />
After I changed the condition to if open.bal &lt; 0.00009, the record was not printed.<br />
<br />
To further add to this is another problem I have with the same session/report.  On the old server the opening balance is $3455,266.51 on the new server the opening balance is $3455,266.50<br />
During debug I saw the &quot;raw&quot; amount passed into the report as $3455,266.509961 on the old server and as $3455,266.5099 on the new server. After the rounding the amounts are then $3455,266.51 and $3455,266.50.<br />
<br />
The same data is on both servers; on the old server the report does not print the record with the ledger account 330900010. So the check on the condition &quot;if the open.bal = 0.0000&quot; is actually different for some reason between the two servers.<br />
<br />
New server = port set 6.1c.06.07 for unix release HPUX10.20<br />
old server = port set 6.1c.04.01, for unix release HPUX10.01</div></div><hr />
