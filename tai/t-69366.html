Infor changes how is VRC coded (now it is number vs old fashion way). I have created derived VRC from b61a (standard) as '105U0a000'. In addition, I setup PMC Update VRC as attached but I am getting error which I cannot resolve.<br />

What it should be done for PMC setup completion ? I<br />

You are right ..I got this problem after basic installation of LN 10.5 and it seems that PMC package wasn't included in initial staging area. After tweaking installation, I got desired VRC and it worked OK ....<br />

Thank you all for helping in resolving this issue.<br />
