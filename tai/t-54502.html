<br />
I have installed Enterprise Server 8.4.1. and ERP LN FP3 into a VMWare; Using Linux and MySQL. Now I am trying to install the German language pack, however the Installation wizard (Version 15.3.2.0) always tells me &quot;Logging from REXEC connection:&quot; (but no more) and then stops. <br />
<br />
The Baan system however is up and running: I can logon as user bsp from the client to the server, using rexec, and it works fine. Only the installation wizard seems to have problems with the rexec call.<br />
<br />
The logfiles are no help either. The installation log on the client just tells me:<br />
<br />
11.12.2008[13:31:39(UTC-01:00)]:I:admin: logfile C:\infor_infrastructure\stagingarea\Logging<br />
Files\erp_ln01\BaanERPClient.log opened<br />

11.12.2008[13:53:43(UTC-01:00)]:W:admin: WARNING - Logging from REXEC connection:<br />
<br />
<br />
- and that's it. There seems to be an error, but the actual message is dropped, I can't find it neither on the server nor the client...<br />
<br />
There is one message in the event log on the client:<br />
<br />
Env : Bse (C:\Windows\baan)<br />
Program : rexeclib file rexec.c # 119<br />
Keyword : BaanRexec<br />
Username : admin type:S language:2<br />
Process : 6084<br />
ProcessSet : admin@greyfox:6084<br />
Lasterror : 0<br />
Errno : 0<br />
BdbErrno : 0<br />
ExtraInfo : N/AMessage : protocol failure<br />
<br />
From the /var/log/xinet.d log on the server I can see that the Rexec seems to stop with a signal 14. But I don't know why.<br />
<br />
I've logged an incident already, but since VMWare and MySql are not really supported yet, I doubt that Infor will invest too much time (and I can understand it) - so I'm asking here....<br />
<br />
Is there any way on Linux (or with the istallation wizard) to log the actual commands which the installation wizard tries to execute via rexec? Or can I install the language pack without the installation wizard somehow? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />

<br />
Since 8.4.2 vmware is supported and mysql is supported too so support should address your problem.<br />
Sure it has nothing to do with ftp, that it can't copy the file over? Basicly I have the same running ..... You can start an ftp connection from your client to the server?<br />
Do you have your client ip-address added to /etc/hosts? That is one of the things I always do to make sure I can connect.<br />
<br />

We faced similar issues due to our advanced HP-UX security setup and we have to turn off the security temporarily during porting set installation and turn it back on. Here is more info:<br />
<br />
$ cat README.porting.set<br />
sysadmins,<br />
when the porting set fails to install and the Bann log file points to an ftp issue. Back up the /etc/ftpd/ftpusers file, Do a dev null of the /etc/ftpd ftpusers file, make the file empty. Have the Baan person do a re-install, restore the /etc/ftpd/ftpusers to original state.<br />
<br />
Further steps, added 2/10/2008 by Lance:<br />
Update /var/adm/inetd.sec.  Add ip address of box running install program to exec allow. Copy /etc/ftpd/ftpaccess.porting to /etc/ftpd/ftpaccess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">13th December 2008, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I found it. <br />
<br />
It was neither the Infor installer, nor the Linux rexec.<br />
<br />
It was the bloody Vista that my client is running: Vista has the concept of public and private networks. For some reason, the virtual network card of my VMWare always has the inital state of a &quot;public&quot; network when I start it up. Vista then blocks the access to this network from remote hosts, even if the firewall is switched off.<br />
<br />
Now: Rexec can open a second TCP connection to a port on it's client (if asked so by the client) to send the stderr data. The Infor installer seems to make use of that functionality. So, the installer starts rexec on the server, the server tries to call back to the client and eventually fails, since vista blocked it.<br />
<br />
After setting the VMWare network to &quot;private&quot;, everything worked fine (at least, the installer currently installs the german lables...)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your ideas anyway!</div></div><hr />

<br />
what version of vmware did you use?<br />
We are using ESX server and i cannot find that setting you mentioned.<br />
Where is it exactly?<br />
Can you make a screenshot perhaps?<br />
thanks,<br />

You can do this in the regional settings and select the correct language for non-unicode characters.</div></div><hr />
