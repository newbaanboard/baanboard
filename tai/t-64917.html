<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">5th November 2013, 06:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe you still need the language number in the first line.  If I recall, you have to put<br />
{\{field   2<br />
line 1<br />
line 2<br />
}\}<br />
<br />
field has to be 8 characters long; if the field name is only 4 characters long you need to put trailing spaces in.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<br />
I now have 8 chars to the language &quot;2&quot;. After running a test record update, the log file says updated 1 though not evident in the table. <br />
<br />
I will step through the exchange under debug condition, and see what is going on..<br />
<br />
Thank you (though may come back shortly  :confused:  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ash Gajjar</div><div class="date">5th November 2013, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I tested 2 records, but I just cant seem to get Exchange to read the 2nd record. As you can see from the ascii file below,  the 1st record (Key 000042605) updates the &quot;JP&quot; and the text as expected, but also appends the text from the 2nd record (Key 000043151)!!!<br />
<br />
The rest of this 2nd record is ignored ( ie Field US for instance). All I can think of carriage return not being recognised?? Never had this isue with any exchange programs without text <br />

<br />
In order to see how the ASCII File format should be you could create an export table relation for your table an generate a test ASCII File. You can let Exchange create everything ASCII Files table and Field relations and then set the type of the text Field in ASCII file to multiline text. Exchange generates Numeric Field Type by default!<br />
<br />
Here is what I got exporting the table tcmcs041 &quot;Delivery terms&quot; with your Text:<br />
<br />
Here I see that there is no separator (in my case a semicolon) after the last field before text! That could be the cause of your problem :rolleyes:<br />
