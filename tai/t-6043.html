<br />
In Maintain Purchase order lines, the format for unit price is up to 4 decimal points. <br />
<br />
I need to change this format so that it can accept until 5 decimal points in company 888 without disturbing/changing this unit price format in other companies... <br />
<br />
i've tried to edit the form, but it effect all the companies...<br />
<br />
Is there any other way to solve this problem.. Please do guide me.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<br />
A real poser this one, the only way I can see you being able to do this is to move company 888 to another VRC and change the table in that VRC only.  Have not tried this myself so am not 100% sure it would work, but on your test system you can give this ago.<br />
<br />
Best of luck,<br />

<br />
Another way I can think is to have another Maintain Purchase Order line session specific for company 888. The session is the exact duplicate of the original except for the form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">2nd August 2002, 22:24</div></div><div class="posttext">On Baan IV, The domain used in the table that stores the purchase price on table tdpur041 only allows 4 decimal points.   That means that even if you customize the session / form / script to allow the input, the table cannot store it.<br />
<br />
I believe the only way would be to change the domain at the table level.<br />
<br />
Any mod to session, form or table would effect all companies in that VRC.    Steve is correct, you would need a separate VRC for the change to apply only to 1 company.   I would not recommend this, but it is an option.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
