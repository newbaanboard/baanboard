When I requested this from SSA Global support, their response was to obtain PMC training through their services area.<br />
<br />
Can anyone provide insight.</div></div><hr />

Is formal training really justified?  Or am I dealing with a slight learning curve?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it depends on how much you understood the quick guide and<br />
how comfortable you feel playing with PMC on your test system.<br />
<br />
it's not that difficult, but it's easy to get messed up =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed one patch while we were testing the new version and there were no pre-requisites.<br />
<br />
With this patch, I have scanned the solution and the output is a report that lists two pre-requisites.  One is on my system,  The other is not.<br />
<br />
The quick guide has no information about this scenario.  <br />
<br />
Do I ftp the missing pre-requisite and scan it?<br />
<br />
Or do I run session ttpmc2101m000 - Process Solutions - on the solution that reports to have a pre-requisite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">23rd May 2006, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">You will have to download and scan the missing pre-requisite before you will be able to install the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">23rd May 2006, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">In have scanned two solutions that list a co-requisite for a base VRC that we do not use.  Will the PMC process require me to install this co-requisite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">24th May 2006, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know you should not have to install the co-requisite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">24th May 2006, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">You are correct.  I did not need to install the co-requisites.  BaaN's support analyst extended herself and we did a go-to-assist.<br />
<br />
I have checked baan support web site for training on the PMC and none is offered, except for an introduction to tools course which is not scheduled.<br />
<br />
I am feeling frustrated by an apparent unwillingness to provide existing documentation to me on the PMC.  Nonetheless, I hope their services area can suggest an appropriate training.</div></div><hr />
