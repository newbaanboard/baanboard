Hope your help very much!<br />
I know item's price in Purchase-Order may come from price books or Item-Purchase data.<br />
But I want to display the price in Purchase-Order only,nobady could modify it except the one I want to .Somebody tells me in TOOL of BAAN where maybe can find something to lock the price,so that we can control it .Any ways will be ok,thanks for your attentions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ratnakar a</div><div class="date">5th August 2008, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple way is to modify the form and make the price field as display.<br />
Note that all the srandard events like after input will not get executed.<br />
Now for some one should be able to modify the same on PO then codeing is required in this case you need source code.If you do not waht that then go to Price book and update the price so that the new one will appear on po. and restrict the access of price book session to specific users who you want to be able to change the price.</div></div><hr />

   You could use the User Table Field Authorization session to put restriction on the field price in the purchase order lines table.. In here limit all the users (who uses Purchase Order Session) to only have &quot;Read&quot; access to this field (price) in P.O Lines Table(pur 401?) and give the specific users (of your choice) &quot;Write/Read&quot; as the access mode. <br />
Even though the above suggestion is based on a B4c4 platform, i hope you got the general idea.<br />
