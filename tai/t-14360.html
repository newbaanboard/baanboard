I am using DEM to control authorization levels at a session level but would like to restrict users further using Tools for Company And Table authorization restrictions.<br />
<br />
I have used the Tools Role and moved a user over to this but he no longer has the ability to Submit or administer Jobs in Session ttaad5500m000 &quot;Job Data&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know where this is set or does the user have to be a superuser to be able to do this function.<br />

Any Help Please..<br />

<br />
In BaaN 4 atleast you do not need a superuser for submitting/cretaing Jobs.<br />
<br />
What is the message in your case to the user - I mean is it to do with permissions or is it DEM related?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jit_mistry</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The Question is related to Tools Roles Authorizations.

Its not clear did you set up at the DEM authorization level ? Our Current Version is BaaN 5b. I am using DEM to control authorization levels at a session level but would like to restrict users further using Tools for Company And Table authorization restrictions. <br />
Refer to the threads -<br />
<br />
Issues with mimic of database auths. sessions (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9195&amp;highlight=authorization+group) <br />
<br />
Authorisation group of form command? (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8511&amp;highlight=group) <br />
<br />
If you are trying to set it up at the tools role authorization template you can set it up at the session or module level, just add the session codes and the related authorization level you like to set to.<br />
<br />
Also refer to the posting - Tools Question (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=54339#post54339) and to the Tools Administrator's Guide, to understand the execution priority logics by company, session, package module etc.</div></div><hr />
