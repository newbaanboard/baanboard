<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">26th January 2022, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">The other day I spoke to Infor Support. They told me that BOD is going to be replaced by new technology based on Json instead of XML. But it was &quot;side-dropped&quot; and not explained in extend. LN (application BODs) currently is not ready for that move yet.<br />
<br />
Apparently BDE development in LN Studio is the most preferred option: when you import a table in your integration project and generate a default definition and implementation, a BDE will be generated.<br />
<br />
In KB 1498754 the bar is raised for Custom BOD development, like completed the Infor training, access to sourcecode, access to BOD sources.<br />
<br />
So creating (custom) BOD seems to be unadvised.<br />
<br />
Now when BDE is the preferred route, we deploy them in the c4ws connector in IOS, is it possible to link them to a dataflow?<br />
Instead of asynchronous SYNC-BODs is it possible to use synchronous BDE subsriptions instead? Can a dataflow subsrcibe to BDEs as they can catch BODs?<br />
<br />
Or is the dataflow connection only possible with BOD (which is what we are doing now)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">27th January 2022, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">You should be able to call custom BDEs through the generic LN IONAPI - you have to append the details of your custom BDE to the URL.  Should be something like this: https://mingle-ionapi.inforcloudsuite.com/&lt;tenant&gt;/LN/c4ws/&lt;CustomWebServiceName&gt;.<br />
We are on premise. I think we do this: BDE is deployed as a c4ws on our internal network and we use IONAPI to act as a proxy to the outside, where the oauth2.0 connection is made from the external website. So an XML comes in, is authenticated and passed on to C4WS (without outhentication), executed (eq sent to LN), response passed on to C4WS and via the proxy back to the caller.<br />
<br />
But in that scenario there is no IONDESK DataFlow involved, where we would be able to use a mapper and pass the request to the message bus where it could be consumed by other connectors on the bus.<br />
<br />
Ideally - as far as I understand the matter [which is hardly tbh] an external site would be able to subscribe on a BDE.<br />
<br />
So when a record changes in the related table, the subscription would trigger an outgoing BDE (not BOD)<br />
Now what I think should be possible is: sent this BDE &quot;response to subscription&quot; to a connection point / dataflow / from there to c4ws / proxy / external server.<br />
Same when a request comes in: external server / proxy / c4ws / dataflow / LN / answer via dataflow / c4ws / proxy / external server.<br />
This would imply synchronous - asynchronous - synchronous and therefor may not be possible.<br />
<br />
When I want to define the BDE as an incoming document in IONDESK (via file template or Object Schema) it becomes a BOD with BOD Verbs, not a BDE with supported methods... Hence it cannot be linked to a connection point.</div></div><hr />

And if so, can you maybe drop some information on what type of course this is?</div></div><hr />

Indeed we succeeded to call a custom - ION API webservice to deliver a document to our internally (on prem) deployed C4WS BDE. <br />
<br />
Next step to figure out is how to work with BDE subscriptions in relation with an ION Dataflow... In my mind it should work similarly to the combination Application + BOD document, but now with Webservice + BDE document.</div></div><hr />

where a BDE is &quot;just&quot; a DLL call away from a BOD extension, it is easy to incorporate the result of a BDE/Show into an outgoing BOD.<br />
