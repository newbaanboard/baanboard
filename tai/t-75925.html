I moved the thread here when I think it belongs.  Hopefully someone with LN experience can help you.  Of course if I had questions about installing a patch I usually direct them to infor and get instructions.  If there are more details you may want to provide them to help others make recommendations.</div></div><hr />

Background is: PMC is intended to update system in a consistent way. When a solution is installed it is checked and all previous updates on the components in the solution are also checked/installed. So just installing one solution on a system for which you took control (after some time of neglect) may cause an avalanche of solutions.<br />
<br />
Having said that, you have to setup PMC (but probably that has been done by your predecessors). Included is the link to the support site where extra needed solutions can be found, downloaded and installed. <br />
<br />
Once that is done you can put the solution in ttpmc2210s000 and it plus all the dependent solutions will be retrieved. Or put the file manually on the system and scan it there to install (ttpmc2200s000).<br />
<br />
Once the solutions are on the system (ttpmc1100m000), they have to be installed for instance using ttpmc2204s000.</div></div><hr />
