We want to make sure that all users are logged off from BAAN at a specific time so that the &quot;data backup&quot; configured in &quot;job daemon&quot; works out successfully. Is there some baan session which could be executed at the dos level : something similar to licmon, which could forcefully loggout all currently logged users from the system.</div></div><hr />

Can u tell me what happens if user is logged before the authz time and if he continues his work in restricted time authz. My means for specific user restricted timing is 16.15 to 17.00 and if he logged at 16.10 and continued his work after 16.15.....<br />

Hi ganesh,<br />

Do a rc.stop with active alg6.1 binary (Logs out all BaaN-Users).<br />
   Do some system jobs.<br />
Restart BaaN.<br />

<br />
Please take care, Abnormal disconnect of users are not recommanded. Which may creates corruption/incosistency in the Database. Just think, what will happen, somebody is running update/generate sessions.<br />
<br />
We have made a program which shows us, who is using what sessions, we can send messages to them to logout. If they are not at their place and not using update sessions, we can kill them. Also we can see their extension nos., so that we can call them to logout.<br />
<br />
Because of this, Oracle has given &quot;transactional shutdown&quot; feature.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
