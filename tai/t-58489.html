<br />
We created one customization with about 20 tables in Baan IV. Now we want to have the same (similar) customization in ERP LN. Does anybody know what is the best way to copy table definitions from Baan IV to ERP LN? Let say thad we used standard domains and there is no need to create new domains in ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
create table [table_name] as select * from [source_table] where [column_name]=[ABC];<br />
<br />
please give value ABC is not in the table, cause we just copy table definition without value or empty table.<br />

If you're customization isn't in LN yet, how did you compare the table defs?  Overall, the standard table defs in LN are very different from Baan IV, but if you move a Baan IV table to LN, the def should be the same (assuming the domains are the exist in LN and are the same).<br />

The table ttadv420 in ERP LN has the additional fields as compared with Baan IV. So I was worried. If, however, think better, this will not be a problem.<br />
Thanks Vincent.</div></div><hr />

It will cost you a days work, but afterwards you have them correct, you're able to change domains where required (eg for items, business partners etc.) It's faster than any export/import and definitely safer.<br />

The export/import is definitely possible, but this is also a good opportunity to review the customization and make sure it's structured the way you want and to fix any bugs/make any process changes.  Also may want to look at what the customization is accomplishing and see if LN standard functionality can accomplish the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no problem doing an export from baan4 and an import in LN for tables if the tables are not standard tables.<br />
<br />
One thing to check is if there are date fields in the table as tcdate in Baan4 is dte and tcdate in LN is utc.<br />
<br />
After the import you can change the domain tcdate to tfgld.date in the tables then there is no problem with importing the data.<br />
<br />
There is a problem with sesions, forms and reports if these are not in english in Baan4.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
