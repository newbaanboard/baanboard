<br />
I had installed the solution which includes table definition. After installation I had ran CRDD (ttadv5215m000), restarted BAAN services &amp; lastly restarted BAAN server.<br />
<br />
For one specific table I am getting error message in GTM as 'Data Definition not found' where as in the session 'Maintain Table Definition' I can able to see that specific table. Also in BAAN\dict folder the particular Table Definition is present.<br />
<br />
Please guide me in this matter ASAP.<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />

Convert to runtime on the Domains before the Tables you can run into<br />
this sort of problem.<br />
<br />
Do a CRDD for Domains, then a CRDD for the table and you should be all set<br />
- you may have to run CREATE runtime this time instead of CONVERT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmorais</div><div class="date">7th July 2005, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a similar problem a while ago.<br />
<br />
The problem then, as far as I can remember, had to do with an enum domain, for which the language descriptions were not yet present in the combination I was using. <br />
<br />
-Try to check (in the domain definition file) the domain definitions on the domains the table is using. Correct problems if they exist.<br />
-Run convert to RDD (for everything)<br />
-Run create RDD (for domains and the referred table)<br />
-restart shared memory.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmorais</div><div class="date">8th July 2005, 12:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what I would do:<br />
<br />
-See in the domain definition file (d&lt;package&gt;.pd) for the current package combination if the domain is present. This is just to see if we can arrive to a conclusion. If it's not there, the table definition will not be created correctly for sure.<br />
<br />
-Look in the domain descriptions for the language you're using and if the descriptions are absent, create them manually.<br />
<br />
-Run Convert to RDD and create RDD.<br />
-Restart shared memory.<br />

What was exactly the problem then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganesh_kapase</div><div class="date">10th July 2005, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">See I had installed the solution in Upgrade VRC which is derived from  Localization VRC. All users are working under LIVE VRC which is derived from Upgrade VRC. After installation of solution I ran the session Convert RDD for only Upgrade VRC. Now I ran the Create RDD first for Upgrade VRC &amp; then for LIVE VRC &amp; restarted the server.<br />
<br />
These steps solves my problem.<br />
