<br />
     I have scanned the solution plus its dependencies and I have managed to install the dependencies but the solution status is still available. Any suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

If there is any solution &quot;Not Available&quot;, you canÂ´t install it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have had the same problem, but in ERP50c.<br />
This was solved with solution 139224.<br />
Here is the description of the solution :<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
&quot;Check Solutions to Install&quot;  (ttpmc2203s000)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
If you checked a PMC solution to be installed, the solution kept the status <br />
'Available', although the report didn't show any error messages.<br />
<br />
This was the case if there was a large tree of pre-requisite solutions and also <br />
co-requisite solutions for a localization.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The check algorithm has been improved; if there are no restrictions to install <br />
the solution(s), the status will be changed to 'To Install'.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">See also solution 132988:<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
It was possible to connect more than one Update VRC for the same Base VRC to one VRC Combination. This is not allowed. <br />
<br />
VRC Combinations are meant to handle co-requisite dependencies between different Base VRC's (e.g. standard solutions and localization solutions) and not for updating different Update VRC's with solutions for the same Base VRC's at the same time.<br />
<br />
When PMC was setup in this way, unpredictable errors might occur. One of the symptoms of this setup is that during the checking of solutions, the solutions keep the status 'Available' and there is no error message in the report why the solutions could not be installed.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
It is not possible anymore to connect an Update VRC to a VRC combination if another Update VRC for the same Base VRC is connected to that VRC combination already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MarioS</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Please check if there is Update VRC for package &quot;cc&quot;<br />
If not, add one (e.g. cc_B40U_c4_stnd). <br />
If you use a localisation, also add a &quot;cc&quot;-Update-VRC for the localisation.<br />
This PVRC has not to be in the derivation structure, it just has to exist.<br />
Hope that solves your problem.<br />
