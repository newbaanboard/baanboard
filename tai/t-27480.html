<br />
We are using BaanERP 5c. Recently, we want to upgrade server hardware (moving to a new machine actually). We shall restore Baan database, backed up from old server, to the new server. After moving to new server, the old machine will be discarded i.e. there will remain only one instance of BaanERP server.<br />
<br />
The question is, how we can move/reinstall the baan license from old server to the new server?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any feeback.<br />

<br />
All this assumes, that you have a valid support contract, otherwise Baan will play dumb and might give you some headaches or might charge you for the huge effort of generating a new key.</div></div><hr />

We currently dont have a support contract. It will be a really headache and disappointement knowing that all the cost paid for Baan and its implmentation was only for  to use it on just a *particualar* machine. and we cannot reinstall on any other machine.  It will also say that to Keep using Baan we must keep paying to SSA Global, even if we dont need their support. Seems kind of a software subscription model or a &quot;keep customers forcefully&quot; model :) . Will have to check further with Baan .<br />

<br />
I would appreciate it, if you could keep the baanboard informed about your success here. Without being a legal expert, I am pretty sure, Baan/SSA can be forced to provide you with a new key, since your license is not time limited. But as mentioned before, I also think SSA has good reasons to charge for the effort, as long as you do not have a support contract.<br />
<br />
I know several SSA customers, who have the same situation like yourself. But up to now, I could not get a defenite answer from Baan about it.<br />
