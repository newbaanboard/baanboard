<br />
We are trying to reduce the downtime of our Production Databases during weekend. Right now we are using TTS refreshes and this runs for very long time making the downtime of the whoel weekend. <br />
<br />
We have 7 Production, 7 Support and 1 Test and 1 Development environments. The Test and Development combine the 7 Environments of Prod into one Environment including the companies.<br />
<br />
To get over this we initially started with RMAN backup as it can bring down the downtime to zero as suggested by our DBA's. <br />
<br />
The point Iam NOT clear about is that our DBA's says he can only exclude tables and  not companies form this RMAN backup and rfresh design. so in effect he says though he can exclude &quot;000&quot; company in the backup later there wont be any 000 after he refreshes it in support from production say for example.<br />
<br />
So we are given options like take backup &quot;000&quot; refresh everything from Prod to support and likewise and then replace the &quot;000&quot; backup into support. This sounds risky to me with License data, runtime data etc.<br />
<br />
Also since our Test and Dev have all Environments and Companies packed into one, we are thinking of splitting them now into one application with 7 databases architecture to accommodate a free parallel production to support to test to development scenario fo RMAN refresh. This also I know that can drastically slow down the test and development response time and become complicated to manage.<br />
<br />
I request your expert opnions in this case.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have a 'consistant' option which means that you don't have to bring the database down<br />
to do the export.<br />
<br />
Export your production company, excluding tools, and load it into your test database.<br />
just truncate or drop the tables in the test company first.<br />
<br />
this is a very easy process if you are able to have production Company # == Test Company #.<br />
<br />
If not then there are still options.<br />

<br />
