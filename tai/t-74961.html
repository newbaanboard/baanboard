The worst thing is that if I try to import this table on other activities I can't because it's in this locked state... do you happen to know how I can fix this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should check in the component(in your case: table) before the end activity. With that you can click this component while End Activity.<br />

The problem here is that the table is locked because it has been in use by an activity that has already been closed for some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keitaro84</div><div class="date">30th November 2022, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I understood why this was happening. A colleague of mine had flagged &quot;Integration Whit PMC&quot; in the project properties, by deflecting it I was able to close the activities again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">7th December 2022, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Point is that PMC does just that: it makes sure that all changes are delivered in solutions, so it keeps record of the components in the delivery project and those component registrations will block delivery of later versions.<br />
<br />
You should be able to find the delivery activity UUID (tlprj120, type of activity Delivery, note the UUID). Removing the components from ttscm115 and ttscm117 will allow you to not deliver the previous PMC solution...</div></div><hr />
