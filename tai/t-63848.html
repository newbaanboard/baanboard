<br />
I am trying to figure out how baan quickly manages to identify the difference in package combinations (Tables &amp; Domains).<br />
<br />
As a standard, we are allowed to switch companies belonging to different package combinations at least in BaaN 5c.  As soon as we introduce some difference in the table definition/domain, it restricts us from switching the companies.  Now the question is where does it store this data.  <br />
<br />
I am assuming that while CRDD, it does the comparison of all involved tables with the rest of package combinations and puts a flag somewhere.  I am still investigating.  If someone already has this knowledge please share, else if I am able to figure the same out, I will update this thread.<br />

That is the answer your question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamdnb</div><div class="date">21st March 2013, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right.  I am interested in knowing how baan tracks these changes so fast.  There are 1000's of tables that need to be compared.  I am close to my findings.. will share if successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">21st March 2013, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">They don't need to be compared. Just the fact that table or domain definitions are found in different VRCs for both package combinations will disable the company switch.<br />
<br />
So, just copying a table or domain to the other VRC will immediately disable the company switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamdnb</div><div class="date">25th March 2013, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right JaapJD.  I could also find the same after going thru the DBSLOG.  Here's my detailed analysis for future reference:<br />
<br />
Compare entries in ttaad121 (Packages by Package Combination) for involved companies during switch<br />
If number of entries do not match<br />
     raise error &quot;Package combination of company is %s ; package VRCs in package combination are different&quot;<br />
else<br />
     For each package in ttaad121 (package by package combination) of switch-to company<br />
           Check package in ttaad121 (packages by Pack Comb) for current company<br />
           if package not found<br />
                raise error &quot;Package combination of company is %s ; package VRCs in package combination are different&quot;<br />
           else<br />
                Retrieve PVRC details from PVRC table (ttaad111)<br />
                For each derivation level<br />
                     check if any domain exist in ttadv400<br />
                     check if any table definition exist in ttadv420 <br />
                next<br />
           end if<br />
           Check package in ttaad121 (packages by Pack Comb) for switch-to company<br />
           if package not found<br />
                raise error &quot;Package combination of company is %s ; package VRCs in package combination are different&quot;<br />
           else<br />
                Retrieve package VRC details from PVRC table (ttaad111)<br />
                For each derivation level<br />
                     check if any domain exist in ttadv400<br />
                     check if any table definition exist in ttadv420 <br />
                next<br />
           end if<br />
           Keep track of PVRC found in the ttadv400/420<br />
           If any mismatch found then<br />
                raise error &quot;Package combination of company is %s ; package VRCs in package combination are different&quot;<br />
           end if<br />
     next<br />
end if<br />
<br />
In nutshell, BaaN actually does find the real difference.  Presence of any additional entry of table/domain definition in ttadv400/420 is enough to raise the alert.  There are no flags or file level updates involved to identify the mismatch.<br />
<br />
Attaching the log I referred for my understanding.<br />
<br />
Cheers !!<br />
