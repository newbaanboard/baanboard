(which happens to be my first). So after finally installing sp7<br />
and going for the spanish locations I've discovered through<br />
session ttadv1111m000 &quot;Maintain Package VRCs&quot; that there<br />
are two italy location VRC packages yet: &quot;it B40 c4&quot; and &quot;it<br />
B40U c4 stnd&quot;.<br />
<br />
Is this usual ? What should be my next step ?<br />

However, base c4 and c4_stnd are standard VRC names in Baan IV.  The initial c4 code (and maybe through a couple service packs) is in the c4 VRC, then once PMC was working, patches and service packs go into c4_stnd.<br />
<br />
I imagine it's the same with the localizations.  c4_stnd should be derived from c4, as only updates are in stnd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 21:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think the itB40_c4 and its update PVRC are part of the actual Italian localization. The Italian localization should be composed of packages in the VRC's B40L_c4_itl0 and the update PVRC B40U_c4_itl0. But for some reason Baan decided to include some 'italian' functionality into the standard VRC. Have no idea what the purpose is or what it is used for though :)</div></div><hr />

for a long time if you hadn't intervened. I wonder why they<br />
included those VRC's the first time. I'll continue with the<br />
installation of the spanish localizations tomorrow morning.<br />

Read you soon.<br />

tf_B40_c4_mven and tr_B40_c4_mven. Now I'm supposed to<br />
create runtime data dictionary but in the supplied documentation<br />
they input a package combination range which I haven't created<br />
since it wasn't suggested in any of the previous steps. Would it<br />
be the same ( although slower ) if I create runtime data dictionary<br />
for the whole.<br />

<br />
It is easier if you create a package combination and link your PVRC's into them. Then you can create RTDD for your entire package combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm tried to integrate tf B40C c4 iber  through Maintain package VRC's with the newly created package combination B40c4ibe but I couldn't, so I went to Maintain packages by package combination and tried to add tf B40C c4 iber, tf B40C c4 mven and the same for package tr but neither I could.<br />
<br />
*Sighs*<br />
<br />
Should I create two separate VRC's, one for iber and another for<br />
mven ?<br />

I think your VRC tree should something like this (see attachment). IB=IBER; MV=MVEN; C=base; U=pmc update layer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently creating all four VRC package combinations and<br />
maintaining packages for all of them. This way ,tf B40C c4 iber<br />
and tr B40C c4 iber will get associated to B40Cc4ib and the<br />
same for the rest of the packages. Unfortunately creating the<br />
runtime  data dictionary for each combination seems like it will<br />
take the rest of the day.<br />
