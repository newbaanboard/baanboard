Thanks for your Help.</div></div><hr />

Password Aging Thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=295) <br />
<br />
There has been a lot of discussion on this point as the call for a password expiration has to occur when they are logged into Baan, but some sites do not want to give shell access to accounts, etc.  <br />
<br />
I am interested to see what people are doing for password expiration notification ...<br />
<br />
BTW -- what platform are you running on?<br />

<br />
THERE IS AN ANSWER!<br />
(See some of the other preceeding repsonses.)<br />
<br />
Each Unix installation has some sort of routine that will allow a user to list attributes of of a user ID. At our installation it is called &quot;xpasswd&quot;, a locally grown network version of passwd.<br />
<br />
Given that capability above, a script can be written (pass.check.sh in the example below) that simply finds the expiration date of a user ID, compares with today's date (date/time) and pushes a formatted message to the LOGGED ON Baan user (bshcmd6.1 or 6.2) that their password will expire in in x-days and y-hours, if and only if the expiration date/time is within a threshold. In our facility that threshold is 5 days.<br />
Note: send a message to the logged on user. That is accomplished by invoking the above script as a background process in the bshell script pointed at by ipc_info. <br />
<br />
The normal $BSE/lib/ipc_info entry just points to bshell6.1/6.2 (an object). But you can point it to a Bourne shell script that invokes the bshel6.1/6.2 as the last thing:<br />
<br />
#!/bin/sh<br />
# Set site env user variables...<br />
#<br />
# Set other site specific env variables<br />
#<br />
/.../pass.check.sh &amp;<br />
$BSE/bin/bshell6.2 $*<br />
<br />
The magic here is the ampersand on the password checking command: it says to run in the background and continue processing. The pass.check.sh script has a &quot;go to sleep for 5 seconds&quot; command as its first executable command. It then wakes up, does the check, sends the message to the (now) logged on user if required and then exits. Because it is a backgound process, when it ends it will be in a process state of . This is OK and will stay there until the Baan session (the parent process) ends.<br />
<br />
Happy day. Users love it. It can also be used as an adminstative tool.<br />
<br />
<br />
This works pretty good for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in Baan5.0 ERP b (Grieg) en c (Corelli) Baan made passwordaging available by the BW-client<br />
<br />
First you have to set password aging on Unix. Here we have SUNOS and we make it work by typing 'passwd -x 30 -w 4' where x is period password aging and w is the warn time in days to change the password.<br />
On AIX you can change it by smit(tty) as far as i know.<br />
<br />
Then you set password aging in Baan. change owner of ${BSE}/bin/badmin6.2 to root and set the sticky bit on it:<br />
# chown root badmin6.2<br />
# chmod u+s badmin6.2<br />
Add session ttstppwdaging  to session BMS Mask Data (ttadv4188m000) and run the convert to runtime in special menu.<br />
<br />
<br />
That should do the trick. If you get an error 506 install patch/solution 113957 (we must so i mention it)<br />
<br />
On BGS in solution 119781 you can see some more of password aging.<br />
