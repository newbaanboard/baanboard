Tried enough but cannot achieve this. So, turning to this place hoping someone will have an idea. I am in Baan 5c<br />
<br />
I am setting up Tools Role. It should be possible to insert record into a table. But after inserting, many fields should not be possible to be updated. <br />
<br />
For example, I should be able to insert a Purchase order line first time with values to fields as per my choice. But after saving the record, I should be able to update only the Price (and not any other field like quantity) through Purchase Order lines. Is this do-able? It would be nice if I can put in a constraint that if record date is less than date.num() then Read-Only !! But it does not accept date.num() but only a sheer constant date+time value. I am able to disable fields but it disables first time also. I dont have an option to use tdpur095 for this as many fields are customised and overshoots 13 characters;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance hoping someone has a way around.</div></div><hr />
