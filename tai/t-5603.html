<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanivc4</div><div class="date">23rd June 2002, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I have BaaN IV c4 on NT with SQL 7.0. My original Unisys Server has following configuration.<br />
<br />
C:\Winnt (Operating System)<br />
<br />
E:\MSSQL7(Only Software)<br />
<br />
G:\MSSQL7(Data Files)<br />
<br />
G:\BaaN<br />
<br />
Now assume this Server crashes, and we need to restore on additional server that is of Dell make. The configuration for Dell Machine is:<br />
<br />
C:\Winnt<br />
<br />
D:\Blank<br />
<br />
Now we want to restore our earlier Baan on to this machine. We cannot restore Unisys registry because hardware configuration is different. My question is, after I restore SQL 7.0 and Baan IV on this machine, how can I create registry entries so that it points to new Location i.e. instead of G:\ of Unisys. If I am able to create registry entries for Baan, then we will ge Demo Period, and after that we can apply for revalidation. Can Anybody pls suggest solution to this Problem<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nicholas</div><div class="date">13th July 2002, 05:21</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do a &quot;basic&quot; installation of Baan on the new hardware platform, this will then create the registry files that are required.<br />
<br />
When that is completed you can then do a search for Baan and export the core directory for the location of Baan in the registry (I think there are 2 directories).  This then can be used for later rebuilds of the test server..<br />
<br />
Then you can restore Baan on this server.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To get MS-SQL7.0 restored, install MS-SQL7.0 in the new locations, with the Master DB.  Then copy out all of the .dbf files.  And restore all of the .dbf files to these locations.  (I haven't tested/played with this for over a year, so the memory is vague)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do what is called a &quot;FAT Client&quot; installation on the destination (D:\Baan ?): this only copies the portingset to disk and creates the entries in the registry, not the complete Baan environment (faster).<br />
<br />
Then copy from the original (G:\Baan) into the new one (D:\Baan ?) and then check the registry keys:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Baan\BaanIVc4\  (check BaanIVc4 name, may be different)<br />
Set: InstallType = &quot;3&quot; (compare with old)<br />
Set: DBType = &quot;1&quot;  (compare with old)<br />
Set: GROUP_NAME = &quot;baandb&quot;  (or whatever group you have called)<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Baan\BaanIVc4\Environment (check BaanIVc4 name)<br />
Delete: BSE_REM<br />
<br />
edit the file env.bat on \Baan\bin and update environment variables.<br />
<br />
KEEP those registry keys written somewhere or exported into disk and backed up, you never know when you may need them!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perform the restore, install Baan (only portingset) from the mastercd, then update it with the latest portingset.<br />
<br />
The only thing you have to check (at least we have to) if the BSE_REM entry in the registry exists. <br />
