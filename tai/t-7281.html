Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;manually&quot; means you enter login and password in dialog?<br />
I remember trying to write a script that does ftp on unix without success because of this reason: password dialog couldn't be done automatically.<br />
 What you can do is use the .netrc file. This file is used by ftp to automize filetransfer. &quot;Man netrc&quot; should help, take care of the permissions and empty lines, then it should work fine.<br />

<br />
    &quot;manually&quot; means the user has to press continue button.The username and password are already predefined in the program script.The program already uses .netrc in the script.Thanks anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">22nd October 2002, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">In Unix, the ftp has an interactive option (on the run line) to turn off any prompts form the ftp command (see below form man page on ftp for the -i option)<br />
<br />
issue the ftp command with this option     ftp  -i .......<br />
<br />
 -i   Disable interactive prompting by multiple-file commands; see<br />

Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
here is an script example for unix (hp-ux):<br />
<br />
<br />
ftp -n ${FTP_HOST} &lt;&lt;EOF<br />
user $USER $PASSWD<br />
cd INTERFACES/DATA/EXTR/OUTPUT<br />
binary<br />
put $1<br />
quit<br />
EOF<br />
<br />
the -n option disables the prompt for user and passwort.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I had the same problem and could not solve it. <br />
<br />
When you run the session that includes all the ftp commands, it works good. When you try to run the same exact session in a Baan job, it does not work. I think few system variables need to be defined in the Baan Script in order for this to run in a job as well. <br />
<br />
did anybody encounter such an issue before?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">WE have been successful in executing ftp scripts from BaaN via a BaaN job.  The BaaN job starts our Unix script which sets up the command file and then execute the ftp command as follows:<br />
<br />
ftp -n -i -v corp6 &lt; command file name &gt; log file        <br />
<br />
(corp6 is the dns server name and could be an ip address)<br />
<br />
-i  turn off interacive prompts<br />
-n turn off automatic logging (we supply id password in command file)<br />
-v verbose (that is why the redirect to a log file - to have any error messages as well as the commands execution to a log file for later review)<br />
<br />
This for Unix to Unix or Unix to NT (not sure about NT to somewhere)</div></div><hr />
