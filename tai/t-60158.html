<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sankuu</div><div class="date">2nd March 2011, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">We use two application LN servers pointed to one clustered database. We get this error (Getoverlapped result failed() ) getting logged almost every second whenever the application is doing some transaction. AND we are getting this error only in second application server and NOT on the first application server.<br />
<br />
The last error says &quot;network connection was aborted by local system&quot;. It may not be related to anti virus as we run the same anti virus in first app server also. This error is loggedin almost all our jobs (sessions) and openworld tmboas as well. It is not really harm any transaction but sometimes the job gets into runtime error and i see only this error.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />
