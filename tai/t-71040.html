<br />
I've got a problem with Excel integration. We have Infor LN 10.5 running under Solaris 11 and Oracle 12c. We have also installed java (JRE) 8.1. I have opened a case with Infor but no results.<br />
<br />
When exporting from any session to MS Excel via option &quot;Quick export&quot; I've got a window with error &quot;Cannot start SSI Java library&quot; and the log file showing error &quot;Unable to start the JavaVM - JVMI not available! (The Java SSI Library cannot be started)&quot;<br />
<br />
We have applied KB 1367788, 1711387, 1829597, 1837795, 1864452, 1882072, 1883847, 1891737, 1893628, 1908854, 1910626, 1914857, checked JAVA_HOME variable, etc., but no luck. It seems to be a problem with the Solaris Platform.<br />
<br />
Could anyone help me with this issue?<br />

KB 1883847 <br />
&quot;Spreadsheet Integration&quot; Java application cannot be deployed in ES 10.5.1 <br />
<br />
Description: <br />
 <br />
TOOLS VERSION(S):  10.5.1<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
 &quot;Deploy Java Applications&quot;  (ttadv2570m000)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
 The &quot;Spreadsheet Integration&quot; Java application (version 1.1.6) cannot be deployed successfully in LN (ES 10.5.1). The &quot;Deploy Java Applications&quot; session seems to complete successfully, but will place the Java libraries in a wrong location. As a result, the previous version of &quot;Spreadsheet Integration&quot; (1.1.5) will still be the active one. <br />
 This is due to the absence of an &quot;application.xml&quot; file in the Java application archive (Additional File &quot;ttstpspreadsheet-integration.javaapp&quot;).<br />
<br />
 Support hint:<br />
Defect present in Tools 10.5.1 - December 26th Build<br />
Symptom: Error message during &quot;Export to Excel&quot;: ttstpssiexp002 &quot;the Java SSI Library cannot be started&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Resolution: <br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
A newer version of the Java application has been created (version 1.1.8). This version includes the missing &quot;application.xml&quot;.<br />
<br />
The new version also includes an additional fix for a problem with rich-text formatted cells in Excel. See KB 1882312.<br />
 <br />
Note: <br />
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:<br />
After installing the PMC solution, use session ttadv2570m000 (&quot;Deploy Java Applications&quot;) to deploy version 1.1.8 of the Spreadsheet Integration application.<br />
<br />
PATH NAME IN DIAL-UP DIRECTORY/WEB SITE:<br />
Below are the supported VRC's based on the standard derivation structures.<br />
<br />
If your Current Tools VRC is: ES 10.5.1</div></div><hr />

I've checked the jar files. They are not present at the $BSE/java, but $BSE/java/application/7.6_a/ttstpspreadsheet-integration.javaapp/1521122361/<br />
<br />
Anyway I copied the *spread* files to $BSE/java/ but still not working.<br />
<br />
any other suggestion?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbhawesh</div><div class="date">11th May 2018, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many cases when bshell is not able to start the java. Can be a non supported version of JRE is running (w.r.t the porting set you are using) or some environment variable is not set correctly. Check porting set document for supported JRE version. If you are using a supported JRE version one option is to create the link for java binary in $BSE/bin directory and the bshell should be able to pick it. That is the first place it looks for any executable. If that still doesn't work you can enable a JVMI trace for bshell and that should give some clue.<br />

Sorry no. I had this once on Linux and never figured out what was the reason but after copying the jar files it worked.<br />
Ah, my favorite mistake is to include &quot;bin&quot; in JAVA_HOME which must NOT be included. If that is not the case I have no more ideas.</div></div><hr />

I run it everytime i change something with Excel Integration.<br />
<br />
Also refer to KB 1063602.<br />
<br />
In KB 1367788 there is very detailed information which settings had to be maid.<br />
<br />
We have set the following environment variables in the file $BSE/lib/bse_vars:<br />
<br />
export BSE_CLASSPATH=/usr/slm/java/com_baan_bclm.jar:${BIRT_HOME}/lib:${BSE}/java/ow.jar::${BSE}/java/ow3p.jar::${BSE}/java/bjvmi.jar::${BSE}/java/ssa-bml.jar::${BSE}/java<br />
export CLASSPATH=/usr/slm/java/com_baan_bclm.jar:${BIRT_HOME}/lib:${BSE}/java/ow.jar::${BSE}/java/ow3p.jar::${BSE}/java/bjvmi.jar::${BSE}/java/ssa-bml.jar::${BSE}/java<br />
export JAVA_HOME=/baan6/java/jdk1.8<br />
export JRE_HOME=/baan6/java/jdk1.8/jre<br />
export PATH=${BSE}/bin:${ORACLE_HOME}/bin:/baan6/java/jdk1.8/bin:/baan6/java/jdk1.8/bin/client:/usr/slm:${PATH}<br />
<br />
Hope this helps ;)<br />
