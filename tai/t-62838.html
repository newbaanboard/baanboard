<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">welks10</div><div class="date">13th September 2012, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys. I am currently attempting to install the new Infor10 ERP 10.2.0, but I am having trouble installing it. <br />
<br />
About 2 days ago, I installed FP7 perfectly fine. I tried to update it to Infor10 with no luck. <br />
<br />
Then I wiped everything and did a fresh install of Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 R2 with Latin1_General_BIN collation. <br />
<br />
I then did the staging wizard from both the enterprise disc and the enterprise server disc. <br />
<br />
Next I configured everything.. put in the database information, made sure the collation matched, installed SLM, etc. <br />
<br />
When the installation begins it installs the SLM and ASM fine. Then it gets to the importing BWC and it pops up an error message saying &quot;Connection with server lost, Reconnect?&quot;<br />
<br />
Never had this problem before... anyone have any ideas as to why it is losing connection with the server?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">welks10</div><div class="date">15th October 2012, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Normally I would install everything as one lump. For some reason 10.2.0 didn't like that. I had to install the porting set by itself first. Then I was able to install everything else. Kind of strange but it worked. Thanks everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
get the LN installation guide, your questions will be answered there.<br />
You can check if it on the iso images you already have, document U9497H US.<br />
Otherwise you can get it from Infor Xtreme, not from this board because it has copyright.<br />
