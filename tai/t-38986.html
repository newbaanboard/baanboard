<br />
Need your help: We have 2 BaaN application servers and want to share audit information on both the servers.<br />
<br />
Our Plan: We will first backup and delete existing audit data on one of the servers and then, share the file partitions / directories of the other server that are storing audit information with this server.<br />
<br />
Problem: In this way, we will lose audit information on one of the servers. <br />
<br />
Is there any way by which we can consolidate both the audit information into one so that none of the data is lost??<br />
<br />

You could use one NFS share for both servers. Not sure about how to configure this, but we use it with 7 servers (for the whole Baan system except of some log files. But this has history reasons) . One realy important thing I know is: don't share the shmparameters! This will not work, because they depends from the maschine (it had &quot;unpredictable&quot; results...).<br />

Am only talking about sharing &quot;audit&quot; directory here and not the Baan application. And I know we can share the directory on NFS, but what about merging audit information on 2 different servers into one??</div></div><hr />

<br />
For my understanding of the audit file structure there is no way to merge them. <br />
What I wanted to write is, why not sharing the audit directories so both servers can write in the same file? We do so without problems. <br />

But, what about the old data on one of those servers? We will lose that, since existing data will have to be removed.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">22nd July 2007, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to correct myself. There is a way to merge them... . I've looked at the tools online help. Look for the aud* commands. With this commands you can write a program that reads the audit files (run the program at every server so you read the local files) and write the data to a table. From this table you can re-create the files with the data of both servers.<br />
<br />
It's not an easy way but it is possible. I think it's easier to save/archive the data for further use. Or just read the data from one server and save it in a table for reporting. <br />
