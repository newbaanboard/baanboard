I have a client where there is a defined job.  I changed the next execution date, and tried to activate the job.  Opened the session, got the correct job on the screen, pressed &quot;y&quot;, and now the job status is &quot;Waiting&quot;... Waiting for what?  I thought it was OK, and killed the &quot;Activate job&quot; session, and the job didn't run.  How do I get the status to be &quot;In queue&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Basically this how you set up a job within a queue. See attachment. Be aware that the jobdaemon has to run at the OS.<br />

I needed to get to the status field! :o This was achieved by cancelling the job, maintaining it (to reset the status to free), save it, edit it again, and... at last I could get to the status field, and change it to &quot;In queue&quot;! Phew! As you will probably realise, I haven't been using BaanIV for a long time! :)</div></div><hr />
