Difference between languages is in date format and character set for Croatian language is ISO88592.<br />

maybe this will couse your problem:<br />
<br />
Look at the NLS TAB in your bw-configuration.<br />
<br />
Maybe there's ARABIC or Right to Left enabled.<br />
<br />

<br />
there is not &quot;Right to Left reading&quot; enabled and Locale is &quot;Eastern Europe&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't think that the problem is in bw client or worktop settings, because in english language is everything OK using same bw/worktop client.<br />
<br />
I cheked all settings for croatian language in application and everything seems OK.<br />
<br />
We have a lot of Baan IV, Baan 5.0 and a few SSA ERP LN installation with slovenian, croatian or serbian language but I never faced such problem before.</div></div><hr />

On the tab 'NLS' there is a field on the bottom 'Right to left reading'. When this field is checked, you will get the result you showed in the print-screen...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you check the &quot;Reading direction&quot; frame in the Worktop options. I know that it happens also in BW. What do you have there? Follow Worktop Language?<br />
<br />
If you change it to Left-To-Right does it still happen? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">22nd August 2006, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I reported this problem to SSA Support and got explanation. The problem is because we use small h as language code for Croatian language. SSA language codes are H for Croatian and h for Hebrew. Languages a (Arabian) and h (Hebrew) has by default right to left.<br />
<br />
I tested it and it is true. But it happens on one installation only. Does anybody know where is it defined  porting set, BW client, ?</div></div><hr />
