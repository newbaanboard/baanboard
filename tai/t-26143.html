<br />
I am currently on Baan 4c4. I did some test on the Baan software.<br />
<br />
It seems the BaaN will dropped (closed) after 9 Seconds, if the network is disconnected.<br />
<br />
Test #1:<br />
1. Connect to BaaN using LAN.<br />
2. Unplug network with timing.<br />
3. About 9 seconds, the BaaN prompt message of disconection. BaaN windows closed immediately.<br />
 <br />
Test #2:<br />
1. Connect to BaaN using LAN.<br />
2. Unplug network, then re-plug the network (within 9 seconds).<br />
3. BaaN is still working.<br />
 <br />
Therefore, if the Internet having TimeOut more than 9 seconds.<br />
Is there anyway to make BaaN's TimeOut longer?<br />
Where can I access the BaaN Log File? especially to show users' login or sessions?<br />
This is affecting my remote users as Baan closes by itself over at their remote sites and they have to login again. I suspect because the timeout is so low, and whenever the internet is not stable, Baan will logout by itself.<br />
<br />
Is this true? Can any one suggest anything?<br />
<br />
