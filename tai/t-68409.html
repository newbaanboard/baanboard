<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">24th November 2015, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two custom sessions: one zooms to the other. When I do the zoom, I get the error 301, query not correct, unknown reference. <br />
<br />
The session I zoom to is based on a custom table, which has a field &quot;cuno&quot; that references tccom010.cuno in the table definition. The form for this session displays both this cuno field and tccom010.nama. The unknown reference error is related to this field. If I remove tccom010.nama, the error goes away.<br />
<br />
The Zoom 2 session uses a Type 3 form and the customer and name are multi-occurrence fields. <br />
<br />
If I run the zoom to session by itself, I don't get any error.  The name displays correctly. <br />
<br />
The problem only occurs if I zoom to a view that has more than 10 occurrences (the limit for the session). If it has less than 10, I don't get the error. <br />
<br />
The session has this in the Zoom From section:<br />
zoom.from.all:<br />
on.entry:<br />
     import(&quot;z.date&quot;, tdcus048.date) | The main view field<br />
     execute(find.data)<br />
<br />
If I comment these lines out, I can zoom and manually navigate to the date.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if they are relevant to Baan4, but you can check similar threads - <br />
<br />
Thread 1 (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=61741)<br />
Thread 2 (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=5970)<br />
Thread 3 (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=27739)<br />

Sounds like it has something to do with the table def. You can wait for someone to add a specific answer to this if the above thread don't help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">24th November 2015, 17:15</div></div><div class="posttext">You might be right. I converted to runtime for all packages (to include tccom010) and it worked. <br />
<br />
It is weird that the only time not doing this seemed to cause an error was when I zoomed to the session, used find.data and if there were more occurrences than could be displayed. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
