<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pichlmair</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello!<br />
We use BaanIVc3-Application with BaanIVc4-Tools in Europe on one server with five languages (Dutch, French, English, German, Italian).<br />
The english-speaking users in Europe use the language 2-english with the date-format DDMMYY. Now we have also a site in USA, where the user use again the language 2-english, but here we need the date in the format: MMDDYY. That's all running on one server with the same BSE, but with different companies. <br />
<br />
If we change the default date format for language 2-english with ttaad1110m000, it's changed for all users, which is not ok, because it should be only for some us-baan-users. After convert-to-runtime the file $BSE/lib/datecurr will be updated.<br />
We want to change the date-format for some special users.<br />
We also tried to change the date-format for certain users in the user-file in $BSE/lib/user.<br />
It works fine with all reports, but not with forms. In this case, Baan reads the file $BSE/lib/datecurr. The solution would be for us to have a second file datecurr, to define the date-format MMDDYY for our USA-user. That means a own datecurr for some of the users or a own datecurr for a baan-company.<br />
<br />
I appreciate you prompt response to this request.<br />
Thanks,<br />

 <br />
 Create another language, copy the components from English(2) to the new language, by linking the components to the original language, etc.<br />
 <br />
 There is a lot of work to do this, I know. Also there will be a large number of components in $BSE/application.... Tools tables would grow. A lot of disadvantages.<br />
<br />
 It is just an idea.</div></div><hr />
