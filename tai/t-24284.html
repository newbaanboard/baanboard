<br />
I have this problme since long time and I asked about it in different threads but never able to fix it. I dont know process detail behind the &quot;convert Runtime DD&quot; for table, domain or user etc. Unfortunatly Baan never logs any thing (error or problem) during &quot;convert runtime DD&quot; but the process never ends. <br />
<br />
What could be the reasons for it? If it is the problem of directory access right, user rights, path definition problem, object corrupted, etc. I have no clue about it. I observed that during the &quot;Convert runtime DD&quot;, the file is created in the TMP directory but it always remains empty.<br />
<br />
I will appriciate the all suggestions to resolve this problem. If someone expalin the process detail behind the wall, may be this helps to fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
first let's define, what kind of CRDD are you trying to do?<br />
<br />
a) CRDD after user data ws changed<br />
<br />
This is actually the most easy one. Here Baan will just rewrite the u&lt;LOGIN&gt; file in $BSE/lib/user. This takes usually just a sec and is most likely not your issue.<br />
<br />
b) CRDD after change of a table<br />
<br />
Here Baan will do the following:<br />
   - write the new DD file of this table in $BSE/dict/dd&lt;PKG&gt;/... <br />
   - compare the existing old and the new DD file<br />
   - if the files differ, then baan  will dump the table, recreate it<br />
     and load the data again. This should create a temporary file<br />
     in $BSE/tmp, a process called bdbreconfig should run and a <br />
     logfile in $BSE/log is written (even on windows!)<br />
<br />
c) CRDD after change of DD<br />
<br />
Basically baan will do the same here as in (b), but for all tables, which use the domain. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps you a bit to followup, what is happening on your side and you can give us some more details, what's going wrong.<br />
<br />

<br />
First of all thanks for quick and detail response.<br />
<br />
At my side problem is whenever I tried to convert runtime DD for any thing, table, domain or user, it get stuck and never comes end. <br />
<br />
A similar problem is with printing of report (I have started a thread for this porblem but not get any resolution Select device session not started (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=24115) ), the select device session never started and I am not able to proceed and print the report. I noticed that the temp file for report is created in the TMP directory but it always remains empty (size 0k). <br />
<br />
I am sure that all these problems are related and require just a very small configuration, but not know what and where?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
MRF</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">14th June 2005, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, lets have a look at the most simple of the three first:<br />
<br />
The convert to runtime in ttaad2100m000 (user management) for a single user. <br />
<br />
Can you execute this? <br />
Does ist start writing the file in $BSE/lib/user? (You know most likely, that it only writes the file, if the user data was actually changed)<br />
<br />
This is really such a simple action. No Reports are involved, just a bit of file IO and it should return immediately.<br />
<br />

I tried to convert runtime DD for user. I changed few attributes for a test user and start convert to runtime, it runs for long time but never come to end, file remains unchange. I am not able to complete even for this simplest case. <br />

This would have moved the fd* file - are the paths in all of the files correct? Two - when you log into this new company are you getting the correct $BSE path?  Just another thought I had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">14th June 2005, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Yes, the path in all fd.* files are correct, and it should be correct becasue the directory structure on the actual server and copy server is same.<br />
<br />
Yes, on log on to the new server/company, getting the correct BSE Path.<br />
<br />
I dont know if it the issue, becasue I can work on the new environment, can update and compile scripts etc, but not able to convert RDD and printing  any report.<br />

Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th June 2005, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thought - have you tried rebuild dd in ttaad1121m000? Just a stab - I would recommend contacting Baan.  You might also want to check ttaad1120m000.  Just glancing through the menus.  Last thought have your tried starting and stopping Baan on this server.  Wondering if something could be hung up in shared memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">14th June 2005, 21:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
don't feel offended if you already considered/checked this ... but when you copied the $BSE directories ... you did it as Administrator? Did you change the permissions of these dirs afterwards? (even M$ has something like this :-)<br />
<br />
Although I would expect a clear error message and immediate abort in case of access problems, but one never knows ...<br />
<br />
Good luck to you and let us know what the prob finally was.<br />

<br />
mark_h: I tried to rebuild dd in ttaad1121m000, it ends with a message that there is no change in package combination. Yes, I have restarted the Baan service several time, there is no problem with it but I am not able to start the shared memory manager. It always give error as<br />

The same error message for few other tables. I checked these table in the specified package &quot;b50ocfby&quot; in session table definition but these tables are not existed in the specified package.<br />
<br />
<br />
norwim: Yes you are right, I copied all directories as baan user (having administrator rights on machine) and after that updated the directory rights as full control to every one. Yes, I dont think so that it is the problem of access rights becasue the file is created in the TMP directory but it remains always empty.<br />
<br />
Any thing other that we can check?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">15th June 2005, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">just another guess:<br />
<br />
if you have the directory structures 1:1 on the 2 servers ... do you get this warning<br />
--quote<br />
Message <br />
No definition in definition file for sopen({package=b50ocfby}F_BRDD:dtczzb002, dtczzb002)<br />
--endofquote<br />
on the (source-)system too?<br />
You should, shouldn't you? But this is just a warning, shared memory should work though.<br />
I assume that you can start the shared memory service on the other system.<br />
<br />
On the new system: Does a file called srdd_tab6.2 exist in $BSE/lib? If so, can you start the shmmanager if you rename it? <br />
<br />
I found something about ERRNO 22, but this has to do with kernel values on unix machines .... I have no idea what might have to be adjusted on a M$ server, sorry.<br />
<br />
Do you know filemon? Small shareware proggy that shows file accesses .... always worth a try.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />
norwim: The interesting thing is that the directoy structure is 1:1 on both server but not getting any warning message on the source server. Yes, share memory service is started on the other server but not able to connect to share memory manager.<br />
<br />
File srdd_tab6.2 exist in $BSE/lib is existed and after renaming this file, still not able to start the share memory manager, getting error message as follows:<br />
<br />
Error in reading '${BSE}/lib/srdd_tab6.2;${BSE_REM}!${BSE}/lib/srdd_tab6.2': Error 2<br />
<br />
I dont have any idea abt the proggy &quot;filemon&quot;, let me check on net.<br />

<br />
Are you by any chance logged using Terminal Server when you try to start the shared memory manager? That doesn't work. It will probably work if you log on through VNC, or directly on the server's console....<br />
<br />
Nick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">15th June 2005, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">HI friends,<br />
<br />
nick66: You are right, as soon as I logon on to the server through the VNC, the Share memory manager is started. Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
Now we can come to the actual issue, the conver runtime DD is not work and I am not able to print any report. I tried this also by connecting over the VNC but it still not working.<br />
<br />
One interestig point that comes in my mind after &quot;nick66&quot; information, the actual server is running on windows NT while the new server is running on Windows 2000 and &quot;Terminal Services&quot; are also running on the new machine. The SQL server version is same on both machines. The installation of Baan on both servers is done by the same software CDs. I dont know if this difference is causing problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
I found multiple results when searching for forums and Wiki for DBSLOG<br />
have a look and see if you can figure out how to set it.<br />
<br />
If it's a database problem, that will tell you. But personally still I think that it's a problem with permissions (or something) in your temp directory. (even though the file gets created) Windows is strange that way sometimes.<br />
