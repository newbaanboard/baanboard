<br />
In our recent MS2000 installation we can only print files to the server.  Any quick method on getting printed files to the clients C: Drive?  Having the user enter in their complete path \\mycomputer\c$ in the device is not really acceptable.  <br />
<br />
Yes, we can print to Word, Notepad etc., but would prefer to print directly to an ascii file on the client.<br />
<br />
Is there a BSE_OUT environment variable or something similar.  Would a wrapper script be appropriate?<br />
<br />
I assume there is something simple I am overlooking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the tools function - server2client() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_client_file_access_server2client)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 22:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking for a possible solution from the &quot;ttstpsplopen&quot; standard program session (select device).<br />
<br />
I guess you're inferring I'll need to create a 3GL program and use that in the Device Data setup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">15th May 2003, 01:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is to use the bwprint.  <br />
<br />
When printing to a printer, check the 'Preview' option.  This will bring up the report to your screen instead, in the bwprint program.  You can then use the fairly standard windows File drop down menu to print the report, or save it to your PC.  <br />
<br />
The major problem with that is they are saved in the '.bpf' format, and can only be read by bwprint, not a regular ASCII file.   The users may have to install bwprint on their PC's.  It comes with Baan.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone here has come up with a conversion for that.....<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">estotz</div><div class="date">15th May 2003, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of the bwprint, it is still easier to print to a file device with path:<br />
<br />
\\mycomputer\C$\whatever <br />
<br />
although I'd like to make it easier on the users and simply print to their C drive (or whatever).  Anyway to resolve an environment variable on the device setup of through the print session (ttstpsplopen)?  <br />
<br />
Using the server2client() function is a good idea, but I don't want to reinvent the wheel with writing a program.  If anyone has an example of something similar to the ttstpconv, that would be swell.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that case you need to use - get.bw.hostname() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_system_and_user_information_get_bw_hostname) to get the computer name and assign it to the variable - spool.fileout variable in your calling program.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you out.</div></div><hr />
