When using session tiscf0101m000 (Maintain Production Orders) I can use Ctrl+B to zoom, in order to Release a Production from this session. I am set up as a Normal User and some of our other users are unable to use Ctrl+B to zoom.<br />
<br />
Is there a setting to enable this?<br />

(I am not sure which forum to post this question to)</div></div><hr />

Which is what I was trying when I first read your post thinking it had to be upper case b. :)  <br />
<br />
We will leave the post here and if you want it moved just ask and one of us moderators can try another forum.  I cannot think of anything in baan to activate this and I am not sure if something on the client might be set to prevent it from sending the ctrl-b.</div></div><hr />
