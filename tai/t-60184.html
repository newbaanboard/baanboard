<br />
I know as admins we all have our little tools to do things.<br />
<br />
We are trying to setup LN and want that the components across Dev, Test, Support and Production to be compared for synchronicity. Ofcourse for Dev and Test we will ignore for all current developments and testing.<br />
<br />
If any of you have ready made tools or unix shell scripts and willing to share welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Use pmc to distribute your components. You can use the data in ttpmc201000 to check which solutions are installed where in order to compare these.<br />

<br />
Any ideas??</div></div><hr />

I assume you mean the source/object level comparisons? From SOX/security point of view the developers should not be able to make direct code changes/compile code in production (you can have approved emergency VRCs/changes than the deployed code in target VRCs). <br />
You can use the ssh or rsh commands on Unix to list/compare a component from source to target environments. It would make it easier if the PMC/deployed-VRCs are in sync across the environments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've created some products to answer this kind of questions:<br />
1. Baan4Unix is a set of Unix scripts to simplify application &amp; technical  management of Baan environments. <br />
2. Baan4U makes it possible to compare (sets of) packageVRCs within an environment or between environments. It will work for all versions of Baan/Infor and for any number of environments.<br />
<br />
Please search the forum for Baan4U. On http://www.quint-ict.nl  (http://www.quint-ict.nl) you can find a Dutch Baan4U powerpoint and a Dutch Babe4Unix manual.<br />
<br />
Please mail to info@quint-ict.nl when you prefer documentation in English or when you have additional questions.<br />
<br />
Kind regards &amp; I hope to hear from you soon. <br />

May be useful if same situation exist at ur end .<br />
<br />
pathname 4gl function along  with several other functions can help u print differences in runtime components. Would also recommend u follow PMC procedure for standard /localizations component changing/overwriting . For customized components u may use ur written scripts . Ur script  can be used for printing different components across environments without changing them.</div></div><hr />

Han, NPRao, Hitesh for your valuable suggestions.<br />
<br />
NPRao,<br />
<br />
We have deployed PMC only for all installations but still for comaprison sake we want to use this method also.<br />
<br />
Iam interested in rsync kind of compare or as you said ssh kind of.<br />
<br />
What variables should we consider for such comparison of scripts or objects like data and time, size, permissions etc.<br />
<br />
Also if we use rsync with just list option we have to use a source right then how will we compare??<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />

<br />
U may check time , size etc . But file.cmp(src file ,target file ) function in baan ( I think function in ttdllfilehand ) will do a byte by byte comparison and will give u return true for  any single difference . In case u look for such comparisions  , this function can help . <br />
<br />
If  u are trying to do some sort of syncing files from one instance to another , please aware of dictionary objects syncying . Syncing these objects without actually re-configuring tables  in other environment will land u with error 512 in other environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quintict</div><div class="date">20th March 2011, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are only interested in runtime comparison on Unix level (e.g. application and dict (table/domaindefs)) I can offer you:<br />
1. pvrclist<br />
This script will create a recursive (runtime) listing of the application directory. When you run pvrclist in two environments you can use the diff command to see the differences<br />
2. tabdefdiff<br />
This script will list differences in table/domain defs between 2 package combinations in one environment. It's no big deal to make it possible -in a pvrclist kind of way- to compare table/domaindefs across environments<br />
<br />
The scripts are variable-driven: after setting the vars specific for the Baan environment in the setenv script.<br />
<br />
Note: if you want to in-depth comparison (=comparing also softwarecomponents without a runtime component) you will need the Baan4U tool I mentioned earlier</div></div><hr />
