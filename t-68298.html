<br />
Can you explain the requirement? Most of the times, DAL can be replaced by AFS and its always better to use DAL over AFS wherever possible and yes, its possible to get data from other database and update details in LN, There are many ways to achieve this based on your requirements and resources you have.<br />
<br />
e.g Use SSIS or any other utility to save your data to text or XML file and push it to LN server. Use standard LN functions to read and process the file.</div></div><hr />

First of all thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I have already  reading data from text file and updating in Infor. My requirement is to read data directly from SQL server  using AFS and update the details in infor (update part is already done). I can read from text file using AFS file read functions like wise i want to read data directly from SQL .So that  want to know the following like connection string format and how to open and close a sql connection inside AFS module etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">26th October 2015, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm not really sure what you are trying to achieve but i assume you need to have real time data between 1 sql server machine and the LN database. i also assume that both are sql servers. in this case you can probably create a baan table that replicates with the other sql server machine. this solution is a little more &quot;intrusive&quot; and you need to be very comfortable with your sql server skills. there are plenty of microsoft articles that deal with replication on the web. this will have real time data between two machines and since you are talking about AFS and the data now resides in the baan table do whatever kind of updates you want, whether DAL or AFS.</div></div><hr />
