<br />
I want to take out inventory from company 100 (process negative quantity) and bring same inventory into company 200, using Inventory adjustment Function servers. The user will be in company 100 all the time, but be able to switch companies while processing Inv. adjustments in both companies 100 &amp; 200. My question is: how to switch company numbers in AFS? I appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

So you would switch.to.company (think that is the command) run the adjustments to lose inventory from company 100. Exit that api code, then switch to company 200. Then run the adjustments through the same code for company 200.  I recommend searching this forum for switch.to.company - it seems there was some problems with this, but I can not remember what they were.</div></div><hr />
