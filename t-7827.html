<br />
We had Support Eye installed a few weeks ago and we are currently working our way through the various scans.<br />
<br />
The details on the Archive Scan warn against running it in production time so we will probably run it sometime during the holiday period.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Neal</div></div><hr />

Have you had any results from the scans yet ?<br />
<br />
Has Baan done &quot;interpretation&quot; or were you able to do it yourselves ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
HNY yourself.<br />
<br />
The way I understand the archive scan Baan have to analyze the output from it.<br />
<br />
Sent the tar file off to them on 30/12/02 no response as yet.<br />
<br />
Not sure if you've ran archive scan yet but beware it takes a long time and also appears to put a fair load on the server.<br />
<br />
I started it on 20th December and it finished sometime between the 24th and the 30th.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Neal</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know the Baan blurb in Performance analyser of only putting a normal session load was a bit of an understatement as it took 25/32% of the 4 processor CPU with no other load at all on it.<br />
It also ran for 3/4 hours  not 45mins!<br />
<br />
We intend to run ArchiveScan on a very small company ( size wise) as a test. Before then putting a plan together for later in the year<br />
<br />
We have had feedback on our PA which was interesting , which I will share on 21st Jan <br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />
