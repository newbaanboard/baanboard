<br />
I have this function that has been working perfect for the last 4 years. Last Saturday we upgrade the the porting set and now when closing the hours for the day for the employee, we get an error &quot;End Date must be entered&quot;. This error happen when the day &quot;Monday, Tuesday, Wed....&quot; is blanked out on the session itself. But this field is calculated by the session tihra1101m000 when you change the field Hours Status to Close.<br />
<br />
function domain tcbool close.day()<br />
{<br />
	domain	tchtst		t.htst<br />
	domain	tcmcs.long	ret<br />
	domain	tctano		t.tano<br />
	domain tcpdno		t.pdno<br />
	domain tcyesno		oper.completed<br />
	domain tckoht		tran.type<br />
	domain tcmcs.long	clock.time<br />
<br />
	oper.completed = tcyesno.no<br />
	tran.type = tckoht.production<br />
	t.htst = tchtst.closed<br />
	tihraf101.put.Year(tihra100.year)<br />
	tihraf101.put.Week(tihra100.week)<br />
	tihraf101.put.Employee(pro.emno)<br />
	tihraf101.put.Week_Sequence_Number(tihra100.wsrn)<br />
	rec.found = tihraf101.find()<br />
	clock.time = determine.clock.time()<br />
	if rec.found then<br />
		tihraf101.put.Hr._Tr.Stat(t.htst)<br />
		ret = tihraf101.update(false, add.mess)<br />
		tihraf101.put.Hr._Tr.Stat(t.htst)<br />
		ret = tihraf101.update(true , add.mess)<br />
		if not ret then<br />
			message(add.mess,1)<br />
			tihraf101.recover(add.mess)<br />
			return(false)<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
	return(true)<br />
}<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

I would report this to Infor and I am not sure updating the libraries would solve the problem.  Not sure if this helps but I would search for threads by lbencic on this topic.  Not sure if these are relevant to your problem or not, but it seems one of the threads reported the same issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">12th December 2008, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">This really scares me because I have so many FS that I hope this problem will NOT make fail all others. <br />
<br />
Yes, we update the api libraries as well.<br />
<br />
I'll investigate. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">12th December 2008, 20:45</div></div><div class="posttext">After further investigation, I've been informed that, we moved from 06.01 to 07.08 Porting set. However, seems that apilib are not modified on the new porting set and therefore not updated.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not know what is wrong with this.<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th December 2008, 01:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had various function servers break with different SP's and porting set updates, but only once did a vast majority break.  That was caused by a porting set update, but the newest API libraries fixed the problem.  You might also want to check for a current version of the session.  Do you own source where you might be able to debug what is happening? Have you tried entering the end date just to see if that provides a work around?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">15th December 2008, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I've tried to pass the end date and still not working.<br />
Yes we own the source, I'll try to debug it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">15th December 2008, 22:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that the to.field() function seems that isn't working... I am not quite sure. When I pass by the function, the debugger doesn't jump to that field, keeps going over the following code. I can't bet on that but, if is that, the function is applied to field tihra100.endy ( to.field(tihra110.endy)), which is the field in question.<br />
<br />
What are the latest API libraries?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th December 2008, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">You would need to contact infor for the last libraries for the service pack - I am really not sure what the latest version is.</div></div><hr />
