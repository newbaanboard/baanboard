<br />
This problem don't happend when the report is saved as a .txt file, opened later with wordpad and it is sent to the PDFMAILER virtual printer. <br />
<br />
For Baan, PDFMAILER is only a windows printer, but bwprint and PDFMAILER have some problem to communicate when there are groups of blank lines in the report.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know a solution? <br />
Thanks<br />
 :(</div></div><hr />

Ok, you are into risky business...!!! This is the third time you post this very same message! The users and especially the forum managers do not have much sympathy for cross-posters. A message should be posted only once, at the relevant forum. <br />
<br />
Just a tip for your own health's sake...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmeizagirre</div><div class="date">27th September 2005, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I have wait for some days and I have received no reply. This is why I think that first forum wasn't the right forum. <br />
Then, I have found that both, Tool Administration forum and Tool Development forum, have questions about problems with reports... Then, Â¿WICH IS THE RIGHT FORUM?<br />
I think most people and weblog's administrations understand this problem.<br />
In addition, this doesn't generate annoying e-mails or similar because this forum doesn't work as an e-mail list. I have not received warning from the administrator. I am surprised with your reply.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmeizagirre</div><div class="date">17th October 2005, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The patches 145207stnd, 204143stnd, 204709stnd (they install the Office Integration functions in Baan IV) solve then blocking problem.<br />
After the installation of these patches I haven't got blocking problems but  I have found that bold fonts at the las line of the page can generate problems in the conversion to pdf format made by PDFMAILER, I have removed them from by report.<br />
Perhaps this could help another person.</div></div><hr />
