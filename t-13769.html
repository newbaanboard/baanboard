I am pretty new to Baan and our company has a Baan IV c4 installation running on Windows NT SP4 on the following hardware<br />
<br />
Dual P III Xeon 500<br />
1 GB RAM<br />
8x9.1 GB SCSI'S in RAID 5<br />
2 GB Swap on  80GB IDE drive<br />
<br />
We have about  25 Active concurrent users  and during most of the day our CPU's are maxed out by SQL. When all 25 users are online,performance is really slow.<br />
<br />
Just curious about what sort of loading other Baan Servers out there are running at.<br />
<br />
Would be really nice to know what people are running <br />
<br />
Hardware config.<br />
Users<br />
Typical Server Load<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I've moved all report generation outside of baan (in crystal reports), so much of server load is taken out.<br />
<br />
mostly reports need a lot of processing, everytime a big report is generated the CPU usage comes to 100%, which also makes other processes slow.  RAID5 also is instrumental in making the server slower.<br />

<br />
Yes we are using SQL 7 and performance is poor. SQL eats up around 800MB or so of physical memory during peak loads.<br />

  <br />
I am not sure that the RAID 5  is the cause of the server slowing down (assuming that you have a good RAID card installed that does not eat CPU cycles.Even in the worst case a RAID card would not consume more than 10% of CPU time even under extensive read/writes)<br />
I setup a performance counter in winNT and under peak loads the reads/writes total did not exceed a few hundred Kbytes/sec. (far below the capability of the Disk subsystem, even an old one such as the one we have)<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that memory is the bottleneck. Today i will set up another perfomance counter to see how much swapping takes place under load for a few days.<br />
<br />
could you ( EdHubbard and sriram and anyone else who reads this post:)) also please post some numbers about  Disk I/O's and memory usage in your systems under a typical load? Just  so that the bottleneck is easier to isolate<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Our server physically has 1.7GB of RAM. The SQL process uses around 1GB of that so I think your memory is likely to be too low.<br />
We have 4 x 400MHz Xeon processors and processor utilization averages 30%.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 14:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Typically 25 - 30 users</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulletboy</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm interesting....you are probably right about the memory being too low. I am going to start some perf logs to monitor the Pagefile usage.<br />
<br />
Low physical memory would translate to higher Paging right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I think so. Our test server only has 1.2GB of RAM and it works ok - but it only has 1 or 2 users on at any time.</div></div><hr />
