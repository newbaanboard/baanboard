Give me screen shots of your 4101 and localization session with stepwise order creation along with localized data manually i.e. using gui directly .</div></div><hr />

(2) Always search this forum for the session in question - see this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=15329&amp;highlight=tdslsl101s002). There are multiple threads on tdsls4101m000 and tdslsl101s002 where code has been posted that would help.<br />
<br />
Anytime you have a problem with some AFS code I recommend searching this forum - several of us have already posted code that works for us.  Just keep in mind that because of patch updates, portingsets, etc. what is posted may not work for you.  This should give you a good starting point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justknowledge</div><div class="date">22nd March 2007, 05:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi mark,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your valuable suggestion i'll adopt the same in future, however i have already search the forum for same problem and found zero satisfaction <br />
my query is when you open session tdslsl102s002 through special zoom menu.<br />
It opens &quot;Maintain Extension to sales order lines&quot; with all blank field and once you click on add.set button it carries the marked order no and position  from session tdsls4105s000 and then we can maintain base date and all other fields<br />
<br />
now if i maintain base date as back date and want calculation on back date then according to my AFS i am unable to pick order no and pono automatically through <br />
stpapi.handle.subproc( &quot;tdsls4105s000&quot;, &quot;tdslsl102s002&quot;, &quot;add&quot;)<br />
stpapi.zoom.option (&quot;tdsls4102s000&quot;,1,&quot;tdslsl102s002&quot;,error.in.tdslsl102s002)<br />
<br />
and i think becasue order no and position is comming blank on tdslsl102s002 AFS is throwing error &quot;Extension to Sales Order header not exists.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or in other words if sombody can suggest me how can i carry order no and position from tdsls4105s000 to tdslsl102s002<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

They do an insert and an end on 4101 - with no handle on tdslsl101s002.  Your code looks different and I do not know if that is the difference or not.  We do not use these sessions so this is a shot.  This code came from this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=15329&amp;highlight=tdslsl101s002)(from SriksAdi).  I noticed several others also ended the 4101 session also before calling the tdslsl101s002 session.  Again there are no promises that this will work on your system - patches, service packs, etc.  You can review the rest of the code in the post on how he handles the 4105s000 session.</div></div><hr />
