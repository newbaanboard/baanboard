<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sgoupil</div><div class="date">3rd July 2013, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
We just developped a new web application that will run from a web server. Programming language is ASP.net and C# on IIS7 web server. Our Baan version is Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
This application will create new Purchase Requisitions, therefore, at the end of the process, the buyer will click a button to create new PO/PO lines in Baan automatically.<br />
<br />
We've tested this application, running from the developer's PC (localhost) and this works just fine.<br />
<br />
Now, to push further our tests, we moved the whole thing on our web server. We've installed Baan client on the the web server as well. The issue is, when running the application from the web server, the creation of the Baan instance seems to work (communication) but it opens the configuration screen. Once we entered the configuration connection parameters and click on the Run button, it hangs there and nothing is processed. Even, after creating the configuration parameters, every time we run the application, we always get the configuration screen instead of the login screen.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Here is the regular C# code we use to connect to Baan. Again, works from localhost, but not from web server.<br />
<br />
     Type t;<br />
            t = Type.GetTypeFromProgID(&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;);<br />
            Baan = Activator.CreateInstance(t);<br />
            object[] Parameters = new Object[1];<br />
            Parameters[0] = 3600;<br />
<br />
            Baan.GetType().InvokeMember(&quot;Timeout&quot;, BindingFlags.SetProperty, null, Baan, Parameters);</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd July 2013, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">My first thought was - is the default bwc file the same between the client and web server the same?  It almost sounds like the install on the web server does not have a default bwc file.  I can't speak about the c# or asp.net coding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sgoupil</div><div class="date">3rd July 2013, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we have a default, but it keeps asking for us to enter the configs, like it would be a fresh install with no default or even no config at all. It looks like it can't find the default config.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th July 2013, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if this is possible, but can you compare registry entries between the web server and one that works?  Sorry not much help, but all I can think of. To me it seems like the client install, but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />
