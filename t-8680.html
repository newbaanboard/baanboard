<br />
maybe someone will be able to help me with that:<br />
<br />
I have two different servers, &quot;powerfull&quot; live serwer IBM RS6000 and &quot;poor&quot; test server , Intel based Compaq with SCO Unix for some developing works ; both with BaaN Base<br />
<br />
On the test server we have developed some new sessions, dealing with new tables in a new module, and everything is running fast. But, after import DD on live server the same sessions (even on the same data) are running very slow. <br />
I have obserwed, that problem lies in fetch time of first row in select statements. For instance I have following select<br />
<br />
select tkikd068.* from tkikd068 for update <br />
where tkikd068.year inrange :year.f and :year.t <br />
selectdo  ...etc , where year is third part of four-part index.<br />
Table has about 2000000 records, 500000 of them is matching criteria.<br />
On test environment first row is selected after 0.17 seconds. On live environmet we must wait minutes for first row to be fetched.<br />
<br />
What can be wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">the reason could be the jfs of AIX. Do you actually notice during the fetch of the first row a lot of I/O on the disk particular on the transaction part of the volume group?<br />
<br />
It's already a few year back that I have worked with AIX, but due to the transaction principle of jfs working with tbase/bisam is not that fast. <br />
<br />
But the difference is too much.<br />
<br />
Hope you get more response.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it change when you use the between qualifier instead of inrange? And if you make it two different where clauses, &gt; year.f and &lt;= year.t?</div></div><hr />

<br />
a query I posted is just an example - the problem is that every update session runs much slower than we expected - and there are lots of different quieries in those sessions. We use indices and write our componens according to official Performance Guide. So i think the problem is not in non optimized queries.<br />
Do you know about any tbase parameter that can make all select statements to be treated like &quot;as prepared set&quot; (first row fetched after whole query processing) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume both boxes run tbase...<br />
Is there a difference in parameter settings? $BSE/lib/tbase/*param</div></div><hr />
