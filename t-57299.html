<br />
I am using AFS in a 3GL session to reset the scrap factor for a released production order to zero.<br />
<br />
However, when the session runs the code executes perfectly, but there are no changes made to the database.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />

What happens if you do it manually? Any messages? Are you getting any messages?  I know I can not modify any that were already issued or in outbound.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
The session is set to run as a job once a minute throughout the day.  Originally, I was puzzled why certain orders were not being cleared, but it turns out that they had outbound against them.  After I discovered that I wasn't as worried about it.  <br />
<br />
Then I discovered that the session wouldn't reset the SF when it was being run as a job.  However, if you just run the session manually then it would reset the SF.<br />
<br />
I am currently trying to see if any specific permissions are needed to run tisfc0110m000.<br />
<br />
I would certainly welcome any suggestions that you have at this point.<br />

<br />
So it worked as a job?<br />
<br />
<br />
Then I discovered that the session wouldn't reset the SF when it was being run as a job.  However, if you just run the session manually then it would reset the SF.<br />
<br />
And now it doesn't?  Did it ever work in batch? Did any updates get applied? Not sure I understand - so the session works when it is run manuall.  What about if you run the job manually?  What if you run the job using your ID(launching the cron as yourself)?<br />
<br />
All I know is if it works manually for you then it should also work in batch - we use a different ID for that.  All of our batch ID's are set up as superusers and we do not have an issue.  I can not think of anything else a user might need access to besides tisfc0110m000.</div></div><hr />
