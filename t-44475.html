<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frank holland</div><div class="date">14th November 2007, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday I saw a presentation of ERP LN, and I was positively surprised about the big improvements in Baan's user interface (dashboards, filter-options, multi-main-table etc.).<br />
<br />
A point that disappointed me was the fact that there are more or less no changes on the reporting side. The standard reports are still the old character based ones, and as far as I know, there is still no standard option to export reports in csv-format, a thing that almost all ERP-competitors have (and I think a programmer could sove in a couple of days...).<br />
<br />
Office Integration may be acceptable for Word (if it works?), because the amount reports that need a good look-and-feel is usually not so large, but for Excel I think it is a lot of work to make a template for each report that you want to export to Excel.<br />
<br />
As I see it, you would still need a third party reporting tool for Baan (unless you create your own solution, as many of us do, thus spending a lot of double effort...).<br />
<br />
There are some recent statements in this forum about third party reporting tools, but still I have some questions:<br />
<br />
Crystal reports:<br />
Is it true, that the cooperation between Business Objects and Infor will end, and the Solution Kit for Baan will not be available for future porting sets?<br />
(Would be understandable because of owner SAP).<br />
<br />
Cognos:<br />
I am not sure about the current relation between Infor and Cognos.<br />
Is there an interface between LN and Cognos? Is this a solution for documents or for data analytics (e.g. OLAP)? Can the document solution be compared with the solution for Crystal (Printer device in Baan that directly opens a Crystal report)?<br />
<br />
Other products:<br />
Are there other products that have a tight interface to LN?<br />
I heard something about an Infor reporting product, but I have no name, and I do not know how it is coupled to LN.<br />
<br />
So, a lot of questions...<br />
Thanks in advance for your help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, there is such tool, it's called Enterprise reporting for ERP LN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frank holland</div><div class="date">16th November 2007, 09:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The reporting tool that Infor offers apparently is called Infor Performance Management (PM).<br />
Part of this tool comes from a german company MIS that Infor bought.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have experience with this tool? Is it restricted to Business Intelligence, or can you also  print Baan-documents like an invoice or purchase order with it?<br />
<br />
In general I think there are many tools that you could use for BI, because for that it might be enough to access a standard database without Baan-specific logic (descriptions of tables and table fields, references etc.).<br />
<br />
For printing documents however, an interface with Baan is a must. In this area, it seems that there are only a few tools...<br />

<br />
Last week the news appeared that IBM will buy Cognos.<br />
<br />
How do you all think that this will affect the relation to Infor?<br />
<br />
As far as I know, SSA had a very good and tight relation to IBM, but I do not know if this applies to Infor...<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
