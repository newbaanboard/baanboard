<br />
We are in the process of finalising an integration (and the D-Day is tommorrow and hence it is urgent). We do not have access to the Baan source code. Now our concern is that if we use FS we will run into trouble sometime due to FS not being able to handle issues like the various popups (zooms, messages etc) or due to execute or end statements in init.form, choice sections and so on. <br />
<br />
The questions are:<br />
1.<br />
Does somebody have a list of scenarios where FS cannot do without adding the api.mode construct in the Baan source? Even if there is no list with any individual, it would be great if the forum members could just add their own known scenarios which hopefully will add up to the entire list. I have done some reading on this forum and have come to know of some cases like multiple reports handling, auto.nextform value setting etc causes FS to crash and api.mode comes to the rescue. However, I need to know if there are some more such scenarios.<br />
<br />
2. <br />
What does the variable boi.call exactly do? Is it to be set in the Baan source or in the FS client source (i.e. the DLL that we program to call FS functions)?<br />
<br />
3. I have to say I have not checked the forum for his yet (due to shortage of time) but has anyone done any study on using EDI vs FS approach to update Baan? <br />
<br />
Thankyou for your time!<br />
<br />

I have only used boi.call once and that was based on another posters recommendation.  I can come up with several other scenarios that MAY cause problems.  Notice I say MAY - I never really know what I may encounter, but I have so far always found work arounds.  I also do not know Baan V, so what you encounter could be different.  Here are some scenarios I have run into:<br />
(1) Limiting the number of records processed using API.  When I firsted start doing function servers I was able to process 1000's of records, but within the last year 1 or so, some of my most commonly used sessions require a limit to the number of records.<br />
(2) Controlling subsessions can be problematic.  Sometimes it requires a little work to get the control down and yes sometimes we have used Qkey to work around problems. Also sometimes I actually had to kill subsessions and then reactivate them to get them to work correctly using api.<br />
(3) Sometimes all fields do not update. Used various work arounds like putting the data twice and doing two saves. Also I have done direct table updates.<br />
<br />
Can not seem to remember any more big problems.  It is really to hard to say without actually trying to do the coding.  But I never shy away from using api type function servers.<br />

<br />
The only thing that you can use EDI for is to load PO's (and maybe modify them) for you.  Standard EDI functionality does not include 'receiving POs' or other things that we have used AFS to solve.<br />
