<br />
I developed importing functionality (purchase invoices) using a little bit AFS (a dummy query with a report containing the importing functionality). To make it really work I had to do some hardcoded table updates. It all worked nicely in sp11. Input was read from ascii files.<br />
<br />
After upgrading to sp18 I stumbled on the two following -silly- problems:<br />
<br />
1. In case the ascii file contains two invoices -in some cases- the first document is processed oke and the first afs call related to the processing of the second document will result in a hang situation (the report script is stuck; examining the process list of the bshell reveals nothin unusual (no sessions are waiting for input etcetera)). <br />
Notes:<br />
- 'in some cases': I know what input to provide to reproduce the hang situation; in other cases the report script will process and end without any problems.<br />
- when I remove the first document from the ascii file and restart the report the second document will be processed correctly. I.e. there's no functional problem.<br />
<br />
2. 'In some cases' the ostpapiserv program will not end. I know what data to provide to reproduce this situation. Note that the ostpapiserver didn't exist in sp11. In case the apiserv program ends oke I can see the following message in the afs.log: 18dll-&gt;serv (afsscript: exit(18)). In case the ostpapiserv doen't end this message wil not appear.<br />
<br />
Anyone having a suggestion? <br />
<br />

We did get some new tools and stpapi patches from Baan.  On top of that with SP18 SSA had started incorporating their warehouse product.  This caused us a lot of problems in the receiving area.  Baan fixed the code for the sessions I identified - most of it had to do with lot controlled items.  I also had to redesign my piece to actually get lot controlled items to work again.  I would report this to Baan as soon as possible. Currently we are testing service pack 19.<br />
<br />
If you have source you might be able to trace the new problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For your information: I installed the latest version (solution 205876). So far this doesn't seem to make any difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th October 2005, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">What porting set - we use 6.1c.07.04.  It seems to me someone posted something in this forum about problems with a porting set.  No promises this would solve the problem - over the years it seems like something different with each SP, one reason I recommend contacting SSA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HennySol</div><div class="date">28th October 2005, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
I already posted a call at SSA describing my problem. So far I didn't receive any answer. The portingset should be oke I guess:<br />
<br />
Portingset  : 6.1c.07.06<br />
Port no.    : PA.2638<br />
Date        : Tue Nov 30 16:39:29 MET 2004<br />
Uname       : HP-UX torka B.11.00 A 9000/861 2016171322 two-user license<br />
Machine-id  : HP9000_PA_8000<br />
OS-release  : HPUX11.00<br />
<br />
I 've found a work-around: If I split my ascii file data in a number of ascii files (to be precise: for each separate processing stream in the report script a separate file) the processing ends oke (apiserver exits!)<br />
<br />
The only problem remaining is the processing of purchase invoices with a ttyp that is 'PurchaseOrderRelated' (if you know what I mean). The problem there is the following:<br />
1. If I enter the receipts via AFS in tfacp1131/1132s000 and subsequently approve via tfacp1140 my first invoice is processed oke (batch is balanced and can be processed)<br />
2. If the ascii file contains another invoice to be processed the first AFS call to tfacp1131 for the second invoice will result in a hang situation.<br />
<br />
This problem I can work around by splitting once more the ascii files for this type of documents: If each ascii file contains only one invoice the processing is oke.<br />
<br />
So I can make it work; only thing is: my cheeks flush if I have a look at the coding that is necessary. It's not very elegant to say the least.<br />
<br />
I wonder if my problems could be caused by the thing you mentioned (SSA incorporating their warehouse product in sp18). I can imagine that tfacp1131/1132 are also changed because of this. Agree?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

I do know where all the warehouse stuff went - I only have a few sessions with source code.  Luckily the lot controlled session was one.  <br />
<br />
Another thing I have done in the past:<br />
Have you tried processing more than one record in debug mode?  stepping through each line - for two records.  I have had api code work this method but not work when a normal compile is done.  In some of these cases I have added a suspend statement to get them to work.</div></div><hr />
