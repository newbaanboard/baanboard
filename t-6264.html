<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">16th August 2002, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan is a rich ERP with rich data. Also a lot of customizations are done to get the information the way users need. However there has always been an unfulfilled need to represent the data graphically. Now this is no longer impossible. Users can get online graphs and charts whenever the reports are run. <br />
<br />
We have a tool available in Baan IVc4 version. This tool is written in Baan 4GL and uses Baan Chart Manager. This tool enables users to <br />
<br />
	- To specify the reports (standard, localized or customized) in which a graph / chart is desired. <br />
	- To specify the information user wants to plot on the graph from the report. <br />
	- To indicate the type of graph / chart required. <br />
	- To authorize the users and companies in which the graph / chart will be displayed. <br />
<br />
This tool enables the users to make quick and accurate decision and makes the decision making process easier.  Managers' dependence on others for graphs and charts is reduced and hence secrecy of confidential data is maintained easily.<br />
<br />
Further Baan Chart Manager is very agile and produces very high quality charts and graphs. And these too are available online with little investment and no extra implementation-like efforts. <br />
<br />
Also along with demo copy of the software 50 graphs from Baan standard are also given which enables users to get valuable MIS information from Baan graphically besides along with report itself. <br />
<br />
This tool is easy to use and install. For your demo copy of the software, please write to us ( hitesh@jewelexindia.com ) with your customer code, customer name and the package combination in which u want to install the tool. <br />
<br />
