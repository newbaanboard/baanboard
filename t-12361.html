<br />
i am using AFS for a session tfacp1131s000 Match Receipts<br />
<br />
the problem is that out of the two forms...<br />
the first form allows to do a find only on tdpur045.orno and tdpur045.pono<br />
<br />
<br />
while the same sessions form 2 allows the find on <br />
tdpur045.orno , pono and srnb .<br />
<br />
how do i customise the sessions form 1 so that it also allows the find for the above three fields instead of two.<br />
<br />
curr the find with only two fields gets me the wrong record<br />
<br />
<br />
doing this customisation i will be able to use the find in my AFS program to do what i need and get the correct record<br />
<br />
<br />
pls...do help....<br />
<br />
any suggestions ..ideas ..r most welcome<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at the form and as Maria suggested the field is display only on the form.  So the way I see things you have two options.  The first is to change the session and its forms, so the srnb field is part of the find.  I admit I do not know how Baan has two different find keys for the two forms. I have never attempted or tried this, so I am not sure how they did that.<br />
<br />
The second option is to use the stpapi.change.view using the orno and pono fields.  Then use the stpapi.browse.set to find the correct srnb record you are looking for.<br />

<br />
thanks to all , i got the find working finally !<br />
<br />
actually i was already  trying the option which maria suggested...<br />
but for some reason it wasnt doing any good...<br />
it was still giving me only two fields on the first form..<br />
<br />
i did a little research ...and found that in the first form there was<br />
additonal field &quot;tdpur045.srnb&quot; put in to the form again at the end after the Invoice amount.<br />
<br />
I deleted the sneaky extra field ,changed the actual tdpur045.srnb field to Input and ran the session again.... and it finally started giving the three fields req for the FIND.<br />
<br />
<br />
so its done finally :-)<br />
<br />
thanks to  Maria, mark , lisa  and gordan for ur prompt help !<br />
