Is there anyone who have some queries to analize data before starting with archiving. I need to give to the customer a report in which I show him the record which should be corrected before the archiving. Thank you in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">19th February 2004, 20:16</div></div><div class="posttext">There are about 60 things that should be checked prior to archiving. Unfortunately it takes more than a few queries to do that. It took me a year and more than 250 pages of program script to develop a program that goes through the whole application and does a thorough data checkup.<br />
<br />
You can run standard reports e.g. &quot;Print Integration Transactions&quot; to check if all integration transactions have been posted or write an Easy-SQL to go through the purchase receipts and check if they've all been matched to a supplier invoice. There are a lot of things to check. It's just really cumbersome to do it that way and you need a lot of functional knowledge in each area ..<br />
