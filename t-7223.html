you have just found out an issue that makes the integrated Baan reporting practically useless (from my point of view.): You cannot modify the report in Baan once it's in Crystal, without loosing the changes in Crystal.<br />
<br />
In the interim XML file that is exchanged between Baan and Crystal a time stamp is coded in. That time stamp is put into the report 3GL script during COMPILATION of the report. Crystal will throw away an existing reports when it get's a new report from Baan with a newer time stamp.<br />
<br />
Basically, the report extractor of Crystal seems to be able only to create a new report from scrach, but it (yet?) cannot process CHANGES in Baan. (At least this holds true for Crystal 8.0 / Baan Connector 2.0 version. - I'm not sure about Crystal 8.5 / Connector 2.5). <br />
<br />
Which version do you have?<br />
