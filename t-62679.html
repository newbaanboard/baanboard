<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmendes</div><div class="date">31st July 2012, 13:53</div></div><div class="posttext">In the past I developed a sesion wich uses API. Everything worked fine until some days ago when I had to instal several solutions. Now, the session hangs when executing the following line of code: stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdilc4113s000&quot;,&quot;tdilc402.clot&quot;, my.lot). This type of error only hapens with this sub-session. Other sub-sessions are called on the same script without problems.<br />
Anyone could give me a clue?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

The best thing is if you have the scripts for tdpur4120m000 and tdilc4113s000 - assuming these are the calling programs.  At that point all you can do is put it in debug mode and try to trace through it.<br />
<br />
Another thing is - when you installed these solutions did you update the API libraries and/or the portingset?  If no you might want to contact infor and get the latest API libraries - but no guarantee those might not cause other issues.<br />
<br />
I know in the past I have had some minor issues when doing a receipt.  I know in the call to create a receipt I had to set boi.call = &quot;tdboidll0011.Create&quot;.  I also had to set a variable g.sub.session = true to get the receipt program to work(in tdpur4120). This was way back in 2005 and I do not know if that is relevant to your situation or not.  Not even sure if I was you I would try them.  There can be so may differences between systems and we do use A&amp;D extension.<br />
<br />
Something else I just thought of - is this new lots or existing lots?  I know I create lots before calling the receipt session to receive the lot.  Been so long since I worked on these receipt sessions I can't remember why I did it that way at the very start. Hmmm - maybe that is what the system expects, just don't remember.</div></div><hr />
