I was wondering if there is anybody that has the QKEY documentation and wants to share it? I have inherited a system customized with QKEY, but no documentation.<br />
Appreciate a lot the help!</div></div><hr />

Contact redklay, if that is what they are still called and see if they can send you some.  The only copy I have is real paper.<br />

I noticed your profile says 4c4 AND1.  Service pack 24 actually breaks something in qkey and hopefully they will fix it soon.  It has to do with DEM flow generation - it no longer creates the pragma used statements, so when generating the dem flow users do not get all the permissions they need.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all the details you posted.<br />
 <br />
I used a long time ago QKEY, but I do not have any documentation. Through an acquisition we inherited the Baan system with QKEY, but we are out of luck with the maintenance contract. <br />
<br />
I am trying to see if we can get any manual before going to Redklay/Fullscope. I am sure they will ask for retroactive maintenance and I am not sure if it is worthwhile. We are evaluating the system to decide if we can remove QKEY, but I am not even sure how to install and un-install it.<br />
<br />
We are currently on Baan 4c4 with AND1 extension, SP 22. <br />
<br />
Maybe you can photocopy the manual you have?<br />
<br />
Appreciate the help!</div></div><hr />
