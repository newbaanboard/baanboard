<br />
We are having problem with the archiving session (tfgld6205m000). Since this session deletes table106, is it possible to delete tfgld106 manually? what will be the effect if we manually delete the this table, instead of running tfgld6205m000. We will just backup the table in the tape, instead of copying  this to archiving company. <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I've never used this session myself but can I suggest that before you go down the route of deleting directly from the table that you post some more detail about the exact problem you are having. It is possible that somebody on the board maybe able to solve the problem you are having with the archiving session.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">7th February 2002, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">1458 is a database error and I'm not quite sure what database you're running on but we're on informix and this sort of error is generally caused by a lack of logical log space see text below. <br />
<br />
&quot;finderr 458<br />
-458    Long transaction aborted.<br />
<br />
The database server ran out of log space in which to record this<br />
transaction. A transaction that is not fully recorded cannot be rolled<br />
back. To preserve database integrity, the operating system ended the<br />
transaction and rolled it back automatically. All changes made since<br />
the start of the transaction have been removed. Terminate the<br />
application, and replan it so that it modifies fewer rows per<br />
transaction. Alternatively, contact the database server administrator<br />
to discuss increasing the number or the size of the logical logs. Be<br />
prepared to talk about the number of rows being updated or inserted and<br />
the size of each row&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
We have already done this, and the error still persists, that's why we would like to do it manually, by deleting tfgld106 and other tables related to archiving session. Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">7th February 2002, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I would only do this if Baan support said it was OK to do so and I couldn't do it through the session.<br />
<br />
I have heard of people manually deleting tfgld410 but not tfgld106. You really need to find out what other tables may be effected before proceeding.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't be of more help.<br />

The archiving session must do quite a few checks before it actually deletes each record.  I'm not sure how you would be able to do this manually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mattcull</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds to me like you need some more table space.<br />
The archiving sessions either work, dont work or report an error.<br />
<br />
If you really want to delete transactions in tfgld106 it can be done quite easially by deleting a selected range of transactions<br />
<br />
You should also change the status for each record tfgld018 Documents table to Deleted.<br />
<br />
If your data is for closed financial years eg 1999 you should not have any problems after doing this as long as all invoices have been paid. You will loose data integrity between tfgld 410 and tfgld106.<br />
<br />
You must run Rebuild History after you have done it<br />
<br />
I have deleted records in 106 before where archiving does not work</div></div><hr />

What you can do is copy tfgld106 &amp; tfgld 018 from the live company to the archiving company before deleting in the live company</div></div><hr />
