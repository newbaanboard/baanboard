Even though the customer is set up for tax and the sales order header shows tax=Yes, no tax code is assigned on the lines.  Since it doesn't get assigned, no tax is generated from Vertex.  This happened after we enabled Vertex but properly put the correct tax on the lines prior.  If you manually put the tax code on the line, it calculates correctly but it should automatically assign tax codes.  Customer service should not have to look up the tax codes to assign tax  to each line.</div></div><hr />
