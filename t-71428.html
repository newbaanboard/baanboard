<br />
I would appreciate your support into the issue below, INFOR till now didnt solve it for us.<br />
<br />
We have installed the following:<br />
<br />
1) Infor Business Vault Enterprise Edition 11.3.2<br />
2) Infor BI OLAP Server (64 bit) 11.0.0.365<br />
3) Infor LN Analytics Foundation 10.5.2<br />
<br />
We are using Infor LN FP9.<br />
<br />
We have 2 companies: 222 and 333.<br />
<br />
Company 222 has common Master data in it which is shared with company 333.<br />
<br />
We have published all the data referring the document &quot;Infor_LN_Integration_Guide_for_Infor_LN_Analytics_Foundation&quot;.<br />
<br />
But when we see the Sales Overview screen from LN Analytics Foundation, we see &quot;Customer reference missing&quot;, &quot;Customer reference invalid&quot; etc in report &quot;Top 10 Customers&quot;.<br />
<br />
We see &quot;Item reference missing&quot; in report &quot;Top 10 Items&quot;,<br />
&quot;Employee reference missing&quot; in report &quot;Top 10 Sales Representative&quot;<br />
<br />
Please refer the attached screenshot.<br />
<br />
Please tell me if someone can have an idea about this?<br />
<br />
Thank You,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reference missing is nothing but if you don't mention any customer,employee and item in the sales order then those orders will come under respective customer reference missing, item reference missing and employee reference missing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">27th December 2018, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The invalid reference means that the underlying order/invoice has a customer code but the master data is not known at the BI side. (re)Publishing the missing one or just all customers should resolve this issue.<br />
The reference missing means that the underlying order/invoice does not have a customer or item code attached to it. This is not wrong it is just a fact. Sometimes this is just how LN works in certain cases. Sometimes you could resolve this in LN by maintaining more data, like give each sales order a sales representative.<br />
