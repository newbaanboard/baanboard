<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zamarlab</div><div class="date">10th December 2003, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I found in baan that every session has some extern function.<br />
But this AFS code I have to put in VBA.<br />
<br />
this is example of this function:<br />
tufncgendll_launch(check.input.tfacp1100.isup).<br />
<br />
If someone knows how this function use in VB app, I will <br />
be very happy.<br />
<br />
Problem is that I don't know the dll name to call this function in VB.<br />
<br />
BaanObj.ParseExecFunction &quot;ottstpapihand&quot;, &quot;stpapi.put.field(&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;tfacp1100m000&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;tfacp100.isup&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;567845-33&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;)&quot;<br />
<br />
This is example how to put data into field. Here is used dllname: ottstpapihand. Now I  should know the dllname for that function.<br />
<br />
Or is maybe some other way how to check if this field has good input?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th December 2003, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish by calling this function from VB.  In this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13847) it looks like they are trying to do the same thing.  If this is the RMC version of extending source then why do you need to call this function from VB?  Typically what you do is create a Baan session with your modifications using RMC's product, QKey or the ~Vamsi solution.  Then you would call this program using the STPAPI commands.  Then when you did a insert the session itself would run the function that is mentioned.  If there was error then it would be returned to the calling program - in this case VB.  This function looks like it was intended to be imbedded in the program itself and not called independently.  It looks kind of like Qkey, where it would call the parent object of the session.  <br />
<br />
One way to find the DLL is to look at the script itself.  I believe Qkey includes a pragma used DLL pointing to its DLL.  Maybe RMC does the same type thing.  If it does not do that see if it attaches another library to the script.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">11th December 2003, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, you are correct.  Scripts and libraries generated by or run using RMCgen (http://www.rmcis.com/rmcgen2.html) have a pragma used line of <br />
#pragma used dll otufncgendll .<br />
<br />
It seems like RMCgen has become quite popular lately:D .</div></div><hr />
