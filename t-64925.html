1.How to execute a session in a program script<br />
2.Which event to capture (Ex. next record),So I can write script to put value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th November 2013, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Rush is the way to go.  I can't imagine all the coding that would have to take place using AFS code.  I mean first you have to duplicate the form, then make all the calls necessary for next record, previous record, etc.  Not to mention getting the data in the background to redisplay.  Not worth it and it would probably be easier just writing a brand new display session(assiming that is what is meant by query session).  If I was going to do it I would use rush.dll.</div></div><hr />
