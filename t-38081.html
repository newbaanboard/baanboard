<br />
I wonder if it is possible to disable so that afs code not can be runned threw Excel &quot;vba code&quot;?<br />
<br />
I have a script that has worked before but now I get this error<br />
Dynamic Link failure function '_get.api.error.status.as.string'<br />
<br />
People on my site believe that this can have something to do with sox rules but anyone knows for sure.<br />
<br />
:confused: <br />

I found the client can be real sensitive with the portingset and tools patch changes.  This error looks more like something happened with Baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fsamuels</div><div class="date">27th June 2007, 07:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are right that something happened with Baan.<br />
<br />
Can you please explain a little about session ttaad4150m000?<br />
It itÂ’s not working on our production server so I wonder if you think it can have something to do with it?<br />
In our test server this session works and also my script.</div></div><hr />

What I do recall from using this method is that we broke it with updates 2(or 3) times.  I know one time we installed a new portingset and this caused my program to fail.  I also know we installed a tools patch that broke it.  The only thing I can really recommend is for you to call the support center.</div></div><hr />
