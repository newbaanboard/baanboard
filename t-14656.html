<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">1st March 2004, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">There have been some exciting new developments in the wonderfull world of archiving recently :-)   ..... ok, ok, there is nothing exciting about archiving but Baan finally released archive sessions for sales orders, sales order history, purchase orders and purchase order history - something most customers have been asking for since quite a while. So far there are Baan 4 versions. <br />
<br />
Not quite so new, but Baan released a session for archiving lots,  which is important if lot tracking information needs to be kept. <br />
<br />
Check Baan solutions 164474, 164461 and 164208 for details and updates.<br />
<br />
Thought I'd pass that along.<br />

<br />
archiving salesoders and history..  I can't believe it!<br />
Does it really work??? Did you test the solutions already?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the hint.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">1st March 2004, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, amazing, isn't it ..... :-)<br />
<br />
No, I didn't test them yet. They are brand new. I'm currently busy with archiving in Baan 5 but I hope I'll get to it soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so far there is only a Baan IVc version. I'm hopeful though that other versions will follow. <br />
<br />
I got a lot of solutions for Baan 5 and Baan 4 late last year - things I had been writing calls for on behalf of clients since several years:<br />
<br />
- All archive sessions now have a button &quot;Archive General Data&quot;, <br />
- There is a new session that archives the project records (tipcs020) when all references to a project have been archived (important if you want to re-use project numbers)<br />
- All archive sessions now have a date field, including &quot;Archive Production Orders&quot; and &quot;Archive Projects&quot;<br />
<br />
Things have definitely become better.<br />

<br />
We had to customize our sessions to include the date field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">5th July 2004, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been testing the session tdsls4227m000 and tdpur4227m000. There are problems with them. We are getting 605 errors. After logging a case with Baan tehy discovered a problem that would cause the 605 error and is fixing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">5th July 2004, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, there was also a problem archiving a subcontracting purchase order which belongs to a production order, which in turn belongs to a project. Don't know if that's already fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">6th July 2004, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Karen,<br />
<br />
The problem you are referring to is not solved yet. Currently a solution is under construction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">6th July 2004, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh good! I read through the script and saw that that case wasn't covered but didn't write a call since I currently have no client with project subcontracting who is using the new session.<br />
<br />
Thanks for passing that along Kees,<br />
Karin</div></div><hr />

Re: the 605 error we got while testing tdsls4227m000 and it'as pur counterpart is being addressed in solution 165951 which was delivered to us yesterday.</div></div><hr />
