<br />
Can anyone tell me why sometimes functions stpapi.find and stpapi.change.view have to be repeated twice or more to find the chosen record?<br />
<br />
It depends apparently on the system: On my NT server it works fine, and on another NT server I had to loop on those functions.<br />
<br />
The solution 125086 Multilevel was pathed on both systems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

stpapi.find() mimics find action while stpapi.change.view() mimics new.group action. If find doesn't work in the session, and it doesn't work in quite a few session, then stpapi.find() won't work there. In such sessions, to be able to find record correctly, you may have to issue stpapi.change.view() if you're on form type 3 then do recurring stpapi.browse.set() until you get to the correct record<br />
<br />
I only know one session where stpapi.change.view() doesn't &quot;change the view&quot; and that is in whinh3520m000 Receipts. In normal usage, when you do new.group in this session, BaanERP goes to a long routine to assign new receipt number, instead of blanking the view field for us to fill in. So, in normal operation, new.group doesn't &quot;change the view&quot;. That's why when you issue stpapi.change.view() to whinh3520m000, you wouldn't &quot;change the view&quot; but rather assign new receipt number<br />

I have faced with a similar situation. <br />
In one of the session, find doesnt work manually. So naturally when we execute the session using AFS, it always returns a failure, even though the record is present. <br />
<br />
so what I did was, that changed the default starting index of the session.<br />
I had two indexes for that session. I changed into the other one. <br />
<br />
now, find was working manually and it worked in AFS also. <br />
This solved the problem for me. This might help<br />

change it to 8 or 6<br />
that usually works for me.</div></div><hr />
