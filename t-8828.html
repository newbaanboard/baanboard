<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fahqueue</div><div class="date">11th February 2003, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to automate the restarting of the license service on Windows 2000 server.  I am running BaaN Vc on Windows 2000 Adv Server.  I don't really want to use a program like closeidle.  I have heard that some people have designed a way for the license service to be restart at preset intervals.  Thanks in advance for any input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">12th February 2003, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I read in portingset update notes (7.1d for iBaanERP5.x) that licmon did get an option -C to clear all not pending (so &quot;hanging&quot;) licenses. In that case you won't need to restart the services, you can schedule (with at or another scheduler) to issue a licmon -C command each hour or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's generally not a good idea (I'm still trying to convince everyone here not to do it anymore)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ranias</div><div class="date">18th April 2004, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">that option of licmon6.x -k will also disconnect all the users currently working in the system which will cause a big problem.<br />
I have also faced a problem of bshell6.2 process in BaanERP 5.0b which has been &quot;hangged&quot; in the server licenses and they also reserve a license and actually block the number of licenses.<br />
<br />
How can I release the bshell process which has been disconnected from the Baan server but still use a license in the license daemon.<br />
<br />
BTW: Licmon6.2 -C : clear brandinfo from shared memory<br />
This in portingset  7.1c.03<br />
What does it do in 7.1d portingset ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

   -c       : cleanup orphaned local licences<br />
<br />
It might have come out for ERP in 7.1c.04..<br />

However I noticed that on our system it doesn't work for 100%, sometimes another user has the same PID in use so that will not free the license.<br />
<br />
Other licenses are not freed at all. However it gives some licenses free.<br />
<br />
I know that resetting the license daemon gives problems, so I can only advice you not to do it during production hours. <br />
