<br />
I'm new to this baan career field, appreciate if u guys can help me. <br />
I got problem with the date while executing CR with date data from ERPLN database. Example: I run report to display data on date 03/09/2012. The result date displayed as 03/09/2012 but the data is actually for 04/09/2012. It looks like the date jump for 1 day. The report captured the date as per user input but when it comes to the data it showed data for the next day.<br />
Would like to know why it happen? Is CR and erpln does'nt share the same date pattern? How to solve this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
if I am right you are connecting CR directly to the database tables. Baan software runs in an international context. A user in USA can be seeing an working on the same sales order in USA at the same time as a colleague in China. They must both see a date such as planned delivery date in their own local time! <br />
<br />
To solve this problem the date saved in Database is therefore in GMT this is converted to the date and time of a user according to his or her Time Zone setting. If you connect CR directly to the Baan database you allways see the GMT date and time which is 8 hours behind Malaysian local time. So a sales order date captured at 7 am on 04/02/2012 Kuala Lumpur time is saved in database as 11 pm on 03/02/2012 GMT! Strange but true!!<br />
<br />
Crystal does have functions for adding times to dates like dateadd() (http://crystaltricks.com/wordpress/?p=153) which you can use to show the local time on your reports.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I'm connecting the CR directly to the baan database tables. I've tried out the solution given and it was success! :) I've tried o set the date formula as DateAdd (&quot;d&quot;, 1, {ttisfc012888.t_prdt}) in my report and the report result date is now correct. Thanks for the solution ya! Appreciate it much! :D<br />
<br />
However, can we set our database server to our local time? I mean is to equalize the date between CR and baan, is it possible? If this is possible, so no need to convert the date using the formula functions anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am glad that I could help!<br />
<br />
Maybe it would be better if you add 8 hours instead of 1 whole day. Try using: DateAdd(“h”, 8, {ttisfc012888.t_prdt}). This will be always correct regardless of the time part.<br />
<br />
I am sorry but I don't know if one could change the Baan-database Time to local time or if this is recommended. Maybe someone else can help. But remember: Never chage a running system! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Owh..thanks for the input..yes, I'm forgot about the interval type values..&quot;h&quot; is for hours and &quot;d&quot; is for day..should choose &quot;h&quot; since the range date is only 8 hrs and not for the 1 whole day. luckily u're here to help and advice me. Thanks a lot Vahdani! U've help me so much! Have a good day ahead ya! :)</div></div><hr />
