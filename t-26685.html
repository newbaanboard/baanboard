There are several reasons to use AFS.  The first is to automate the process of loading a large number of records.  For example: Maybe your users want to move all items in one warehouse to another.  You can write a function server to run the inventory transaction session for all the records.  No user input and it is just like running the session manually for each part.<br />
<br />
The second reason is to &quot;automate&quot; processes.  For example: You can automate the pick process.  Instead of the users having to run each of the sessions manually you can create one session(asking for the fewest number of fields) to run all the sessions for the user.  This reduces is a time saving measure for the customers.  We have automated - receipts, picking, yielding, BOM Creation, inventory transfers(bin to bins, gains losses), production order completion.  There are other process that I have that use function servers.</div></div><hr />
