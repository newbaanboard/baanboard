Can anyone let me know what are the pros &amp; cons of single logistics set-up compared to multi logistics, when the organization is having locations in different countries? Finally can you please add your comments on whether it is better to have single logistics with an enterprise unit for each country (or) multi logistics (one for each country)?<br />
<br />
Request to respond ASAP.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regds,<br />

Current there are two sites, under two general managers, running independently in one location (ultimately the CEO is one person). We are in hot argument of whether having single logistic or multi logistic. Can someone advise what is the pro &amp; cons of setting up as single logistic or multi logistic? How about cost? Will the cost doubled if we set up as multi logistic? <br />
<br />
Below is the detail:<br />
-	2 sites running different operation, but one site sell parts to another sites<br />
-	users are from two different groups , including finance<br />
-	different P&amp;:L</div></div><hr />

You can go for single logistics company and multi finance company set-up if there is anything common between teh two sites. Like similar set of items (raw materials etc.). If not, I would say multi logistics and multi finance is a better option.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">7th July 2008, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I do frequently get the question if Multi Logistic would be THE solution for various costing problems in Single Log. when using FTP as valuation method. For this purpose I can give a clear no, since multi log. does not help very much when using intercompany invoicing based on internal pricebooks. It maybe a different story when using cost plus method but that is the minority of companies I do know. The big issue is with FTP in single Log. that the WH-Surcharge has to be setup extensively which cannot be handled under &quot;normal&quot; circumstances. Also in sinlge Log. a recalculation of cost price leads to a change in all warehouses of all sites - that often is not wanted. So I guess the best method to use is MAUC which makes it unnecessary (from costing point of view) to have multi log.<br />

It rarely is, but functionality is often the price one pays for diversity.<br />
