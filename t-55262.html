<br />
I would like to solicit your opinion on our Baan server setup as we are currently facing <br />
performance issue especially on Sales Invoicing, Service Invoicing and Generating Projects <br />
from Sales Order. On a bad day a single invoice can take up to 3 minutes to print. We have <br />
around 250 users. Baan 4C4 SP20 app and database (SQL Server 2000 Enterprise SP4) is in the same Server. We have <br />
windows 2003 Enterprise Edition R2 SP2. We have 24 GB RAM. We have four dual-core Intel Xeon <br />
processors. SAN-connected. We have 125 GB database used. We are also heavy users of SQL <br />
Reporting Services and have job running on Intergratio Package in early morning. We use <br />
Taxware. Our CPU utilization could come up to 96% in the middle of the day. We do experience <br />
better speed in the morning and late afternoons when there are less users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">7th March 2009, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">As the complaint is more about  print sessions than process sessions like  tdsls4223 , tfgld4200s000 tfgld1212s000 etc , I assume  u have database properly tuned , update statistics  run periodically . <br />
<br />
Directions u can look for  can be <br />
<br />
1. U did not specify network usage . Is speed of NIC , switch , cabling etc any  bottleneck . Normally  gigaport switch  and nic , cat 6 cabling will not have network bottleneck.<br />
<br />
2. Printing normally  has to deal with writing in tmp . If tmp  is not  cleared for  quite some time , then printing / login etc can be slow .<br />
<br />
3. As u use reporting service , u may not  be using baan reporting substantially . Still check if u have lot of disk based data transformations used in Baan reporting and Baan proceses for summarizing / compressing data and such reports / programs run regularly daily .If yes , then u can speed up the system by using memory based algorithms in such reports / programs.<br />
<br />
4. What is  the number of records in invoicing related tables like tdsls040/1/5/50/1 , tsssma tables and number of customers  u talk about . Is there possibility to archieve such sales data to archieve company . That will definitely  improve the performance of invoice printing.<br />
<br />
5. Do  u have large number of companies . If yes , do u share tables  for modules which arenot used e.g. we did not used tp  , tr modules . We shared  all such tables  . So  in our case , for each new company the number of tables created at db level were only 500  as against 2500 . DB  catalogue size  greatly reduces with table sharing (of course without compromising functionality ) .<br />
<br />
6.What is the make up ntbshell , mslsqldriver and reporting services in overall  server load . mssql and reporting services are resource intensive and not releasing the resources when needed . Is it possible to reduce the allocations of memory / cpu resourses so that more resources are available to ntbshell.<br />
<br />
7. Run TSQLs to get most time consuming  SQL in runtime in enterprise manage at the time of peak loads.<br />
<br />
8. Use baan traces  to get driver related  traces .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">25th March 2009, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hitesh mentioned a lot of things. Maybe I can add some more:<br />
<br />
- Check your IO. As you do a lot of reporting stuff, this could put a heavy load on your disks.<br />
<br />
- I would normally start with a Call Graph Profile. It shows you where your time is spend: CPU, queries or other things. <br />
<br />
- I also recommend to make a system wide trace with e.g. perfmon. It can tell you the most consuming processes.<br />
<br />
- Last but not least I recommend to check the database. Your report services can ruin your cache. This definitely helps to slow down normal users.<br />
<br />
hope this helps,<br />

<br />
Just to add up to the above points ..<br />
<br />
Assuming the OS is 32 bit - the DB shall consume only 4 GB limit even though you have 24 GB , You might need to increase System global area size (check with SQL DB) .<br />
<br />
hence moving DB (DB only) into seperate server (64 bit OS) and increasing the SGA / pool size etc...might work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th April 2009, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's possible to use more memory with some pab boot switch in win2k3 enterprise edition. In 64bit there is no need for such boot switch to enable more memory utilization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">13th April 2009, 06:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Please be informed , PAE can be used in boot switch - (Physical address ext)  for 4GB above support.<br />
<br />
But it is only for WINDOWS OS not for Database i.e even if you use PAE - you will not be able to configure your Db for above 4 GB.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">13th April 2009, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Since your DB is SQLSERVER from Microsoft - you could try AWE in conjunction with PAE.<br />

Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">13th April 2009, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Right . SQL can have more memory  available with PAE &amp; AWE . One more link for the same  http://www.modhul.com/2007/11/10/optimising-system-memory-for-sql-server-part-i/ besides authentic one from MS .</div></div><hr />
