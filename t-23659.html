<br />
When I was working at SSA Global / Baan, I have used the session for various customers while doing Archiving Workshop for them and it ran successfully without any problem.<br />
<br />
PS: The session was stable when I left Baan in Dec 2004. I was the developer of the session, so there might little prejudice towards it :-). Still I was happy with what I developed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have ran this session on a couple of occasions. If possible I would advise you to try and run ranges of Purchase Orders as opposed to an open range.<br />
<br />
If ran on an open range on our system the session can take several days to complete.<br />

If you plan to archive in Baan 5, then you should open a call for it with Baan support. So far I got all archive improvements that already existed in Baan 4 transferred to Baan 5 by Baan support when I contacted them. <br />

Session is tdpur5201m000 (Archive and/or Delete Purchase Order History).<br />
For sales:tdsls5201m000 (Archive and/or Delete Sales Order History).<br />
It is also written by Suresh Manoharan :) , solution 165604.<br />
The archiving functionality is available in SSA ERP LN 6.1 SP1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">That would only be for the sales and purchase order history tables. Anything new for the sales and purchase orders? (Which is the more important data for most companies)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Karin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">20th April 2005, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed only history is archived.<br />
Orders itself are not archived.<br />
May be Suresh Manoharan can tell the reason?<br />
By the way: why are the orders more important than the history as history contains the same data as the orders?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">20th April 2005, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Evert-Jan:<br />
<br />
it's correct that all standard Baan info on orders can be found in the history but it's quite inconvenient to search for it.<br />
<br />
The purchase and sales history are tables in which every change to a sales or purchase order is logged. Each time a user makes a change in an order and saves it, there is at least one entry into the history. Those changes might just have been typos that were corrected. Yes, it's possible to find the information about what was on the final order, when was it delivered at what price etc. but it's quite cumbersome. <br />
<br />
In some cases the only way to find certain information in the history is by looking into GTM or writing a query because the existing display sessions don't offer the necessary options. Another problem I came across is that the history tables don't have the right indices to make searching for certain information feasible.<br />
<br />
Information that customer service departments usually need about an old order can be found far more convenient in the &quot;main&quot; order tables itself by using the sessions the user is used to.  There are far more display sessions and print sessions available to access the order and delivery information. In many cases companies have added their own display sessions to display order information in exactly the way they need it. These sessions can also be used in the archive company if the data is archived. <br />
<br />
Often companies have also added additional fields to the purchase and sales order tables that contain important information about the orders. These fields are usually not added and updated in the history tables.  <br />
<br />
In fact, many companies never use the history. If it's used, it's mostly used only to trace unusual changes that were made to an order. It might still be necessary to archive the history though, e.g. to keep information on deleted orders.<br />
<br />
Hope I gave you enough reasons to initiate the development of an archive session for purchase and sales in Baan 5  :) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">20th April 2005, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">P.S.: There have been many problems in the past, where the history wasn't updated correctly. Those problems have often gone unnoticed because users usually don't work with the history that often. That's another reason not to discard the sales and purchase orders and rely only on the history for historic record keeping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">21st April 2005, 09:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your answer! I'm not initiating development of functionality. Customers who need such functionality are doing that, nowadays :)<br />
<br />
And I hope Suresh Manoharan can explain the reasons for archiving orders in Baan IV and archiving history in Baan V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">21st April 2005, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">:) I had hoped you might have some influence there. <br />
<br />
BTW: In Baan IV both can be archived, sales and purchase order history (tdsls5202m000 and tdpur5202m000) and sales and purchase orders (tdsls4227m000 and tdpur4227m000).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">22nd April 2005, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting.<br />
I did not realize myself that in Baan IV both can be archived.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nambu13</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">By archive what exactly you want to achieve?<br />
Remove the processed PO/SO from the transaction table? that can be done with the session 4223m000 (from top of my head - no access to Baan for the last 2 years).<br />
A project for archival and retension of orders was initiated earlier (1999), but couldn't execute it due to change of priorties. This included the analysis of the archived data and DW. Later BIS came up with this.<br />
regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Archiving means that historical data is stored in an archive company before it is deleted from the production company (tdsls4223m000 just deletes). <br />
<br />
Baan has added the necessary sessions for archiving sales and purchase orders to Baan 4 last year but hasn't gotten around to doing the same for Baan 5 yet.  As I said before though: so far I made good experiences when I asked Baan support to have an archive solution that already existed in Baan 4 transferred to Baan 5. <br />
<br />
I currently don't have a new Baan 5 archive project coming up and for the Baan 5 projects that I did in the past I've developed the necessary archive sessions myself. If anyone plans to start archiving in 5 soon though, then I would suggest they send a request to Baan support. It might be as simple as that.<br />

I like that, because we had problems with users deleting records before, now we just don't allow them in the archive session.  simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toletofhitachi</div><div class="date">15th November 2007, 11:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone has the writeup on the tdpur4227m000 session? Example, what are the tables involved and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">23rd September 2009, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question about the session tdpur5202m000 Archive and/or Delete Purchase Order History.  I ran this session, in hopes of helping a PO issue we were having with 1 po.  I ran it for just that PO.  I noticed it was archiving a bunch of master data tables.  Fine - I understand it needs to have the Master Data in the Archive company.  <br />
<br />
After this ran there were two very strange issues that popped up and this session is the only thing I can think that caused it, but I don't know why.<br />
<br />
In the Maintain Order types session (tcmcs0142m000)  the transaction type for all order types are now blank.  Our Main warehouse lost it's Default receipt and inspection receipt locations.  Now I just got an email about a control account not found for a supplier when a user is trying to maintain purchase invoices???  This is static data and I'm confused as to what happened?  Does anyone have any idea about this??<br />
<br />
your thoughts are greatly appreciated!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The session tdpur4223m000 just deletes the data without doing archiving. Whereas session tdpur4227m000 does both. The tables involved would be the same as in tdpur4223m000 except the difference being that the data is moving to the archive company and then getting deleted. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
