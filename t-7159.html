<br />
were are running Crystal Reports in combination with Crystal Info (for scheduling) since almost 4 years now.<br />
In recent times we faced some trouble with the Seagate Info Server. The whole thing seems to turn into an unstable state. Reports suddenly failed, the execution of more than 1 report at a time is no longer possible. The only error message we get is &quot;not enough memory availble&quot; - but looking on the memory usage of the box (Win NT 4.0) everything seems to be ok.<br />
<br />
Anybody expereinced a similar problem?<br />
<br />
Does anybody use 'Crystal Enterprise' for scheduling and webreporting?<br />

In our case we have a lot of reports that connect through the BDN ole db provider (toptier reportserver). This reportserver is running on the same NT box so I'm not sure if the problem is coming from the reportserver (connection) or the info desktop.<br />
<br />
PS: We are planning to migrate from info desktop 7 to crystal enterprise. No detail plan yet or no testings so far.</div></div><hr />

Just to let you know that it occurs in that version as well.<br />

In practice it's rather difficult for us to find good and reliable support for Crystal products.<br />

<br />
We have also interfaced Crystal Enterprises with Baan and getting the o/p thru crystal device in baan. After getting the o/p , if we try to refresh the data, it asks for some login and password. We tried all the combinations of logins and passwords, but it does't accept that. We are very new for this, can anyone help us to go further and rectify this problem ? Even, if we try to schedule the report, it says SQL database not found. <br />
<br />
thanx in advance.<br />

Too many files in these directories will register as memory errors because they're to saturated. I keep mine cleaned out regularly and don't have these problems. The Windows/temp directory is especially bad when full when running other apps like Word or Excel. These apps complain about low memory when space gets tight there.<br />

<br />
Is anyone accessing BaaN V with Crsytal report? I have tried but I am getting the message:<br />
<br />
&quot;unable to to logon to the Server, The Server environment or user/password combination may be invalid.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have no problem in connecting to BaaN IV with Crystal. I also have no problem in connecting to the native BaaN V. Do I need extra crystal drivers or am I missing something? If anyone has the new drivers for BaaN V, can you please send them to me. Thanks.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">29th October 2002, 00:49</div></div><div class="posttext">The question is: What version of the Baan driver do you have? If it is the free one, then you can forget trying to access Baan V. If you want the supported ones that can access Baan IV or V, then you need to talk to Crystal or Baan because they can only be bought and are licensed.<br />

We just bought crystal and had to dowload te drivers from the net.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">29th October 2002, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">In 1999 Crystal introduced their Baan driver in beta release and it was free to download and use. It is still in circulation, but is not available from Crystal since they introduced the production version in 2000. The production version is fully supported where the beta version is not. The production version is only available from Baan or Crystal, and is only licensed for use with Seagate Info or Crystal Enterprise.  You will not get any support if you use the beta version and have problems with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the crystal device uses a kind of 'push' mechanism. So if you want to refresh the report, the proper way is to do that from within Baan (by printing the report again). You can use a Baan job to automate things.<br />
