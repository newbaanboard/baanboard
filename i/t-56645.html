Can you show the data in session tdsls4110m000 and cisls2545m000? Somewhere there should be a mismatch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">neha_K</div><div class="date">4th September 2009, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">hey i have attached the screenshoits for your review.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">4th September 2009, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">When comparing it to a similar situation at our system I see some differences.<br />
In the session cisli2545m000 I have 2 lines one for the advance and one for the normal installment. The type (on the Invoice Related tab) is advance and installment. The line number is 0 and the sequence is equal to the sequence from the installment data.<br />
<br />
So I assume you face a bug already at moment of populating the session cisli2545m000. So this is something to report at Support.<br />

Installment is not used in FP2 India Localization. It can be used with the standard version.<br />
