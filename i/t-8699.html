<br />
I need a sugesstion from u Finance Gurus. Basically i am a Tools guy ( Technical ), but i have a interest in Finance, and in later stage i would like to shift to more of a techno functional in Finance area, but the problem which i am having is that i don't know finance, only having an interst in the subject is not suficient.<br />
<br />
Even my basic terms about Finance is not clear. like what is Trial balance, or what is ledger, and somtimes it really creates problem when  i do coding also. How can i learn BaaN Finance , should i post my small small doubts in the group or is there any other web site which teaches u the basics of Finance. ????<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
if you are from India, Pl read Financial Accounting book (by Kotibhaskar) for Std XI.. it will definately help you in better understandings of financial terms.<br />

<br />
I don't think you should ask this group for all kind of general finance issues (not-Baan related). But I have some<br />
finance colleague's in India who might be able to help you.<br />
You may also ask me some general questions.<br />
Mail me on jo.hietkamp@worldonline.nl and see if we can <br />
find and solution for this.<br />
<br />

Otto</div></div><hr />
