<br />
We have some jobs scheduled.<br />
<br />
I wanted to skip some of the jobs on saturdays and some on fridays.<br />
<br />
Which is the best possible way to achieve this?<br />
<br />
Normally what we do is manually cancel the jobs on prior day and schedule it manually to the next execution date.<br />
<br />
I am looking for something to automate this, i am not sure on calenders? Can you assist on this please?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />

There is a job scheduler that will run from crontab;<br />
<br />
crontab entry would call<br />
rc.startjob JOB_NAME</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your inputs.<br />
But, I am looking for setting up a job which executes for the whole week except of Saturday of every week.<br />
<br />
So if i am using calender i have to manually add the dates of each and every week and after every month i have to change this. So is there any other way around?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<br />
You can use the option Searocket mentioned earlier: in stead of using the Baan jobdaemon you can start the job from the unix crontab. In the crontab you can exclude specific weekdays from your schedule...<br />

All I did was create copies of the job for each day of the week that I wanted it to run - eg Monday job, Tuesday job etc.  Then each of these jobs are run weekly</div></div><hr />

As pointed out  by  others there are many options and one such option if u have ur program is customized , is to  check the weekdayno using this function and if it's  saturday skip  the session using choice.again in before.choice fof  run.job or cont.process . Optionally u can set job.process.error to true and give a message that job skipped  due to saturday and all that will be recorded in job history .  U can also use 'skip on error'  value in that case to skip all subsequent session in that job which may be standard session also.</div></div><hr />

Just set up 5 jobs with the same sessions (one each for Monday through Friday).  Set each job to be Weekly on the appropriate day of the week.  That's all there is to it.  You never have to edit anything.</div></div><hr />
