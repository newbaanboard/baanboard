However you need to test it first, that will take most of the time!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RamSundar</div><div class="date">28th March 2002, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, i don't think there are major functional differences between these two versions within BaaN 4, which makes the migration job easier.  Ofcourse, still you have to deal with the customizations...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">is there a quick way to apply all service packs after installing c4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">10th April 2002, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">There is never a quick options when it comes to service packs and they should never be rushed! They will take as long as your server takes to install and every step should be tested before installation of the next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">10th April 2002, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">In migration, if the customizations are virtually zero, it takes hardly 1-2 weeks for the Tools person to migrate the application and also data. But testing by the functional people and correcting the problems takes time.<br />
<br />
Between Baan 4c3 and Baan 4c4, the only enhancements I can think of is introduction of PMC and some Currency enhancements.<br />
<br />
I have heard of sites migrating successfully in 2 months(minimum customizations, in India) and also ones that migrate within baan4 versions in 8 months(one of the biggest in France)(they have lots of interfaces)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">10th April 2002, 11:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats right, there is very little changes in the actual body of 4c4. PMC is major change in tools and a few currency changes in finance for the euro. <br />
<br />
However, seening that the service packs actually fix some several thousand defects (and also i currently upto service pack 10, I think 11 is either with us or soon), then without the service packs installed, BGS is not going to be too keen to help out with any issues you may have during upgrade until you get to a level they approve of (normally service pack 6/7 depending on problem)<br />
<br />
As with any major upgrade, a service pack should be considered as almost a new installation every time considering the amout of changes to the system there are on installation. In service pack 5 alone there is major changes to finance, enough to almost call it a re-write.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">10th April 2002, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">If someone wants to consider migration within baan4 version, this document may be helpful!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">10th April 2002, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard that BaaN recomends the customers to install the latest service pack within 6 months of its release. If anything less, they simply instruct the site to upgrade, before taking up major support problem. <br />
<br />
Yes. Some Service packs are really huge and contain more solutions than others. Taking into consideration, the localization service packs apart from stnd, it is really long time.<br />
<br />
I also observe that generally in UNIX boxes, Service Pack installations takes longer. One reason could be that the dump be coiped from a NT CDROM drive to the UNIX box before starting installation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">10th April 2002, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point about the localisations too. This can add an ENORMOUS amount of time to the installation of a service pack. Another reason why every install should be tested before the next, even sometimes to the point of setting up a team of testers just to sit there and make sure every report, customisation and update is tested.<br />
<br />
So comes back to the point of not rushing ANY major change to your system.<br />
<br />
And thats before we get to the small matter of the service pack bugs in number 6 ;) (ask anyone who runs NT and MSSQL 7)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has anyone got docs from baan on differences between these versions?<br />
<br />
It would help understanding the fuctional difference on change.<br />
<br />
thanks,Thomas</div></div><hr />

We opened a case with Baan to get the functional differences between c3-c4, and were told the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have the difference document between IVcx to IVc4. &quot;<br />
<br />
This is frustrating for those who want to train their users.    It's true there has been nothing major, but there has been a ton of minor corrections and enhancements.    I guess they will never be documented.  Each service pack release has a listing of the patches included.   We tried to make sense of that and create a differences doc, but without much luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have listed anything as notes would help us in the right direction. I have done the upgrade(test system) and business is still worried about testing. I need little more information to convince them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information.<br />
