<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">9th March 2003, 00:05</div></div><div class="posttext">If salesmen knew this forum exists, it may even help more... It is a good thing to know that you are not on your own if you have doubts before / in and after a new implementation. There are lots of people willing to give you a first, second or third opinion here.<br />
<br />
I wonder why Baan does not sponsor this board...</div></div><hr />

I agree this forum is a great way to show that there is a lot of Baan knowledge and that Baan is a great product.</div></div><hr />

I think the best way, Baan could sponsor this board would be to supply all kinds of technical information to be published here.<br />
And that is already ongoing, as I see it.<br />
<br />
So far I pointed every sysadm at the customers, I visited,  in the baanboard direction.<br />
<br />
This way we can all sponsor a click or two.<br />
<br />
