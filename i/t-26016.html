I have a need to set an input condition for a financial transaction type on a form field.  Due to new financial laws we must segregate user access.  It gets weird.  Long story short:  Our finance department must segregate who is able to enter certain types of financial transactions.  We can't address all the nuances by limiting session authorizations because of Baan functional design.  Therefore, I wanted to try to set up an input condition on a session Form that would limit what kind of transactions can be entered by the type of financial activity.  (ie, AP, AR, GL, Cash)  Has anyone had experience with setting an input condition on a form field?  If so, please Help!<br />
Thanks,<br />

In the input section of the field of your table create something like this:<br />

I am hoping to avoid changing the underlying code in the session.  The session is pervasive to all manner of transaction entry in Finance.  I had hoped to 'customize' by making a copy of the maintain transactions 'tfgld1101m000' for each part of finance duties.  One for GL, AP, AR, AP cash, and AR cash.  Then I wanted to modify the form1 ONLY by setting an input condition for only those transactions for each financial duty.  I hope this makes sense!  <br />
When I am in the Baan form editor, I can click on the transaction type field.  'ttyp'.  There are several options for the field.  I was hoping to be able to use the 'input/reference expression'  to set up a logic to only allow certain transactions for entry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">5th January 2006, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You could set an default in the field ttyp. And after this set it to display only so nobody can change the value.<br />
If you assign (with personalized menues) your special sessions only to the people how have access to this transaction types, it should work.<br />
<br />
It could be a way<br />

Make ttyp an autozoom field to zoom to a session written by you to display only the tran type as per user login  and their domain . Also make the zoom autoaccept , so user may not be able to edit the field himself/herself .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of setting an input condition on a form field, you can do it through session ttaad4134m000. To set Transaction Types by userwise to be used in the session tfgld1101m000, in the session ttaad4134m000 insert User code, tfgld101 table,Table Authz as D/I/M/R, Data Authz as Not Authz.<br />
<br />
Select ttyp field, Operator as Not Equal and in the Value1 field enter the trans.type to be allowed to that particular user. Select End of Operation in the field And/Or/End and do CRDD.<br />
<br />
Remember after these settings user can be able to select trans.types which are not authz for him but he can't save the record.<br />
<br />
Hope it will HELP to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For ex in the session tdilc4201m000 the values of order type field must be selected by userwise my means only 2 users can select value 'Service Order' and remaining users can select any values of Order Type except 'Service Order'<br />
<br />
Please reply<br />

My reqd is little bit similar to BB, in the form inputs of a print session can we set the enumerated field values by userwise ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">9th January 2006, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">As aforesaid , write a customized autozoom session and based on the logins set pre-def variable attr.enum.mask$ = chr$(1)  chr$(2) ... etc depending on ur enum requirement , set attr.input = 0 (if required e.g. user has only 1 valid option ), export the same in customized session and finally close the program with end() . All these are to be written in the before.program section of ur  customized session ,<br />
<br />
It will get u the desired  result.<br />
<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
       |do algo to get the valid options <br />
       attr.enum.mask$ = chr$(1) &amp; chr$(2) | Sale/production<br />
       export(&quot;attr.enuim.mask$&quot;,attr.enum.mask$)<br />
       end()<br />
<br />
<br />
Beware u will still not be able  to stop users who run the program globally skipping the manual input on this field . <br />
<br />
U can also set the user defaults for each users .<br />
<br />
So good solution could be to write an AFS session to run these sessions itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No idea how attr.enum.mask$ command works. Can u post the syntax and HELP of this command please ?<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">10th January 2006, 10:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I have already written an example statement in my earlier post. That's the syntax . Valid  enum options ascii values have to be assigned to this variable .<br />
<br />
For help u can check the help in pre-defined variables listing attr.enum.mask$  and help for set.enum.values() . Normally this is set in before.input section of an enum field or  before ask.enum function .</div></div><hr />
