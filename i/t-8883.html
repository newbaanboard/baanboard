Now, Winning from a Country like Nambia is a great Pride for Indian Cricket team, its a achivement.</div></div><hr />

And, a request. Let us not criticize any team, as it may not go well with other members. Let us remember that postings on World Cup is only an add on and our main focus is to learn and thrive on Baan.<br />

Still, if one posts bad about one's own country, I donno what to say... Just remember that everyone represents his own country to the world, in general !!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 11:14</div></div><div class="posttext">An analysis on how India can rach final..<br />
 <br />
As the countdown begins for the world cup final  its only 11 matches away  an India-Australia showdown, going by form and fixtures, seems more than wishful thinking. <br />
<br />
Australia go into the Super Six stage with the most points (12), followed by Kenya (10), India on 8, Sri Lanka 7.5, New Zealand 4 and Zimbabwe 3.5. <br />
<br />
<br />
On form, Australia are expected to win all their three matches  against Kenya, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. If any of these teams can upset the rampaging Aussies, it is New Zealand. Simply because they have done it often enough, especially in the recent past. In any case, Australia should finish far ahead of the rest. <br />
<br />
The only match Kenya could be favoured to win is against Zimbabwe. So they will end the Super Sixes at 10 or 14 points. <br />
<br />
Assuming India beat Kenya and either the Kiwis or Lankans, they end at 16. That will be higher than what Zimbabwe will end with, even if they win all their matches. And also higher than what Kenya, Sri Lanka or New Zealand will end with, assuming India beats one of the Lankans and the Kiwis, and Australia beats one or both of them. <br />
<br />
In that eventuality, on form, Australia will top the list, followed by India, and then by either Kenya or one of New Zealand and Sri Lanka. So the most likely semifinalists will be Australia, India, and two from among Sri Lanka, Kenya and New Zealand. In case of a tie between these teams, however, Kenya would go through, having beaten the other two in the group phase (as happened with Australia and South Africa in the 1999 semi-final). Then it would be a head-to-head between New Zealand and Sri Lanka, and the latter would be in on the same grounds. The semi-final line-up pits the top team (likely Australia) against the fourth and the second (probably India) against the third (possibly Kenya). Whod then bet against an India-Australia final? The bookies favour Australia to win the tournament (8/15 on) while India are 7/2 second-favourites. And no, you cant get odds on Duckworth and Lewis.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Cricket is a very unpredictable game, and no one can really predict the winner. But, the way Aussies have performed so far in the tournament, they deserve to be the champs. Look at the way they perform in every match, even when players like Warne, Jason and Symonds are out of the team. Take out top three players from any team, and they are gone, unlike Australians.</div></div><hr />

Now, they are out, but I don't think Lankans ever deserved to be in the finals, looking the way they played. Except for a couple of players, they never clicked!!<br />
Going by the performance, the final should be between Aussies and the Indians. But, lets see what happens in today's semi-final!!<br />
And, hey Gaurav, now what are your views about the Indians after the initial hiccups!!?:)</div></div><hr />

The law of averages might just catch up with the Aussies, and like India broke Aussies run of consecutive wins (16) in Tests, this time again, in ODIs (16), they might break this run too!!</div></div><hr />

Ganguly is not going to make more than 10.<br />
Rahul Dravid is already injured.<br />
Veru, is not in form at all<br />
Now the batting is dependent on kaif, Yuvraj and mongia, but none are going to really succeed on sunday.<br />
<br />
Thus the writing is on the board, India is not going to make more than 175 runs.<br />
Now do we really have the bowlers to defend this kind of total...<br />

Tendulkar got out on 4<br />
Ganguly on 24<br />
Veru played well and threw my other calculation out.<br />

Anyway, i guess we should all be proud of our Team coz they got us into the Finals, a place no one thought was possible for Indian Team.<br />

We lost to a Good Team on a Day when things were not on our side, though we have the team to beat Australia.<br />

<br />
The Indian team was the only one I thought had a good chance of beating Australia.  Australia hasn't been able to beat them in India for years (tests).<br />
<br />
Whilst Australia has been going really well in tests in recent years I hasn't necessarily done so well in 1 days.   <br />
<br />
I thought the selectors took a risk in picking the team then losing Wayne was a big loss. However, they certainly performed well.<br />
