Dear Friends,<br />
                 <br />
                Can anybody guide me how to implement &quot;KANBAN SYSTEM&quot; , in BaaN ? Basically , I want my SCH MRP PUR SCHEDULES , generated on any given day , should have Times , printed on it ( Split the day's quantity into smaller lots ) &amp; the same information should be printed in the Bar Codes of the Vendors ! ( Only a + OR - 2 Hrs interval should be allowed , at our gate , while scanning their Invoices at our Gate &amp; allow the material in , accordingly ) .<br />
                   Somebody , suggested that , it's controlled through the path : MFG / Shop Floor Control / Production Order Control / Misc. / Maintain Pull Notes , in BaaN. ( I've no idea / knowledge about these Pull Notes ) . Is it correct Path ? I thought , it should rather be controlled through Planning module ( MPS / MRP ) .<br />
<br />
Thanks , in Advance ,<br />

When you want to start with a 2-bin system there're other ways.<br />
Could you share your specific needs perhaps so we could help you any further?</div></div><hr />

Dear Mr.Hutje33 ,<br />
                       <br />
                      We r a Joint Venture company , mfg.&amp; supplying automobile seat sets to M/s Maruti Suzuki Ltd .We r maintaing a 4 hours Inventory at their premises+ a one day stock Inventory at our end . They supply Hourly E-Nagare's , one day in advance , to us . This is meant for keeping Inventories Low .<br />
       During , Pre-assessment Audit of TPM , one of the Japanese Auditors    ( From JIPM ) , has suggested to us that , we also follow a similar system with our vendors , to rationalise the B.O.P. Inventories.<br />
       Since , BaaN-IV ERP , is installed in our company for the last 5 Years , I'm looking for a solution in ERP , to implement this type of KANBAN SYSTEM &amp; issue hourly Supply Pur Schedules to our Vendors . ( At Present , we r generating SCH MRP PUR SCHEDULES to our vendors , but they r total for the day &amp; no further split-up , into hourly Schedules ) . Can anybody , who's implemented , such a KANBAN SYSTEM ,in their company ( Esp. in India , in BaaN Environment ) , help me out ?<br />
<br />
Regards ,<br />

Dear Mr.Hutje33 ,<br />
                      <br />
                      I've posted this querry to M/s SSA GLOBAL , at HYDERABAD , INDIA &amp; I got a reply from them . Their consultant has advised me to define Timing of deliveries , in the&quot; Maintain Del. Profile &quot;sub session , in the session &quot; Maintain SCH PUR Contract ( ( Form:9 , Auto Del Sch generation field set to &quot;Yes&quot; &amp; going into Special ). He says then only BaaN recognises/uses this data to make this functionality working .<br />
                      I'm going to try it , in our Test Company &amp; see the results .<br />
<br />
                     U R Right . &quot;KANBAN &quot; , is entirely different &amp; only pertains to pulling materials from one Shop-floor to another shop-floor or from one Ware-house to another warehouse<br />
<br />
Than X , anyway for ur reply .<br />
<br />
Regards ,<br />
