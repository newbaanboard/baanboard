<br />
any idea what this is all about? I have noticed that if I give that I am not satisfied on the problem, I immediately get a call from support.<br />
<br />
also some more questions : what does baan do if they close our call by<br />
a) standard functionality : ( even if its not logical)<br />
b) Enhancement request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, not quite sure about current procedures followed by Baan but:<br />
a) Standard functionality: This is the way the current software works (by model restrictions, by design decisions, by theoretic constraints (like MRP etc), by technical posibilities, too many customers would run into problems if it was going to be changed in the way you want it). If you (still) want it the other way, you should not turn to Baan but turn to a customizing partner or do your own customization. There is no way to have it working the way you want it in the standard software.<br />
<br />
b) A bit like a), but they might consider to have it changed in newer versions, good suggestion. A defect (prio 50) is made and transfered to the development department. The problem is not going to be solved in your version, so you do not need to wait for that. Your case is closed.<br />
<br />
A feedback may cause them to review their initial solution (and have the case &quot;reopened&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">by the look of it , it seems that a standard functionality cannot be ever an enhancement.  <br />
<br />
only thing I hope they keep a track of standard functionality problems  because if many customers want it then they can maybe change the design or therotical logic in the same version <br />
<br />
anyone has any idea whether baan tracks this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">22nd August 2003, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello baan5guy - <br />
<br />
Where are you located?  In the US, the BaaN Support website is located at www.support.baan.com<br />
<br />
This is where you can close your case, leave feedback, and access their Knowledge Base, which stores all case data.  You can look at cases related to specific sessions, etc.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
<br />
Regard,<br />
Linda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">22nd August 2003, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Location is immaterial, since there is only one support website! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">25th August 2003, 10:22</div></div><div class="posttext">baan5guy: by the look of it , it seems that a standard functionality cannot be ever an enhancement.A case that was closed as an &quot;Standard functionality&quot; can become an &quot;Enhancement request&quot;, if you disagree with the solution proposed and want to have it changed in newer versions as wellonly thing I hope they keep a track of standard functionality problems because if many customers want it then they can maybe change the design or therotical logic in the same versionRemember that &quot;Standard functionality&quot; usually also means &quot;Customer misunderstanding&quot; the software. That also implies that the support analyst should be able to also tell you how the software works, and if applicable how the desired functionality is implemented in the standard software using another path through the software...anyone has any idea whether baan tracks this?I am not sure, tracking is there also statistical analysis, but I do not think they log defects themselves to clarify helptexts on sessions because of the statistical analyses on cases for a specific session shows that many customers log &quot;Standard functionality&quot; cases against the session. Nor do they change &quot;Standard functionality&quot; because many customers tend to misuse the software ... But again, I have no knowledge of how Baan Development looks at cases and generate feedback from them (except for prio 50 defects).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arthas</div><div class="date">25th August 2003, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't be so naive.<br />
<br />
The support organisation is managed by &quot;metrics&quot; which were introduced by a (VERY) former VP who's favourite quote was &quot;If I can't measure it, I can't manage it&quot;.<br />
<br />
The metrics change from time to time, but they publish the changes internally. To look good you need to know the metrics, not the baan software.<br />
<br />
The job of a support analyst is to close the case, not solve the problem. Many ex-baan guys will be able to quote you case numbers where the closing dialogue is something like:<br />
<br />
&quot;If I don't hear from you in the next two days I will assume that the problem is solved&quot; (Friday, 6 p.m.)<br />
<br />
&quot;As I have had no response to my last comment I have closed your case and put it into status 'soltion accepted'. Thank you for your custom&quot; (Monday, 9.01 a.m.)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - there are some VERY VERY good support analysts in the company, even now. If you've connected with one you'll know what I'm talking about. But there are an inordinate number of &quot;metrics chasers&quot; too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">25th August 2003, 22:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I fully agree with Arthas because I have worked in BAAN Support for two years during the Golden years of BAAN and noticed that everything became so metrics oriented.<br />
The isssue here was that these guys used a &quot;negative&quot; metrics system. They were chasing the &quot;dissatisfaction&quot; rate of customers. The whole idea was to make customers less dissatisfied. Instead of using a more positive approach.<br />
<br />
My biggest issue at that time was that the management in BAAN Support was only focused to shut down customers who were crying the loudest. The louder the screaming the faster a case had to be closed.<br />
When cases came in with a priority 40 (Questions) the green beans had to handle those because the 10s and 20s were for the experienced people.<br />
However, many of those 40s were questions from existing and experienced customers that were now trying to implement a new piece of BAAN. They were insulted by BAAN that these green beans had to handle those kind of issues.<br />
Many customers got very disappointed in BAAN Support.<br />
<br />
Luckily, today the situation seems to be a lot better!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arthas</div><div class="date">25th August 2003, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for backing me up, Edwin, even though we've never met or spoken to each other. You've obviously worked in baan support because of the words you use (me too).<br />
<br />
Would you care to share with the baanboard community *exactly* what a greebean is/was?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">26th August 2003, 00:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure. <br />
A Green Bean is a new employee to the company that is thrown into battle on the first day on the job and has totally no clue what to do or who to go to for help.<br />
<br />
I guess that almost everybody working at BAAN started as a Green Bean. And because it is truely a survival of the fittest we all realized that only job protection and not sharing any info with colleagues and consultants of other firms, was the only way to stay alive in the Jungle of BAAN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">26th August 2003, 04:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately I have not  had a bad support from Baan for quite sometime now. <br />
<br />
Most of the guys I have dealt with are quite good at the product ( functionally if not technically).  I have instances where their bug correctors also discussed issues with me and corrected the problems.<br />
<br />
Yes, agreed sometime back ( say 2 years ago) there was a tendency to &quot;close&quot; calls but I guess now they are focusing on Feedbacks  ( otherwise why do most of the case solutions remind us to give feedbacks??)<br />
<br />
For my cases, these guys usually wait for me to give confirmation, once I confirm only then they close cases. I had dealt with one of their guys from India who told me &quot; dont thnk I am trying to close the case. I am more interested in solving the problem not the case&quot; and wasnt that refreshing?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile ....any of you got the customer survey from baan recently?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arthas</div><div class="date">26th August 2003, 07:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan5guy, you've just bean(SIC) &quot;metric'ed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Way back in the last millenium we used to get bonuses (so long ago now that few of us can remember what one of those things used to look like).<br />
<br />
The biggest sin (and bonus-buster) that a SA could commit was to have a case &quot;re-opened&quot;. That's why they introduced the status &quot;solution proposed&quot; - pulling a SP back into &quot;in process&quot; wasn't a bonus-buster. <br />
<br />
Someone from India or anywhere else saying &quot;I'm not just trying to close the case but.....&quot; is similar to somebody saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not trying to start a rumour (and please keep this to yourself), but have you heard............?&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin, your account of &quot;sink-or-swim&quot; is pretty accurate, but don't you remember the Vanenburg Campus (at the Castle)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">26th August 2003, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The Campus existed, but I can't remember ever meeting anyone in Baan who had attended this.  Any of &quot;those&quot; people members of the board?<br />
<br />
As for the sink-or-swim, I know Arthas had the same experience  (coaching is fun :D) when he joined.  And to me it happened as well.  Joined Baan, got a shortened Tools training (2 days instead of 2 weeks!) and on day three, I received a tape and document of the (then brand new) BaanIVa installation, and was sent of to the (new) customer to install their pilot server!<br />
<br />
It actually worked, and we learned extremely fast that way. The bad part of this was that those type of people, with &quot;forced&quot; field experience, became &quot;senior&quot; analysts very fast, dealing with the &quot;serious&quot; calls (meaning the customers with the biggest mouths), and the newbies got the questions!<br />
<br />
As for support, we tend to fix things ourselves these days, and when opening a call, also send the exact location of the problem in the source code.  That way support is actually very fast!  Turn-around of less than a day, with accepted solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">26th August 2003, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I never attended the Campus at the Vanenburg Castle. When I joined the boot camp was still held in a hotel in The Netherlands: The Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek.<br />
My group was called BBITS III. It was a wonderful experience: 42 people from 24 different countries locked up in a hotel for three months.<br />
<br />
The most important thing we were taught was: it does not matter what you know, it is who you know.<br />
This message came from Jan Baan himself.<br />
And that was true. BAAN was growing so fast in the 90s that you had a hard time keeping up your network.<br />
Of course you have to also be good in your field of expertise because  otherwise you will never be successful in the Jungle of BAAN. <br />
<br />
Learning the hard way may not have been the most optimum but for sure your level of experience went up like crazy in a short time frame<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">27th August 2003, 05:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Arthas<br />
<br />
I just thought to share with all my experience which is not as bad as you make it out to be. <br />
<br />
Yes support may have been like that ( you would would know better) but I feel that it has changed and is changing for the better. Ofcourse a bitter pill last a long memory lasting power.. so bad experiences tend to remain with us. <br />
<br />
But seems support is doing just the right things now. contacting customers , not insisting on case closures and in some cases also telling us whats wrong (and what needs to be corrected) with customisations .<br />
<br />
by the way, for SA a case which is Solution Proposed is also closed and its counted as (the bonus buster) reopening.  A solution accepted case cannot be reopened.They recreate it as a new case.  <br />
<br />
Yesterday I gave one unsatisfied feedback. the support lady called me up and explained the answer again <br />
<br />
I took the opportunity to find out more about the feedbacks . She told me in details how they concentrate on feedbacks rather than case closings<br />
<br />
She told me that her appraisal is also based on the feedbacks I give her and each unsatisfied point I give is a setback to her ratings.I made her reopen the case. <br />
<br />
seems that they have an internal target of measuring satisfaction and each of the feedbacks we give counts toward that. <br />
<br />
so I believe since our work is also dependent on Baan, we should be realistic and help them improve.</div></div><hr />
