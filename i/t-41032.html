<br />
Can some one let me know which is the best practice for upgrading SPs to 18.<br />
<br />
Currently we have baan running on sp3 and we are upgrading the SPs to sp18 also we have lot of customizations.<br />
<br />
so we are doing it on test system first. The test system is ready with OS, DB and baan loaded on it. Now my question is, which one is best practice and easy in the upgradation?<br />
<br />
1) To upgrade the test system to SP3, load the data, then upgrade the SPs to 18 with a batch installer.<br />
<br />
2) To load SPs to SP18 using the batch installer, then load data by doing the modifications in the data( as new fields will be added after sp18, so there is a chance of getting 512 errors)<br />
<br />
And how do we do it for the customizations? Can some one throw some light on this. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Regards,<br />
IndianIdol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st option is better...<br />
<br />
And how do we do it for the customizations? Can some one throw some light on this. <br />
<br />
Before installing SP 18 on test server, you will have to put on paper all of your customized components and after installation of SPs, you will have to test these sessions on the upgraded server...<br />
Then, you can make modifications as required and also estimate downtime required on Live server....<br />

<br />
I have also been doing the same thing, and I will share the plan that we have...rest is yours...ofcourse this has to be done on test server machine...<br />
<br />
1. Take Dump of all the customizations  <br />
2. Take the back up of the system in current state, that includes the Export of Data Dictionary, Sequential Dump and BSE folder back-up.  <br />
3. Uninstall and clean up the Baan from Current Sanbox Server (applicable if you already have been doing some R &amp; D on the test server) <br />
4. Install the BaanIVc4   (applicable if you already have been doing some R &amp; D on the test server) <br />
5. Upgrade the Porting Set that is compatible to our target Service Pack for upgradation  <br />
6. Upgrade the Service Pack using &quot;Batch-Installer of either SP18 or SP21&quot; (as per requirment...)<br />
7. Run CRDD<br />
8. Import the customizations on Server<br />
9. Import the Data Dictionary and Data<br />
10. Run CRDD<br />
11. Ofcourse you customization will fail, so now do you rework on your customization and modify them.<br />
12. Then go for and exhaustve Testing Phase (all system and application testings...) in iteratative manner.<br />
Once you got the success on test server, then implement the same to go with Live.<br />
<br />
Hope this may help you a bit or so...all the very best.<br />

So any clue on that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi,<br />
Data is to be loaded before SP upgradation.<br />
<br />
Only the customized components (sessions, forms, reports, etc. etc.) are to be loaded after SP Upgradation....</div></div><hr />

1) To upgrade the test system to SP3, load the data, then upgrade the SPs to 18 with a batch installer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here I dont think you can use batch installer because batch installer works on only fresh installations since you have SP 3 installed already.<br />
<br />
I then summarise here my point of view, its strait forward:<br />
1. Take backup everything (OS, DB, BaaN, Export, Seq Levels)<br />
2. Install SP's, Porting set and standard program<br />
Note: Here I am assuming nobody changed standard component of Up Stnd.<br />
3. Do CRDD<br />
4. Retrofit your customisations.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and all the best.<br />
<br />

We had successfully upgraded one of our client's SPs from 8 to 18 using batch installer...You can use batch installer to upgrade your system, you can even get a confirmation from Infor (We had taken before our upgrade)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">30th August 2007, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Be careful with Batch Installer. If you have already installed individual solutions that will be part of a newer SP than the Batch Installer you are using, old problems can come back, or even worse, some software components are not compatible with each other anymore. To be safe, you have to uninstall those solutions and install them again after applying the Batch Installer.<br />
Another condition is that you must use the Update VRC codes that Infor is using for creating the Batch Installers.<br />
And be sure you import the PMC tables with the option to overwrite the duplicates. If you skip the duplicates, your registry may be corrupt after import, because solutions can retain the 'available' status, instead of 'installed'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whatever I have mentioned was taking care of your statement that you are going to do it on Test System first, so from my point of view the best way is batch installer, but ofcourse if you are going to do this on a system already having SP3 then you will have to go one by one SPs, and I will recommend to Run CRDD after each SP...<br />
<br />
@Kaustubh,<br />
<br />
are you sure that we must not put company Data after SP installation...in this case when someone is going to do the fresh installation...? Please guide me...with pros and cons?<br />
<br />
And dear IndianIdol,<br />
<br />
dont forget to prepare the customized component list before doing all these ase you have to do the rework on the components...<br />
<br />
All the very best..<br />

<br />
Hi Dilip,<br />
<br />
You have to put data into tables before upgradation, because the Table Definitions will get modified after upgradation and you wont be able to put back the data without altering your datafiles.<br />
<br />
In fact, our SP upgradation was done on existing system. So, we did not carry out any fresh installation...<br />
