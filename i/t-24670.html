<br />
I need some help from experienced experts who have implemented Baan in India.<br />
I am new to baan and would be implementing baanIV in a manufacturing unit in INdia - all modules like manufacturing, fin, distribution,service, project ,etc.<br />
<br />
I am about to start system study for the same.<br />
I am told that there is a concept of system study in baan using SIM-1 ,SIM-2 ,SIM-3 in Baan implementation ? What si this ?<br />
Can someone send me details and where can I find the documents for this for implementing in India ?<br />
<br />
Please reply as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Roughly they are scheduled at 1/3 (SIM 1) of the implementation time, 2/3 of the time (SIM 2) and immediately before going life.<br />
<br />
Roughly spoken, you can do the simulation phases in this way: <br />
<br />
Simulation 1) The major process (from sales order entry to sales invoice  integration into finance) for a single, but typical product of the company is demonstrated by the implementation partner, the basic layout of the way working with Baan is clear<br />
<br />
Simulation 2) The refined process is shown by the key users, the details of working with Baan are clear<br />
<br />
Simulation 3) The end users are trained, The process is demonstrated by the end users all doing their part of work within the process. All issues are cleared. If everything looks fine then, managements gives the ok for going life.<br />
