We have already Baan at all of our sites in US and are planning to initiate the implementations in Europe/Asia. I was wondering if some one can tell us the differences or additions we can expect in Europe ( Ireland,Hungary ) and Asia ( Malaysia, Singapore). Are there any localisation packages for these countries. Is Euro reqmts. part of standard Baan package.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanite</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 01:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Euro compliant requirements are accomodated.<br />
Iam sure they are there from version release 5.0<br />
<br />
As far as I remember we did not do any localizations for Ireland,<br />
Hungary&amp; Singapore( I was part of the localizations development for 5.0b &amp; 5.0c).Not sure if there are any in pipeline.<br />
Check out with Baan sales about thirdparty localization leads for malaysia<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I know about the Thialand localization which is very similar to India localization. <br />
<br />
 Singapore have very few localization requirements don't know abt the other sites.<br />
<br />
I feel U could get all the info from BGS site or mail them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have an implementation partner for Europe and Asia.  Anyone who has implemented in those regions would be more familiar with any localizations that exist (or should exist) for a particular country.  The chief driver for localizations in Europe would have been the Euro, which Baan addressed anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">for Europe, and on one of our systems (covers most Europe in one big system), we have (BaanIVc4):<br />
- Localizations installed for: Portugal, Spain, Belgium (BULL made), Italy, Scandinavian  countries (Norway+Sweden+Denmark)<br />
-No localizations installed for: France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Netherlands and Poland<br />
All countries just finished their EURO migrations.<br />
<br />
Forgot the Asia implementation (BaanIVc4 as well):<br />
- No localizations installed for: Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Germanicus</div><div class="date">16th December 2001, 14:43</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan 4 localisations are available for almost any European Country taking the legal situations into account.<br />
<br />
But only B40c4 is Euro comliant. Anyway if you want to implement new software you would certainly not buy B40c4.<br />
<br />
And this takes us to ERP. In ERP all localisations are included.<br />
But still there are a few things unsolved e. g. Grinya.<br />
<br />
The FAM module is much better than the FAS in Baan 4 but there is still room for improvement.<br />
<br />
If you get in tuch with the Sales staff remember that they will tell you anything to get your signature. (promise functionalities)<br />
<br />
This does not mean that Baan is a bad software. If you want to implement it you must know what you want. Does the Baan Software offer the functionalities that your company needs?<br />
<br />
You need a good consultant that helps you to analyze your needs. With a propper planning you won't get in trouble.<br />
<br />
And don't believe that the implementation can be done &quot;in no time&quot;. There are some simulation phases necessary!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">19th December 2001, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Germanicus is correct.  The package will likely cover your functional requirements, but do not take the sales rep's word for it.  I have spent many implementations explaining aspects of Baan to my client that they were hearing for the first time from me.  Spend the time on your simulations and you will have a clean system.</div></div><hr />
