1. A normal Consignment warehouse (CO)is defined against a Finished goods (FG)warehouse .An Inventory transfer is done from FG to CO.Before that the sales Order shall be booked &amp; in lines the warehouse CO is  Created  An inventory planned order can be generated for replenishing CO  from FG.<br />
2.In Consignment sales the business demands is such that the transfer of product is sold by a consignee on a elemental  amount for which that consignee shall charge a commission .And the goods which are sold or to be sold shall be under the consignee cutody (meaning the consignee warehouse)<br />
3.Consignee purchase is purely based on-behalf purchase for which if the transaction is done in India , then the law says that the MODVAT effect cannot be granted to you.which is usually an unadvised business policy still if the transactions due to mere reasons are done .it can be purely handled by letting a purchase receipt done in CO &amp; transferring it to normal warehouse .<br />
Payment can be done in many ways <br />
1. Payment shal be made to the main supplier from whom the Raw Material is Purchased &amp; a Other Charges cost item PO can be made on the Consignee supplier<br />
2. Without PO the payment transaction can be made by passing a JV for the commission charges fro the main purchase ( the only care to be taken is to create a PO in the name of the main Supplier &amp; not the Consignee Supplier.<br />
Kindly let me know if there is any other requirement</div></div><hr />

Each procedure can be divide into two phase, and combine the two phase function can get the same as the normal process. <br />
<br />
in the two phase, the procedure has been divided into Physical movement and the Really buy/sale procedure. if you buy something with consigment,  in the first phase, only the physical movement will be take into account. Now, the materila move from supplier to your consighment warehouse(not owned). even the materila is located in your site while the buy procedure haven't be done.<br />
<br />
Next, when you want to use the material, you will move the materila from the warehouse (not own) to your own warehouse, this is the really buy procedure take place.</div></div><hr />
