<br />
We have Upgraded the Service Packs and Porting set, SP from 18 to 25 and Porting Set from 6.1c.07.03 to 6.1c.07.19. but after updating the portingset getting error during compiling of any report or query or any script. Its looking for bic_bshell, but i have seen in include6.1 folder only bic_shell, i also update the include files from baan site, still no luck. And when i revert the bin folder it works fine, so i tried to replace the following executables<br />
<br />
bic6.1, bic60_6.1, bic_cstub6.1, bic_info6.1, binput6.1, csapi_compiler6.1, idl_compiler6.1, preconv60_6.1, repgen6.1, repgen_incl6.1, std_gen6.1, stdgen_incl6.1<br />
<br />
and also moved the new include to .org and got the old include6.1 folder, but now its giving a message as comilation error but not displaying any error.<br />
<br />
So is there any way to fix this compilation error in the new portingset?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,</div></div><hr />
