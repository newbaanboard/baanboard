Want expert's advise on the following :<br />
<br />
!. What is better - centralised single server or multiple Baan Servers- one at each location ?<br />
2. What are the Pros &amp; Cons of Centralized v/s Decentralized Baan Server ?<br />
3. Is it essential to have a Citrix Server if we go for a Central Server ?<br />
(or can the additional cost of Citrix Server be avoided ? If so, how ?)<br />
4. What is the ideal policy for VRC Structure, Companies, etc if we go for Central Server ?<br />
5. What is the ideal policy if we go for one Baan Server at each location ? Can we keep a common VRC Structure everywhere ? How will it help in taking common patches or common Customization at all locations ?<br />
6. Any other inputs not mentioned here , that can help me further ? Pls. advise.<br />
<br />
I expect all the Gurus &amp; Experts Opinion on this to enable me to take a final decision.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
All depends on the company organisation (several companies, multi-finacial setup, specific localisations, etc. ?) so start by evaluating or describing on each location needs and then work on your system and not vice-versa!<br />
<br />
Even so, on my former employer we had centralised servers: not only was cheaper (less DC space, better deals for big machines than smaller ones, etc.) but also for manageability of the system. Of course I only dealt with UNIX servers so it may be not the same with Windows.<br />
<br />
The package combination/VRC structure of Baan copes very well with these centralised setups, so you can have each of your locations working on it's own VRC path, independent of the others (just sharing whatever should be common to them).<br />
<br />
Now, by centralising you need a good policy and workflow regarding patches. I would definitely have a test server (also used as development, so you can avoid any test layers on production) to test patches/development before applying them to production. You also need to keep track of patches and so on and have only one person (global IT manager) that can approve their installations, otherwise you'll end up with a patch mess.<br />
<br />
From the network side, depends on how your offices are connected, those systems I mentioned had the clients connect directly to the server, no citrix was ever used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that you must have Citrix, you may setup a Terminal server which costs much less.<br />

<br />
we have around 40 location network and we implemented centralised baan server. I think centralised server configuration definatly reduce the administrative cost and also project cost (hardware wise). It also depends on your company policy, product and MIS procedure. <br />
<br />
Reg. Citrix/Terminal services, you can use where their availability of bandwidth is low. These are very good solution against Bandwidth problem.<br />

Ctirix may be used but depends on your network.</div></div><hr />
