<br />
Pl'z tell about yor location and the baan version in which you are working ?<br />
<br />
Also pl'z tell when u had implemented Baan in your company ?  <br />
<br />
My Suggestion will be to stay in your own company for atleast a year(one financial year ) after implementation , This will help u a lot in your learning Process and then u can go high in your carrer along with that experience<br />
