Its all depends on your Business requirements. See...every organization has different set of stategies/policies when they accept it. Sometimes might be relevant in my organization but definitely not in yours...vice-versa. <br />
Always, prepare a backup strategy so that you can recover quickly from any unexpected problems or delays.<br />
I am curious, Are you working in 24*7 operations? Whether you have separete servers for application and database? <br />
Whether your database is on Archive mode? Which backup software are you using? <br />
<br />
Localisation might not the issue for backups.<br />

2. No we have onely one dual CPU server.<br />
3.Our database is not running in  Archive mode <br />
4. Backup strategy is<br />
daily - live company dump [afer last shift is over],registry of Nt server.<br />
weekly- export dd,partition dump,rdisk of nt server,tools company dump, dem export,cold backup of whole server.<br />
5. we take the cold backup weekly .<br />
6. Yes we are looking for a third party backup software.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">N. sriram</div><div class="date">5th December 2003, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Suhas/Anurag,<br />
<br />
I would like to put my views in this subject, since I had faced a critical problem with baan a year ago.<br />
That was a kind of experience, which put my blood pressure levels to the max and is a nice story to read.<br />
It all happened in a day, when I was preparing to on a long leave.  All of a sudden the baan server stopped responding to the user requests and I was getting some error like &quot;database not on&quot;.<br />
<br />
I tried everything I knew to set the server running.<br />
I searched for baan support, and it was a friday evening &amp; all the consultants will get vanished for weekends.<br />
I talked to Baan Bombay and they redirected me to Hyderabad, but ultimately I couldn't do anything.<br />
Since, it was a very serious situation, baan sent a tools consultant to rectify the problem.(I cancelled my leave, that's the saddest part of the whole episode)<br />
<br />
The problem was identified with that of passwords of dbo.  The password that's stored in baan\msql directory was not matching with the password available in baandb.  We couldn't find out the reason.  It was not a user problem, because, nobody of us, even knew what to do with a sql server then, since the baan server was kept like a diamond in a safe place.<br />
<br />
Now, it was decided to reinstall everything, since the problem couldn't be rectified.<br />
<br />
Reinstallation of baan and service packs, along with recreation etc., etc.,<br />
Then we decided to go for a shortcut.<br />
1. Make a copy of the existing baan directory to another safe place.<br />
2.  Take complete sql database backup<br />
3.  Reinstall only basic baan, which will recreate the sql server database <br />
4.  Try restoring the sql server backup <br />
But, it didn't work.<br />
<br />
Then we reinstalled baan and restored tools company backup. (Sequence I am not able to recollect, since I was very new to everything) Copied all the baan directory files, except the tools and user directory from the earlier backup (This avoided reinstallation of service packs) Then we carried on with the restoration of live company, which went on successfully and we could complete the entire operation in just a day.<br />
<br />
From this entire episode, I could learn few things :<br />
<br />
Always, have a recent backup of baan installation, tools company and live company backup. Always take your sequential dump with | delimitor.  we faced lot of problems during restoration of non-delimited backup of baan, since I wasn't taking sequentil dump with | delimiters then. We couldn't make use of sql server backup of baandb.  After restoring of the data, we couldn't run baan successfully, then only we decided go for restoration of sequential backup. We first thought that, restoration of sql server level backup, will retrieve all our data back, but it didn't work somehow, and we ended up getting the same error.<br />
<br />
Hope, you would have got the gist of my message.  Now you can better plan your backup strategy.  Pls. let me also know, when you format something.<br />
<br />
Remember one thing, whatever amount of backup you have, if your time is good, everything is good.<br />

You re-installed becuase the password in the msql_group's file<br />
was different than the actual DBOs password?<br />
<br />
Sorry, but whoever sent you down that road should be shot.. <br />

May be now it may look like that.  But, during the problem he looked like god to me.  Since, we were only 6 months old into baan and I knew nothing about baan then. (and the biggest thing, is that I was supposed to attend my engagement the next day, in a city 1000 kms away from my work place)<br />
He suggested copying old msql directory files, but I didn't have them, since in a hurry I took a fresh backup of all baan directory files, into the same place where I had the old backup, overwriting good ones with the bad ones.  So, we were forced to this situation, I think.</div></div><hr />

It's difficult to suggest backup strategy to you because lot of things has to study in it. We are taking following kind of backups, you have to decide your business requirements to adopt it.<br />
<br />
Application Level :<br />
1. Sequential backup (Without &quot;|&quot; for 000 and with &quot;|&quot; for other companies)<br />
2. Export sessions<br />
3. BaaN folder backup<br />
<br />
Database level:<br />
1. Oracle Export (full database)<br />
2. Hot Backup<br />
3. Cold Backup<br />
4. Also my database is on Archive mode so I can peform point in time recovery.<br />
<br />
OS Level:<br />
1. Full server with OBDR backup<br />
2. ERD<br />
3. Also we have RAID 1<br />
<br />
Also refer to - <br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12369 and attached white paper.<br />
<br />
Sorry Sriram/Dave, I am not SQL person so cannot share your views. Sriram, just curious, Did you reached to your destination in one day or postponed the function.<br />

<br />
sorry, I suppose i should post something on the topic too.. <br />
<br />
Nightly, Hot backups for your Oracle DB<br />
are the key.<br />
<br />
You'll want a backup program with an Oracle plugin (otherwise you have to script the hot backup part), as well as a windows plugin so that it can backup (and restore) the registry.<br />
<br />
This will give you point in time recovery ability (You can recover up to the second you lost your data..).<br />
<br />
If you'd like you can also do an export of the Oracle DB, which will allow you to do table recovery. However, this isn't always as useful as it sounds, since Baan's referential integrity could be messed up if you restore a table from an export. (You can't roll forward in this case)<br />
<br />
Sriram,<br />
<br />
I don't blame you, I blame your Baan support center that didn't fix the problem immediatly.. Unless its something much more than it sounds, that should have taken about 6 seconds to fix...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 09:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sorry Dave, but taking Hot Backup needs your database on Archive log mode. You are right, ours BaaN support is poor as we are getting always different tape than we expect.<br />
<br />
I have one nice white paper on Backup but I don't know why attachment feature is not working at my side from last 2-3 days.<br />

<br />
Right you'd need to be in archivelog mode.. Which all production DBs should. *Unless* you like the thought of losing a whole day's worth of data..<br />
<br />
The performance hit is usually fairly minimal. If you have your DB tuned.<br />

I have a similar situation on our Development box.  I was trying to speed up the process to do a data refresh for our dev system.  So, I took the baandb (in MSSQL) offline, detached the database and copied it to our dev environment. On Dev, I reattached the new baandb files.  Through SQLServer I can see all of the data.  When I log into Baan, I get the 510 errors.  How can you resync the passwords?  <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
