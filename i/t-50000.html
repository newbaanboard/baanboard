<br />
Good Day!!<br />
<br />
Can some one suggest how to disable Delete tables session or is there any way to make this session password protected?<br />
<br />
Thanks in anticipation and Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">31st March 2008, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to completely disable this session, one way (brutal way, IMHO) is to remove (or rename) the object script from the directory tools:<br />
<br />
$BSE/tools/ttXX/oMMMNNNN where MMMNNNN where MMMNNNN are the third 7 chars of the session (discard first 2, the module name).<br />
<br />
Just rename it as the same name.DISABLED or something else<br />
<br />
Nobody can call this session after.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if you want someone have already access to this session, you have to manage the session authorizations (this means that all users have to be normal users, a lot of work and a slightly increase of load of the system...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">31st March 2008, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, session authorizations is a cleaner way, but consider that all super users cannot be disabled, so you have to transform all super users in normal users and manage all authorizations. Also, this increment the system load because every time an user must run a session the system must control that the user is authorized.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That rude way might be helpful to me in my case, as there are lot of super users and i cannot change them to normal and give them authorizations.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of this option, but i wanted to check for any other better options.<br />
<br />
Anyways thanks a lot for ur time and suggestions.<br />
