<br />
This is related to ERP LN 6.1 FP2 for Warehousing Module.<br />
<br />
Please note that in our company we are mapping following things,<br />
The C-Class Consumables Like Hand Gloves, Cotton Waste, Napkins, Soaps &amp; Washing Powders, Cutting Oils etc. are regularly used for Production &amp; we treat them as Consumables. We donÂ’t want to put them in Production Order, but want to record them as additional expenses to carry over the Production, hence we want to issue them as Production Expenses.<br />
We know that in Baan IV C4, we had &quot;Enter Inventory Transaction: Production Issue&quot; which could take care of this Production Issue thing, and the Consumables are just consumed in the Production.<br />
But till now we had not able to map the solution for the above matter in ERP LN 6.1 FP2.<br />
Please anyone of you had the solution applicable for ERP LN6.1 for this, then please reply with the flow &amp; session numbers. Please help me out. Thanks.<br />

<br />
You can use W/H Orders with Origin as SFC Production &quot;Manual&quot; and Transaction Type as &quot;Issue&quot;. In this session you can also map the Workcentre against which you are issuing inventory.<br />
Hope this will serve your purpose better.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the conveying the correct procedure.<br />
<br />
Please note that the consumables are to be consumed in Production, and hence those should be Production Issued to the respective WorkCentres.<br />
<br />
By using the 'Warehouse Order' with Origin as 'SFC Production - Manual' &amp; 'Transaction Type-ISSUE', the material is transfered from 'Warehouse' to 'WorkCentre'.<br />
<br />
By this procedure, the purpose is solved. Thanks once again.<br />

 <br />
In ERP LN 6.1 we have Warehouse Order of &quot;SFC Production (Manual)&quot;, and using this the Consumable Items are Issued from Stores Warehouse to Work Centre.<br />
Now I got it to this point. But now I have further question.<br />
<br />
We have issued &amp; loaded the value to Work Centre. Where is this value going? How this value is captured in Production &amp; Finance ? Expenses.<br />
<br />
If suppose I Issue consumable material worth 1 Lakh in one month, then where will I get the reference that these are the expenses in one month for production, which occured thru consumables, but which are not directly loaded on production of end finished product thru production order.<br />
<br />
Please guide me, I want to learn. Sorry if its simple &amp; I have failed to find myself. I asked to some of my colleagues but not got answer.<br />
Thanks.<br />
