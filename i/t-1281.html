Whilst I don't expect anyone for one minute to post a reply to this question in a post. It will be interesting to see how people vote anonymously.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

Seems PJ wants to know the trend only in US and UK :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know this is a very old thread, but I am sure the subject is still important, and is also changing based on the market...<br />
<br />
I just found an article that talks about Baan salaries (And some other ERP consultants/ Perm Jobs) in Europe.<br />
<br />
You may find this link useful. They say the salary of a UK IT Director with SAP or Baan experience should be around 90,000 pounds. Daily rates for consultants in the UK in the same arena has fallen from 750 Pounds to 400 Pounds a day.<br />
<br />
Check the attached link...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mattblack</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to be a fusspot, but if anybody needs questionnaires designed for a small fee to keep food on my table while I wait for a miracle or another job...<br />
<br />
Questionnaires are actually a lot more difficult to design than people think, for example, this one had overlapping and non-exhaustive categories. They also were sensitive to currency and location.<br />
If you wanted to include Indian respondants and UK, you need to know if you want absolute currency or buying power scales.<br />
<br />
For example, if you wanted to know if people were getting &quot;good salaries&quot; then you need an independant conversion factor, like the price of a Big Mac as a basis of comparison, or you need to factor cost of living numbers.<br />
<br />
I know the poll was more for fun than serious, but many serious decisions are taken on the basis of invalid techniques.<br />
<br />
I am a reasonably good creator of questionnaires and analysis.</div></div><hr />
