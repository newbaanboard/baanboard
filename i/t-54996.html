<br />
Firstly is it possible to install Baan remotely?<br />
<br />
I am trying to load Baan Vb remotely in combination with SQL2000 with SP4 and Windows 2003 R2 with SP2. I am using Dameware to connect the server which is in another locatoin.<br />
<br />
It is direct installatoin method not the staging method, And every time it fails at 97% of importing tools part. I am starting with the Tools setup first it reaches 97% and fails every time. I tried to install using the same software in a local machine and it went thru fine.<br />
<br />
When i look at the error is reads as &quot;Error Importing Data&quot; and also i see &quot;Error 205 - Out of Range&quot;. I have checked the coillation of OS, DB and Baan Charactersets they were same as the local machine. <br />
<br />
So, now my question is is this the problem with Remote installation? I also checked the environment variables like BSE, BSE_TMP, BAAN_HOME they were set properly.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest why its failing?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

Are You trying to use &quot;Damware Remote Desktop&quot; or &quot;Damware Remote Install&quot; ?.<br />
<br />
Try using Remote Desktop (MSTSC / VNC /etc..).<br />
<br />
Note : Some of Our Servers are Located in Diff Locations , I use MSTSC it works for me (even for remote install using RDP)<br />

However, I know that you must be on the console of the server for installations.  When using remote desktop you must use the 0 display to be the console.  VMware works also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for all your quick replies, I think i have figured it out....<br />
<br />
The problem is when we did the installation on the server A it failed and on Server B it went well, Note both the servers A and B are in different geogrophical locations, So when i investigated further, noticed that the server A was in Domain earlier which we moved it out of Domian and made a member of workgroup, and Server B was an individual server not included in any domain, so i belive the reason for failure was when the OS was installed on the Server A it was installed according to the domain specifications and which was causing the problem in Baan installation.<br />
<br />
So now i am installing it on the Server B which is in workgroup and using it. Thanks for all your time and efforts.<br />
