<br />
I am not sure if this is the right forum to ask, but just putting my thoughts here and looking for some suggestions.<br />
<br />
I am a senior technical consultant with close to 11 years of experience, I do not have development experience but my experience is mostly on Installations, Upgrades, Migrations &amp; Tools administration. <br />
<br />
Now I am in a situation where I don't see any future for the work I do as a senior resource, as many junior consultants can do the same tasks. So, my concern is what should be the way forward for me?<br />
<br />
Where can I use my past experience and grow further both professionally and financially.<br />
<br />
Is it Project Management? or Continue being Technical consultant and grow the width of the product knowledge, like development &amp; functional knowledge? or is there any other alternative?<br />
<br />
I am sure, some one before me might had the same situation as i am in now? So any ideas or suggestions suggesting a way forward would be of great help.<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking your valuable time to read till end and would appreciate if you can share your thoughts.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</div></div><hr />
