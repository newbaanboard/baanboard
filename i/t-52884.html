<br />
We face the scenario that we do not want to  create a production order for sub contracting material. But without the reffernace of it we have to send the material outside for subcon. As per requirement we will tell subncontractor to work on material. Then we will receive material in diffrenet form. This also need to be linked with 57F4 challan.<br />
<br />
Help required<br />
regards and thank you<br />

<br />
There is no way you can achieve the result desired by you in standard baan/Ln, without creating a production order. <br />
<br />
May be customization can be tried out (Too complex I believe). Any way what is wrong with the standard, it is quite robust although little bit lengthy.<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

This is with reference to ERP LN 6.1 FP2 with India Localisation, with issue in SubContracting.<br />
Please note,<br />
# Sending &quot;one form/ itemcode&quot; ( XXX ) of material to SubContractor for working, where form changes, and then recieving back &quot;in DIFFERENT FORM/ different itemcode&quot; ( YYY ) of material back, is the process involved in the case.<br />
# This type of transaction involves Inventory transactions in Warehousing. This is supported with the help of BOM &amp; Production Order, where the itemcode &amp; Inventory changes when you recieve the material in different form back.<br />
# Hence your present requirement is not getting support from the ERP system.<br />
# This type of transaction out of Production Order route is possible only if the form &amp; Itemcode is not changed during the process, and the same material is again recieved back. Just like in case of Heat Treatment.<br />
# In that case the 57F4 Challans are prepared without reference of Production Order. where you maintain the Outgoing &amp; Incoming material same &amp; after transaction completion, the 57F4 is closed.<br />
Hope you understand the case.<br />
If further assistance needed or any breakthrough you get, please write back.<br />
Regards.<br />

I've seen a demonstration of this already.</div></div><hr />
