<br />
It is nearly  18 months gone by when ERP LN 6.1 introduced in India. Indian Localisation was made in JAVA. Every Baan Users knows about Indian localization.  There are different views by the Baan User's  about  Indain localization.<br />
<br />
Whether <br />
1) Made in JAVA is good decision and should continue<br />
2) Should have gone with Standard <br />
3) Should have made in Other Tools. (spedify)<br />
4) Dum the JAVA go for Baan Standard<br />
<br />
Your  views will certainly helps other members understand cons and pros of the current Localisation. <br />
<br />
If anybody from SSA (Now INFO) will also get some indication of the actual users point of view.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Ramesh</div></div><hr />

The Java is too slow. It gives a feeling that this is something different than standard.</div></div><hr />

Thus, developers, administrators in Java will be required for support, development, customization, etc.<br />
<br />
Between,<br />
I have heard from one of the Infor technical sources, that Indian Localization in Baan is on the verge of completion. Infor should be releasing it near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dilipk.pandey</div><div class="date">16th June 2007, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all I am agree with Kaukul that developing India Localization in Java brings one more technology in  Pool of Baan, and I think the very first reason why they would have started thinking about Java is the Resource Unavailability/ Scarcity in BaaN (4GL &amp; 3 GL)...and we have ample of resources available in Java, that reduces the development cost ofcourse.<br />
<br />
And for this daring step, even after all IFFs and BUTs on India Localization, I appreciate the Decision Makers as well as the architects who decided to lead this Project...I have heard lots bad words about it, but I also understand the complexity of Development...the complexity of Finance Integaration from outside of the Baan, all those synchronization, integrity &amp; database consistancy issues, connectivity issue, behavioural conflicts of two totally different environments etc.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have heard about the India Localization in 4GL is going to be released (or already released..), I hope this will erase all the grudges of the customers...please dont take my words to b meant for defending someone but just a personal thought.<br />
Wishing all the Baan customers all the very best.<br />
Regards,<br />
Dilip.</div></div><hr />

   India Localization first phase is already delivered. It has lot of good concepts. One of them is Aggregate Tax Codes. This structure makes, ur defining of tax code very flexible. Most of the changes in tax laws can be handled at user end only.<br />
The localization seems to be really positive. many new concepts are said to be planned.<br />
<br />
Next phase of localization is also in design stage. It is stated to be released in October - November 2007 time frame.</div></div><hr />
