<br />
We have implemented ERP LN 6.1 FP3 in &quot;Single Logistic - Multi Finance&quot; environment. We are using &quot;Inter company transfers with Invoice &quot; option to do inventory transfers between Enterprise units connected to different finance companies which have different Taxations. <br />
<br />
However we couldn't find out a option to do &quot;returns&quot; (i.e: Inter company transfers with Credit Notes)  in the application. Please advise us how to perform this type of transaction in the system.<br />
<br />
Eg: Company A transfered some goods to Company B with a invoice for 10,000/= (In this we have to pay 15% Vat &amp; 1% BTT). since system doesn't have a way to pass a credit note and return goods hence we have to do another transfer from Company B to company A where we will pay the 1% BTT again.<br />
<br />
(for an example if some has done a inter company transfer by mistake there is no way of returning)<br />
<br />
When I checked with Infor Support (India) this was their answer. &quot;At present this functionality is not present. Way you are working in current scenario is the only workaround.&quot;This will be taken as enhancement request, This functionality may not come immediately it will come in future releases.&quot;<br />
<br />
However I think there should be a way to do this transaction. I'd really appreciate if one you experts can advise me on how to do this or suggest a workaround.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
