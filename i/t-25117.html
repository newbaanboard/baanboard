<br />
I am looking for information and documents on indian localization.<br />
What is indian localization (specific to baanIVc4)and how is it different from normal baan used worldwide? What are the features of indian localization ? What are the differences between in3 and in5 ?<br />
I searched on baanboard but could not get any info on this.<br />
<br />
Any details would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
India Localisation is the setup for Indian Taxation like Central Excise, Sales Tax, VAT &amp; Service Tax. It also includes statutory compliance like creation of 57 f 4 challans for material movement to Sub contractors as required under Indian excise rules. It creates statutory reports lfor VAT &amp; Excise i.e ER1 etc. As some or all of these tax structures and compliances are not standard around the world they are not included in Baan Core/Standard and are country specific. It integrates into the Baan standard used around the world.<br />
<br />
I am sorry I cannot tell you the difference between in3 and in5 as I have only worked on in5. However the localisation also depends to a greate extent on the service pack installed. Localisation too has service packs.<br />
<br />
My personal id is nayak.ratnakar@gmail.com. If you can send me yr mail, I will dig up whatever material I have on in5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">22nd September 2005, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference between both is more technical than substantive . The programs in in3  have localized standard programs . In in5 the programs are decoupled from standard . More or less the functionality is similar .<br />
<br />
As of now little changes are made in in3 and more changes are made in in5 as an incetive for customers to migrate to in5 . <br />
<br />
I have worked little on localization. So somebody with more-in-depth knowledge can provide more info on this.</div></div><hr />
