<br />
We have loaded BaaN IV c4 on win NT 4.0 with IN5 ( India Localisation ), now for standard VRC i have created a paackage combination with the name B40c4STD and for my India localisation we have created package combination as B40c4IN5<br />
<br />
Now if i execute or try to see help for any standard session , it shows me the help for that, but if  try to see INdia Localisation related field level help , then it doesn't shows me.<br />
<br />
I went to session ttadv5240m000 (Create Windows Help), and saw that my package combination B40c4STD has been listed there and all the package r listed below them where the help file status is INITIAL, then i saw for my India Localsiation package comb. for this also the same help status is shown there as INITIAL.<br />
<br />
Only tools package it is showing the help status as COMPILE.<br />
<br />
now my question is :<br />
1)why does field level help doesn't come for India Localisation ?? and why it comes for STANDARD Package comb. ??<br />
<br />
2) Although i selected one of the package i.e. td and clicked on Generated, it changed the status of td package from INITIAL to GENERATED after processing for some time , it seems that now I have to compile it too.<br />
<br />
from where can i download this Microsoft Help authoring tool... anybody knows the exact path ???<br />
<br />
My user is not using Windows help file format,  rather he is using BaaN runtime or baan format <br />
<br />
Am i going in right direction ???<br />
<br />

<br />
After patching the localized objects (IN5), I hope you might have created RDD for help also..Even then are you facing problem ?<br />
<br />
Have you checked all the components' help details ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">22nd September 2003, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Well after i posted i figured out that it was windows help whose status was shown as INITIAL.... so i think i have to generate the help and then compile it using Microsoft Workshop Help.. but one more problem is that when i select the Module i.e. Menu such as Central Excise which is under distribution ( INDIA LOCALISATION Module ) and i click on Centre Excise and then on Find Help on , it doesn't display the help for this module.....<br />
<br />
<br />
what should i do ??<br />
