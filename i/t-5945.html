<br />
I'm a Baan consultant that I've worked during all my career in Spain.<br />
<br />
As I can see, almost all the people and professionals at BaanBoard, have experience in foreign projects (USA, UK, India, China, etc...).<br />
<br />
I would like to know, if there is someone who had worked here in Spain, and chat with him/her about the experience and the knowledge adquired (companies where he/she worked, posibilities in the future market, etc.)<br />
<br />
I hope to find someone with these characteristics.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
