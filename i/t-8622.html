We have J2EE server ( Jboss, with SOUP implementation AXIS , and XML) which is resposible for connection with several application. Sales order is created in another application and by that J2EE should be send to Baan.<br />
Also information about Production order created in Baan should be send to another application.<br />
I am responsible for connection to Baan IV c<br />
I installed Tomcat ( servlet container , Axis - implementation of SOUP and Xerces - XML pharser) . I wrote service in AXIS which receives Sales Order , but I can't put it to Baan<br />
I know , that I have several possibility:<br />
1. create socket( port 512) to Baan - like in proxyServer in $BSE/internet - but netserver6.1 and bic_jstub6.1 isn't now available - I have one for Solaris (from old version of portingSet) , but I should have for HP Unix and WINDOWS<br />
2. use BCK with BOI ( I have ccslssalesorder and ccsfsprodorder)<br />
  but how I can get BCK .Is it free ?<br />
3. use OpenWorld - but :<br />
   where I shoul install Getway and Adapter? Should I have another parts of OpenWorld?<br />
I prefer not change J2EE server , because our solution should be general ( just was made connection to SAP , and now I look for the method to connect Baan) This solution will be installed in several places.<br />
Thanks for help.</div></div><hr />

1) I would say u can use either Cordys or OpenWorld Adaptor for BaaN Java Integration. If u face any problem on investment u can use BCK. I would say BCK is better than Internet applets specified in the $bse. BCK is ofcourse free of cost. But BaaN stopped supporting BCK and its not available in many countries. But if u are living in India, u can still get BCK1.3 along with the BCK documents.<br />
<br />
2)BCK comes with inbuilt BOI's such as ccslssalesorder and ccsfsprodorder.But the problem is not all the methods are implemented . For eg, in ccslssalesorder Create() is not implemented. In such occasions u need to develop your own <br />
BOI's. BCK supports BOIBuilder.<br />
<br />
3) For OW Installtion please refer the OW Installtion manual.<br />
<br />
4) Regarding the J2EE Server, there will not be any specific changes required in the J2EE Server .If u use BEA Weblogic, it has inbuilt JCA components which can be used to call the BOI's directly from the application server. In Tomcat and other applicatoin servers, u need develop piece of code which will call the Javaclients that comesup with BCK. I dont know whether Tomcat supports JCA. JCA is the best practice to integrate Java application server and BOI's.<br />
<br />
Please refer the forum for more details and there are so many posts of similar nature. <br />

Thanks.<br />

I have tested the similar setup.  <br />
using Apache Tomcat as the web container, and with Apache Axis installed in it, which is a SOAP server.<br />
<br />
Made a sales order service using Axis, which will receive requests from different applications.(in my case, it was from .Net) whenever any request comes, I store them in a temporary db. From this, I make a sales order in Baan using BOIs.<br />
<br />
This works fine for me.<br />
But for this, I have written my own BOIs, as the one which baan sends is not enough. You can try that. <br />

I have one question for Arun.<br />
Where was Axis and temporary data base installed : on the same server where  Baan was, or on the different server.<br />
If it was different server , ( I prefer such solution to be independent of Baan's server platform ) how you made sales order in Baan - . how Axis service get to the Baan server <br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, there is a different server altogether where in I have the temporary database, and apache server.<br />
<br />
I exposed, the functionality of receiving orders as a &quot;Webservice&quot; using Apache Axis. <br />
So when ever any request comes from client, I make an entry into the temporary database. <br />
<br />
Now, from this temporary database, there is a BOI java client, which reads this data and connects to baan server and runs the Maintain Sales order session in Baan. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ml2253</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I still have 1 problem.<br />
If I understand : Axis , temporary db and BOI java client are on one server and Baan server are on second server , are there ?<br />
How does BOI java client (which is in diffrent server as baan server ) connect baan server ?<br />
Does it use socket to baan server ( 512 port - such BCK)  and what does it send  through this socket ( command &quot;ba&quot; with aguments).? Which mechanism do you use for that connection ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for patience.<br />

<br />
I think u r worried abt communication with baan server protocol. BCK does that for u. U can imagine as invoking a baan shell in the background for every BOI request to the baan server, which is done by java api that comes along with BCK installation. For every call to a BOI, a Baan license is used, which is coz it invokes bshell behind. So, u can imagine licenses getting used during runtime.<br />
In OW, there is a single tmboaserver server running in Baan server that handles all the BOI calls. NO separate baan user license usage, in this case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 07:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, As senthil said,<br />
you dont have to worry about connecting to a baan server. Baan has provided the necessary Connectivity APIs(the Display server Protocol Implementation), which will help you to connect to Baan. When you generate a BOI, it has several functions for connecting to baan server. <br />
During login, the java client accesses a configuration file, where all the necessary login details to baan are present.(BCBE.cfg).<br />
<br />
And with programming, you can also control the license management in baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ml2253</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I found at last, that  you use BCK in your setup. ( to connect with baan server).There is no java on baan server  - Do I understand well ?<br />
As far as I know BCK is obsolete now. Despite of that , how can I obtain BCK ?<br />
On page secure1.support.baan.com/ftpdownload/BC_Kit is only DefaultCompany 555<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">BCK is no longer shipped in most parts of earth. <br />
No longer supported either. Even if u get hold of BCK, it is at ur risk. There are many mentions to this effect regarding this, in this forum.<br />
<br />
Why not u call up Baan Distribution store in ur region? Maybe they will ship, but am not sure if they will support.<br />
<br />
And abt license usage, There is no way 2 BOIs can be run at same time, using a single license. Maybe u can optimise it by programming to release the license, without holding on... and maybe make it optimised. Or maybe put the existing call in a loop till the first BOI releases it's license.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeyaseelan</div><div class="date">5th February 2003, 08:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Please refer License and BOI thread in this forum. I attached ConnectionManager.java in the license and BOI thread which handles the BOI licensing issue programmatically.<br />
<br />
Regarding BCK, its still available in India and APAC on demand.But no baan support for BCK.<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt; Refer to this point. I work for a integration software company and we need to integrate with Baan IV C4.  And the client does not want to buy any integration software.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me on where specifically I could get the BCK CD along with the document, in India? Whom should I call- the Baan Support? Do I need to be a Baan customer to get access to the BCK? <br />

Thanks a bunch!<br />

BaaN doesn't suport BCK anymore. BaaN India is issuing BCK Kit on demand. You need to put lot of pressure then only u will able to get it. I managed to get one for my Client where we have integarted BaaN IV C4 using BCK. Pls approach BaaN India in Mumbai or Hyderabad. <br />
Best of luck.<br />
