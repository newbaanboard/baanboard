Two finance user have work on the same batch, one of them finalized the batch. but few transaction have not been finalised. So when we printing the non finalized transaction, it show the data. But in finalization run number this batch is linked with a Run Number.<br />

I do not know about any standard session to do it.<br />
<br />
Another way using Maintain Tables Session:<br />
<br />
* First of all check if the non finalized lines are not duplicated. It is possible the entire batch has been finalized but the lines have not been cleared.<br />
* If the lines exist only as non finalized I would try to create a new empty batch and use it to finalize the lines. In order to get it the batch number has to be changed in the pending lines.<br />

<br />
Sometimes it happens that some lines of transactions get updated on finalzed tables and some remain on the non finalize table during finalization process.<br />
<br />
Easiest way to slove this problem from user end is make a new entry, if user can do so and delete the non finalized and finalize from table and maintain session.<br />
<br />
Or, if batch is not modifiable, then you need to update tables or run the same process again.<br />

<br />
Basically this batch have the Sales Invoicing Transactions. I ask to delete the non finalised transaction and re-enter in another batch and try to finalise. <br />
<br />
Is it the correct way to updatation of the GLD books? Please suggest.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Indian</div><div class="date">21st August 2010, 08:50</div></div><div class="posttext">As you said, this is sales invocing batch. it means it cannot be modifiable from front end. since it is a sales invoicing batch that need to be update accordingly on table level like tfgld, tfacr, cisli tables bcoz it can effect your reports. So, try to update all tables first.<br />

<br />
The batch has been finalised. The Problem is due one Transaction have been found in the Table tfgld106. I correct that and re-start the finalisation run number.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of you, for your valuable input.<br />
