<br />
1. If it is Irregular / rare  or once per month: make a sales in source and Purchase in dest.<br />
<br />
2.Regular / huge Transaction per month :<br />
  Try EDI for doing the same<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
  make a Cust for Sales / Purchase . and store the PO against SO numbers in Cust tables for future ref.<br />

<br />
Let me explain little bit in detail.......<br />
<br />
There are two logistic companies one at Haryana (100) and other at UP (101)<br />
<br />
Raw material is purchsed at 101 company then it is transferred to 100 for further procsessing.<br />
<br />
Then finished good again send to 101 from 100 and sales has been done from 101 company</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">10th April 2009, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend EDI Sales-purchase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you ever thought about a multisite setup ? (one logistic company and multiple financial companies). In this case it´s a simple stock transfer. In your setup you need the purchase/sales orders.<br />
<br />

<br />
ups: I see that your question was regarding Baan IV. The Multisite setup that I had in mind is not possible with Baan IV. Sorry <br />
<br />
For ERP LN:<br />
All kind of financial transactions including tax calculations are done in the background. A prerequisition is a correct multisite setup. <br />
Multisite (specially single logistic, multi finance) in ERP LN is made for your problem. If installed and configured correctly it´s working very well. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nishant</div><div class="date">18th April 2009, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">HI,<br />
<br />
We are doing Inventory Transfer b/w two warehouses of two saperate EU belonging to different Financial companies (company Structure - SLMF), for which we have applied Taxes also.<br />
<br />
We have generated a Sales Invoice from the Ship From Warehouse (logistics company 111, financial company 111), the values are ACR is posted correctly with the tax amount.<br />
<br />
But when we are trying to generate Self Billing Invoice for the same transaction in Ship To Warehouse (Logistic Co. 111, Financial Company 121), only Basic Amount is posted, it is not considering the Tax Part.<br />
<br />
Please help me out, how can I get the completed amount with Taxes.<br />
<br />
(111 - Both)<br />
(121 - Finance)<br />
<br />
Thanx in Advance.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure will this work in your case, if not leave it. <br />
<br />
I understood from the scenario explained by u is, all distribution related Transactions (like Raw material purchase and Finished goods sales) are carried out in company 101 and Manufactuing (Processing) activities are carried out in company 100. <br />
<br />
so logically there is no sale transaction is happening instead job work is going on. <br />
<br />
 If this is true, create a production order for finished good in company 101and subcontract the operation (hope you know abt subcontracting master data setup) to the ohter logistic company and send the material through Delivery Challan (India Localisation). <br />
 In other hand recieve the material in company 100 against job work order and do the production process and send the finished good to 101 company. Raise the charges (costs for Processing) through Job work order.<br />
 <br />
 In Baan 4C4, India localization supports for this functionality. <br />
 <br />
