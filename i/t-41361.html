<br />
I have been in BaaN since 1996. It is very good product for manufacturing,projects,tools. other modules has light weight compare to SAP.<br />
BaaN Ln has improved lot. It is very easy to implement and customise it.<br />
Try BaaN LN demo from Infor.<br />
Concurrent based licences and cost effective others will have named users.<br />
<br />
Infor has lot of new products which can integrate your requirement.<br />
<br />
<br />
We all can expect good demand in 2 years. I predict...<br />
<br />
There is  a good demand in India &amp; Middle East ,Europe for BaaN Ln.<br />
<br />
I suggest baan user/developer/implementer not to switch to other ERP another 1 year. you will see good response from Infor.<br />
<br />
salary details 1- 3 years developer = 3000 t0 5000 $<br />
                  2-5  years Implementer = 4000 to 7000 $<br />
                    1-3 years key user 2500-4000 $  In Middle east/Europe<br />
for india 30-40% less<br />
<br />
Good Luck.<br />
