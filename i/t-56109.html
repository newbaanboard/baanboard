<br />
I am getting the Windows Socket Error 10053, when i do some modifications at the folder level and restart the shared memory.<br />
<br />
The only way to solve this is rebooting the server, but thats not a solution for a Production server.<br />
<br />
The other related error messages in the event viewer are <br />
<br />
997 (Overlapped I/O operation is in progress.)<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
Connection with server broken.<br />
<br />
The BW version that we are using is 8.4b.7 and Worktop is 2.5.2.<br />
And the portingset that we are operating is on 7.3a.06.<br />
<br />
I tried searching the forum, but nothing was quite helpful, so, if any one have any inputs that i can work out on can be of a great help.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<br />
There are many possible reasons for Windows socket error - some are as follows :<br />
<br />
1.An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine. <br />
(hint :Check your AV or any personal firewall or windows firewall.)<br />
<br />
2.The TCP/IP Connection was aborted by Windows. This was possibly due to a data transmission timeout or protocol error. <br />
<br />
3.The virtual circuit was terminated due to a time-out or other failure. The application should close the socket as it is no longer usable.<br />
<br />
I also found out sometime back that such errors can occur if there's not enough buffer <br />
for data in the underlying hardware.<br />
<br />
try increasing Virtual memory for the same.</div></div><hr />
