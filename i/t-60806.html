<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">6th July 2011, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I have setup ERP LN FP7 on Windows 2008r2 server with SQL2008 database (in vmware) and is working fine with worktop.<br />
<br />
I have tried several times (reverting to previous VM) to run the standard FP7 'server extenstions' CD to get webtop working but I can't get it to work.<br />
<br />
The install runs OK, but at the end the service will not work.  I have tried the following from the release notes:<br />
<br />
Known problems:  - After installing on Windows 2008 R2 and Windows 7, the service sometimes will not get started. To solve this run  <br />
\bin\uninstallTomcatService.bat  <br />
\bin\InstallTomcatService.bat  <br />
\bin\startService.bat<br />
<br />
<br />
but this doesnt make any different.  I have tried disabling the server firewall entirely, I have tried making sure JAVA_HOME is setup etc and I have tried to run the service with different user options - but nothing helps<br />
<br />
I gave up on the service and thought I'd try and get tomcat running from D:\Infor\ERPLN\ese\apache-tomcat-6.0.29\bin\startupTomcat.bat<br />
<br />
So this gets a little further, when I go to http://hostname:8312/webui<br />
I get the initial login with <br />
  Envirnonment<br />
  Username<br />
  Password<br />
it accepts the login, then it asks for a profile <br />
  [open] or [new] as necessary <br />
so when you get to the point of [open] and click it...<br />
you can the spinning wheel and 'loading' <br />
'last login .....' and that's it - it just hangs here for ages<br />
<br />
I had this working fine for previous installs of FP5 without any problems, any suggestions for this FP7 version?  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

In the summer, we were faced with the same problem, did not start the Tomcat service.<br />
The solution was in the files Tomcat.(The right files in attach)<br />
Not long ago, I installed the latest version of the WebUI (XH0100), the problem with the Tomcat service is no.</div></div><hr />
