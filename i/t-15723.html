<br />
In session Assign tables to database I saw that every table was assigned to Audit database, i changed this setup. and assinged only mandatory tables to audit and rest of the tables to Non-audit.<br />
<br />
Now i executed session ttaad4461m0000 Print Range of Audit Files and saw there were so much which report was showing because of intial setup.<br />
<br />
Now problem is when i went to purge the audit file and specified the right input field data it gave me report and the message it showed me was &quot;Cannot remove current sequence 000 of table 'cpcom000' and company '901' on host 'localhost' &quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
why is it unable to remove it ??? why does it shows &quot;local host &quot; in message ideally it should show my server name .... isn't it ??? <br />
<br />

why is it unable to remove it ???  <br />
The answer is obvious -<br />
You cannot remove current audit sequence number for a table.<br />
IF you really want to remove them, then you have do a manual delete of the files on OS and also remove the entries in the tools audit tables. I do not have access to the BaaN-IV system, I think the tables are different in BaaN-V to BaaN-IV. This would be a very big task to find the individual tables and files and remove them. If you have set them right now, I would ignore the other files/entries. If you tamper with them you can cause issues for table updates and get the following error -<br />
254  EAUDABORT <br />
 This indicates that a commit transaction has failed in the audit server. See the log.audit file for more information</div></div><hr />

Fine. But another question is when does baan automatically change the audit sequence no . ??? like if currently it is 000, when it will move to 001 ???<br />

<br />
check the $BSE/lib/audit_spec for the audit file size and the number of sequence numbers to be generated.<br />
A sample audit_spec file can look as follows:<br />
ttadv999:000:TOSEQ 99 FROMSEQ 000 MAXSEQSIZE 2M<br />
tt:000:seqreuse toseq 49 maxseqsize 1M<br />
tf:000:toseq 49 seqreuse maxseqsize 20K<br />
*:*:FROMSEQ 000 TOSEQ 499 MAXSEQSIZE 100K<br />
Refer to the administrator's or tools technical manual for Audit Management.</div></div><hr />
