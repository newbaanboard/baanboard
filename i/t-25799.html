<br />
If we develpe a customized session what should be incorporated to make it AFS compatible ??<br />
<br />
Presently I am having trouble in executing the localized session &quot;Calculate taxes after deliveries&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd December 2005, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not do anything special when I work on my customized sessions.  And I have run some afs code against a couple of them. Of course my sessions are simple compared to Baan sessions. The good thing is you can always debug your customized sessions to see why they do not work using AFS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">2nd December 2005, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's more what makes a session 'Uncompatible'.  A session following Baan best practices should be afs compatible.  Some have non-standard structures or commands that mess with the afs.  For example, any code calling end.program, abort.program, end() etc, will hang the AFS.  Code that hard programs the report options can mess with the AFS.  Important zooms at field levels, etc.  <br />
<br />
The best source for 'what can mess up an afs' is the Developer's Guide for Application Function Servers (Baan doc #U8233A), in the chapter for 'Guidelines for Baan 4GL application sessions', which tell you how to develop your own sessions that are afs friendly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">2nd December 2005, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, the API has a limit of a single report per session. If you have sessions that default to multiple reports, you will not be able to create a working AFS.<br />
<br />
Second, there is some behavior that doesn't jive with API. I cannot think of an example this early in the morning, but for that reason there is the if.api()/when.api() (something like that) command to use in your session that can make it behave differently depending on whether it is accessed through the GUI or the API.<br />
<br />
In the KB there is a spreadsheet with certified API compatible sessions.<br />
<br />
Of course that only applies if you use all the latest versions, but doing that would take all the fun out of it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">3rd December 2005, 02:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the issues that can make a session not suitable for AFS uses are:<br />
<br />
Message handling: Functions such as set.input.error(), choice.again() etc. can cause the session to cancel the requested action and therefore can only be used if a message is given, or must not be called in api.mode.<br />
<br />
Commands: If the session has more than one form, keep the form commands (standard and form specific) the same. AFS does not have a notion of current form.<br />
<br />
Hidden functionality: The AFS cannot reach functionality that is only accessible through zooming on field level. For example, if for a field the zoom-button is pressed, a menu is shown to maintain or display records.<br />
<br />
Execute(Â…) To help the end users, sometimes a choice is started automatically, for example, starting the add.set when no records are present. If the session runs in api.mode, starting choices automatically can result in undesired results.<br />

<br />
Now, at present I am stuck in executing the in5 (Indian localization) session &quot;Calculate taxes after deliveries&quot;. This session calculates the taxes for sales order lines for which the deliveries have been done by refering the tdsls040, tdsls041, tdsls045 and other master table and populates the tdsls901 table. The out put is a simple error report which is only printed if there is any error.<br />
<br />
It seems that the values which I am passing to the form fields are not reflecting on the form. What could be causing this ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">3rd December 2005, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">api.mode is a variable of type long. You can use like a boolean. It is true when the session is called by AFS and false if not. Very helpfull if i.e. you have in non AFS-mode some interaction with the user but in AFS mode you want to use a default decission. It is like background or jobmode (forgotten the correct name of the var). The declaration of the var is in a standard include that is linked to every session.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
