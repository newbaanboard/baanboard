<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt whether BaaN's QMS module adheres to FDA regulations. Many people in India use it but crib about its limitations like only one reading can be maintained for one test etc. Some customers have even gone for the source code customization. I too want to know abt the integration with other products.<br />
