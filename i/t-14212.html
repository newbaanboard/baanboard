The reason is non-availability of India localisation for BaaN V (atleast this is the last available information available to me).<br />
<br />
I believe BaaN wants one customer to agree on BaaN V for BaaN to start the localisation on the other hand the customer will want a localisation first. Chicken and egg situation.<br />
<br />
I would like to hear from others if there is an update to this.<br />

As per the information given by BaaN India , New Delhi representative to us , the new company in U.S. , which has bought BaaN recently is going to bring in BaaN VI ( Also known as Gemini ) software world-wide by the year 2005 . So ,we in India can look forward to stright to BaaN VI , since we can upgrade our present BaaN IV to BaaN VI system . <br />
<br />
It seems they have abandoned the idea of localisation of BaaN V in India for this reason . They r concentrating on Gemini , which , we were told is more powerful &amp; has a flexible option of buying in seperate modules like Mfg,Distribution etc .&amp; implement them seperately .<br />
<br />
