<br />
thanks for replying. Well could you please tell me the session code for this report &quot;CHECK TO INSTALL &quot;. I could not find any session under PMC.<br />
<br />
R u taking about session ttpmc2203s000 Check Solution to Install ??? If yes, then in the report output I could not find anything strange or missing.<br />
<br />
I am herewith attaching report output for ttpmc2203s000.<br />
<br />
One more thing , I tried installing sp14 ( tools ) and it got installed with no problem. I don't know why the problem is with sp13 ( Application ) and with sch1 sp13 ????<br />
<br />
I am badly struck up.<br />

<br />
the lignes saying &quot;Not Available&quot; are causing the problems. Those Patches you have to download and scan in first because they are Co-requisite to the patch that you are trying to install now.<br />

But I'll give you a hint, Why would you have cnt, mcr, nas, scc<br />
on your system and not patch them?<br />

<br />
Well, when i started working on the system, found that all the extensions were already installed. .... that's why these cnt, mcr are exisitng which i don't need actually.<br />
<br />
now situation is i just want to install only standard supply chain &amp; is5 i.e. Indian Localisation with supply chain.<br />
<br />
1) My first doubt is if someone is a co-requisite , is it neccsary to install that also. ... i though only pre-requistes are only necessary.<br />
<br />
2) Can i un-install extensions now ??? if i try to delete the extension related PVRC it doesn't allow me to do so.<br />
<br />
How should i go about it ??<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) If they wouldn't be necessary the installation would most likely have worked without problems.<br />
<br />
2) As far as I know you cannot uninstall entire Update VRC's<br />
<br />
Fazit) Download those patches, even if you won't need them.<br />
<br />
