I have switched from BaaN Iv to LN ERP. I find there is a great difference between the two product. I want to keep in touch with all those who are working and getting new features explored in LN envirnment.<br />
<br />
Presently I have the following doubts:<br />
<br />
1. What is this dual accounting system in COA? I feel we should create only statutory a/c.<br />
2. What types of Ledger a/c we should check the GL Matching flag.<br />
3. What types of Ledger a/c we should check the Integration flag. Will this include even the interim a/c?<br />
4. How the field Cash Flow Reason be used and for which type of a/c? Is this for Cash and Bank a/c only?<br />
5. How the Invoicing Method is used in Finance?<br />
<br />

1. What is this dual accounting system in COA? I feel we should create only statutory a/c.<br />
you should create statutory a/c for legal purpose. But if you want pararel reporting, for example, for fixed assets, you can define complementary accounts<br />
<br />
<br />
2. What types of Ledger a/c we should check the GL Matching flag.<br />
for accounts that you need the final balance was 0. For example clearing accounts.<br />
<br />
3. What types of Ledger a/c we should check the Integration flag. Will this include even the interim a/c?<br />
the accounts that you use in mapping sheme</div></div><hr />

I am Arup working in LN in India. U are from which co? in India? <br />
<br />
1. Dual a/c ing system is a&gt; statuory b&gt;complimentory. If u maintain 2 sets of books ie one for statury purpose &amp; discloures &amp; the other for internal discloures ie if there are some portion of a particular exp u do not want to disclouse in public then u can use the complimentary set of books the particular ledger will show the full balance in the complimentary books while in the statutory books it wiill show only the net figure. ie complimentary = statury + the extra exp<br />
<br />
2. In Ln those that are used as integration a/cs cannot be used mannually. U will have to open shadow a/cs for mannuall entries. interim a/cs will have to be integration a/cs.<br />

<br />
I am in Mumbai, India. Can you give an example of Statutory ledger account and complementary ledger a/c. Can we use all interim account used in integration as complementary ledger account? <br />
<br />
Suppose some rectification entries required using integration ledger a/c, how this will be done as you can not pass any jv directly in finance?<br />
<br />
As rgds Cash flow reason...for which type of ledger a/c this field should be ticked..is it for only cash a/cs, BPs????<br />
<br />
Also share your problems and solutions as well<br />

However one normally does not use the complimentary set of a/c they normally stick to statury set of a/cs . U will, under normal curcomstances will use only one trial at a time.<br />
<br />
As per the cash flow reason , if u want certain future expenses to appear in ur cash flow statement like unpaid exp for that matter, filling up the cash flow reason would help. neverthe less whereevercashflow  reason is not filled the system will generate error msg &amp; will make u fill the same at the time of the entry itself. IT is only in the case of SP 1 . With SP 0 there are no cash flow reason.<br />
<br />
No LN 6.1 does not allow mannual entries for integration a/cs U will have to open shadow a/c s for the same. otherwise at the time of entry u will not get the a/cs when u zoom in for the COA.<br />
