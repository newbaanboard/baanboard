<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jan van dillen</div><div class="date">9th June 2006, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen this error when one invoice results in more than 32.000 tfgld410 records. In that case Baan aborts the database transaction and gives the mentioned error message.<br />
You should have a look at Baan solution 9316:<br />
After printing invoices, an attempt to Process the Delivered Sales Orders results in an error message similar to &quot;Invoice line could not be written to Finance for order 410275 line 960.&quot; <br />
You could check in tdsls045 how many sales order lines are linked to the sales invoice. If there are a few thousand sales order lines linked to the sales invoice, this could be the cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
I think the best way to solve this issue is to run the session tdcor4404m000 for the invoice that gave the error, change the value of the field maximum invoice lines to for example 8000 (this value depends on the number of tfgld410 records created per sales order line) in the session 'Maintain Performance boosters' (tcmcs0197m000) and print the sales invoice again. <br />
Please note that this will result in a gap in your invoice numbering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nilesh.bhosale</div><div class="date">14th June 2006, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Typically this error is thrown when there is a mismatch in amounts from tables tdsls045 &amp; tdsls901 due to improper updation of tables. You need to go into Change price &amp; discount &amp; tab through all the fields to rectify the updation error. Since Print sales invoice is done, to open the sales order line sequence from 'Change Price &amp; Discount', you need to delete the transaction type from tdsls045 through GTM. <br />
<br />
Tab through all the fields from 'Change price &amp; discount' &amp; revert the change made in tdsls045 &amp; execute the PDSO.<br />
<br />
THis message is followed by a error display where you can identify the error line showing amount as #########.</div></div><hr />

PDSO can be executed when sales order is in the status of PDSO &amp; record of the sales order line sequence is present in tdsls049.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haripra</div><div class="date">27th June 2006, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue was resolved by verifying the amounts in tdsls901,there was a variation of amount of 0.01 in 4 records. The Order was Processed once this difference wasrectified through GTM.<br />
<br />
