<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">25th October 2004, 02:51</div></div><div class="posttext">The new product has been released for some time now and there seems to be a fair amount of documentation available on the support site.<br />
<br />
Asside from the hand-full of beta test sites (who have special arrangements/connections with SSA) I am keen to know if there are many customers who presently have the software and/or are in the process of upgrading to this new version. <br />
<br />
I find it to be very strange/errie that there have been no indications to date of sites installing the new version or of any real interest in obtaining and using the product.  <br />
<br />
Form my experience with SSA (which is addressed in recent threads here) it is clear that SSA were very reluctant to provide substantive information despite the fact that I have subsequently been able (with the help of some posts here) to download a lot of manuals from the support site.   <br />
<br />
In our case SSA were not, but should have been, forthright in pointing out the  omission of &quot;Process Mfg&quot; and &quot;Containerized Items&quot; from LN6.1, both of which we make considerable use.   It should also be pointed out that the local Baan operation did not provide any information (other than a one page chart) until an overseas executive became involved. <br />
<br />
Please share your knowledge of status of LN6.1 implementation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you. We are on Process Mfg like you and use Containerisation extensively. All our queries to BaaN have resulted in late and incomplete information provided reluctantly.  In addition for India there is still no clarity/commitment from BaaN on localisation for LN 6.1. <br />
<br />
As far as we see there is nothing in LN 6.1 for Process Mfg Companies. BaaN says (not directly) that they can map most of the process functionality from IVc4 on to LN6.1, but will that be enough ?<br />
<br />
Our options seem to be 1. To continue with IVc4 (and hope for the best) or 2. Move over to other options (Oracle ?, SAP?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">25th October 2004, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Again additional evidence of the same communication problems as indicated in earlier posts regarding LN6.1.<br />
When will BAAN ever learn to communicate properly with the outside world?<br />
This is not how SSA will become successful to prevent BAAN customers moving away to other ERP packages when time has come for replacements.<br />
<br />
But, perhaps SSA's only intention is to create a new hype around BAAN so their shares can sell for a higher price at the introduction on Nasdaq later this year.<br />

They have a huge potential of migrating all customers below b40_c4 to LN6.1 and still there is no evidence this is handled in a professional way that has been thought through into a great level of detail.<br />
BAAN has always been keen on bringing in new customers and then at the same time forgot treating the existing customers.<br />

The issue here is not new sales with new clients. It is doing new business with your installed base.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">27th October 2004, 02:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that news of the of the NL6.1 sale 5 weeks ago to ELTON, is not good news at all.  If this product were going anywhere SSA would be able to report 100's of sales and upgrades.  Furthermore this would be splashed across the media hailed as a second-coming.<br />
<br />
Interesting figures would be: &quot;How many new-site SSA ERP's (all versions) have been been sold  this year-to-date and the total number of new licence seats for those sales&quot;. I think I could count comfortably without having to take my shoes off (or my other glove).  <br />
<br />
Like it or not, I don't think we can cast any aspersions at SSA for their actions with the Baan product.  They picked it up for a song and plan to harvest the ongoing licence/support cash stream. As customers work out that they could do with out the support charge or they should upgrade to a different package, then SSA will give them the upgrade to the latest/greatest technology LN6.1 instead and perhaps even sell few more licences and some other modules not covered by their licence, but keep them for a while longer. I think that's the business they are in with all their products. They make no secret of it, in fact they are very forthright about it. <br />
<br />
We need to come to grips with the fact that Baan or SSA ERP is not a main stream package of the ilk of SSA, ORACLE, Peoplesoft etc. and will never be.<br />
<br />
I know that there are hundreds of us who &quot;know&quot; the capabilities etc of the software and who want to argue that the software is of the same ilk. Unfortunately it takes more than the programs to make a product.  Baan's market price was $130 million, Peoplesoft's is around $7 billion etc. <br />

We are another Process mgt company in IVc4. I was at the BWU conference last week and according to SSA CEO there will be a &quot;process extension&quot; for  LN. There was also a conference specifically to process and we were about 13 process companies. Beth Berndt was the presenter, she seems to understand the very peculiar issues with process industries and what she (SSA) is trying to get from us (customers) is functional requirements to improve/solve some of our existing problems with the system. But I agree with you on the lack/not that efficient ways to communicate with SSA customers.<br />
<br />
I am very optimistic. I think these are better news than 2 years ago, when Invensys had nothing to say, well other than... we can help you migrate to Protean... wow!<br />

My company and me felt very positive about presentations. Baan IV, V to LN migration presentation also very impressive. Hope for the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">29th October 2004, 00:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Now we are getting to the second part of the whole situation.<br />
<br />
As mraguthu points out correctly SSA is communicating to existing customers and I personally believe the intentions of SSA are good.<br />
But at the same time they do not seem to realize that in North America only 200 BAAN customers out of about 1,800 BAAN customers are a member of BWU Americas. That is only 11% and so 89% of all existing BAAN customers in North America are not a member and did not attend the BWU conference in Montreal.<br />
This is exactly the point I am trying to make and I am very interested how SSA believes they can get these messages accross to the &quot;other&quot; 89%.<br />
Predators like Microsoft are gearing up to zoom in to the ones that feel left behind. I attended a meeting of Microsoft Business Solutions in NL last week and it is amazing to see the potential they recognize in ERP replacement markets.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">29th October 2004, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the discussuion on this thread has highlighted four very important issues. three of which we are still not much closer to understanding SSA's position.<br />
1) The one issue that we do have some understanding of is that the product does not have the IVc4 &quot;Process&quot; functionality. Notwhithstanding that Rosalba reported that the SSA-CEO indicated that a process extension would be available. SSA have previously said that this functionality will be covered with their &quot;other&quot; ERP stream (AS400 - BPCS/PRMS). Furthermore CEO's sometimes make a living of using Poilitic-speak (promising things that never actually happen) when they are performing before a crowd.<br />
2) SSA are Communicating very poorly with existing customers. Whilst BWU and other user groups around the globe welcome the opportunity to hear from SSA, they do provide a friendly captive audience of users to whom promotional messages can be presented very cheaply. However, as Edwin points out they only represent a small proportion of user companies.  Considering that we are mostly looking at replacing a software version and implementation that is at probably more than 5 years old and now very stable, the usefulness of usergroups is no where near as high as for new implemenations. <br />
3) SSA's underlying strategy and approach to making the product available is not entirely clear.  Is it their intention to provide the software and migration tools so that cutomers and/or their specialst consultants can upgrade their installations on they own accord,  or do they intend to sell highly-prices consulting and conversion services.     <br />
4) Despite the BWU conference, we still have now soild evidence of customers (other than beta test friends) who have actually got the software and have either upgraded or are in the process of doing so.  I think this is very telling and indicates that something is very wrong or at least doesn't add-up. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, if the software was intended to be available to loyal customers who have been paying a very high support fees for years so that they would be entitled to upgrade software, then we should be able to see/hear a lot of evidence of these people testing and migrating.  <br />
<br />
I think there must be 100's of installations, my company included, who are eager to use the software and would begin migration projects right-away if it were feasible and did not mandate additional SSA charges. The fact that we do not see this happening leads me to think that SSA's strategy is to use this &quot;hyped-up&quot; product to sell product extensions and expensive consulting/migration services.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kevobr</div><div class="date">29th October 2004, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Terry check out SSA results for last quarter. Claim 71 new SSA global customers out of 662 new software licenses signed.<br />
So not too bad.<br />
<br />
I think the reason for SSA not appearing to communicate with existing customers fro 6.1 is that the migration tools arn't available yet.<br />
So hopefully when these are ready we should see a flurry of contact with existing customers.<br />
<br />
<br />
The most encouraging thing from SSA results is that Gross Margin is substantial, which shows that financially SSA are in a good position offering customers some stability and confidence with the ownership of Baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">30th October 2004, 05:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Kevobr<br />
<br />
Thanks for the pointer. I have checked out the link which is only a couple of days old. <br />
<br />
It is good to see that SSA appears to be doing well. I hope you don't get the wrong impression. I have been hoping that SSA would save Baan but  that they have had it for 15 months now and I can't see a lot of change yet.  The LN6.1 product was developed by Baan and it included migration tools for baan versions.  All I can see is that SSA have done so far is: they have revamped the Baan documentation to put the new logos on it.  I  can't see and certainly haven't experienced any improvement in their communication with or in their attitude toward existing customers.<br />
<br />
If SSA were having trouble in developing migration tools, why not be open, honest etc and announce or proclaim that? Perhaps even put extra gloss around it.  My hunch is that this is not the real reason at all. I can't imagine a set of tools (that baan already had) that could take that long to design and program.            <br />
<br />
As for the 71 new customers and additional 662 licences. The article does not say what software the new customers have bought - Baan is just a small part of their ERP line-up.  Similarly with the new licences. Compare this number to the number that a company like Boeing has. 662 is a very small number for licences.  The article does not say how many existing customers have for whatever reason left them nor does it give the net licence figure which may be a lot more telling. The net licence figure would reflect the many situations where customers are continuing with Baan IV/ Manman/x etc but only in a Legacy way (ie: keep the system for historical reference and or system change-over etc).  My opinion is that if the number of new customers and/or licences for Baan or ERP NL was more than a embarrassingly small  handful they would be very quick to announce that new signups.  <br />
<br />
As for the dollar numbers, it is certainly good to see that SSA are profitable. Whilst I do not particularly want them to focus on high Gross Margin, the figures indicate that the margin is down a bit on the previous year (66.9% vs 71.4%). <br />
<br />
One item of disappointmant in their figures is that while the figures for revenue from Support and Services are listed separatley the figures for cost of revenue have been concealed. Now I can certainly be wrong, but my hunch is that this agregation hides a very high profit from either Support or Services.     <br />
 <br />
Another item of disappointment in the figures is that there is a massive change in tax provision from one year to the next (18.9 expense this year from 10.6 benefit last year). All these factors together resulted in fairly stable Cash Provided From Operations figure (Too stable to my programmers' mind, I seems to me that when one sort of number goes one way there are always other numbers that just happen to more the other way in an entirely unrelated but compensatory way - the result a bit like Newtons 3rd law)<br />
<br />
I think these figures are for accountants and it depends on whether the accountant is from inside trying to keep the investment company happy or whether the accountant is from outside looking to price an invenstment proposal. <br />
<br />
My conclusion: Could it be the accountants who are holding back on the software and not allowing communicating ?   What ever the reasons; I still know no more about what SSA are up to with the Baan product than I did a year ago.  <br />

<br />
Last week the BUC Baan User Club Switzerland and customers were invited to the official launch event of SSA ERP LN in Switzerland.<br />
<br />
We had some in-depth sessions of functions and features of LN. We were all very impressed, because we saw (and think) that Baan/SSA did a step forward with LN.<br />

Migration Projects<br />
=============<br />
In Germany are 5 customers with migration projects to LN:<br />
- Brill Gartengeräte (50 User) http://www.brill.de/<br />
- Telair (Baan 5 to LN)  http://www.telair.com<br />
- Becker Antriebe (110 User, multi site)  http://www.becker-antriebe.de/<br />
- VW Versuchsbau (600 User; to Baan 5.2 &#8222;Reger&#8220; = SSA ERP LN)<br />
<br />
- Nederlands: 2 customers<br />
- England: 1 customer<br />
- Iberische Halbinsel: 1 customer <br />
- Boeing (from Baan V to LN, building the 7E7 &quot;Dream Liner&quot;)  http://www.boeing.com/commercial/7e7/flash.html<br />
<br />
<br />
Modules<br />
======<br />
The service module is very new and expanded. They said one customer will migrate to LN because the service modul.<br />

<br />
I did have to take my other glove off though as the count is getting near 10.  (I think Telair was announced in July.)<br />
<br />
What will also be very interesting to learn is just how much work is involved and especially whether the new data-model can be built automatically with the tools and how fast the conversion is.    <br />
<br />
I am particualy keen to learn if the DB migration for fairly large databases can happen overnight. Or whether the virtues of data cleansing and archiving are put forward with religious vigour to justify the length of time the migration takes. (Many may prefer to preseve historical data on devices whose capacity and speed is ever increasing and whose cost is ever decreasing). <br />

<br />
We are using Baan IV c4 and think that it is quite stable. But with news of SSA bringing out LN, I am intrigued to find answers to the following queries :<br />
<br />
1. If we have to move to LN in future, how is migration path ? Does it involve a lot of effort as was with moving from versions like Triton ? What effort (time frame) would a normal migration involve? What about customisations ? Would their migration be easy ?<br />
<br />
2. What is the technology platform and middleware of LN ?<br />
<br />
3. Would IV c4 be supported in future or eventually (which I sense), every existing customer would have to move to LN.<br />
<br />
Information from experienced members would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">15th November 2004, 00:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Ramna,<br />
<br />
If you do a search on this topic I think you will find a lot of disscussion threads/replies but no first hand stories or even evidence of the migration process. <br />
 <br />
As to your specific questions: (3) IVc4 it seems will be supportted for a long while to come (many years). (2) The technology platform is the same. If using Web interface then probably need a Web sever like Appache.  (1) These questions have all been posed here -- some people who sound as it they are Baan/SSA employees (one of whom has corresponded with me off line) have been very defensive with answers to some of the fairly provocative questions/remarks.<br />
<br />
My impressions are that whilst SSA are more or less legally bound to provide the upgrade software at no cost, they will make it compulsory to use their expensive professional services for migration and implementation.  There is  no evidence or indication for that matter, of any customer who has undertaken the migration process without SSA involment. <br />
<br />
Furthermore there is no evidence that the software is freely available (ie: that SSA will provide without it without first getting a Professional Services contract.) <br />
<br />
Because IVc4 is such a good product and its functionality is more than adequate for most of its customers, there is no real incentive for SSA to provide the new product. The IVc4 support revenue is extremely lucrative and the amount of support effort required is miniscule in relation to the very large revenue. It would be counter-productive for SSA (in terms of their P&amp;L) to make it easy to move to the new product without significant additional charges/revenue. (The new product would incurr additional support requirements until it reaches the level of stability/maturity that IVc4 has.) <br />
<br />
Until such times as the IVc4 support renewals drop off I don't see SSA being eager to provide the new version without some other fairly significant additional revenue from individual customers by way of professional services or very large orders for other software or additional licences. (It is a clearly and proudly  stated tenet of their business approach to grow the revenue from each customer.) <br />

One piece of info that I was interested in was the takeup so far around the globe. It seems that 54 sites have already installed it and another 120 sites  are in various stages of implementation. <br />
<br />
Still very small numbers in my book considering that this release is getting toward 9 months old and also considering that a sizable portion of the 54 installed sites would have been with the beta release (especially as SSA see themselves in the number 3 spot of tier 1).<br />
<br />
I need to digest and confirm some other areas covered over the two days but it is still evident that SSA are concentrating on milking the existing customers with the LN migrations and compulsory professional services rather than growing the customer base with new names.    <br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your information and keep us informed after you have been able to digest the rest.<br />
<br />
Right now it is obvious that SSA is not screaming from every roof top that they have this wonderful new product, ERP LN 6.1,  and that they are agressively looking for new customers.<br />
One can argue whether this strategy will keep the company alive in the next five years. We have already seen that SSA does not have the creative people to generate new business with new clients so the only way to grow for them is to buy more ERP vendors (and hence milk more customers).<br />
<br />
However, if this is their choice then so what?<br />
In case they remain just the number 3 in the market place without growing (and potentially shrinking) they will get what they deserve.<br />
In the end only SAP and Microsoft will dominate the ERP market around the globe.<br />

Terry, Just wondering, is there any option to take minimum services from SSA for migration, and get other help from independent consultants. I bet there might be many good Independant baan Migration consultants, probably better skillsets than &quot;SSA Professional services&quot; and may be at half the cost!!.<br />
I am surprised to hear 54 customer got migrated and never came across any recruitment ads for baan migration consultant??. Its worth a look in that directions.<br />

<br />
(1) I can't answer that but there are many of us who are looking for that approach. Especially the many sites with internal baan/systems expertise and who also have the domain knowelge redily available. The need for any external help could be minimal. It would certainly be reasonable to pay SSA for some tailored DB migration aids.<br />
 <br />
(2) I am not sure that you can claim to be better than SSA until the technical information becomes available to enable a professional to execute the migration.  Competition is fine but it has to be fair. I think it is to easy for small and/or low wage offshore people to appear to undercut SSA SSA are entitled to a premium.<br />
 <br />
(3) There is nothing to say that the 54 were migrated -- some may be fresh installs and most were probably beta installs done a couple of years ago. Furthermore many of them may be for same companies (eg:Telaire). Also if they were done in different parts of the world then you may not expect to hear.  Similarly with the 120, a large number of these will be attributable to some of the large multi-sit companies represented on this forum.  Both very small numbers in my book for a release 9 months (2 years) old <br />

<br />
If I am not mistaken, then only SSA employess get the migration tools to do a migration in the first place. This means, that neither an external consultant nor the customer alone will be allowed to do the migration.<br />
<br />
This is in line with SSA trying to grab as much as possible of the consulting and customization revenue of the existing customer base.<br />

(B) For us externals it means: Enjoy Baan as long as you can...<br />
<br />
(A) This certainly seems to be their aim from what I learned from discussion on this forum, other internet forums and directly from SSA people.  However there are certainly some very large users resident in the USA and who participate very actively on the board who have very high levels of baan-expertise (which they freely share with us) and who have internal projects for LN.  I expect that SSA would do anything these customers ask,  irrespective of what general policies Mr Greenougsk sets for others to adhere to.     <br />
<br />
I think we need to bear in mind that very little migration has/is being done so far around the world. So the level of LN expertise within SSA is not much more than could be obtained by reading all of the documentation available to us on the support site. They will have access to some other internal documentation and access to source code on their demo systems, but the level of technical expertise in the many &quot;sales branches&quot; around the world should not be expected to be very high. <br />
<br />
The obvious reasons for this are (1) Success breeds success and vice versa. Both SSA and Baan are failed entities and the cream-of-the-crop moved to successful entities. (2) SSA is running in bean-counter mode. All decisions are dictated by an old fashioned, british-style charted-account/administrator who drives all decisions with predetermined budget rules. (This is not what made IBM, Microsoft or Oracle successful)  (3) The primary purpose of Sales operations is to make sales (Make them thirsty and not cure the thirst) The technical people who's job it is to support the sales professionals may be better be described as semi technical and either sales aspirant/discard.  (4) Mr G's present obsession will be to getting the special cash dividend from the IPO.  If that works he may try for another and if he pulls that one off who knows where he may go then and what will become of SSA.     <br />
<br />
(B) I think the same applies to us all. Externals, Customers and as a consequence: Internals.  I am with one of the largest and most fully implemented of their Baan customers in this distant part of the world (Australia) and it is now almost a forgone conclusion that we will &quot;unplug&quot; within the next year or two.  This is due in no way to the performance or functionality of Baan software or to our assessment of LN but to the antics of SSA-Global in encouraging all baan users to stay on the old stable versions (mostly IVc) that cost nothing to support but provide a lot of &quot;milch&quot;. They do this by playing-up the vitues of the old stable versions and playing down the fact that the UI and software is now very old and making the migration path so expensive that it is not be easily cost justifiable.  (Incidentally if I were say that their local support performance has been abysmal I would in effect be complimenting them to some extent.) <br />
<br />
I have a lingering hope that when the Mr G and his buddies get their cash out with IPO's, SSA may be run more like a software company and we can all live happily ever after.<br />

<br />
At present we have Baan IV c4. We have customer and supplier master defined in the system and used in various modules of the software. We have Supplier codes and Customer codes which are similar, although they are not related to each other. Since the supplier and customer master are two different tables in Baan IV c4 they were defined so and available for the past 10 years (starting from Triton 3.0).<br />
<br />
Since in Baan 6 (even in 5) Business partners is common to define suppliers and customers, how can this be mapped? How can the coding be handled in such cases where the codes are the same? Since we are interested in going to Baan 6, we are curious about this issue.</div></div><hr />

Dear jmathew<br />
<br />
During the migration process there is a mapping between customer/supplieres and the new business partners.<br />
<br />
Old Customers: 100, 101, 102, ...<br />
Old Supplieres: 100, 101, 102, ...<br />
<br />
In the mapping definition you could define how be a new businesspartner:<br />
cust --&gt; add a &quot;C&quot; before the old number<br />
supp --&gt; add a &quot;S&quot; before the old number<br />
<br />
After migration:<br />
Business partners: C100, C101, C102, S100, S101, S102, ...<br />
<br />
I think you can also do some calculation during the mapping, like &quot;Business partners for supp: add 100 to the old one, business partners for the cust add 300 the old one&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
There are some documentation about this issues:<br />

<br />
You did explain the prefixes very well.<br />
However, adding 100 to the old code is not possible during migration.<br />
<br />
One addition to the prefixes:<br />
After defining the prefixes, you can already generate the new codes in a kind of mapping table (still in the Baan IV system). In that mapping table you wil find the old code and the new code. When you are not satisfied with the new code, you can always change it manually.</div></div><hr />
