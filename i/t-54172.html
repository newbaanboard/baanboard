   Its not necessary to have the password of user baan as baan itself. You can have any other password. <br />
Why have you left the sql admin username password blank? <br />
When you installed SQL, did you leave it blank? Is the SQL Server service running? <br />
What user have you logged onto the server as? <br />
If the user (that you logged on) is &quot;baan&quot; then is the password that you gave at login time the same as the password you mentioned in the setup? <br />
The user with which you have logged on to the server, does it have access to your sql server (is it an admin user)?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thaykhov</div><div class="date">6th November 2008, 01:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All after numerous checking and rechecking, btw I am following the Infor installation guides, it told me to leave the sa password blank,<br />
<br />
once again binary order is correct. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">6th November 2008, 08:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
   Thought you already mentioned in your earlier post that you had selected binary order. <br />
W.r.t sa password:<br />
Regardless of what Infor Installation Guide tells you, its not a safe practice to leave your sa password blank. Anyone with a bit of knowledge about how to setup connection strings to your database could easily get hold of any database they want to. <br />
