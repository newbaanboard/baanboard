<br />
I am having problem with purchase order AFS.<br />
<br />
                                1) Purchase order header AFS works fine.<br />
                                2) We are on IN3.When we put delivery date in 1st form of po session tdind0270s000 pops up. using AFS this session also works fine with no error except i have got no data in localized form. I don't know where AFS saves data. I try to track it and found that document type (tdextr) returns 0 insted of 13 (purchase order)and there is no provision to put doc. type. somewhare i will have to put docu. type but don't know where ?<br />
<br />
both code and dll are attached.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th November 2003, 22:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Do a ttstpcreatdll on tdind0270s000 and see what it gives you for fields. You maybe able to just do a put on tdind0270s000. When I have some problems I usually run ttstpcreatdll on the session just to see what it says I can do. For some reason tdpur4101m000 may not be passing all of the fields to the sub-session.  I know on my inventory adjustment function server I had to put the item and do a find to get one of the sub-sessions to work - when doing it manually the correct item and sequence came up.  If you have source you may be able to fix it.<br />

1)I had already posted code and dll within attachment.<br />
2)I do not have source code.<br />
<br />
my concern is when i put for Purchase order and zoom to localized session it shoud pass corrct document type though the same session(tdind0270s000) is used in all loocalized header sessions i.e for sales &amp; purchase related sessions ;selection is on the basis of document type only.So it must work.<br />
<br />
but i don't know why its not working.<br />
<br />
if you see the dll and code you will understand what i am talking about.<br />
<br />
waiting for reply !!!<br />

:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded it at home last night and missed the library.  The problem is I do not know where &quot;docu.type&quot; is set - and this is not in my code for tdpur4101.  Using API does not always fire off all the events so it is probably not getting set. From looking at the library it appears to be a display only type field. Without source I do not think I can help.  I have used qkey in the past to get some variables set and passed to sub-routines, but I did have some code to look at just to have some idea of what needed to change.<br />
<br />
You could try to put the field anyway, just to see what happens.  You could also try setting docu.type in your function server just to see if the tdind0270s000 session might import it.  Again without source it is really hard to make suggestions.<br />

<br />
I tried  out to  put  docu.type  and order no. then i find record in tdind0270s000 its return 1. Then i put other records. then update it. save+update returns 0 with no error in afs log. strange !!!<br />
<br />
I wonder no one from india ever tried out AFS of localized sessions.<br />
<br />
waiting........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th November 2003, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it seems like docu.type is definetly not making it to the sub-session.  Unless Baan support would be willing to help the only other suggestion I have is to use something like the Baan extend source posted by ~Vamsi in the code and utilities forum.  Then you could export docu.type from tdpur4101m000 and import in the tdind session when api.mode is true.  It may take some playing with the sessions to get it to work, but I think it is possible.<br />
