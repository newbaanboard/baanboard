<br />
Has anyone been able to obtain it recently, perhaps this is just a problem in the UK.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Your request about BCK keeps popping up. The reason that we are not shipping<br />
BCK is because we are phasing it out. Official announcements are in<br />
preparation. The main reason for phasing out the product is that it serves a<br />
purpose that is no longer valid in the way BCK is dealing with it. <br />
<br />
This means we are only going to allow the use of BCK if the dependency is<br />
known or if there is a custom situation that cannot be dealt with another<br />
product from the iBaan suite. <br />
<br />
BCK has no official successor. What we find is that in most cases the iBaan<br />
OpenWorld Suite will be able to cope with it. <br />
<br />
Please let me know if you would like to know more about this or OpenWorld.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very recently a client of us in India got it from Baan.<br />
<br />
Very unfortunate, indeed!<br />
<br />
I would also like to know if Baan is following this policy worldwide...<br />
<br />
Anyone having similar experience??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">5th April 2002, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Good.  The BCKit is a headache.  I was in a team testing it for a few months and we found SOOOOO many bugs and limitations with it's connection to the Scheduler/Execution.<br />
<br />
There ITK kit will replace the BCKit, and OpenWorld replaces ITK. <br />
<br />
We recently saw the ITK in action and it looked much better than the BCKit.  You get to use standard Baan instead of having the BCI extension and all those extra fields!  But again, there was no volume testing and only a limited amount of functional testing.<br />
<br />
OpenWorld 2.0 was supposed to replace the ITK, but Baan has not said that it supports the scheduler interface yet.  They might give a date for GA release, but you just know that they won't meet it (and if they do, you have to be crazy to use it within the first 6 months).<br />
<br />
OpenWorld is supposed to be a &quot;technical upgrade&quot; from ITK and is supposed to have a lot of ITK in it to begin with.  That's all the news that I have though.</div></div><hr />
