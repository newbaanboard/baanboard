Also just run Create Tables for the tools package then log out and then login and check again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you need to restore the file $BSE/tools/dd/dttaad/dttaad260 from before the update. Then you can log in again and do the &quot;Create RTDD Tools/ES&quot; with &quot;Dump Data Definitions&quot;.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

I was hoping you did a backup before the update. Do you have a backup ? If yes your admin should be able to help you with this. I can not.<br />
If this solution update was done on the test server (I hope so!) you could also copy the file from the live server and replace it. <br />

We installed LNUI(FP 10.4) with windows server 2012 and SQL Server 2012 Standard edition. After this we installed Indian Localisation also.  We created  2 companies one is related to stnd  &amp; one is related to localisation , created same users &amp;  installed monthly solutions  also. Up to that the system is working fine . After that we installed tools solutions, did  Convert to Runtime. Whenwe are trying to re-login , we are  getting the attached error. <br />

I think the tools solution that you installed is incomplete or just wrong,You probably need to restore your old state of your system from somewhere. Is there a Backup of your system?<br />
<br />
I would strongly advise taking help from Infor on this matter<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lebowski</div><div class="date">28th March 2016, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">What happened is that the data dictionary file ($BSE/tools/dd/dttaad/dttaad260) and the table ttaad260000 in the database are out of sync because you didnt check the &quot;dump data definition&quot; switch.<br />
<br />
What you could do: edit the data dictionary file so that it is in sync again with the database table, then log in and then do the create RTDD for enterprise server with &quot;dump data definitions&quot;.<br />
<br />
The data dictionary file is a plain text file and you can delete the entries that the error message indicates (desc, catg, etc.) but you should know what you do and make a backup of the file before you start. <br />
<br />
Consulting Infor is also not a bad idea !<br />
<br />
Have a nice day,<br />
