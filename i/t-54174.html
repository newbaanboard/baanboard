When we do production subcontracting, we generate a purchase order and also send the materials along with the purchase order to the subcontractor. When the subcontractor completes the task and sends back the material, the purchase receipt is made and also the production operation is completed.<br />
<br />
In a similar scenario like the above, if we are the subcontractor and we receive a purchase order along with the materials to manufacure, how do we handle that in ERP-LN?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Also, how is it possible to handle if one branch subcontracts a job to another branch in LN? The branches are in the same logistic company and each has their own work centres, warehouses, sales offices, purchase offices etc. The branches are located at different locations and hence we need to record movement of raw materials and finished goods as well.<br />

<br />
Thanks for this Information, as we are facing the same problem.....<br />
<br />
Please can you let me know, how you will map Raw Material receipt and Indian localisation in this scenario.<br />
MSO is concerened to Service Module, because in MSO,part Delivery, Part Maintence and Part Receipt is concerned,which should be adopted and why, in which way we can handle this scenario.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Good question, Actually In MSO - Maintainance Sales Order, you have part receipt, part maintenance and part delivery functionality. Once you create MSO with Part receipt line, it will creat a inbound line for receipt from customer or subcontracter. At this time the status will be inprogress. So If the customer sends u some material and u need to do some work on that you can take receipt through MSO - part receipt. Once you receive the material you can complete the part receipt line, at the same time sys will update the invoicing information with cost. <br />
<br />
Once you receive the material you can create the MSO with part maint line. Which inturn create work order, through which u can book your resources. Once you complete the work order and sends the item back to warehouse, sys will update the MSO line with the cost occured in WO. Once you complete the MSO, it will update the invoice information as well. <br />
<br />
Now u can create the line to deliver the serviced item to the customer through MSO - part delivery, it will create an outbound line and also update the invoice information.<br />
<br />
MSO is attached with Coverage line and through Coverage line you can see MSO invoice line information and update it as well. Once you confirm the amount you can make MSO as costed. Now you can create an invoice through central invoicing. In Invoice you will have three lines for receiving, maintenance and delivery with the cost occured in MSO.<br />
<br />
I dont know much about indian localization as I dont use it I am in sydney, you can do one cycle in demo and let me know if you face any problem.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help you...<br />

Thanks and Regards,<br />
