<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Indianidol</div><div class="date">10th May 2017, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done the fresh installation of LN 10.5 on the Cloud VM (AWS). <br />
OS: Windows 2012 R2 Standard <br />
DB: MS SQL Server 2012 Standard<br />
It is a fresh installation, there were no errors during the installation. However after installation, when trying to setup LN environment in the LNUI, it is giving an error &quot;Username or Password not recognized&quot;, However I am sure on the credentials. When looked at the eventviewer, I only see this error msg &quot;Client tried to connect with protocol 'Rexec', which is not allowed on the used port&quot;<br />
<br />
So tried logging in thru BECS to see if I can login. I get the attached error and the eventviewer shows the attached error messages.<br />
<br />
Firewall is off and there are no antivirus applications running on the server.<br />
What could be wrong? and ideas would be highly appreciated. Where can I look for additional information in the logs? <br />
<br />
I have also enabled the debug for rexec and collected the log (attached here) but could not find anything useful there.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
1) Uncheck Rexec<br />
2) Choose connection port 7150<br />
3) Restart Infor Logic Service<br />
4) Configure in LN, LN UI BaanLogin/7150 for the connection.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lebowski</div><div class="date">13th June 2017, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same problem and used the same workaround - baanlogin instead of rexec. Portingset 9.1b.01.<br />
What sucks is that I could not find out what was causing this error. Rexec is not prohibited, so why this message ?<br />
Even more: I have this phenomena on two different machines and other servers with the same portingset dont have it.<br />
Indianidol, if you found more insights about it I would be interested to know !</div></div><hr />
