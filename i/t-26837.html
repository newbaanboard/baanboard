<br />
is it possible,to develop a Baan session in Java.<br />
<br />
I mean to develop some objects - GUI based in Java and then calling them in Baan. E.g File Selection Dialog Box. Alot of people has done it in VB as exe and then in Baan u can patch it in Baan session.<br />

So yes you should be able to do this - of course I have never worked with Java.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for information. but my question is to develop an application straight away in Java instead of baan. e.g.<br />
<br />
suppose i have developed a submodule (customized one) in java and now i want to attach it with Baan ERP, so how can i do.<br />
<br />
i want that it should appear in user menu and when he double clicks on menu item, it should start functioning (java Application). <br />
<br />
standalone java applications i know i can run thru APP_start. But what about, i am developing a form in application in java and i want to attach customer list zoom (subsession zoom) to customer code and want to use baan's subsession. instead of creating customer code list in java itself and attach it with customer code.<br />
<br />
I heard Baan LN is java based specially India localisation is java based. has anybody woked on such scenario.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
