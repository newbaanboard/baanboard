<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">4th July 2006, 00:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Gurmeet, Refer to the documentation for SSA License Manager (SLM) and contact BaaN/SSA support site for more information.<br />
<br />
Most SSAÂ® software must be validated prior to use. The SSA License Manager was developed to facilitate one license file per customer covering all products with various license types.<br />
<br />
We strongly recommend that you start your license key request process prior to beginning your implementation of SSA products. The License key request process may take up to five business days to complete, please take this into consideration during your implementation planning. The SSA License Manager (SLM) key request process for SSA software installations listed under the below mentioned product group links consists of the following steps:<br />
<br />
   1. Install the SLM software and the purchased software applications<br />
   2. Enter the applications specific information in the Customer License File of the SLM<br />
   3. Send your Customer License File to the Validation Specialist using the submission form<br />
<br />
Revalidation of existing software installations is required for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
    * Hardware changes<br />
    * Additional Software applications installed which are supported by the SLM<br />
    * Updates/changes in versions<br />
    * Hardware or operating system upgrades<br />
    * Increase/decrease in numbers of users<br />
    * Catastrophic failure of system requiring a complete reload<br />
<br />
For further information please contact SSA Validation<br />
<br />
Please find an overview for all the SLM Product ID&#8217;s by clicking on the link for the various product groups:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seem to be missing something -<br />
received porting set and erp LN 6.1 FP3 disks, installed porting set and SLM 7.0.0.6.<br />
A database &quot;ssa&quot; has been created during installation, but during installation of the enterprise server with the first attempt to write to ttaad000 I keep getting error 515. <br />
I was told that the &quot;demo licence&quot; (running 30 days without licence) does still work - in log.mysql it says: &quot;SlmInit call failed; return code 1 ('initialization failed')  &quot;.<br />
/usr/slm does contain slm-stuff, I started the slm-daemon (although nothing in the manual said one had to) - I don't have any clue other that the mysql-drivers of the portingset are invalid.<br />
I will try to install informix now, but would be glad to get a hint.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Hi Norbet, Did you manage to solve this Initialization Failed error? I am getting the same massage when trying to start SLM on one of my AIX servers.</div></div><hr />
