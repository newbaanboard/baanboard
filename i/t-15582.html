<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bamnsour</div><div class="date">23rd May 2006, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">A quick shot of ERP<br />
<br />
http://www.networkmagazineindia.com/200605/coverstory16.shtml<br />
<br />
Advantec Coils implemented an ERP solution in 33 days and was pleasantly surprised by the results<br />
<br />
Advantec Coils (ACPL), a manufacturer of indoor units of split air conditioners needed to scale up its operational efficiency to support its growth targets. The goal was as ambitious as it was daunting. The company had to manage five operational manufacturing units (sixth coming up) and was heavily dependent on seasonal demand cycles.<br />
<br />
Defying the traditional myth that ERP is only meant for large enterprises, ACPL chose to implement an ERP solution. It deployed SSA Baan ERP IV in 33 days, which helped in effective inventory management and allowed the company to cater to seasonal spikes in demand.<br />
<br />
Having already recovered almost Rs 8-10 lakh on its Rs 25 lakh investment within the first year of implementation, the company is looking forward to more returns in the future.<br />
<br />
The Company<br />
<br />
<br />
ACPL is an OEM supplier to vendors like Hitachi, Carrier, and Fedders, and has its own brand of indoor air conditioning units called Azure. The company operates in a highly competitive business environment, which is typified by seasonal demand patterns and high requirements during festivals.<br />
<br />
The onslaught of competition from low-priced Chinese products had further increased the pressure to perform.<br />
<br />
Issues with Tally<br />
<br />
Prior to implementing ERP, the company used Tally for financial accounting and stand-alone software to automate the HR function.<br />
<br />
However, according to Gurvinder Pal Singh, Director, ACPL, the level of automation was not robust enough to take care of the competitive environment as well as future growth.<br />
<br />
Further, maintaining data security as well as the accuracy of facts, accounts, and inventory management was just not possible with Tally alone. Apart from these issues, the solution resulted in pile-ups of surplus inventory.<br />
<br />
Without an effective enterprise-wide system the company was inclined to keep higher levels of goods in inventory, which were often not required, leading to inefficiencies and revenue loss. Due to the unavailability of even the smallest of components like a sticker, production could get delayed, adversely impacting the time-to-market.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, maintaining excess inventory levels could be an expensive proposition considering the costs involved in holding inventory.<br />
<br />
Key Requirements<br />
<br />
What ACPL required was a solution that would help the company improve operations while remaining competitive by performing the following functions:<br />
<br />
Effective allocation, planning and control of crucial resources of men, machines and material. <br />
Well-tuned production environment with good synchronisation among the various units to enable adaptation to fluctuations in demand. <br />
Effective cost control to be able to deliver better value to its customers. <br />
Inventory visibility among various units and inventory reduction across the supply chain. <br />
Availability of up-to-date and concise information to the top management to allow better decision-making. <br />
These requirements, the company understood, warranted an enterprise-wide automation solution.<br />
<br />
Why SSA Baan ERP?<br />
<br />
According to Singh, while the need for an ERP was imperative, one of the key concerns was the time taken to adopt a new information architecture and the disruptions that could arise in an organisations operations. The fact that ERP has been notorious for time and cost overruns was bound to create apprehensions and influence the final decision. Especially so when ACPL had already deferred the decision to implement an ERP system earlier.<br />
<br />
Yet, one of the companys biggest compulsions was to plan production for the coming season. It needed a solution that would allow smooth and early adoption of a new system without compromising its functionality.<br />
<br />
<br />
After considering several ERP solutions, the decision was taken in favour of SSA Baan ERP IV. According to Singh, the solution provided everything ACPL was looking for: robustness, close fit with business requirements, and cost-effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Polaris was chosen for implementing the solution because of its extensive experience in SSA Baan ERP implementation and project management skills. Moreover, its Speed framework promised to carry out the implementation in less than two months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
33 days is impressive, but I know of a company in Germany, which introduced Baan IV in less than one month, because their old system crashed and could not be brought to live again.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately they paid a very high price for this. Due to the short implementation cycle, they did not really test enough the functionality and it proved that the then current Baan Version (Baani IV a) was not able to print reminders. The customer nearly went bankrupt due to this.<br />
<br />
Even though a short implementation is fantastic, this should not be done by sacrifiying due diligence.<br />

<br />
On top of that they started something like 8 month before to analyze and reorganize their processes. Then they did the rest within 33 days, because they wanted to finish the implementation in a low season of their business.<br />
<br />
So in the end it all sounds much less impressive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
full ACK ... <br />
I didn't want to spoil the party here, but this is exactly what I thought ...<br />
<br />
Nevertheless I hope that the client profits from the installation.<br />
