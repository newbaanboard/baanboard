<br />
I am trying to get some 'benchmark' related to the GTM changes Vs the code promotions/production fixes. The goal is to compare these changes Vs GTM changes and explore the options to reduce the GTM changes (reducing the   direct data changes. reduce risk, less Sox audit scrutinity ).<br />
<br />
Would be interested to get feedback/guidance on 'How tos' to meet the goals. <br />
<br />
At an average I see 7 to 10 GTM Changes/ Day in our environment.It looks like the no of package promotions (in our environment) is far less comparing to the no. of GTM changes and it looks like fundamentally something is wrong.<br />
<br />
Would be interested to get feedback/guidance on 'How to' approach to meet the goals. At an average I see 710 GTM Changes/ Day in our environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with GTM you mean general table maintenance (ttaad4100)?<br />
If yes: change the password for it and let the people explain to you in detail why they they want to have the new password.<br />
Sounds like they got used to circumvent a bug by correcting the data by hand. Identify and remove the bug instead.<br />

In my opinion, GTM changes cannot be avoided. Can be reduced but not avoided. First, Verfiy whats being changed and if it can be fixed otherwise, take that approach. Apart from that, i would suggest to have one person be given the responsibility of any GTM changes for better traceability...<br />
 <br />
There are some niggles that can be fixed only through a GTM intervention. You could say GTM changes are part and parcel of troubleshooting in Baan. However, it shouldnt be given to any Tom, Dick and Harry(no offense to the Toms, Dicks and Harrys out there). It should ony be done by a person who knows what he is doing....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to ask a silly question: What is a package promotion? <br />
<br />
in my personal opinion, even though usage of GTM is unavoidable, 7 uses a day sounds way too much. Naturally this might depend on the total number of users and how long you are life already etc.<br />
<br />
To get a feeling, you might want to start a poll how many GTM manupulation people see per 100 users per day:<br />
<br />
below 1<br />
1-2<br />
3-5<br />
above 5<br />
<br />
or something like this. My prediction is below 1 for stable production environments.<br />
<br />
Just as a small anecdote: Some month ago I did some finance traning in MS Axapta and the acounting consultant/trainer was more than surprised to hear, that Baan allows to manipulate the tables without restrictions at all. Axapta (Dynamics Ax as it is called now) also has a GTM facility called table browser, but it enforces most of the access rules like any form does and according to the accounting consultant, at least he himself never needed it. So there is a possibility in an ERP system to do without a GTM and also in Baan it should an can be reduced.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I'm quite surprised that there are companies that allow ordinary users to do GTM ???? <br />
Table maintenance should be restricted to IT staff / administrators anyway, and any GTM I do is either; - because of testing in a seperate test company - to correct any structural system error / bug that has created inconsistency that cannot be reversed with the normal programs - to correct/adjust an occassional orderstatus (e.g. sometimes and order gets blocked due to margin control settings where actually it should not be blocked.)<br />
The last two GTM adjustments should be accompanied with proper documentation about cause/resolution by IT, and if applicable by the request from end-users.<br />
Accountants will also want to see this kind of tracing.<br />
If you really need 7-10 GTM adjustments per day then something needs fixing :-)<br />
<br />
p.s.: I think as per BV GTM also enforces consistency and business logic using DAL</div></div><hr />

Is package promotion is Service Packs, you are talking about? If yes, then yes... its really one of the reason to have too many GTM's.<br />
<br />
In your case 7 to 10 GTM/day is a huge in a stable environment, you have to find out reason, as said below.<br />
<br />
Would be interested to get feedback/guidance on 'How tos' to meet the goals. <br />
<br />
<br />
I remembered we have one GTM issue, we have to delete record(s) from tdind091 (process delivery) of our India IN5 localisation, when it is disconnected while generating delivery.<br />
<br />
We have made one simple maitain session, where user can delete record(s) using delete button, when he got message &quot;Lines are blocked&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patyogi</div><div class="date">13th July 2007, 02:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for the 'good start'. To clarify, these GTM's are NOT granted to everyone, A list of users are pre-authorized by the supervisor who can use this, but they need to request the account to be activated (temporarily).<br />
<br />
From SOx, I see more scrutunity in revewing these to insure 'correct' data changes ONLy did occur. The numbers seems to be too gih comparing to the number package/code promotions.<br />
<br />
Something fundamentally not correct. May be because of no proper training?,<br />
Interface is not working correctly, or the business logic is not translated  correctly to the session function?<br />
<br />
Like you mentioned 7-10 /day seems to be high. To do a good 'measurement' what data do I need to include(compare)  in my 'measurement' to build a case?<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">14th July 2007, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be helpfull if you could mention what are these 7 odd fixes you do in GTM on a daily basis. Then i am sure it would be easier to find out if its a technical bug or a business logic flaw...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patyogi</div><div class="date">16th July 2007, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">What I was told is that these &quot;fixes&quot; are not of the same types and there is no 'pattern' or 'Correlation'. I've requested to get the report to do some data mining on this. My gut feelign says, it is more related to wrong &quot;part no&quot; , &quot;Sl.no&quot;, &quot;unit of measures&quot; and etc.<br />
<br />
Will keep you posted, I would appreciate if you could through some lights what measurements should be considered for analysis?</div></div><hr />

<br />
in $BSE/log you should find a file log.ttaad4100 -<br />
there you can at least finde the names of the tables that have been changed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">18th July 2007, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Very much depending on what the changes/corrections are that the users perform through GTM, you could analyse it and try to reduce it by setting up better work procedures, correcting bugs in customizations/interfaces/integrations, etc.<br />
<br />
Very important factor is: how many users are we talking about, and how extended is their BaaN-knowledge?</div></div><hr />

Or you use ttaad4400m000. Same information, but a little better readable ;) <br />

About 3 days of work to undo this :mad:<br />
<br />
My advice: Never, never give the ttaad4100 password to anyone except the IT manager and make him responsible for the use of this powerful but dangerous session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sudhir</div><div class="date">7th June 2010, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Use of GTM is not recommended at all. In my company in SP0 it was very frequent but we have been able to limit it now and have taken authorisation from all except for one It person who maintains a record of each change. the frequency now is 1-2 in 3-4 months. <br />
<br />
Please try to find out why such errors are occuring, you need to spend some time. the main reason we found was that people were skipping certain steps. we deployed checks at some places.</div></div><hr />
