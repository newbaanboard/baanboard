I think you r just very perfect in describing the localization. It seems that SSA is not much concerned about the LN future in India. Although it is a very good product but the Indian touch(localization) seems to be very indigestive. Even their approach towards quality and time can not be justified. By their current history it seems they might able to complete Localization by end of 2007. SSA had come with such a strong product(LN) but these guys have made a mess of the things.<br />
<br />
Cann't even imagine where are they going to land. Now, in the whole industry there is big big doubt on future of LN in India. SSA might have to pull it back.<br />
That's sad part of it.<br />

<br />
It seems it will take another one year atleast to stablise the Localisation in Standard Version i.e 2.5 years  after release of LN 6.1. This also in Standard edition only.<br />
<br />
SSA is not at all serious about the localisation in INDIA. It is made in  JAVA (J2SDK). The look and feel is same to the distance from earth to Moon. <br />
<br />
Some of the companies in India who had gone for  SSA LN cannot go LIVE for the past more than one year due to absence of localisation. Think of the ERP guys &amp; management position in those companies. <br />
<br />
SSA it is the wake up call for you (after 1.5 years of sleeping partner in lacalisation) and pl............... take the things in your hand in developing the localisation in INDIA. Or think of position NO BAAN / LN or its product in INDIA after 3-4 years. As the BAAN supporter and user i am very sorry to mention this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After seeing the SSA Ln 6.1 every baan users thought that LN will give good competition to SAP. The way india localisation was handled by SSA it has changed the equations. Now as the sad user of Baan IV, LN I will request India user to think thousand times  before upgrading baan iv to LN. New user of India must go to SAP or Oracle ERP. <br />
<br />
Localisation look is - feel, forget &amp; close for ever. As everyone knows this localisation is not done directly by SSA.<br />
<br />
As the baan great supporter &amp; user.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt you have ever seen the localisation in SSA LN 6.1. If you have seen you would certainly feel bad about it. <br />
<br />
You will certainly get the idea how a Beautiful product can be ruined by shorterm money saving decision. <br />
<br />
If anybody seen the localisation they will comment same thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
:(  Baan is bread &amp; butter to all the Baanboard users the LN is future to all of us.</div></div><hr />
