<br />
My question is as follow. When generating Subcontracting Purchase order using session tisfc2250m000, how BaaN determine the Purchase Office in the Subcontract Purchase Order ?<br />
<br />
I actually expect BaaN to use the Enterprise unit of the department that the subcontracting task link to to determine the Purchase Office of the Subcontract Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
However, my testing show that BaaN use the business partner to determine the Purchase Office of the Subcontract Purchase Order. I am not sure exactly which setup of the business partner was used by BaaN<br />
<br />
Can anyone comment on this ?</div></div><hr />

I have not seen Baan V.<br />
But lets see in ERP LN 6.1 FP2, it says that,<br />
1) If you define a purchase office as the enterprise unit's default purchase office in the Departments (tcemm1124m000) session, SSA ERP uses the enterprise unit's default purchase office for automatically generated purchase orders.<br />
2) The next option for the system is,<br />
The purchase Office maintained in the Buy From Business Partner ( Supplier ), that SSA ERP uses by default for purchases from the buy-from business partner.<br />
Hence your findings seems to be correct.<br />
