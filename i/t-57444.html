Hi,<br />
<br />
When using the report Print History Report (tpppc2414m000) with the report selection tpppc241403000, the report system does not, as described in the help reverse hard commitments and book costs after approval of invoice for the &quot;Direct delivery process&quot;.<br />
<br />
When using a Project warehouse, the system does not show any hard commitments (Warehouse) at all, it only shows inventory once items have been issued out of the warehouse.<br />
<br />
The records don't show even though the records are available in the table tpppc215 and also show on the report tpppc440201000 when processing the transactions via the session &quot;Process transactions&quot; tpppc4802m000&quot;<br />
<br />
In short: The report &quot;Print History&quot; does not print any records of Posting Type &quot;Invoice Purchase Order&quot; and &quot;Hard Commitment Warehouse&quot; and reverse &quot;Hard Commitment Project&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have logged a call with Infor and they have passed it on to India. That usually takes a few weeks. I was just wondering if there are people out there where the report DOES revert hard commitments and shows hard commitments also for stock.<br />
