<br />
This is related to ERP LN 6.1 FP2.<br />
<br />
Please note that in our company we are mapping following things,<br />
The C-Class Consumables Like Hand Gloves, Cotton Waste, Napkins, Soaps &amp; Washing Powders, Cutting Oils etc. are regularly used for Production &amp; we treat them as Consumables. We donÂ’t want to put them in Production Order, but want to record them as additional expenses to carry over the Production, hence we want to issue them as Production Expenses.<br />
We know that in Baan IV C4, we had &quot;Enter Inventory Transaction: Production Issue&quot; which could take care of this Production Issue thing, and the Consumables are just consumed in the Production.<br />
But till now we had not able to map the solution for the above matter in ERP LN 6.1 FP2.<br />
Please anyone of you had the solution applicable for ERP LN6.1 for this, then please reply with the flow &amp; session numbers. Please help me out. Thanks.<br />

<br />
Please note that the consumables are to be consumed in Production, and hence those should be Production Issued to the respective WorkCentres.<br />
<br />
By using the 'Warehouse Order' with Origin as 'SFC Production - Manual' &amp; 'Transaction Type-ISSUE', the material is transfered from 'Warehouse' to 'WorkCentre'.<br />
<br />
By this procedure, the purpose is solved. Regards.<br />

you can issue material in the production order too just add in the estimated material when u generate any new production order for the item, or you can directly add in the material to issue for production order too. <br />
