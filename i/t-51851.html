<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Indianidol</div><div class="date">13th May 2008, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to validate the new server. I got the keys from Infor, and i have entered the key information thru BCLM, and after that i have to do Validate Tools set and configure application,<br />
<br />
So i logged in as &quot;root&quot; user and tried to run the &quot;Validate Tools set&quot; session, but it was giving a message &quot;The Program may only started by &quot;root&quot;, you have insufficient authorization&quot;. But i have already logged in as root user, so then i tried with bsp user, still i got the same message.<br />
<br />
So i looked from brand6.2 file, but there is no such file as we are running on the portingset 8.4b.<br />
<br />
So, my question is did any one come across the same situation? and how to fix it?<br />
<br />
Looking forward for your valuable inputs, Thanks in anticipation.<br />
<br />
With Kind Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you really are using BCLM then there is no validate tools set, you actually do nothing in Baan for that. And you should probably install SLM since BCLM is 5+ years old.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're using old licd style licensing, try shelling out from baan and type 'id' at the unix prompt. what unix say? <br />

<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
When i do &quot;id&quot; from shell it gives a message as &quot;This session can only be started via another session&quot;, but when i log in from OS level and do &quot;id&quot; it gives me the following out put.<br />
<br />
$ cd $BSE<br />
$ id<br />
uid=125(bsp) gid=125(bsp) groups=1(staff),16(dba),804(baan)<br />
$<br />
<br />
And, what does &quot;id&quot; tells about? could you please let me know?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">14th May 2008, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">well, your ID says you're bsp not root... so you're not running validate tools set as root.<br />
<br />
you also started the wrong shell you need to start a !ksh not ottstpshell<br />
<br />
<br />
If you insist that you're using SLM then ignore everything with validate tools set and make sure that you've setup Baan properly to talk to the SLM server.<br />
you need to make sure your CLASSPATH is set correctly, and that your Baan tools version is able to even use SLM. To do that, i'd go through the SLM install guide for your version.<br />

<br />
I found this infor after tracing the bshell,<br />
<br />
*** ERROR begin ***<br />
File: /BAAN/view/port.SLM7.1.0.1/vobs/tt/bclm/SlmApi2.c, Line: 1278, Keyword: SlmSetShlibHandles<br />
        Load of client software (shared library) failed.<br />
Client version detected: 'Unknown'.<br />
Error: 'Could not open the 'SlmClient' shared library.'<br />
*** ERROR end   ***<br />
<br />
*** ERROR begin ***<br />
File: /BAAN/view/port.SLM7.1.0.1/vobs/tt/bclm/SlmApi2.c, Line: 1298, Keyword: SlmSetShlibHandles<br />
        Client version 'Unknown' detected, required at least '7.0.'<br />
Load of client software (shared library) aborted.<br />
*** ERROR end   ***<br />
<br />
So is it some thing to do with SLM client version mismatch?<br />
<br />
This log belongs to bshell.<br />
<br />
And yes i tried the id with bsp user. So it shows the bsp details. But while doing the validate tools set i tried with root user only, as u were right, i dont think we need to do validate tools set and all those old processes, as i am using SLM.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your inputs so far. Please extend the same hence forth.<br />
Regards,<br />
