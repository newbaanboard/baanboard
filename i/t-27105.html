During my discussions with SSA Global I could not get a firm commitment on dates and functionalities.<br />
<br />
Now with Infor in the picture, it will be anybody's guess about the schedule.</div></div><hr />

We are existing customer of LN India starting from October 2004. Till date we are not yet live. After so, much long localiztion is yet not complete. There are so many issues pending. Excise part is not working. Although we can prepare excise invoice through LN but this is the max. limit. All excise register<br />
RG1, RG23A P-I, RG23A P-II, RG23C P-I, RG23C P-II not working properly.<br />
TCS is not there. Subcontrating not working properly.<br />
<br />
Now, we are going live with all these compromises. We are hoping that may by the end of this fin. year they would be able to give solution.<br />
<br />
That is the scene.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deepaksachdeva</div><div class="date">14th June 2006, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">it will take another 1 year to get the localization stablized, as few IT companies are working on it, and top most customer of Baan are also planning to migrate their existing Baan IV c4 to LN 6.1 .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">satish_174</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 08:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
Right now I am not using LN but I have been in touch many new users of LN. Feedback which I got from them is that now, it is lot more stable. Most of the excise registers are working properly. even it is working fine for multi site functionality. :) <br />
<br />
Only problem which I anticipate is whether it is working fine for Export/ Import funcationality. Anyway I am going to get a chance for testing that in coming days and shall keep you all posted for further updates.<br />
<br />
In my opinion if you don't have a very-very complicated business process there will not be any problem. <br />
Ofcourse due to Localization based on JAVA it will be slower that's far sure.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; bye</div></div><hr />
