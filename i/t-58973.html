<br />
In our company, we have a situation that there are 2 mfg plants but control and administration (HO)  are in another place.<br />
<br />
I have one option that 2 mfg plants can be maintained as 2 enterprise units under one financial company. or<br />
another option that 2 mfg plant can be maintained as 2 logistic company and HO is a financial company, 2 logistic company can be attached with 1 finance company (single finance multi logistic)<br />
<br />
But, I am confused of determaing on above.  Can anybody suggest which option is best in terms of finance, logistic and so on<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

If management want to see financial statements of both mfg plant as seperate, then it can be multi logistic multi finance or single logistic multi finance. Now, for HO accounting, I think, HO should be a different financial company only. <br />
<br />
And I think you should go with multi logistic multi finance structure for mfg. plants. and for HO, different financial company<br />

Thanks<br />

1) Do both companies build same stuff ?(item and BOMs are the same in both places?)<br />
2) Do the management need separate balance sheet for both companies?<br />
<br />
We have two companies one in Ny and other in CA, but in Baan we manage with one logistics and one finance. There are some compromise we have to make, but significantly reduces the ongoing data maintenance and stuff</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. Most of the times, Management demands for seperate balance sheet for analysis perspective.<br />
