I do not think that is possible. But I beleive, you can route the SFC order through Inspection.<br />

Thanks a lot for your reply. I know we can route it through SFC but it will not serve our purpose as the W/H receipt maintained against subcon purchase order can be easily be matched and approved in Finance as it directly gets approved.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if any other solution is available.<br />
<br />

I do not think there is a solution for this even FP5(improved subcontract functionality). May be you can think of Customizing.<br />

In contrast to the classic subcontracting (where purchase orders contains items of the subcontracting type) where used, FP5 offers so-called production operation subcontracting with material flow or purchase item subcontracting.</div></div><hr />
