<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nancy Mathew</div><div class="date">22nd August 2002, 02:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
 We had BDN up and running till we decided to migrate to a new higher end server.  We migrated from a Server (SP8 and porting set 6.1c.06.04 Oracle 8.1.7 32bits)  to a server on (SP11 and porting set  7.1c.03 and Oracle 8.1.7 64bits)<br />
On changing the entries in BDNP.INI to point to the new server and getting the correct rtoptier file ideally though we should be able to connect to the server its not happening.<br />
We are getting an error unknown column t0.user in ttaad200.<br />
We realized for any kind of error this is the message displayed. On looking into event viewer we see the following error<br />
no server defined  for 'ttaad121000', cannot start driver.<br />
<br />
Please help if anyone has any idea about what needs to be done.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

I think you are not even able to login to the thick client of BDN.<br />
I feel that you need to license it again. The problem could be that one ttss.dll( am not very sure abt the name though) got corrupted or expired(date). <br />
I guess u shud contact Baan(as they in turn may request SAPPOrtals team)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

The way the database is accessed but haven't yet come to a conclusion as to how to make it work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nancy Mathew</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We have solved the problem.<br />
Our earlier server was on Baan5.0b with porting set 6.2a.03.03. We moved on to porting set 7.1c.03 that caused the whole problem. We had to install BDN again and install it for the corelli version instead of Greg. This did it.<br />
Thanks anyway.<br />
