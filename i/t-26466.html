SSA Global Reduces 2006 Revenue Forecast<br />

SSA Global Technologies Lowers 2006 Sales Outlook, Warns 2nd-Quarter Results Will Miss Estimates <br />
<br />
<br />
CHICAGO (AP) -- SSA Global Technologies Inc. on Tuesday lowered its fiscal 2006 revenue outlook and warned its second-quarter results would miss Wall Street expectations.<br />
The enterprise software maker said 2006 sales for the year ended July 31, would total between $755 million and $765 million, down from its previous forecast of $780 million to $800 million. SSA blamed the lowered guidance on a strong U.S. dollar.<br />
<br />
 <br />
The company sees 2006 earnings per share of 36 cents to 40 cents. On an adjusted basis, it expects earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.09. Wall Street anticipates earnings of $1.12 per share on revenue of $793.6 million, according to Thomson Financial.<br />
<br />
For its fiscal second quarter, SSA forecast earnings per share of 9 cents, or 25 cents on an adjusted basis, on total revenue of $188 million. Analysts are looking for higher earnings per share of 27 cents on revenue of $198 million.<br />
<br />
SSA's stock dropped $1.57 or 9 percent to $16.20 in early afternoon trade on the Nasdaq.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my analysis the stategy behind for buying Baan was to get its massive support income coupled with its almost zero cost of providing support.<br />
<br />
There is no evidence that SSA are even trying to sell new customers. There is certaily no evidence of any but trivial sales of Baan since buying the company (yes we have seen a couple of brochures and real-life stories but there is only a few of these and some (if not most) are exising customers and a very new one I found out the feel-good story is in fact a couple of years old)  Most of the claims are for complimentary products, no substantive evidence of sales of the full blown ERP packages (Baan4/5/LN). <br />
<br />
Sales activity costs money. Good sales people get top-dollars and I doubt any lounged around the slow-to-die Baan for the six or eight years till now.  Certainly the ones who could sell would have moved on (probably before 2000) so unless you know of a stream of top sales people around the world all heading to SSA we can be fairly sure that the strategy of milking support will continue.<br />
<br />
The focus of the few sales people I have seen in this part of the world(Regional exec's down) seems to be on trying to get existing customers to buy more modules/add-on products and/or to buy  baan consultanting services.  (Makes it easy for the competitiors to say you get all that and more when you buy our product which is full stream nth generation intergrated...)  <br />
<br />
The IPO gave Mr Greenough and his backers there money back plus some so we needn't look in that direction for a change of direction.<br />

LN 6.1 seems to be a good product and those in the know have compared it favourably to SAP. I am under the impression that LN 6.1 has received good response globally!<br />
They have sold well in Japan, Australia and New Zealand?? or is it just sales talk. <br />
I know that LN 6.1 has at least 5 customers in India.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">8th March 2006, 00:07</div></div><div class="posttext">...LN 6.1 seems to be a good product and those in the know have compared it favourably to SAP...<br />
<br />
Baan, of all complexions, compares well in many functional areas to SAP and others.  Despite some nice to have new features and the fact that it has been available for 18months or so, it seems that LN6.1 hasn't been taken up by many sites around the world.    <br />
<br />
...I am under the impression that LN 6.1 has received good response globally...<br />
<br />
It depends how we measure/interpret &quot;good response&quot;, it certainly hasn't had any/many negatives publicized. But very little has been published about it either and it hasn't been used by many users. It would be very interesting to see the truth about the number of live installed licences and compare this to BannIV &amp; V licences.<br />
<br />
...They have sold well in Japan, Australia and New Zealand??...<br />
<br />
Not aware of any production sites in Australia and have heard of 2 recent/current implementations in New Zealand.  Your term of Sales Talk is probably a lot more politically correct than the words I would use.<br />
<br />
The real pity of the situation is that Baan is a superb product and its functionality compares well with all comers but its future is not assured and is not becoming any more clear as time moves on.  It is easy to understand new customers not wanting to select Baan because of the corporate uncertainty and its &quot;small-fry&quot;  nature but the existing customers not wanting to move to the newer version I think is due to SSA'a insistence on selling highly professional services contracts as the only way to access the conversion tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KAMALAKAR VARMA</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 07:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I do agree with the thought that SSA Global is not really trying hard enough to market BAAN, instead they are more into selling other associated products like Cognos, CRM etc. Quality of BAAN support is slowing going down and SSA seems to be focusing only on high value projects / consultancy work.<br />
<br />
Even if existing Users think of migrating to BAAN LN, it would be a very costly affair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">If upgrading to LN 6.1 is a such costly affair in case this is done via an 8 month project by expensive SSA Global consultants, why not do this upgrade through a BAAN partner who can do the same job in two months or less?<br />
<br />
Eventhough SSA Global believes they have a monopoly on the existing customer base, they actually don't and every customer is free to decide with whom they want to work. <br />
I believe it is still a free market out there!<br />

<br />
I believe that their goal is to get as many people on ERP LN as possible. But i would understand<br />
if they focused on ManMan / MK / BPCS customers first and Baan 4 / 5 customers second.<br />

<br />
The SSA Global migration tool is not the only way to perform a migration from BAAN IV to LN 6.1.<br />
In fact talking about a costly affair, I did not even mentioned the price of the SSA Global migration tool which will be in addition to the 8 month project with high consultancy rates.<br />
<br />
In the past I heard a lot of promising words about the intended migrations of ManMan / MK / BPCS customers to LN 6.1 but have not seen much action here.<br />
Is there already a migration tool for these applications to LN 6.1 and are there already examples of such customers moving to LN 6.1?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I know of 2 company in the US that are in process for MK to LN<br />
and 1 company doing ManMan to LN.<br />
<br />
I'm sure based on SSAs previous press releases that once these guys go live we'll know about it. =)<br />
<br />
As I understand it (and I'm not a partner) the conversion tool is not<br />
sold at all, it is used as part of the service to migrate data from Env X to LN.<br />
So it should do nothing but speed up the conversion (assuming you want to migrate all of your data) Of course, as we both know, that's not always necessary.<br />
