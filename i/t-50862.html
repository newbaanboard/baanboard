<br />
Is there any document(way out) which gives the information about what files are used in ORACLE_HOME by baan.<br />
<br />
As we dont have complete access(755) to Oracle, so now we need to know which files of oracle does baan uses during login and after login while connected.<br />
<br />
Thanks and looking forward for a positive response.</div></div><hr />

This is an Oracle bug and is solved. I don't have the patch numbers in fact it is opening some directories and files. I think that you need at least to open the lib* directories<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

The script is developed by oracle and can be found in $ORACLE_HOME/install/changePerm.sh .<br />

You might share the oracle client installation, or you may just install a new oracle_home as baan client. It's up to you.<br />

<br />
Who told you so? It is only opening files for read only so I don't see a problem.<br />

Hope this helps,<br />
