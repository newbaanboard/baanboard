<br />
I was trying to give different reporting periods from fiscal periods. Example. if i want to set fiscal period as F.Y. and reproting period as Calender Year.<br />
<br />
Could it be possible? I tried it but while maintaining end dates of periods......reporting period end date is disable. It automatically takes fiscal period end date. Kindly help.<br />
<br />
:confused:<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

The reporting period can be different from your fiscal period, however must fall within the end date of the fiscal period.<br />

<br />
Let say your fiscal period is from Jan - Dec. End date must be Dec.<br />
Your reporting period 1 can be from Jan - Mar, period 2 from Apr - Jun, etc.<br />
<br />
But if you are referring to reporting period end in Nov, while the fiscal period end in Dec then this is not possible.</div></div><hr />

However u can create a customized trial balance report for different period different from calender yr if <br />
1.	Company has 12 fiscal periods corresponding to any calendar month. E.g Fiscal period can be Aprilâ€“ mar and reporting can be done for Jan-Dec calendar year as well as April-Mar Fiscal periods.<br />
2.	Year numbering can be any.<br />
<br />
The customization requires reclculating opening period  balances from tables tfgld201/3, converting fiscal period to new periods  , removing effect of balancing adjustments for p&amp;l items etc</div></div><hr />
