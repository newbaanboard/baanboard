<br />
BaaN IV c 4 environment<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
We would like to setup the following:<br />
<br />
*	For every export invoice booked, we would like to create an auto entry for a particular amount, which is again linked to the Customer.<br />
The auto entry will debit the Export Freight account  in the GL and credit another control account.<br />
<br />
*	We should be able to create this entry against some few Customer (not all customers).<br />
<br />
Any valuable thoughts...!<br />

<br />
I have thought of that option of Automating the entry but the amount of Freight is not fixed and it cannot be taken as a percentage. And moreover i cannot use the control account to effect my ACR. I can only pass an entry into an ACR Adjustment account. <br />
<br />
As regards updating tdsls901 we dont have any session as in India Localization. <br />
<br />
Other options which I m thinking of is by scripting and update with a session to enter the freight amount.</div></div><hr />
