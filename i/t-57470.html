I was able to submit an SLM license request.  And I can search using the the old knowledgebase, but  have not had a result returned using the new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st December 2009, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not used it.  I get most of what I need from this site and let the app admins use it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">21st December 2009, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I have problem with searching knowledge base, with adding incident, with seraching for documents, ...<br />
Obviously I need time to become familiar with new website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">22nd December 2009, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Opening an incident takes much more time now. Nice that now multi language support is available, but wait, German customers still have to select English... Also it seems that only some parts of the site are new, several sections do still have the same layout (like the downloads or documents section). Why not creating the whole site (with all its sections) from scratch? It looks like they stopped 'middle of something'...<br />
<br />
My five cents...<br />

 How to process Purchase Requisitions<br />
 Direct Delivery Sales Orders<br />
 Standard Costing in LN<br />
 and More ..<br />

<br />
do you mean the tool &quot;Latest solution for a session / component&quot; to list all solutions for a session/component by a given version/release, because that`s still available?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g端nther</div><div class="date">14th January 2010, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good so far. Can you give me a step-by-step description e.g. for tdsls4102s000?</div></div><hr />

The Infor Baan Knowledge Base is now opening in a new window and here the solution tool is available in the &quot;Components&quot; Box.<br />
<br />
Please check/test.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">22nd January 2010, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Still not working with anything else than Internet Explorer, and the search is still a pain in the ass. Infor should be so embarrassed.<br />

Overall, I found it was difficult to get your desirble solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">29th January 2010, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The product support of Infor mainly in ERP LN6.1 has detoriated to such an extent that their development team at Netherlands and Hyderababd - India, doesn't accepts any bug in the system and straight forward comment the same as a PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT. I have many such instances. I can tell this forum what are the simple bug there in ERP LN 6.1 which these guys telling as product incident.<br />
<br />
I think Infor should look into this instead of revamping its www.infor365.com. When there will be no clientbase, then there will be no use of this www.infor365.com<br />
<br />
These guys attitude is very bad.<br />
<br />
I think the support of BAANBOARD is far-far better than that of Infor365. Its really a piece of crap.</div></div><hr />
