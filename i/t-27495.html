<br />
LN offers offers many new features. If you want to use them you also have to set up your data in another way. I you just ask SSA to start their migration tool much functionality will get lost.<br />
<br />
First you should have a look on LN and then you can decide by your own which approach will be the best and cheapest for your company.<br />
<br />
Regarding the migration tool of SSA I can say thant in Germany there is also a consulting company which has developed their own migration tool. They also say that the SSA tool is not so good and their tool is much better. My opinion about that subject is that other companies than SSA would not develop a new tool if the tool of SSA was good. I still hope that I am not right or that SSA improved their tool in the last time.<br />

<br />
I belive that we have to redo some of the customizations we've done in IVc3, to map the new table definitions, using DALs, etc. isn't it?<br />
<br />
any comments are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
moving from IV to LN is not a normal migration but very often like a new implementation of an ERP system. There are not only twice more tables but also much old tables were replaced by two or three others. I think you should start this discussion in the general forum. There are already some comments.<br />
<br />
It may not help you if I tell you that there was a discussion at great length about this subject in the German forum.<br />
