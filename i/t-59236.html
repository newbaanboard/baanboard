<br />
I am trying to install ERPLN FP6 on Windows 2008 R2 platform with MSSQL 2008 (SP 1) DB.<br />
<br />
But the installation is failing at the DB section, when i select the DB as MSSQL 2008 it fails. When i look at the event log i see the following message<br />
<br />
&quot;Lasterror 1008 (An attempt was made to reference a token that does not exist.) Errno 0 Message CoCreateInstance failed SQLServer &quot;<br />
<br />
Did any one installed it successfully, could any one tell me what might have gone wrong.<br />
<br />
Any input is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What options for authentication and collation did you choose when you installed SQL?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your responses,<br />
<br />
I missed the SQL_DMO packages installation, i believe we have to do it separately, please correct me if i am wrong.<br />
<br />
All i did is SQL 2008 server installation with mixed mode authentication and binary sort collation, and upgraded it with SP1.<br />
<br />
So i have to do the SQL_DMO packages installation. <br />
<br />
Will try to do it and post the updates. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

It sounds like everything else is good, and DMO is absolutely required, so hopefully that will take care of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your responses.<br />
<br />
Finally installed ERPLN FP6 on windows 2008 R2 and MS SQL2008 SP1.<br />
<br />
The initial DB connectvity problem was because of SQL DMO packages were not installed, after installing them seperately the problem got fixed, but got stuck in another problem where the installation was using sspi login instead of rexec, as Lebowski suggested in another post we can fix it with a work around by manually configuring it to rexec, but the latest porting set has done that job for us, so when you use this portingset it doesnt use sspi.<br />
<br />
The problem was with sspi login which was fixed in the latest portingset (8.6a.02), <br />
<br />
Hope this info can help others in installing latest OS, DB and ERPLN.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />
