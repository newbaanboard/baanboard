Our current fiscal year is January through December. <br />
<br />
I thought I could extend the current fiscal year (2010) to March 2011 and setup 2011 starting from April 2011 through March 2012. But, I am unable to change the number of periods in “Maintain Group Company Parameters” from 13 (which include a Correction period) to 16.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done this before? What is the best approach? I did search the board but I am unable to find any appropriate solution.<br />
<br />
I really appreciate any feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
For the current year, in the session “Maintain End Dates by Fiscal Year”, if I change the “End Date of Last Fiscal Period” to 03/31/2011 and modify the periods of next year to start from 04/01/2011 through 03/31/2012, do you think that would work? Do you see any issues with this? <br />
<br />
Also, with the above changes, will period 12 of year 2010 hold transactions of December 2010, January 2011, February 2011 and March 2011?<br />
<br />
I really appreciate any feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
You can extend the End Date of Fiscal Year to &quot;31/03/2011&quot; and do the transactions of Dec'10 to Mar'11 period in the last period (12) of fiscal year and simultaneously do the same thing for fiscal and tax period. <br />
<br />
This is just a work around because you cannot extend the periods in group company param.<br />
<br />
Try it and All The best.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srrane</div><div class="date">25th October 2010, 09:03</div></div><div class="posttext">The Best Solution that I an envisage is to have two fiscal years for 15 months. The 1st year year will end as mentioned in the system that is 31st dec. The second year you can say that the year will end on 31st March. you can name this 3 months year as extended year.<br />
<br />
One can manage in one year by changing the end date of the year and transactions from 1st Dec to 31st March in period 12. If we do this than we will not get the correct report for months of Dec, Jan, Feb and March.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">25th October 2010, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">srrane, when you say &quot;If we do this than we will not get the correct report for months of Dec, Jan, Feb and March.&quot;, are you saying that all transactions for the month of Dec, Jan, Feb and March are posted under one period i.e., December of 2010?</div></div><hr />
