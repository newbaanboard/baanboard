What document can be generated from the system when items ( raw materials ) have to leave the plant for a subcontracting task ? The subcontracting PO mentions the Finished Good which will come back. We need a doc to release the Raw Materials out. Hope I'm Clear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frank99</div><div class="date">4th March 2006, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">That depends a bit on your business process. We use a warehouse for the subcontractor and replenishment orders to move the components. This allows us to print a delivery note.</div></div><hr />

Thanks very much for your replies.<br />
Ganesh - Our system does not have the sessions you've mentioned !!!! Now this poses a bigger problem for me.<br />
<br />
Frank<br />
Your method sounds very simple and straight forward. Can you please enlighten me as to how I attach a warehouse to a supplier ? and.... how to trigger the process as you explain. Greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

If you are working in India then you have to prepare 57F4 challans to send material for subcontracting task. This is statutory requirement, plz confirm with excise persons. To get sessions you need to apply the required patches released by SSA Global</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
sorry for the late reply but we have just gone live and had a busy week.<br />
<br />
Regarding your question, you don't have to attach a supplier to a warehouse. We use a normal warehouse and call it after the subcontractor. Every subcontractor got his own warehouse. Then we use replenishment orders and print a delivery note with it. Goods being shipped to our supplier independently from our call-offs (because he has to keep the stocks on our behalf). The production / subcontracting order informs the supplier about our demand and the material is backflushed from the suppliers' warehouse.<br />
We automated the steps with the replenishment order using barcode scanners so that we don't need to key in replenishment orders, deliver them and print them. Instead a delivery note is being printed after we scanned all items.</div></div><hr />

What is the purpose of keeping that Prod Order No Blank?<br />
<br />
I understand from your query that you want to send RM material out for processing and later on material will receive in FG form. If this is your query then Consum the RM material by using RPL or production orders and then follow steps as per attached document.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We give metal sheets in coil form(raw materials, each coil having a unique coil no or lot no-units in kilograms) to a sub-contractor who paints the coil with the color we require(we issue Purchase Order at a rate per square meter), returns it to us and we take it back into raw material stock(another distinct item code) at the metal price + coating price.<br />
<br />
We need to keep track of what we have given for sub-contracting too.<br />
<br />
Please give your suggestions on the procedure. We do have a procedure now which we feel is too complicated.<br />
