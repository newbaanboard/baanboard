<br />
I have long and deep knowledge and experience in BaaN Tools since 1993 (Triton 2.2). This refers to Installation, Administration, Migration, Customization, Development and Tuning. Known versions are Triton, BaaN IV, BaaN ERP and LN.<br />
<br />
I gained also strong knowledge about different Unixes (HP-UX, Sun Solaris, Reliant Unix etc.) and Databases (Oracle, Informix). I worked also with Windows and SQL-Server, but experience is more on the Unix side.<br />
<br />
I am based in Munich, Germany and looking forward for interesting offers (Freelance or permanent). English language is no problem. Relocation possible, if the offer is interesting.</div></div><hr />
