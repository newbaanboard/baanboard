<br />
I have an interesting requirement but I am stuck between its development. I have created a customized maitain session which will be storing some Standard Prices for each item/ item group.<br />
<br />
My requirement is that, when a user creates a new sales order/quotation, after entering the field value of &quot;Price&quot; in the Lines, a pop up message should trigger displaying the standard value maintained for the same item/item group in the customized session.<br />
<br />
I want to know, how it can be done? Can field checks on standard sessions be done? Or may be after saving the data?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MilindV</div><div class="date">27th February 2013, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Do you have source of standard session/script?<br />
2) Do you have development license so that you can modify standard source and compile the same?<br />
<br />
If answer to above two questions is yes then,<br />
May be in when field changes of that field you can start your customized session where it will display records relevant for that particular item/item group. This can be achieved with <br />
1) start.session function you can start session modal or modeless mode depending upon your requirement <br />
2)  filter can be applied using function query.extend.where, import tdsls401.item / tdsls041.item in your cust session prog script and apply filter on item and item group (item group can be derived from item master {tcibd001/ tiitm001} not sure about baan4 though).<br />
<br />
If I have understood your requirement clearly, then this should serve your purpose.<br />
<br />
refer to prog's guide for function usage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. To answer your questions, we do not have the source of standard script and neither the development licence.<br />
<br />
From your answer, I can guess that standard session's cant be given field checks unless we have the script. Now, I know, UE DLL can be added to standard tables. <br />
<br />
My Requirement:-<br />
<br />
I have a customized maintain session(customized table) having two columns; Item &amp; Price. <br />
<br />
When a user adds a new sales order line, a message should be triggered which will show the Price Value saved in my table against the item in that sales order line.<br />
<br />
I know, after saving the line in UE DLL, &quot;after.after.save&quot; will be triggered. So, I should write my script within that. But how can I call a message through UE DLL?? Can I pass the value in Message box?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">27th February 2013, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">User Exit script is probably too late and doesn't have any field integration - it is a replacement for the program script's &quot;main.tabie.io&quot; section.  In Baan IV you could make the zoom automatic by clicking a form field but that form-based feature didn't make it to V/LN - you have to do the automatic zoom through the program script.<br />
<br />
If you use the UE script, you can add logic and post a message from the &quot;before.before.save.object&quot; section using &quot;dal.set.warning.message&quot; or &quot;dal.set.info.message&quot;.  The only issue with this approach is that event is not tied to the field and unless you import the program name into the UE script and check it, the UE will be executed for every session that uses the table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the comment. Well, got your point. But still my question remains unanswered, or may be partially answered. And you said, about importing the program. I did not get. Do you mean that I should import the  program in UE DLL itself and then use it? <br />
<br />
Can you clarify a bit please?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">27th February 2013, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Using session specific logic sort of disables the true use of DAL/UE scripts (business rules based on table, not session), but you can use something like the following to have session specific rules:<br />
<br />
<br />
domain tcsess calling.session<br />
<br />
import(&quot;prog.name$&quot;, calling.session)<br />
if (calling.session = &quot;tdsls9999m100&quot;) then   | substitute your session number<br />
    &lt;logic:  perform other table read&gt;<br />
    dal.set.info.message(&quot;@Values fom your custom table are %1$s and %2$d, str.val, dbl.val)<br />
    show.dal.messages(MSG.INFO)<br />
endif</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's 2 AM here in India. And I worked on your code, and yes, it worked!! :) :)<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton!!<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
I have tried it on Sales Release Lines for now and its working!! <br />
I would like to share my code in here.<br />
<br />
function extern long ue.after.after.save.object(long mode)<br />
{<br />
	on case mode<br />
	case DAL_NEW:<br />
		domain tcsess calling.session<br />
		import(&quot;prog.name$&quot;, calling.session)<br />
		if (calling.session = &quot;tdsls3612m000&quot;) then<br />
		    select whbed001.*     | Just one field selected w/o condition<br />
		    from   whbed001        | from customized table<br />
		    selectdo<br />
		    endselect<br />
		    dal.set.info.message(&quot;@Values are %1s&quot;, whbed001.cwar)<br />
		   show.dal.messages(MSG.INFO)<br />
		endif<br />
		break<br />
	case DAL_UPDATE:<br />
		break<br />
	endcase<br />
	return(0)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MilindV</div><div class="date">28th February 2013, 05:22</div></div><div class="posttext">That's pretty good solution....<br />
I learned today something... dal.show.messages() can be used to show messages in/from DAL/UE.<br />
It is not advisable to trigger message display in DAL or in UE but customers do come with some weird requirements. and as far as solution solves the problem, I am okay with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">28th February 2013, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Milind,<br />
<br />
Yes exactly, the user's often come with such weird requirement's and we can't just deny their requirement's and try to get it done as far as it is impossible.<br />
<br />
But thanks for your suggestion too. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">28th February 2013, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the other option is,one can write our own session and use session wrapper program. In this way, one can create our own logic and then execute standard LN logic.</div></div><hr />
