<br />
Our Parent company plans to implement Oracle Financials. Since we are one of the divisions we will have to integrate with Oracle Financials for Consolidation.<br />
<br />
What would be pros and cons of<br />
<br />
A. Replacing BaaN Finance with Oracle Financials. All integration entries will be exported (integrated) with Oracle Financials. We will be using Oracle Financials for any finance related processes.<br />
<br />
B. Use Baan Finance and export all finalised transactions to Oracle Financials. For transactions from other divisions or parent affecting us, use JV import/ AFS.<br />
<br />
Which approach would be better ??<br />
<br />
Any comments, recommendations are most welcome.<br />
<br />
regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Option A would cause problems with purchase invoice matching, unless you want to do that in Oracle as well. Even if you did the purchase invoice matching in Oracle, the order status in Baan would not get updated so you may end up with problems deleting old order lines. <br />
I'd go for option B and extract the data from tfgld106.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have only monthly reports consolidation needs you may do the interface from tfgld201-206 balance tables instead of the more detailed tfgld106 documents table which is more detailed and much bigger.<br />
<br />
Just another possibility to examine.<br />

<br />
Interface methodology has been finalised as below:<br />
<br />
Oracle Financials will Replace BaaN Finance.<br />
<br />
Batch transfer of all integration transactions from tfgld410 to Oracle Financials. <br />
<br />
Bill Passing - Invoice Matching and Payments will happen in Oracle financials using Purchase Integration Data from Baan<br />
<br />
Customer Receipts - Will Happen in Oracle financials using Sales Invoice Data from Baan<br />
<br />
Other Integration Data - Warehouse Orders etc will be directly posted in Oracle Financials based on Integration Data.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What I would like to know what data is written back into Distribution/PMG by BaaN Finance. ( eg : Avg Pur Price updated, Customer Balance, Supplier Balance update etc..)<br />
<br />
Also if anyone can comment on What functionality in Distribution will become unusable if Baan finance is not used.<br />
<br />
regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">14th January 2004, 09:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi we have a similar situation in that we have Oracle Financials and Baan IVc4.  We have recently looked at dropping Oracle but we are too far down the track to make it easy/worthwhile.<br />
<br />
We run 3 different instances of Baan for 3 divisions.  When  baan was originally implemented (6 years ago) we did not set the multi company finance to handle the consolodation of the 3 companies.<br />
<br />
In essence we run separate Accounts Receivable systems on Baan entirely -- we invoice and receive cash in baan with a summary  journal to Oracle. <br />
<br />
We also run separate Accounts  Payable systems. We match vendor invoices with aour receipt details in Baan and notionally cut checks. However, we transfer purchase receipts to be paid to oracle for actual payment.<br />
<br />
All other accounting is done in oracle using summary journals from operations details in baan (sales production etc)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">14th January 2004, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">May be u have taken care off all these.<br />
<br />
1. Invoice balance may will not be correct for supplier / customer.<br />
<br />
2. Sales invoice postings is different and will have to be taken care off separately. U may turn off sales link to finance (tdsls6100m000) if u would generate invoice in Oracle.<br />
<br />
3. Average and latest purchase price in item master will have to be updated separately in the specially designed purchase invoice matching.  If u can eliminate invoice matching /approval then disable  link purchase to finance (tdur6100m000) . The u will be able to run tdpur223m000 successfully.<br />
<br />
4. Period closing in Oracle will not be able to check for integration trx.<br />
<br />
5. Don't know if Oracle has TDS functionality the way Baan has implemented in India.<br />
<br />
6. Reports like tfgld5400m000 may not work.<br />
<br />
7. Central Excise Post to finance (India localization) will have to have separate interface.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good amount of work if u utilize all these functionalities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ahulikavi</div><div class="date">14th January 2004, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hitesh and Terry,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your observations. <br />
<br />
Hitesh, the idea is to keep Finance Link from Distribution on and pick up data from Integration Table tfgld410. <br />
<br />
For Purchase do PDPO so that Change Price Functionality is disabled before invoice is booked in Oracle Financials.<br />
<br />
For Sales, we will do PDSO in Baan and transfer invoice details to Oracle. Issue here is that we use Commission Module tdcms and also use Credit Limits when booking Sales Orders. Not Posting Sales Data would mean both functionalities are crippled. Any thoughts on this?<br />
<br />
For Excise, we are on in5 localisation, so Excise Posting happen through Integration table and can be picked up from tfgld410.<br />
<br />
TDS functionality is to be handled through Oracle Financials Localisation.<br />
<br />
I agree that period closing would not be able to check for int trn. But anyways which period to post a given transactions is a call to be taken by Oracle Financials.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what Openworld supports in such a scenario ( Writing back data into Baan ?)<br />
<br />
<br />
