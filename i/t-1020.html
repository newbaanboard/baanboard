<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">11th February 2002, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">That is one question I keep getting asked these days in mails sent to me. Here is the answer:<br />
<br />
My parents named me &quot;Mohana Vamsi&quot;. Yes that is my first name. It is not uncommon in India to have multi-part first names. If anyone is interested &quot;Vamsi&quot; is the name of Lord Krishna's (a mythological figure / one of the many Hindu gods) flute. &quot;Mohana&quot; is melodious or mellifluous amongst other things. In the part of India where I come from, it is common to put the family name in front of the first name. And usually it is not expanded. So I used to be &quot;P. Mohana Vamsi&quot;. When I worked for Baan I became &quot;Potluru Mohana Vamsi&quot; (no contractions of names allowed). Following Baan's convention of one character from the first name and seven or less characters from last name my logons were &quot;pvamsi&quot;.<br />
<br />
Other transformations started happening about three years ago when I set foot on the American soil. The concept of a space within a first name was alien to the American computer systems. I realised that I will be becoming &quot;Mohana V Potluru&quot; according to the computers. The objection I had to that was Mohana by itself is a girls name. To beat the computers I became &quot;MohanaVamsi&quot; and then &quot;Mohanavamsi&quot; (dropped the capitalization of the V). During a lean period of Baan when I was looking for projects and my resume did not even get an interview call, a friend suggested that people must be afraid to interview me because they could not pronounce my name :). So now my resume refers to me as &quot;Vamsi Potluru&quot;.<br />
<br />
Everyone I know calls me Vamsi. A few nicknames over the years never stuck. A mailing list &quot;CCI - Cyber Community of India&quot; that I was part of had a member who used to sign off with a ~Name. I did some digging to find that the tilde is used to indicate a form of the paper version of the signature. The short version of this is - my name is Vamsi. I use the ~ just as a manner of indicating my signature. The last few months I have gotten used to people referring to me as ~Vamsi.<br />
<br />
~Vamsi<br />
P.S.: My current client insists everyone have a middle initial. Since I don't have one, I am now Vamsi X Potluru :) - have to do anything to fit the mould.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 01:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Well just to add to the long name bit, my name should actually be Jeaninne Roberta but I must admit Jan is faster and simpler when having users call :) Just don't ever tell my parents I shortened it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Well gang, with a name like mine you can imagine what mine has been shortened to in my time. <br />
<br />
So because I've had logons like 'ChrisX', 'Xman', '10CC' and other attempts by systems admins to cheer up their days, I've hunted for a decent name to use myself..... So who ever can come up with the reason I use Ravenscross will impress me (and that is not a common thing).... like thats a challenge to keep you busy during the day.</div></div><hr />
