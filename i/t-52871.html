We are facing the scenario in sub-contracting that material is sent to one subcontractor with one 57F4 challan then material is forwarded to next subcontractor and only take-n-give of 57F4 challan takes place. Please guide me if you have solution for that.<br />
<br />
remember that this is working only in Indian scenario.<br />

<br />
Dear Kapil,<br />
We Indians do all type of &quot;OUT OF BOX&quot; procedure follow, to counter Govt Laws. Its alright.<br />
This problem is Typical scenario &amp; everyone counters. The solution available till now is also out of system only. Because you can not defy the Laws.<br />
Please note,<br />
# When you send the material from Mfg Warehouse ( MW ) to SubContractor ( SX1 ), then you prepare the 57F4 copy.<br />
# The Law &amp; the LN India Localisation states that, if you want to send the same material for further subcontracting to next subcontractor, then follow the procedure again.<br />
# Hence you recieve back the material from SX1 &amp; close the 57F4 copy. Then again issue the material to next SubContractor ( SX2 ), prepare 57F4 copy &amp; adopt same procedure.<br />
# Here you want to defy the law to avoid multiple Transport charges &amp; documentation.<br />
# But due to Govt Laws, you can only save transportation Cost, but ON YOUR OWN RISK only.<br />
# Hence you do like this ( Procedure 1 )- <br />
1) Issue material from MW to SX1 &amp; prepare 57F4 for SX1<br />
2) When the proces over, send the material directly from SX1 to SX2, dont bring it back to MW in between.<br />
3) Only bring back the 57F4 copy from SX1, close the transaction in your system, and issue the next 57F4 copy for SX2<br />
4) When the material is procesed at SX2, get it back to MW &amp; now close the 57F4 issued to SX2.<br />
here you are bound to do all the official documentation, but take a risk against Excise authority, by not geting back the material &amp; avoiding to-fro transportation of material.<br />
<br />
# You have got another option ( Procedure 2 )-<br />
1) Issue material from MW to SX1 &amp; prepare 57F4 for SX1<br />
2) When the proces over at SX1, make a deal with SX1 &amp; SX2.<br />
3) You tell the SX1 to get the material processed from SX2, the expenses settled, which will be paid by SX1 to SX2. and in turn you will compensate the expenses to SX1.<br />
You MW is not involved DIRECTLY in the transaction between SX1 &amp; SX2, and the documentation is avoided.<br />
4) When SX2 completes the work, he will return the material to SX1.<br />
5) And now SX1 will return the material to MW alongwith the 57F4 documents originally issued to by you to SX1.<br />
transaction is complete &amp; you are thru to it.<br />
<br />
Please write back to me in case you get any other alternative.<br />
<br />
