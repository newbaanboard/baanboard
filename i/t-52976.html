<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BhushanPatil</div><div class="date">15th July 2008, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">For Dealer Invoice â€“ Reciept, the Excise Duty set up can be done as follows in BanIV c4, with India Localization set up.<br />
<br />
Dealer Quotes the Basic Price ( Rs.150 ), which includes the Excise Duty ( unknown at Order placement time ), which is being passed on to you as Cenvat claimable amount.<br />
The value or the percentage of the Excise Duty is not knows till the Dealer Invoice Copy is received by you.<br />
Hence while placing the Purchase Order, the Basic price ( Rs.150 ) quoted by Dealer is to be put into the Purchase Order Line Basic Price ( Rs.150 ). In the Localization Line the Excise Applicable is kept as NO, but Cenvat applicable is maintained as YES.<br />
When the material is received from the Dealer, Before the Receipt entry,<br />
The changes are made into the Purchase Order by looking into the Dealer Invoice.<br />
For Example, The Excise Duty available is (Rs.30), then<br />
Split the Basic Price (Rs.150) into two parts ( Rs.120 + Rs.30 )<br />
Change the PO Line Basic Price to Rs.120 &amp; <br />
In the Localization Line maintain<br />
Excise Applicable YES<br />
Tariff Code as applicable in your case<br />
ASV as ( Rs.182 ) which can be arrived at by calculation,<br />
Excise applicable is 16.48% then<br />
(Excise Rs.30 as required X 100 ) / ( Ex Percentage 16.48 ) = Rs182 as ASV<br />
 <br />
And as such the calculation is correctly maintained.<br />
<br />
You can also change the calculation after Receipt maintenance, thru Change Prices &amp; Discounts after Reciept, if you have already maintained the Reciept without any Change. The Cenvat will be always taken as per the Cenvat value available on the Dealer Invoice.<br />
<br />
Dealer Invoice is mapped in such way in our case.<br />
<br />
If anyone has got any other simple procedure, please let us know.<br />
Thanks.<br />
