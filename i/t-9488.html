  Tisco is one of the India's oldest but most modern steel plant located in the eastern city of Jamshedpur. They have implemented iBaan ERP IV and iBaan Supply Chain Scheduler systems in their Spares Management Group (SMG) departments, which is a captive manufacturer of steel plant spares. The products include castings of alloy steel, CI, SG iron, Babbitt material, mechanical assemblies and machined components, structural components and overhauling of slab casters. SMG operates in MTO (Manufacture to Order) environment and facilities include Foundries and Pattern Shop, Machine Shops, Fabrication Shops, Segments Overhauling Shop and Heat Treatment Shop. <br />
Earlier SMG departments were running on a legacy system addressing mainly work orders generation and release. They faced problems in accurate costing of spares and charging them to their internal customers. Spares manufacturing status monitoring and follow up were manual and they faced problems interfacing with Material and Finance functions of steel plant, which is running on SAP system.</div></div><hr />

Also is there any detailed documentation available for setting up the various parameters of the scheduler? Are there any specific settings recommended for a project based - MTO company?<br />
How to provide production feedback for parallel operations through BaaN-IV?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are few organizations within and outside India who already implemented Scheduler with integration with their parent ERP package.<br />
If Scheduler is implemented with integration of any other ERP then its not recommended to use the Production feedback session at Scheduler, the production feedback should check at ERP system itself.<br />
