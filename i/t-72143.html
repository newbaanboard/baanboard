<br />
I have been hearing a lot about the Infor Cloud offerings and I was told that Infor Admin roles are going to be obsolete. So in this scenario, what else can the Admins look forward to? Considering if they don't have any coding expertise?<br />
<br />
This question has been bogging me for quite sometime now and thought of putting it here and see if anyone out there also shares my thoughts (pain) and see where we can head from here. I am referring to Admins with 10+ years of experience.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts are appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

At that time you would still need some system admin expertise - if nothing else for user type issues and some setups they still need to do.  Yeah - you could outsource everything to them, but I do not see how it would save us any money.  I would assume infor cloud is like that, but again never really looked into it.  The thing that stands out most in my mind is how the user community reacted at the conference - it seems like most of them really liked the idea.  And there were some really good questions around security for company sensitive data.  I know a couple of session I would not have wanted to be the Oracle rep answering the questions. I am not sure we will ever move anything to the cloud - but who knows I could be wrong.  My 2 cents worth of opinions for the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ERPpals</div><div class="date">27th August 2019, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I agreen with Indianidol, having more than 15 years of expertise as Baan/LN admins, now I think the next step would be getting in AWS Architect, so that way we can work on Infor LN cloud and still I feel that as Mark mentioned, even with cloud, still there will be need of Admins.<br />
<br />
I also suggest you (Indianidol) to post this question in the Infor groups (Inforxtream site).<br />

<br />
The other skills one can pick up are AWS Solutions Architect/Google Cloud/ Azure Cloud. Python Scripting or any scripting language. System Administration Expertise in UNIX or Windows.<br />
<br />
The toughest transition would be to get into a functional role.</div></div><hr />
