<br />
Desired scenerio is BaaN IV c4 with Supply chain with India Localisation on Oracle and Win 2k.<br />
<br />
For the above scenerio I have installed BaaN IV Master Cd, created update vrc for all the packages, and then installed sp till 14.<br />
<br />
After that i had installed extension cd, and selected PDM0 SCH1 i.e. Standard Supply chain.<br />
<br />
It went fine, but after the extension completion i saw the pvrc drivation structure as follows<br />
<br />
<br />
Level	<br />
0	B40	c4<br />
1	B40L	c4	sch1<br />
1	B40U	c4	stnd<br />
<br />
<br />
now ideally B40L c4 sch1 should be at level 2, i went into session Maintain PVRC, and there it is not alloing me to change the Derivation structure also, i.e. cursor not coming on the bottom part of the screen.<br />
<br />
Contacted one of a technical guy and he told me that this is the wrong sequence that i have <br />
<br />
followed. Ideally it should be Master Cd, then Extension cd, and then finallly SP cd's . I really doubt on this explanation, can somebody throw some light on this ???<br />
<br />
and what do i do know, do i need to install everything again from scratch , or some sort of GTM i will have to do in PMC tables. and also would like to know is the explanation given by technical guy is correct or not ???<br />
<br />
Waiting for your replies.<br />

Yes the technical guy is right. You must first install base and then localisation (sch1) Then you define the update VRC for standard and the update vrc for  sch1. You must then have the localisation sch1 derived from update standard. Then define your PMC relation This is necessary because when you install a solution for standard you can have a corequisite for sch1and pcm must be aware about that.<br />

As said by the Baan Guy, it's true that first you need to Install Extensions and then Service Packs.<br />
But in the current situation, you can modify the VRC Structure from GTM and proceed with the further installations.<br />
<br />
I believe installations of Supply Chain should not affect the installations of Service Packs. It's the VRC Structure which matters.<br />
<br />
Try updating ttpmc240 data in 000 company from GTM with proper VRC Structure.<br />
<br />
The structure should look something like this :<br />
B40 c4 <br />
   |<br />
   V<br />
B40Uc4stnd<br />
   |<br />
   V<br />
B40Lc4sch1<br />
   |<br />
   V<br />
B40Uc4sch0<br />
   |<br />
   V<br />
B40Uc4sch1<br />
   |<br />
   V<br />
B40Uc4is5<br />
<br />
B40Uc4sch0 or B40Uc4sch1 is not created automatically by Baan, but needs to be done Manually, I am not sure which one.<br />

<br />
Well prior to posting this post, i had already installed sch1 by running extension cd.<br />
<br />
As u told i went into this table ttpmc240, and found 1 record which says <br />
B40U c4 stnd is derived from B40 c<br />
<br />
now if i try to change this record through GTM, and chnage value as B40L c4 sch1 derived from B40U c4 stnd then it gives error as &quot;Error 605 Cannot delete record because reference exists on ttpmc240000 in db_update&quot;<br />
<br />
then i went into table ttadv111 i.e. Maintain Package VRC's and from there i just changed this level. and then printed the rpeort Print Derivation Structure, and now it is correct.<br />
<br />
but my doubt is that is it right method that i have followed ??? If yes, then i will do it for other Packages also ??<br />
<br />
Secondly as u described the PVRC structure,  i agrre with this structure, but doubt is why there is sch0 ??? what is the purpose of sch0 ??? and why sch0 does not have B40L c4 sch0 ??? <br />
<br />
and lastly why by default the SCH1 package combination din't got created ?? I suppose it gets created when u install extension cd.<br />
<br />
<br />

I believe what you are doing is right. This is not the standard way of doing it, only a work around.<br />
<br />
B40L c4 sch0 does not exist it is a kind of Phanthom VRC. This is required because the Service Packs contains an installation for  B40U c4 sch0.<br />
<br />
You need to define in the sessoin ttpmc2155m000, that the base VRC for B40U c4 sch0 is B40L c4 sch0.<br />
<br />
Ture, that u need to install the Extension CD and most of the things would be cleat to you.<br />

<br />
Yaah went through the screen shot, tell me if i am wrong , we use this session ttpmc2140m000 Maintain Update VRC, so that PMC can utilise it &amp; PMC can determine which one is the update VRC for a base VRC &amp; acc. post PMC patches in those update VRCs.<br />
<br />
but your screen shot also talks about IS5 VRC , Live VRC and test vrc in this session ...... doubt is you will never be using the PMC for these VRCs i suppose then why to create an entry over here ???<br />
<br />
Is it that u r expecting that somebody might send u some PMC dump for a customized session , that is why it will be easier for you to track the things ???<br />
<br />

You are right that we would not be using PMC for Test and Live VRCs. I don't remember why I maintained them here :)<br />
