<br />
We are facing the scenario that at a time we send many items to one subcontractor on different 57F4 (returnable excise GPD). but we may recieve one single item comprising all those or few of them. Them how to close the 57F4 GPD?<br />
<br />
Guide me as early as possible.<br />
regards and thank you for early help.<br />

Please note that,<br />
1) Suppose Item M ( Qty 1 ) is made up of Item X ( Qty 2 ) + Item Y ( Qty 4 ) + Item Z ( Qty 1 ). That is the BOM you have.<br />
2) You are issuing Item X, Y &amp; Z to your SubContractor and then geting back Item M from him as finished processed Item.<br />
Hope this is what you are doing. Right ?<br />
3) Here please note that you have a BOM for above &amp; then to manufacture it you must place a Production Order, wherein Item M is manufactured from these Three Different items.<br />
4) Hence you will be running that Production Order, and then issuing those 3 above items against that Production Order &amp; SubContracting 57F4 to that SubContractor.<br />
5) That 57F4 will be having all those 3 Items on it as outgoing items from you as issued to that subcontractor. And then that 57F4 will be having Item M as the Incoming item from Subcontractor to you.<br />
So there will not be any problem of handling those items &amp; closing of that 57F4 Copy.<br />
The real problem is,<br />
How come 3 different items ( X, Y &amp; Z ) are issued by you to a single Subcontractor on Three different 57F4 challans, if those are issued against a single Production order, which will be used to upload or recieve the final Item M.<br />
Please note that in Subcontracting 57F4, whatever you are sending out, there should be an item to be recieved back. Hence Production Order supports very well to this arrangement.<br />
You check up what is the Production Order SFC set up used by the Production People to carry out this transaction &amp; then you will get the real route cause, for asking this set up.<br />
OK.<br />

What do u mean material is issued say against 10nos of 57f4 forms and received against one 57F4....?<br />
and you are asking how to close remaining 57F4....?<br />
If this being followed the best way is to inform EXCISE DEPARTMENT and have AUDIT.........   you may also get reward from government <br />
ha ha<br />
or else it may happen vice vera...<br />
<br />
Jokes apart how abt creating a dummy item say fabricated steel I Mean steel goes out and fabricated steel comes in.. (only problem will be of costing)<br />
or when ever you want to sub contract insert sub con activity and dummy item which has all u r X,Y,Z in items  in BOM so X,Y,Z goes out and Dummy item comes in and same is used for next task...<br />
<br />
by the way If you could get Infor to develop clubing of multiple prod orders in single 57 F4 then all u r worries would get resolved...<br />
<br />
Accept the Fact that Sucontracting is a big mess in LN6.1 esp in indian scenareo...<br />
