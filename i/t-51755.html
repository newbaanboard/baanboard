<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Richard Thomson</div><div class="date">10th May 2008, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently trying to set-up Baan IVc4 in India<br />
<br />
We need to maintain the CENVAT receipt for an imported part, however when we are unable to select the correct receipt into the session, when you select it from the list it just defaults to another receipt that has been brought in<br />
<br />
We can bring the receipt into the non-imports version of the session, but this is obviously incorrect and the taxes shown are not appropriate<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas why we can't bring-in the receipt?  The help screens are even more useless than normal (even for Baan) in the Indian localisation package<br />
<br />
On a wider note, is this the most complex/worst software ever designed?<br />
<br />
Any help gratefully received</div></div><hr />
