<br />
This one from Times of India -<br />
<br />
SSA to up headcount at arm by 30%, move tech support to Hyderabad <br />
<br />
HYDERABAD: Extended enterprise resource planning (ERP) major SSA Global will add 30 per cent to the software development headcount at 100 per cent subsidiary Baan Info Systems India . <br />
The Chicago-based company, ranked fourth in the global ERP pecking order in 2003, will also shift its tech support operations to Hyderabad, where the Baan development centre is located. <br />
&quot;While the 30 per cent addition will come within the year, we could even double the software development manpower as all our products and solutions will be represented in Hyderabad to make it a virtual development site&quot;, Mike Greenough, president, chairman and CEO of the Chicago-based company told The Economic Times . <br />
<br />
The decision to shift the IT support centre operations to Hyderabad has been taken within the past 48 hours, Greenough added though he did not elaborate on the numbers that would be added to this operation.  <br />
<br />
Baan Info Systems India, Hyderabad, came into SSA Global's fold after the high profile acquisition of ERP major Baan in mid-2003 at a price of $135 million. It employs about 400 software developers today. <br />
<br />
&quot;The processes here are as good as anywhere else in SSA Global which remains aggressive on Hyderabad, he added. SSA's extended ERP solutions include corporate performance management, customer relationship management, financial management, human capital management, product lifecycle management, supplier relationship management and supply chain management. <br />
<br />
Asked if he would continue with his strategy of acquisitions and whether he was looking at any in India, Greenough was reluctant to reveal any details except for saying that he was open to taking over companies. <br />
<br />
A valid growth strategy is a combination of organic growth and inorganic growth through acquisition&quot;, he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;In fact the market endorses size and there is a premium for being big, he said stating that one of the owners of SSA Global, General Atlantic Partners, was well networked in India. Cerberus Capital Management LP is the other owner of the company. <br />
&quot;There are $100 million in the bank right now&quot;, Mr Greenough. SSA's growth has been led by acquisitions with at least four major takeovers worth over $300 million during 2003 pushing it to the fourth position in the global ERP rankings.  <br />
<br />
ERP major Baan Enterprises was one of the major acquisitions during 2003 picked up for a mere $135 million compared to the $700 million paid by Invensys to Jaan Baan and promoters in 2000 for the company.</div></div><hr />
