As per your requirement , you need a person for around 2 months to work on Baan Projects and finance. I think better Idea is to Outsource the activity. <br />
We are currently working on development of customised solution for a US based company and have successfully delivered complex customisations to our customers with High level of satisfacion in the areas of Manufacturing , distribution and finance.<br />
We are 3 consultants (One functional &amp; 2 tools) having experience in range of 4-7 years in Baan and working for a company in India and could do your job in a much cost effective and efficient way.<br />
Give our company an oppurtunity and we will deliver you the most optimised solutions.<br />
Please let me know your interest and based on that we can talk further<br />
