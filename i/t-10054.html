We are exploring the possibilities of using Purchase Requisitions for MRO purchasing.  The snag is that the approval process is not detailed enough - limits on approval levels - which user can approve up to certain amounts &amp; when multiple approvals are required before it can be converted to a PO.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have this requirement?  If so, how do you handle it in Baan?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">riazsayeed</div><div class="date">17th May 2003, 11:23</div></div><div class="posttext">On receiving the requistions, we check for the amount and in case it is above my approval level, i approve and submit it to the next approver. The same is done by the next aprover as well.</div></div><hr />

Also how do you notify approvers that they have requisitions waiting for them to approve, is this just an email / phone call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mfischer</div><div class="date">26th May 2003, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on Baan 5.0b and we eventually created our own external system to manage purchase requisition approvals for MRO items.<br />
<br />
We found that Baan did not have enough controls in it to ensure that an end user did not request over their given approval limits or to financial coding that they are not approved to use.<br />
<br />
We had a consultant company build an external requisition system that runs on our intranet so that any employee can create a requisition and if it is not within their limits, they would have to send it to a person that has sufficiant approval limits.  It would then e-mail that person with a link to the external requisition for them to approve or reject.  Only after this external requisition was properly approved would it write the requisition into Baan requisitions, and from that point, the buyers would then go forward with the purchase.  <br />
<br />
The system has it's pros and cons and Baan would be smart to look at expanding the requisition system to include similar controls.<br />
<br />
Another draw back that we have for MRO purchases on Baan is that we use a single cost item for all these purchases (otherwise you'd be setting up new items like crazy).  In Baan 5.0b, you can not convert the requisition to an RFQ without losing all the financial coding.  Generally we want to be able to send some of  these sort of requests out for quotation but we can not use Baan for this either.  I am not sure if Baan 5.0c has corrected this issue or not.  When we need to send a request out for multiple quotations, this generally has to be done manually, otherwise we convert the requisition into a PO and use a modified PO report as a Request for Quotation.  Messy but effective for us as we are not high volume and it doesn't slow us down too much.<br />
<br />
Another draw back of the single cost item is that all requirements are entered into the text, and it is very difficult to search the system later for items you have purchased in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan has a E-Procurement solution which address requisitioning of MRO materials. It has a flexible rule based approval process, with a configurable properties and a tight integration with Baan Vc and Baan IVc. Suggest to use E-Procurement solution than Baan Vc requisition.<br />

<br />
Where after supplier and prices are confirmed and before the Purchase Orders are reaised, these orders need to be confirmed again... without which PO cannot be raised from requisitions.  If u have not sufficient financial authorization to approve the requisition u cannot approve the order...<br />
<br />
First stage confirmation make sures that order has been cheked against budget in financial heads and inventory availablity has been ensured.<br />
<br />
It overides the integration setup for Purchase with Finance and entires goes in the account defined for the requisition..<br />
<br />
It allows you define the cost breakup of one item into different ledger accounts<br />
<br />
If the entries are required to go into the accounts defined during integration after the purchase Order lines are created the ledger accounts need to be removed manually for each line...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you please tell me where/how you are getting the functionality you described?  I noticed you're on IVc4.  <br />
<br />
Can you please supply more details (setup &amp; process)?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I am attaching one document which shows u the functionality of Purchase Requisition and the status of Order at different Stage... The document is made typically according to Indian Scenerio. If still u have any problem in understanding it please reply. I will prepare document using Baan Sessions showing the different data to be maintained as per BaaN Standard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its interesting customization. Can you please let me know how was split accounting managed (ie., posting PO line amount to multiple ledger accounts)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">15th July 2003, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
One way to acheive split accounting is to have different ledgers assigned to different items or item groups. This can be as simple or as complex as you want to make it.<br />
<br />
We have cost items that expense directly to the P&amp;L for post and packing, delivery etc.<br />
<br />
So when we order goods the actual part goes to the stock  accounts and ancillary charges like carraige are posted to the P&amp;L.<br />

<br />
The issue is described here:<br />
<br />
A centralized department, buys a mail server and wants to apportion the costs to various users departments. Each department has a GL account. <br />
<br />
How does Baan PO / Requisitions handle this scenario? <br />
