<br />
In the company parameter session, on form 3, the “Currency Transaction Account” is currently set to a ledger account of type “Balance Sheet”. Our finance department wants to change that account to a different ledger account but that account is of type “Profit &amp; Loss”. <br />
<br />
Of course this can’t be done via the company parameters session but if we were do this through GTM are there going to be any issues down the line (during year end closing?).<br />
<br />
Just trying to understand when does Baan uses the account specified in “Currency Transaction Account” and possible consequences if we were to change it to a “Profit &amp; Loss” account.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Currency Translation account is used as Interim account when we pay the invoice payment other than invocie currency or advance and unallocated amount is assigned to invoice which is differs from invoice currency.<br />
<br />
Currency translation account will be nullify automatically.<br />
<br />
Please let me know, why finance dept. want to change it's type of account to P&amp;L account??? Is there any specific reason for that or if amount is falling on this ledger, it means u r using this functionality. Is it so?<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<br />
The reason finance dept. wants to change is because there is a balance left behind in the current account we are using for Currency Translation and they are moving that to a P&amp;L account end of every month. Instead, they want transactions to go directly to the P&amp;L account.<br />
<br />
When you say, &quot;Currency translation account will be nullify automatically&quot;, at what point does that happen?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
