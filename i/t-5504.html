And they have said that it is being withdrawn so I cannot have it. I have heard that it is still available in some countries like the US and India. <br />
<br />
It would make my case a lot stronger if I have proof that it is still available or if people has been able to obtain it during the last six months.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
