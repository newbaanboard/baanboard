India Localization of Infor is already in market. It covers areas like VAT, Service Tax, Excise (Incoming / Outgoing), TDS, Projects (Works Contract Tax), Imports...<br />
Another release is underway which covers more areas like Other Charges, Direct Delivery, RG23D, some improvements in finance. These are what I know. I am not sure, if more features are planned.</div></div><hr />
