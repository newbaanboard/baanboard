<br />
We have recently gone live with ERPLn FP2 but at present we are not using the FST module of ERPLn. We were using this module in Baan IV and there were no additional tools required to enable FST.<br />
<br />
Now talking with several implementation partners, they are saying that some additional setup is required (something which is not core part of ERPLn). I seek advice from all ERPLn finance fst users, if is it true or we can use the FST module in Ln out of the box very much like Baan IV FST module.<br />
<br />
Pl advice.Shall be greatful if any document on ERPLn FST module is provided.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
In Baan 4c FTP was only valuation method available as a standard functionality hence by default there was no other set was required.<br />
<br />
Since In Ln along with FTP other methods such as MAUC, LIFO, FIFO is also available hence company need to decide by which metho Inventory valuation to be done. Set up needs to be define for warehouse valuation group by warehouse, warehouse - Item combination. You can define multiple valuation for an item since it is driven by warehouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The BaanIV FST functionality was brought back to LN in feature pack 4. In Baan5.0b/Baan5.0c the FST functionality in Baan itself only provides some non-normalized tables where the transactional data is stored. To use this for reporting you need an external report writer and knowledge how to use the data from these tables. I know there have been plans to backport the FST functionality from FP4 and higher to FP2 and the Indian localization, but you better ask you local support organization whether this has been realized in the end or not.<br />

On processing financial values stored in Data warehouse table tffst300 and 305. Report layout is out side ERP Ln and can be developed in crystel, Birt or other compitable report writing tools. Else report customization needs to be done within Ln to capture data for printing from above tables.</div></div><hr />
