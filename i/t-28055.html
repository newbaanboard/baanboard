<br />
I have few questions regarding the legal issues for development and export/import objects from one customer to other. I will appreciate useful comments:<br />
<br />
Legal issue for Export Baan object from one customer and Import at the other customer for following:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Existing Baan object (domains, tables, libraries, reports and sessions etc)<br />
 Newly developed object (domains, tables, libraries, reports and sessions etc),<br />
 the new developed object are not using any existing definition or objects in Baan.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legal issue of making customization of existing Baan object (session, scripts and libraries etc), using the know how of similar customization at other customer.  The know how included followings:<br />
<br />
 Domain and table definition<br />
 Source code of program script and libraries<br />
 Session and report definitions<br />
 Others (Questions, messages, labels etc)<br />
<br />

Your very word 'copy' raise questions. Also check your licence, see what it says about code devloped to work with Baan. Nearly all our licences for all products (not just Baan) say developed code belongs to original licensor, but its vague.<br />
To find and manage source code, look at www.bansource.com  to look at licence management go to www.abacus.gg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th September 2006, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The code developed , written and maintained  by SSA / Baan , is exclusive property of Baan . <br />
<br />
And the code written by customer himself/herself can be exported / imported  in other environments  easily. In no way SSA / Baan can be made to support that (as it's customization ) .<br />
<br />
If u have VB .net valid license  , u can give all ur programs written by u  in it to anybody and if the target has valid .net framework , then he/she can use it without any problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manbod</div><div class="date">20th September 2006, 11:46</div></div><div class="posttext">1. When you modify source then the supplier cannot be expected to support your modifications, and only in are circumstances the original code (extent of mod will rule)<br />
2. To modify the source you would need tools and a source code licence.<br />
3. Read your licence carefully, modified code still belongs to the licensor, even if you corrected it or added great functionality. The IPR is with the licensor. Its dubious when not stated, but your license will (99% of the time) say it is not your code.<br />
3a. You may also find that completely standalone code that uses other routines, includes, and accesses the Baan database (also copyright) may also be regarded as a breach of copyright. <br />
4. Copying and supplying to any third party will be deemed to be very illegal and subject to all sorts of wrath, especially in Switerland the home of Copyright comvention!!<br />
I would suggest that you and anyone else considering such action would need very expert legal advice, you are considering a criminal activity (maybe)<br />
You also need a regular inventory of just what is on your system, back it up, keep change management and history of mods, who made them and when. That could just keep you out of trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">21st September 2006, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Point 1 &amp;  2  are right . Ur points 3a and 4  needs more scrutiny . <br />
<br />
Stand alone code (without any single line written by Baan) can be legally copied to a properly validated system with a tools developer license . There can be no bar on it . We have already done these / are doing this with express knowledge of Baan / SSA since years. And Baan has never objected to this till all these years . In fact SSA / Baan have been very good in encouraging the innovation and creativity in the developer community.<br />
<br />
Also world  wide the courts are driven by fair and just practices prevalent in the industry &amp; intentions of the parties  behind writen clauses. The written clauses are there to protect the IPR's of the vendor and not to restrict creativity and innovations of the developer  comminity . So anything which does not violate these legitimate intentions  is legal.  I believe in USA there are courts of Justice and not courts of Law (as prevalent in many countries including India). In practice , justice is more important than law even in such countries. So important is Justice and not Law for the sake of Law .<br />
<br />
I dont know what mostrightfuture intends to do . Definitely we are not doing anything illegal and do not want any advice how to be law-abiding citizen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manbod</div><div class="date">22nd September 2006, 13:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose that sitting in India you may regard legal advice as  optional, but in the real world it is advisable. The one thing you got right is that the original question was vague and thats why I suggested legal advice, from a lawyer, in Switzerland (domicile).<br />
<br />
Copyright is covered under international law, and adapted, adopted, by most countries, including India. However each country applies its laws in different ways, some ignore them!! The question came from Switzerland, the laws there are applied far stricter than some other countries. I am in Spain, its fairly relaxed here as well!!  So I would not give firm advice except see a lawyer who specialises and let him/her know exactly what you intend to do.<br />
<br />
Now, a developer licence is somewhat different to buying source for your own use. You may indeed have a developer licence, the swiss company may not.<br />
<br />
I can assure you that without the correct licence, and reading your contract/licence you cannot assume you have the right to modify and or write new code (which is nearly impossible to write without includes and the use of tools. It is the use of those includes that are copyright protected.<br />
<br />
I also suggested that the Swiss company checked the licence they have signed to see if it mentions who owns any developed code, it is copmmon practice to include a section that says any modification and or new code written over the vendors database or which will not work separately to the originally supplied product(s) belongs to the vendor.<br />
<br />
Your suggestion that in the USA the law is lenient cannot possibly be based on fact. There are many companies who are paid good money to searchthrough code to find any similarity to other peoples products, and then they SUE. Just look at recent situation with Blackberry!! A joke, but held up to the extent they nearly had to close down. <br />
<br />
If our Swiss friend is reading this, I suggest a serious look at a tool to identify and log source code on your system, who developed it and the licence rights. Then you get  a SWISS lawyer rather than an Indian amateur to look at your rights. If any potential breach is discovered simply correct it. One other thing the Indian is right on, Baan have been fairly relaxed, SSA not so relaxed and Infor --- who knows --- want to be the one to test them!!<br />
<br />
Your point about totally new code is reasonable if you are a developer. But even then you only have the right to use source and tools on the licenced machine. You do not ahve the right to use ona  client machine, which is worldwide common. You are supposed to create a development environment and then send the object to the client. There are cases where a developer has left source and tools on clients machines, the client has now inadvertently (??) broken the law by having that source on his/her machine Its no good to say I did not know it was there, its a breach of copyright.<br />
<br />
Everyone needs to house keep, look for and manage source. Even developers!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">22nd September 2006, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">While I dont need any advice and I can go on debating and writing essays on issues such as this , I will not do so bcos I have more important and pressing issues to deal with . <br />
<br />
U can carry on with ur ideas and market the tool u deal in. We definitely dont need that bcos we clearly know what we are doing  is legal  and there is well maintained housekeeping for the same .</div></div><hr />
