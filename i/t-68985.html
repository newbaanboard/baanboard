<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sudhir</div><div class="date">17th June 2016, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to transfer material from Excisable warehouse to Non excisable warehouse in another state. these items will be used for customer support (FOC only)<br />
<br />
The following procedure has been suggested which I want to confirm:<br />
1. Branch raises Purchase Order to the factory<br />
2. Factory creates a sales order<br />
3. The material is invoiced against the sales order as Excise and Sales tax has to be paid<br />
4. Branch receives the material against the Purchase order raised.<br />
<br />
I would like to understand the right procedure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BhushanPatil</div><div class="date">15th July 2016, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">This is India Taxation scenario.<br />
.<br />
# Situation 1: Want to transfer material from Excisable warehouse (Wrh Code AAA in Log Co XXX) to Non excisable warehouse of Branch (Wrh Code BBB in Log Co YYY) in another state.<br />
<br />
The procedure in Baan4 as well as LN6.1 is:<br />
1. Branch creates Purchase Order in Log Co XXX.<br />
2. Factory raises Sales order in Log Co YYY.<br />
3. The material is delivered and invoiced from Wrh AAA in Log Co XXX against the sales order with Excise paid and Excise Gate Pass generated.<br />
4. Branch receives the material with the Excise Gate Pass and purchase receipt is made in Wrh BBB in Log Co YYY against the Purchase order. No CENVAT taken as anyway Material is for FOC sale.<br />
.<br />
# Situation 2: Want to transfer material from Excisable warehouse (Wrh Code AAA in Log Co XXX) to Non excisable warehouse of Branch (Wrh Code BBB in same Log Co XXX) in another state.<br />
<br />
The procedure in BaaN4 is:<br />
1. Branch raises Replenishment (RPL) Order to the factory.<br />
2. Factory delivers the material from Wrh AAA in Log Co XXX against the RPL and with Excise paid and Exicse Gate Pass created.<br />
3. Branch receives the material with Excise Gate Pass against the RPL order, and makes the RPL Receipt in Wrh BBB in Log Co XXX. No CENVAT taken as material is for FOC sale.<br />
.<br />
LN6.1 do NOT Have RPL concept, but uses the Warehouse Transfer. While in Indian Excise Taxation scenario the Warehouse Transfer concept is not supportedt with Excise transaction. As of now this upgradation is awaited from Infor.<br />
.<br />
So the procedure in LN6.1 is:<br />
1. Branch creates Purchase Order in Wrh AAA in Log Co XXX.<br />
2. Factory raises Sales order in Wrh BBB in Log Co XXX.<br />
3. The material is delivered and invoiced from Wrh AAA in Log Co XXX against the sales order with Excise paid and Excise Gate Pass generated.<br />
4. Branch receives the material with the Excise Gate Pass and purchase receipt is made in Wrh BBB in Log Co XXX against the Purchase order. No CENVAT taken as anyway Material is for FOC sale.<br />
.<br />
And all these above Three Scenarios mentioned, the Finance gets all the entries correctly.</div></div><hr />
