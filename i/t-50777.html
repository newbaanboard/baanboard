But the root is able to login, so my assumption is some thing to do with permissions, tried with few hit and trail methods by changing permissions, but no luck, can some one suggest what could be wrong?<br />
<br />
Note: Its a shared environment so 775 permissions cannot be given on Oracle Folder.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Waiting for some hint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solved it by changing to readable for other (in my situation it's not shared). If that's not acceptable for you, maybe adding sguid (group security) to the oracle driver or bshell can help?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Indianidol</div><div class="date">17th April 2008, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Han<br />

<br />
Oracle updates by default install at a higher security level than Baan can use. changePerm.sh is designed to fix that.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the response, but as i said already, this is a shared environment and we are not allowed to run chperm.sh here.<br />
<br />
So, this option is ruled out for us, but i was looking for the oracle files which were accessed by baan during the login process. So if some body can pass this info then i can get the permissions for only those specific files and can solve this login error.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards</div></div><hr />

Refer to the thread - Background info for bshell options (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=95&amp;highlight=dbgfdev)<br />
<br />
Set the BW options -<br />
<br />
-dbgfdev : debug file access<br />
-dbgfile : show successfully opened sequential files</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the info provided by you, but i couldnt use it, could u please let me know how to use those debug options, and where does the output will be saved, i tried as i do it for SQL trace but that dint gave any output.<br />
<br />
Well the good news is our problem is solved. And thats after giving the following command<br />
<br />
chmod 6751 $ORACLE_HOME/bin/oracle<br />
<br />
Now every user belonging to Baan is able to login into baan application.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the baanboard for its kind assistance provided.<br />
<br />
Have a nice time :-)</div></div><hr />
