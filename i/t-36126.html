Much to my surprise I have received a lot of applications today. I realize that for some reason a posting I did on Baan board in May have popped up again today. I do not know, how that happened.<br />

I am sorry to say that we have no available positions currently. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your interest and good luck going forward.</div></div><hr />
