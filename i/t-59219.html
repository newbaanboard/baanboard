<br />
The difference between match invoice with order and receipt. <br />
<br />
Suppose you have multiple receipts against one order, so u can match invoice receipts lines against one order and in case of match invoice with receipt is that you can match multiple receipts against multiple orders for particular that BP.<br />

<br />
One Invoice can be matched either to Receipt or to Order line, not both.<br />
However, for one PO, if you have multiple order lines &amp; receipts, you may match different invoices to different types (either receipt/order line).<br />
<br />
What exactly are you trying to achieve, may be you can specify a bit more.<br />
<br />

If you receive an invoice for let's say 10 pieces for a certain order line/sequence and you received these 10 pieces in three receipts, let's say 2, 3 and 5 pieces, then it depends what you want to store. If you are not interested at all in the individual receipts, then you can choose to match to order. You only need to match the 10 pcs to one record in tfacp2541m000. During invoice approval the system checks if there are 10 approved received pcs available for this invoice.<br />
Another advance of &quot;match to order&quot; is the fact that you can match without having receipts. You can do this by clicking in tfacp2541m000 on the orderline/sequence and through specific go to session tfacp2150s000 (Match Invoice to Order Line). You are warned if there is not enough approved received quantity, but you can continue. Of course you are not able to approve. With this approach you can continue the matching process, and let for example the approval be done with session tfacp2280m000 (batch process) each night. If after let's say 14 days the invoice still cannot be approved you can put it on the error report of tfacp2280m000.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in the underlying receipts, then it is best if you use the match to receipt procedure. The link between the individual receipts and the invoice is stored and also the inventory variances (if price differences are there) can be assigned to the correct receipt, instead of being spread out over the existing receipts.<br />
<br />
One invoice can only be used in the match to order or match to receipt procedure. This is in all feature packs of LN the same. However before FP5 an order line can also only be used in the match to order or match to receipt procedure, which can make life hard if you use both matching scenarios. From FP5 and higher this restriction is no longer there.<br />
<br />
I hope this is of any use to you.<br />

But do you have the invoice match issue when the PO receipts are rejected during the inspection process? I mean if the PO lines have reject inspection history, these lines can not be matched to order, it can only be matched to receipt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If with match to order, you match more quantity than the existing &quot;approved received quantity&quot;, then you get a warning message. You can continue, but with the approval of the invoice, the system will always check that there is enough &quot;approved received&quot; quantity available for this invoice to let the approval continue.<br />
<br />
So, with or without inspections, you can use the match to order functionality.<br />
