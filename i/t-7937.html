While generating service orders in the Periodic Maintenance it gives the 'Fatal error 606'. So, the system is not able to generate the Service orders.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately there is not enough info we can get out of your screen dump.<br />
An error 606 means that you have a data inconsistency in your system. When error 606 comes up it is almost never a problem with the BAAN software.<br />
Unless you cannot provide us with more info it will be very difficult to help you.<br />
If you can provide us with contents in the log files in $BSE you will have more luck I guess.<br />
Another thing to do is to contact BAAN Support and ask them to assist you in finding the problem.<br />
<br />
Sorry!<br />
<br />

<br />
I have attached a doc file having two entries against this errors message in the log.bshell.<br />
<br />
One is the actual error message and the other is immediately above this shows the table, field and key.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
When I check your attachment from December 3rd I don't see any table fields. Only the table tssma310 is mentioned.<br />
In your reply of December 4th there is no attachment.<br />
<br />
Can you please provide more info? If not then there is no way you can get this error 606 resolved through BaanBoard.<br />
This error comes up because of a data inconsistency on your system.<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't know why the attachment is not there in my previous post. BTW the problem has been solved.<br />
<br />
As in the log.bshell I am geeting a entry...<br />
Reference does not exist: tssma310.cvat-&gt;tcmcs037.cvat<br />
<br />
And previously I was not having any tax code mainatined, as not required in Indian localization. Now I have created a blank tax code just for reference purpose and after this its working fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
It is good to hear that you were able to resolve the issue. Usually errors 606 can be a big pain to fix.<br />
<br />
Whenever you have another problem just let us know.<br />
Have a great weekend.<br />
