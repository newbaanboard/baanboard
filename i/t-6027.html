<br />
I have an Item price as 1000 and with 10% discount the amount net of discount is 900<br />
<br />
Now I have other charges as 5%. It should calculate this on 900 and show as 45 but it is calculating on 1000 and showing as 50<br />
<br />
The I have Excise 16% but the ASV amount is being shown as 900 and not adding the other charges amount eventhough the these other charge codes are maintained as excisable in the master.<br />
<br />
was it a bug or functionality?<br />
<br />

<br />
did you set the price parameter for the second discount to 'Cumulative'? That should calculate the discounts correctly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">3rd August 2002, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">ASV will not change although you add other charges as excise applicable. However excise is calculated on other charges also &amp; at the end rate includes excise on other charges also.<br />
<br />
This seems to be a standard functionality as ASV remains unchanged even after adding other charges like freight,insurance etc.</div></div><hr />
