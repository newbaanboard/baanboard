<br />
We are working on Baan IV is3 ,<br />
<br />
Here we have one item for which RG updation is set to &quot;Interative&quot; ( in Item master extn) , now as soon as we produce some QTy , system will ask for RG updation (YES /NO ) and in case we select YES , our RG1 Entry is created in ind022 and our stock gets increased.<br />
<br />
Now when we make sale of same item ,as soon we execute &quot;Process Excise invoice&quot; , the second entry is generated in ind022 (RG1 Table) which reduces RG stock<br />
<br />
Till time everything is Fine.<br />
<br />
NOW suppose we also execute PDSO of this Sales ORDER and after which we found that it was a wrong delivery. Therefore we create a RETURN SALES ORDER for same Qty.( IN OUR RETURN SALES ORDER steps are 1)Print Sales Order 2) Maintain Delivery 3) Maintain Cenvat Credit on sales Rteurn 4) Print sales Invoice and PDSO)<br />
<br />
But none of this step(pertains in return sales Order procedure) updates our RG1 Inventory , which was reduced due to Wrong Sales Delivery.<br />
<br />
Which leads to difference in RG stocks and FG Stocks.<br />
<br />
In case we go for Excise Invoice cancellation , can we execute this session even after PDSO, which tables it will update</div></div><hr />
