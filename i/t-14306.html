<br />
we have some problems to start with our data warehouse. After installing all the data warehouse programs we have 3 major problems:<br />
<br />
1.) changing the templates, so they work with our customizations.<br />
    (ok, we make it :-) )<br />
<br />
2.) Running the export sessions and import the data in the data warehouse.<br />
    (ok, that's running too withour errors.)<br />
<br />
3.) processing the shared dimension and the cubes<br />
    :-(((( here are our problems:<br />
<br />
some error messages: <br />
   'Server is running low on memory' (we have 4GB RAM)<br />
   'tempdb is to small' ( we have a tempdb with 60GB volume)<br />
   After a reboot sometimes we can process a dimension, but when we try to process all dimensions/cubes we have errors but not in the previous dimension.<br />
<br />
so we are NOT very happy with this product.<br />
Now our question:<br />
<br />
a) have anyone a running data warehouse with more than one modul ?<br />
b) have anyone a oracle datawarehouse with baan ?<br />
c) it is possible to translate the baan templates to oracle ???<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

   We are currently implementing BIS 2.1 with all templates on MS-SQL with Baan V on Oracle.  Everything looks okay except few problems with sharing tables and data setup.  We also had couple of issues with processing of Cubes later got fixed with binaries from Baan Support.  The problem here in US Support is there are no people with good knowledge in BIS.  So everytime I had to get support from either India or Netherlands.  In few weeks a guy from Holland is coming down to fix all the problems.  I think you should contact Baan Support as they are only people who know this product.<br />

<br />
it is very difficult to give a  solution for your problems. Somebody has to look closer to your system and your environment parameters.<br />
I have implemented the Decision Manager at a customer together with a Baan Consultant. I can say, that there are companies wich are using a data warehouse with more than one module (also in Germany). If you are interested, I can give you the contact data to the Baan Cosultant.<br />
<br />
Feel free to contact me directly per e-mail (see my profile).<br />
<br />
Best regards.</div></div><hr />
