I was working with a client and came across a problem when the &quot;common&quot; button in the menu browser was not opening.<br />
When I tried that in my machine with remote access, there was no such problem.<br />
But the issue persisted when I used TeamViewer to his machine.<br />
I checked the authorization in the user management and it doesnt seem like a problem with that.<br />
Is it a problem with Worktop?<br />
If you think of anything else, please suggest.<br />
Thank you! :)</div></div><hr />

Just had to delete the cache of that particular login from the main dictionary.<br />
