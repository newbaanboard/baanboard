2) You can't download the Service Packs from Baan website, you need to order them from Baan.<br />
3) If you implement PMC, install SPs are very easy, first transfer the stuff from CD to Sever, second scan the software in appropriate Base VRCs and finally run the Sessoin &quot;Process Patches&quot; (ttpmc2102m000) to install Service packs.<br />
<br />
I hope this is clear....</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have installed upto SP13. According to Baan support, SP14 would be released around October ...<br />
<br />
Hope the attached Quick Guide from Baan helps ...</div></div><hr />
