I have made a sales order for an item &quot;A&quot;. So the entries are made in tdsls040,tdsls041 and tdsls045. Now when I go to &quot;Maintain deliveries&quot; session and delete the record corresponding to Delivery number zero (i.e. before making any delivery against this order) the sales order line(i.e tdsls041 record) is also getting deleted.<br />
<br />
I feel that system should not allow to delete from Maintain Delivery session before making any delivery against the order.<br />
<br />

You shouldn't delete the zero delivery line as that's supposed to be there.  I'm suprised that the system allows you to do this, but I see that it does warn you that it will delete the actual line.</div></div><hr />

which Baan are you working on? We're running Baan IVc4 and when trying to delete a record in session Maintain Deliveries a warning is displayed that the salesorderline is also deleted. As far as I know this has been standard functionality ever since we're running Baan.<br />

Thanks a lot for that info. <br />
<br />
We use BaaN IV C4, Indian localization IN4. We are not getting any  message that sales order line will also get deleted. Looks like I need to contact BaaN Support for this.<br />
