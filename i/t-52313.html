          I have installed ERP LN6.1 with enterprise server 8.4b ,porting set 8.4b.But I have installed SLM2.4.It is creating a problem when I am going to put the product id's in license manager data and try to license the server temporarily for 15 days......<br />
Firstly even after supplying activation key it is not getting licensed and is picking up the demo license..<br />
And many session is not opening giving and error product id 6784 could not be initialized.<br />
Also when I am trying to run Synchronize User data with SLM it is giving an error Slm client can not initialize.<br />
Can anybody explain me the reason and provide a solution...<br />
Your help is most welcome.</div></div><hr />

If you are on the latest ERP and Porting Set why aren't you using the latest SLM Version (7.1.0.2)?<br />
Also refer to SolutionID 216300 (New Product IDs for ERP LN 6.1, Feature Pack 3) in the knowledge base on Support Site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nathsukanta_gil</div><div class="date">24th May 2008, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed latest slm,i.e..Then also it is giving the same problem.At the time of log-in it is giving message &quot;You can still use this software for ....days&quot;.<br />
This gives an impression that it is picking up demo license.<br />
But at the time of opening localised sessions and many other(like tfgld1101m000) it is throwing an error product id 6784 initialisation failed.<br />
Why it is happening?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'am getting the similar error with LN FP2 as well. We have Indian Localization installed and running on temporary liceenses on SLM 7.1<br />
<br />
We get the license error for product ID 6784 for some session like transactions (tfgld1101m000), reverse entries etc.. One confusing thing is that, we were able to open this session till y'day and now it is not opening. Is there anything available for FP2 as well.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
