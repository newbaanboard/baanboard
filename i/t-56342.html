Currently we are on Baan IVc4 and planning to implement Infor LN 6.1 which is available in India with FP2. In other contries Infor has already released FP5.<br />
<br />
Infor has also released MyDay which is a complementary BI tool for ERP LN. I just want to know if we go for ERP LN with FP2, will we able to use MyDay.<br />
<br />
I will highly appreciate if anyone can shed light on this. Well n good if any document is available.<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

As far as I know Myday functionality has been developed around FP5.  I would check with your Infor support in India to see whether this is possible.  <br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
