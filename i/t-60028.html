<br />
I am creating a session based on AFS which will create follow up calls in service module automatically.As this concept is new to me,I am facing many problems.I have written code based on my understanding.The follow up call should be automatically assigned to engineer &amp; the new call no should also be updated in parent call.<br />
<br />
I have attached my code &amp; error message screen shot.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me to check why I am getting this error?Is there something wrong with my understanding?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th February 2011, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see which you include the stpapi library - I usually include this in the program itself:<br />
<br />
#pragma	used	dll	ottstpapihand	| Baan API Handler<br />
<br />
<br />
I will also add that in the code I notice you start off calling a subsession directly(tsclm1100s000) and I have had problems doing that.  I always call the main session and let the main session start the subsession.  Let me see if I have a link to how I design one of these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th February 2011, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - down in this thread I (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=59849&amp;highlight=document) show how I step through creating a session like this.  I document what I start, what button I hit, questions answered, etc.<br />
<br />
I also noticed in the code that you also start a subsession tsclm1113s000 from the tsclm1100s000, but I do not see stpapi.handle.subproc - which would let you control the subsession.<br />
<br />
I also noticed after the tsclm1113s000 session closes - you close 1100s000. Then immediately put the follow_call_no followed by a stpapi.insert - is that necessary? Above you do an insert and get the follow_call_no - so to me it looks like it is already created.  Keep in mind we do not use these sessions so this is speculation on my part.</div></div><hr />

Could you please spend some time with me in sharing AFS knowledge,that would be of great help.<br />
I reside in India,plz tell some time for discussion,I will be there.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th February 2011, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sorry, but this not something that can easily be taught - or at least I don't think I can.  The best I can do is recommend starting on easy sessions and learning to play with the coding.  On a few occasions it is extremely difficult to find a solution and work through getting a session to work.  I also do not know baan 5 or ln and how that will work.<br />
<br />
I would recommend reading the sticky documentation.  Then you can search this forum for examples of code.  The more of this you do the more familiar you will become with it. With single main sessions it is pretty easy, and then when you start going multiple sub-sessions that it can get tricky.  Not all main sessions are designed to work with AFS and those are the ones that can cause problems.</div></div><hr />

I will try to answer what questions that I can.  I am no longer on the board as much as I used to be and only occasionally support baan.  I still help, but not my primary job.</div></div><hr />
