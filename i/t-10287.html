<br />
Can someone please clarify the following issue and give me the right procedure.<br />
<br />
As a first step can I install BaanIVc4/IN5 on Oracle 8i (Enterprise Edition, Version 8.1.7) (As per the Baan Document No.U7051G US, Dt. September, 2002) and then migrate to Oracle 9i (Standard Edition).<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Install BaanIVc4/IN5 on Oracle 8i (Standard Edition, Version 8.1.7) and then Migrate to Oracle 9i (Standard Edition).<br />

Which procedure is correct and if the 2nd procedure is correct can u suggest the Baan Document No for installing BaanIV on Oracle 8i (Standard Edition).<br />

<br />
I had Installed BaanIVc4 on Oracle 9i (9.2.1.0.1) directly thru the new BaanIV installer (porting set 6.1c.07) for Oracle 9i, the installation was smooth.  never expected  <br />
<br />
Thanks for Baan Marketing (New Delhi - India) and Baan Support Team (Mumbai - India).<br />
<br />
Regarding Migration:<br />
<br />
According to Baan Documents the best method of Migration (From Oracle 7.x or Oracle 8.x to Oracle 9i) is using Oracle Migrating Tools.  But Migrating from Standard to Enterprise Edition is not adviseable.<br />
<br />
so since we are using Oracle Migrating tools its better we migrate from standard edition to standard edition (higher version) and enterprise to enterprise edition (higher version).<br />
<br />
For Baan, enterpise edition or standard edition no botheration.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, Oracle recommend using the Oracle Migration Utility (mig) to perform migrations.  I used this method religiously, but later found using standard Oracle export/import utilities work even better.  Baan just probably take Oracle's cautious advise when recommending the Oracle Migration Utility.  Helps if you have a test system to try these things out beforehand :)<br />
<br />
Migrating from 8iEE to 9i Standard?  Not too sure about doing this.  A good question!</div></div><hr />

 Can you please give us more details? <br />
 I am trying to install BAAN IV c4 on Windows 2000 Server and Oracle 9i. But the installation fails because there is no &quot;svrmgrl&quot; anymore on Oracle9i. <br />
 I have a master CD which supports installing on Oracle 8i (PS 6.1c.06.04). As far as I understand, there is a new master CD which allows you to install directly on Oracle9i? Is this master CD available only for UNIX or there is one for NT?<br />
<br />
 Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to install BIVc4 on 9i directly with the 6.c.06.04 CD a few days ago and the installation failed also because of the svrmgrl problem...<br />
<br />
I created a thread about it:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10451<br />
<br />
In the end I had to create the DB manually and connect to Oracle after that.<br />
<br />
Latest info from Baan Support is that there is a new Installation CD (for W2k) available that supports 9i.<br />

<br />
 Now I have the master CD --- BD0024.2273   - for Windows.<br />
<br />
 I would also like to know the code of the master CD for UNIX which supports installing on Oracle 9i.<br />
<br />
 I tried to order these CDs but I did not know the code and the answer was that such CDs are not available !!! This is why I need the codes, to order them one more time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Latest BaanIVc4 Installer for Oracle 9i (Directly) will not look for svrmgrl.exe while installing.<br />
<br />
If Baan installer is looking for svrmgrl.exe, its mean the installer is not latest and can support only 8i or below.<br />
<br />
The svrmgrl.exe is not more in Oracle 9i. (It was there in Oracle 8i and below but not in Oracle 9i).<br />
<br />
The version of Oracle, which I used, is Oracle 9.2.0.1.0.<br />
<br />
I Used Baan Installer for Windows 2000 Adv. Sever.<br />
<br />
Request the Nearest Baan Support Team to get the latest version of Baan Installer for Oracle 9i.<br />
<br />
The New Installer contains porting set of 6.1c.07, so no external porting set is required.<br />
<br />
I am not sure about the Part Number (BD #) of the New Installer.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay in reply, since I was Busy.<br />

Migration from Oracle8 to Oracle 9 see the Migration Guide U8046B US<br />
