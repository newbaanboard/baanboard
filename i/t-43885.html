This problem is for LN 6.1 FP2 with India Localisation, specifically related to India Localisation Taxation only.<br />
1) Generally in Cost Type Orders the Taxes are not applicable. Hence I have prepared an Aggregate Tax Code. Which has a singular tax code,  of kind No Tax which is actually a VAT Kind of Tax. In effect no taxes will be calculated. <br />
2) I have created an Itemcode of Cost Type. where I have attached the above type of Aggregate Tax Code. Which will be used while placing Purchase Order.<br />
3) I have prepared a Purchase Order Type of Cost Type, which will be used for placing the purchase order.<br />
4) I tried to place the Purchase Order for this Cost Type ItemCode. The System is not accepting the above Aggregate Tax Code on line level.<br />
The message displayed is<br />
&quot;TAX CODE TCTNT FOR COUNTRY IND MUST HAVE KIND OF TAX VAT&quot;<br />
The Screen Shots are attached herewith.<br />
Please reply if you have any input &amp; help me. Thanking you.<br />
