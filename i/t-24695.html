<br />
At presently they are not providing these facilities, but you have to attend the formal training. and this certification is formal attendance of training !!!.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets clarify this a bit for newbies:<br />
- There is no certification on Baan, like the one you can have for Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. and, currently, nothing is mentioned on SSA webpages regarding a future certification path...<br />
- You can, however, attend Baan trainings and these come with a certificate of completion of the course.<br />
<br />
Now, as recommendation for future Baan Tools wanabee admins, I would do:<br />
1) get some training/knowledge on:<br />
- Microsoft Windows and, at least, one UNIX flavour (like Linux)<br />
- A [Baan supported] database<br />
- Baan Tools module (by a good trainer)<br />
2) Do a test installation of Baan to play [heavily] with;<br />
3) Read all Baan Tools and OS/database related threads of Baanboard  :cool:  and test the things mentioned there on the system of 2).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">- You can, however, attend Baan trainings and these come with a certificate of completion of the course.<br />
<br />
Simply put, meaningless.  Because, if I attend, sleep the whole time (since it would be boring to listen to someone explaining stuff I already know! ;) ) I still have a Baan certificate!  Big deal!<br />
<br />
Anybody from SSA on the board who could take this issue up with the powers that be?  Maybe with a decent certification, the Baan product will be revived a little bit!  Reason: then there would be good, certified people to turn to when you have a problem, and not just anybody who says they have the knowledge.  Might just be that customers wouldn't start looking for other ERP's if they can obtain real professional services.<br />
<br />
Just an idea... don't shoot!  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, just to complete the history, there was a certification track, Development (Dev 1 and 2 classes), Administration, etc.  When Baan went to Invensys, the training went to partners, such as TriNet, who could still provide the official certification.   Many of us :)  are certified from back then.  SSA does not want any partners in on this right now, they are apparently restructuring the certification and should re-offer it (right?).   In the mean time, the 3rd party certifications are for individual training classes, and content may vary.  I know ours is structured similar to Baan's Dev 1 and 2 classes, and any certification we would hand out is based on coming to the class and completing the exercises.  There is no exam.  But you won't get the certification from sleeping through the class :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">So, as an ex-Baan employee, who learned the hard way, and then taught it to others (quite successfully, I believe) I'm basically scr....., since we did not give ourselves certificates for learning a new part of the software environment! :)  And therefore I'm lacking the old certification, and can not claim to be professional... :( Correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think a certification makes you a professional...or vice versa.  If you taught the classes, surly you can can be considered as having the equivelant of these exams.    I see your point though, without official certification.  I think it's a temporary situation, as the web links show, they are clearly revamping and getting the classes moving again.  Heck, if for no other reason than the certifications are an easy way to make money from the existing base...right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 22:52</div></div><div class="posttext">That was always a problem I had with the whole certification thing.  I was at a client site back in 1994-5 talking to a BAAN employee (I think his name was Dan) who was working on developing a certification of &quot;expert,&quot; or something like it, for the tools section and told me that it was all just a joke anyways and not to bother.<br />
<br />
I never did get certified, much to my managers dismay because then my firm could not count me in its &quot;certified consultants&quot; columns in the promotional materials that they put out.  It didn't seem to bother BAAN as they had me teach their tools courses in MI and CA a few times for them, but every once in a while a consulting client would say &quot;What, he is not certified.  Send someone else.&quot;  In retrospect, I probably should have just gone and done it at some point.</div></div><hr />
