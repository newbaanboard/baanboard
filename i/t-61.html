<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">20th August 2001, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Many people say that manufacturing is considered to be the strongest part of the Baan package.<br />
Standard cycle counting is not the greatest so it is often customised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcaughey</div><div class="date">20th August 2001, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been implementing Baan IVc3 since 1997 as a consultant after switching from SSA-BPCS implementations. Baan was much easier to use and much less buggy. Master scheduling module in Baan IVc3 is difficult but should be better in Baan V. Project control (PCS) is good but difficult to explain to clients. Other modules I found to be very deep in functionality requiring little or no customizations. I have implemented successfully MPS, MRP, SFC, PUR, SLS, INV, PCS and PCF (Product configurator) and DRP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">20th August 2001, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan is indeed very strong in the manufacturing department due to historical reasons. For that area it is prolly one of the best in its class.<br />
<br />
Once you have your system up and running, get yourself a good Baan admin though. A Baan system can be resource intensive where system maintenance is concerned: OS/database management, patch management, user/printer management etc.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless Baan is worth the $$$, otherwise this board would not exist  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">20th August 2001, 22:13</div></div><div class="posttext">There are both lots of good and bad things about Baan.<br />
<br />
But remember that other ERP's also suffer from the same or similar problems.<br />
<br />
The Baan software is in itself proven to be successful.  Though, there are many &quot;features&quot; and problems.<br />
<br />
Indeed, the Manufacturing modules in Baan are somewhat superior to other ERP's.<br />
<br />
Problems revolving around development are inherent within all other ERP's.<br />
<br />
My advice would be to keep the setup as simple as possible.  Avoiding the use of 3rd Party Baan add-on's would be much desirable, if possible.<br />
<br />
If the Baan Software can model your business/process model, then there should be no reason not to implement Baan.  Its fast and cheap to implement/maintain.<br />
<br />
There are many factors to be taken into consideration before you make a decision on whether to implement Baan.  There are  bad/negative sides, but these would be just small factors in the overall decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus B</div><div class="date">23rd August 2001, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">There is nothing really bad about Baan, especially not in manufacturing. There are just very few shortcomings e.g.:<br />
- subcontracting<br />
- no possibility to store transport time between operations on  <br />
  operation level<br />
<br />
These normally result in minor customizations.<br />
<br />
I worked for Baan Company as a consultant for almost 5 years now. Before that I worked for JDE (2 years) and I had a thorough look at SAP during my study time. I have to say that there is nothing that beats Baan in manufacturing. <br />
Especially with BaanERP5.0c manufacturing and planning which are by their nature the most complex areas are extremely good. <br />
We still fight a few bugs, but overall it has become a very stable product by now.<br />
Besides that I must not forget to mention BaanSCS Scheduler which is a fully integrated add on product for manufacturing scheduling. SCS Scheduler allows operation sequence optimization, planning against limited capacity and consideration of several limiting factors.<br />
Also there is a full integration with the Manufacturing Execution System 'Intrac' of Wonderware (part of the Invensys group). This is available for BaanIV and will soon be available for BaanERP.<br />
No other company in the world offers a functionality in the manufacturing area that can compete with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">28th August 2001, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">As with anything, from music to movies, everyone has thier own feelings about everything. <br />
<br />
Some people will feel that Baan is awful and complain about it any chance they get (I try to keep away from them at conferences), others love bits or all of Baan.<br />
<br />
Depending on where you sit on the fence, developer, user, techie, you will have a different point of view about Baan. I love some of the things I can do with it, plus hate a few things it forces me to do.... However, as has been said in this forum and many others, Baan can be improved and with the benefit of these forums, the required changes can be made. So I'm glad to see that there is a split of 'love &amp; hate' here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jim Bucher</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">;) As a general rule, if implementing Baan - absolutely minimize customizations.  Change the business before changing Baan.  (Of course this also applies to most other packaged software as well).  Data capture is a problem with Baan and haven't found a provider that does it really well yet.  As one of the posts mentions, their are a couple of packages for shop floor execution that can be &quot;add ons&quot; (SSC being one). Integration is not tight. Also, ECO process is weak in Baan and PDM as an add-on is &quot;ok&quot;- but should be integrated more closely. CAD (Pro-E) interface to PDM is still coming? <br />
<br />
Lots of problems/issues around time reporting and labor capture which is intrinsic to efficiency reporting (Baan HRA is a difficult module).  Interfacing to HR and Payroll systems is painful.  Supply Chain is ok but has some aggravations.<br />
<br />
The Baan software suite is huge and moderately buggy.  Support has only recently become uniformly &quot;better&quot; for all customers.  <br />
Of course, the major hurdle in most implementations is changing the mind-set of users and how they do business.  ERP is bigger than they are used to (unless they are converting from SAP) and there is more visibility of data across functional areas.  Unless that corporate mindset is changed, implementation of any ERP software is likely to be unsuccessful.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the thing I like least in Baan is the security implementation in 4c.  Is it any better in 5?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">19th September 2001, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Amazing!  No support for Baan IV!  I think you may have OVERstated that.  Baan IV, in one form or another,is running on about 80% of Baan's Client base!  Not even the most arrogant of companies would abandon 80% of it's business. ( the brothers have left the building!  ha ha )<br />
 Most recently, (last week) I received the fastest response from Baan support that I've ever expreienced.  Baan IV c3 mcr is the version I am currently supporting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">20th September 2001, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan is officially comited to support any latest version of Baan for 5 years. If they built version 5 a few months ago, then they will support it for 5 years. It does not mean that they will enhance or fix a lot of bugs, but that means that you can still use it for 5 years more with support.<br />
<br />
As Baanboozeled mentioned, Baan IV is the battle horse of the sales within Baan, and I don't see them discarding it for ERP/iBaan without having a certified and fast upgrade path for all the BaanIV customers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">5th December 2001, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I have worked in good and bad Baan environments. Like all (ERP) programs, Baan has its pros and cons.<br />
<br />
A major problem with Baan that I think cannot be avoided due to its architecture is the way it handles transactions. When running a large amount of (small) transactions, Baans crappy database management becomes very apparent.<br />
<br />
This is a legacy problem that for years has been Baan's albatros. I don't know if they'll ever be able to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In India Baan Has the maximium TRUELY LIVE reference sites..I feel the product is real Value for money and can be implemented very quick if the Top Management want it. Be careful to have a very good D/B admistrator..Most of the problem is not with the Baan package  but somewhere else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acapulco</div><div class="date">8th December 2001, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan is good and reliable.<br />
Our company switched for JDE, at the begining I believed it was a mistake, since the GUI wasn't as nice and Baan's name was going down.  But the truth is that Baan does manufacturng and distribution like no one else.<br />
<br />
The software is less buggy than JDE OW, and besides a couple of archetectural problems the Functionality is great.  We use DEM which I believe is the most powerful tool to create change among end users and Baan data navigator to ease the use of the system to our end users.<br />
<br />
If I would haveto choose baan again. I will do it with out blinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">13th December 2001, 11:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan is a very good software. However, I would always suggest you go for Baan ERP (Baan V, iBaan, or however they call it next year). It solves some shortcomings that Baan IV always had - especially the segregation between items that you build on order and item that you build anonymously is very strict in Baan IV, and that implies some nasty side effects (you just don't get some information when using those &quot;customized&quot;, or on-order-items).  For example, cycle counting for those customized items just isn't implemented within Baan IV.<br />
<br />
Due to this, I have a slightliy different opinion concerning customizations: I have seen a lot of Baan implementations, and not a single one without customizations. No company is standard, otherwise it would'nt be on market. Baan is standard software. So you will have to make some adjustment to make it perfectly suit your needs. The trick is to make those customizations with as little impact to the standard as possible.<br />
<br />
However, and this is a very strong feature in Baan: You can do those customizations very easily (better to say: you consultancy company can do it easily, if it has got clever consultants). Without to much interfering with your update capabilities. <br />
<br />
So, when thinking about Baan: Do a functional analysis of your business (What do you need) and put the functionality of Baan against this (Baan won't fit eg. if you're a company earning it's money with renting it's two fisherboats on a lake in Iowa, you get the picture), prepare to change some of your business processes, and prepare to change a little bit of the software. <br />
<br />
Don't think that everything just falls from heaven by buying a standard ERP software, in other words: Don't over-expectate (this is true for every out-of-the-box-software, not just for Baan): You don't get better processes / information / cost reduction just by buying a piece of software.<br />
<br />
Then the Baan software won't disappoint you, I am very sure about that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan's manufacturing support is among the best in the business.  Also it's order entry is likely superior to all but Lawson.  It is somewhat weaker than Oracle in its financial system...  although I still believe it is adequate.<br />
<br />
Baan's largest problem, which has remained unmentioned in this thread, is that the public at large, and corporate management in particular, views the company as unreliable and unlikely to survive.  This is a legacy of absolutely awful management during the 90's.  But Baan's current home at Invensys should provide it a secure future.<br />
<br />
However conventional wisdom is difficult to counter, especially since the Big-5 abandoned their Baan practices and can be counted on to wisper in the CEO's ear that &quot;Baan won't survive&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you can beat that, then Baan is an excellent package for almost any manufacturing company.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcantor</div><div class="date">17th January 2002, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">As a reseller and implementation firm in the baan space for @ 10 yrs, and as a former consultant myself, Baan is truly a sound manufacturing centric erp system since their roots lie in manufacturing and I think that with baan vc, the improvements have been pretty significant. <br />
I have also learned that most erp systems are the same today (assuming you are only looking at the higher end products) but you need to focus on how good the fit is with your industry and your success will be purely the result of your company's total dedication to the project and who does the implementation....both from your side and from the consulting side.<br />
<br />
I guarantee you that your implementation will be painful....so don't believe the hype!<br />
<br />
functionally, Baan is fine but not without bugs ...as are all systems and there are sometimes integration issues that pop up.<br />
<br />
also if there is an area that you feel is specific and crucial to your company, then make sure the presales guys focus on it <br />
<br />
I hope this helps but either way, out of our 150 + customers, depending on who you ask, they usually will have pretty strong opinions about baan I can always put you in touch with a customer in a similar industry as yours if that would help!<br />
<br />
Good luck....and make sure you ask the right questions....does a and b work together.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sangamsd</div><div class="date">23rd January 2002, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">All the points are ok. Baan is a good ERP and suitable for a manufacturing Industry. <br />
<br />
Pl take care of the implementation which requires the invovlement(full time) of the key users. This is a very vital point for the sucess of Baan going up and live. <br />
<br />
More over go for the latest version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeyaseelan</div><div class="date">26th August 2002, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Its really very interesting to see the posts on different perspective. Now its my turn to say about BaaN interms of integration aspect. BaaN is superior interms of security and middleware development. <br />
<br />
BaaN uses its own middleware architecture called XMA Extended Middleware Architecture. But the only disadvantage is that  it doesn't expose its middleware to any other systems. You always have to depend on BaaN like u need to buy OW from BaaN. In the case of SAP, it supports the similar BOI concept which is called as BAPI and moreover there is no dependency like OW.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">26th August 2002, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been live on BaaN IV for 3-1/2 years now.  When our company was in the selection process, I was lucky to be able, to see demonstrations of the other ERP systems that were &quot;in the running&quot;.  I can honestly say that none of them could touch BaaN's manufacturing/distribution modules.  Finance leaves a bit to be desired in the reporting arena, but we have gotten over that hurdle thanks to a very capable IT department.  <br />
<br />
If the reference to integration not being tight pertains to the transactions that come through via the integration module in Finance, then I have to highly disagree - integration is as tight as you build it to be, and trust me, if a stray hair so much as falls into the wrong warehouse in our setup, it will be caught.<br />
<br />
We have had great success with importing payroll data, and have automated the collection and posting of labor transactions via barcode.<br />
<br />
As with all ERP systems, much of its success will depend on the discipline instilled in the users - the more training and documentation of procedures that you provide to your users, the fewer problems you will encounter.  This is not to say that the software is without its bugs.  Patches are a fact of life, but BaaN Support has made great strides in resolving cases in a timely manner (at least the Support Group that we deal with).<br />
<br />
All in all, if we had to do it over again, I think that BaaN would still be our number one choice.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maaxim</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 01:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Friends....this is a good topic...especially so at this point when we are seeing rapid changes in the market-place. The mergers-acquisitions are a daily news. ERP systems therefore are also embracing change.<br />
<br />
Baan is definitely a strong ERP and especially so for the manufacturing-centric companies. No other ERP, except SAP can come close to Baan in this area. The only thing which one of the members pointed out was about the word-of-mouth publicity that Baan wont be around for long due to whatever reasons....I believe the PR exercise must be taken more aggressively by Invensys-Baan in US and Europe. iBaan must be positioned vis-a-vis mySAP, PeopleSoft, JDE or Oracle Apps....maybe even better. <br />
<br />
I sincerely hope that we get to see iBaan / BaanERP in the news - whether printed or electronic which will do a lot of good to the Baan community as a whole. <br />

Because the tales from the  press on overview and highlights cannot beat the inside and deep knowledge we have about baan and the statisfaction it brings to our companies.<br />
<br />
I think there are more companies like the one I saw recently: they started with Baan back in '92. The cost of buying, implementing and ownership of Baan was payed only with 1) reduction of production time (17 weeks to 6 weeks) and 2) reduction in warehouse inventory. It still pays them off...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As of earlier this year, support for Baan IVc3 would remain in full support untill 12-31-02. After 1-1-03, it was set to go into limited support (this may have changed in the last 3 months however as A&amp;D was only supported on c3 and not yet c4).<br />
<br />
Baan IV c4 would continue to receive full support until 12-31-03, limited for one year after that.<br />
<br />
All BaanERP products will continue to receive full support for the immediate future.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Just an FYI, however.  Due to economic conditions, there may be further cut-backs at Baan Support. This may increase responce time. Last round of cut-backs occured this past June.</div></div><hr />
