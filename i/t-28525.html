<br />
We have a typical situation in Government supplies. <br />
we sell out put (Wheat, Rice etc) to Food Corporation of India(FCI).<br />
<br />
1 the FCI makes the payment on the basis of an interim rate declared by Govt. of India. Some times the final rates come after a gap of two-five years.<br />
<br />
for all invoices a claim has to be lodged and booked as revenue for the respective year as profit and loss adjustment.<br />
<br />
can i configure the system to get the claim for diffrential amount from the system? if yes, how?<br />
<br />
<br />
2 FCI issues it under various welfare schemes, some of which are applicable in our state as well.<br />
At times the FCI adopts a system of partial (subsidised rate) payment by beneficiary department to us directly and the balance is released by FCI.<br />
<br />
my users can out bound the inventory only once. <br />
<br />
how should i configure the system to get the invoice for diffrential amount from the system.<br />
3 in case of para 2 also the procedure for 1 follows which means a third invoice for same quantity.<br />
<br />
Please guide.<br />

<br />
You can always use debit notes. In case there is some problem, then why don't you invoice for the 2nd or 3rd time with Cost Items.<br />
For cost items we need not to have inventory and you can alawys add lines for them in the same sales order.<br />

<br />
Say today u hv raised a Sales order for X Item Qty 10 pcs. The same had been invoiced.<br />
<br />
Now after some time u come to know that u have to raise invoice some further amount on the same 10 Pcs by Rs 50.00 per Pcs.<br />
<br />
So You have got a Cost Item (say &quot;OTHCHARGES&quot;). You add this item in the same sales order in 2nd line for 10 Pcs @ Rs. 50.00. Process Sales Order and Raise Invoice. For releasing Cost Item we dont need any inventory.<br />
<br />
In case u want a different description on Invoice, Use Line Text.<br />
<br />
Hope the same is clear to you.<br />
<br />
