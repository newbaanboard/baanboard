<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ianmerlane</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently investigating rolling out Baan IVc4 for a company, to several countries, including Japan and India. Does anyone have any information regarding the localisations for these countries? Are the localisations legally required in those countries, or are they just functional differences?<br />
<br />
Any information would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are also in the process with Baan to get India localization for Vc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">satish_174</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I think it is very much required as every country has own set rules and laws which needs to be followed. Then for ERP to run in one country it must fullfil its requirment. Like here India, we are using ERP LN 6.1 and we started in month of Jan 2005. till now we don't have indian localization available. Even though we are dying to go live but it is not possible to go live. Because our current software doesn't covers VAT, Central Excise, Sales Taxes etc. <br />
<br />
Thats where it is most required..</div></div><hr />
