<br />
Though I am late in replying to the query, I hope the users will benefit whenever such query arises in future.<br />
<br />
In Infor ERP LN6.1 FP7, this problem arises in the Purchase Order Line or the Sales Order line, where the system tries to find the Registration Number (BP) in combinationn with the BP Tax Country.<br />
To solve this, the BP Tax Country field needs to be shown in the Purchase Order Line.<br />
In Purchase Order line, go to View, go to Personalized Grid, there the BP Tax Country should be brought from Hidden to the Visible. Also the position of the field should be placed before the field of the Registration Sequence (BP). Save it and come out. Done.<br />
<br />
In Infor ERP LN6.1 10.4 version, this BP Tax Country should be brought from Hidden to Visible thru- In PO or SO line, on extreme right corner there is small wheel, thru which go to Personalize form, and do it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
