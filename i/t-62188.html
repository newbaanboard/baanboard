<br />
I need to print invoices for one customer from 2007 till 2011. Is there a way to print them in one batch, or do we need to print individual invoice?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<br />
Alternatively temporarily bit raw workaround can be to copy sales invoice layout  to another and put  a print condition in all layout that customer is that specific only .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvr210</div><div class="date">9th April 2012, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your reply. I tried using &quot;Print Sales Invoices&quot; session, but unfortunatlly, the only option on form 2 is to print range of invoice numbers. This doesn't help me, as you can imagine the range is not sequential.<br />
I tried to use a query with in a same session, but than I can't print. <br />
<br />
As far as your second solution, I'm not sure I understaned what should I do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th April 2012, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">What hitesh is suggesting is to maybe clone the report to a new report.  Then edit that report and put something in the print expression for the layouts that would only print the invoices for the specific customer.  Something like &quot;tdslsxxx.cust = 1234&quot; - so it would pass all the information to the report, but only print that specific customer.</div></div><hr />
