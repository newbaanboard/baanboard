<br />
NOw we are running session tdsls5201m000 with Delete - Yes<br />

<br />
This is strange: in my system session tdsls5201m000 does not offer any delete option. Sales orders should be deleted with tdsls4227m000.. Can you check if you are using the correct session, please?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">10th June 2008, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as i understand you need the following procedure:<br />
<br />
(1) Delete the order position (with status 7)<br />
(2) Delete the order header (after all positions are deleted)<br />
(3) Run the session tdsls5201m000, now all History data which have no current data (in tdsls040/tdsls041) will be deleted.<br />
<br />
If you have no archive company you will loose your historical data e.g. for turnover querries etc.<br />
<br />
You can check the parameter session tdsls4100m000, mask 4, &quot;Method of deleting order data&quot;.<br />
<br />
Marking the session in the menue tree, pressing F1 will give you some usefull hints.<br />

<br />
(1) Delete the order position (with status 7) -- Through Which session?<br />
<br />
(2) Delete the order header (after all positions are deleted) -- -- Through Which session?<br />
<br />
(3) Run the session tdsls5201m000, now all History data which have no current data (in tdsls040/tdsls041) will be deleted -- That is what i have done , but it is not getting deleted.<br />
 4) We do not require historic data of sales. So if it is deleted that's fine.<br />
<br />
Can you help with step 1 &amp; 2 please.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards,<br />

<br />
if I understand correctly you want only delete the sales order history data and not the sales order data, so session tdsls4227m000 &quot;Archive and/or Delete Sales Orders&quot; which was introduced with SP 16 is not helpful for you. <br />
Also with SP 16 there is a new session tdsls5202m000 &quot;Archive and/or Delete Sales Order History&quot;.<br />
<br />
What is your actual SP level?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Juergen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">11th June 2008, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) Delete the order position (with status 7) -- Through Which session?<br />
<br />
(2) Delete the order header (after all positions are deleted) -- -- Through Which session?<br />
<br />
Both could be done manually.<br />
<br />
But if you only want to get rid of the history data -&gt; this is not your solution, because yould would loose both, sales order data (current) and history.<br />

I want to get rid of history as well as order hearder nd lines. <br />
I went to help of session tdsls4223m000 Process delivered sale order. It says this will delete sales order and line.<br />
But there is no option in session which ask/confirm  me to delete the order and line.<br />
And Martin as i told you i dont have session tdsls4227m000 in my baan.<br />
We are at SP 14. <br />
So i think i should get SP16 which will give me session tdsls4227m000 and tdsls5202m000 which should serve my purpose.<br />
But till my question remails..If there is option YES/NO to delete history in session tdsls5201m000 why it is not getting deleted.<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Manish</div></div><hr />

<br />
    Sales order lines are only deleted if a number of criteria are met:<br />
    - the backordered quantity must be 0<br />
    - financial transactions must have been created and the turnover history<br />
    updated<br />
    - the project for project-related sales must have been archived<br />
    - if the order is an installment order, the customer must have been<br />
    invoiced for all installments, and the order must have the status<br />
    &quot;Closed&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe some steps remain to be done in your system that prevents the orders from getting deleted.</div></div><hr />
