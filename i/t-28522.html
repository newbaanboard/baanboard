<br />
We have a typical situation in Government supplies. <br />
we sell out put (Wheat, Rice etc) to Food Corporation of India(FCI).<br />
<br />
1 the FCI makes the payment on the basis of an interim rate declared by Govt. of India. Some times the final rates come after a gap of two-five years.<br />
<br />
for all invoices a claim has to be lodged and booked as revenue for the respective year as profit and loss adjustment.<br />
<br />
can i configure the system to get the claim for diffrential amount from the system? if yes, how?<br />
<br />
<br />
2 FCI issues it under various welfare schemes, some of which are applicable in our state as well.<br />
At times the FCI adopts a system of partial (subsidised rate) payment by beneficiary department to us directly and the balance is released by FCI.<br />
<br />
my users can out bound the inventory only once. <br />
<br />
how should i configure the system to get the invoice for diffrential amount from the system.<br />
<br />
Please guide.<br />

   I have to say that i am no Finance user and the reply was the result of a passing interest. What i could tell you is that this is somewhat the simplest way of taking care of your problem. Your customer account will be hit properly with the amount you invoice and there is no need for any outbounding of inventory and no involvement of any distribution session. Once you conduct the tests you will find out for yourself what i stated above...<br />
Steps are <br />
=&gt; Maintain Sales Invoice Header {tfacr4100m000}<br />
  =&gt; Maintain Sales Invoice Lines {tfacr4101s000}<br />
=&gt; Print Sales Invoices {tfacr4410m000}<br />
=&gt; Post Sales Invoices {tfacr4220m000}<br />
<br />
Hope this is handy..<br />
