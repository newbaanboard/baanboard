<br />
I am sure, Baan system (Now called Infor) is a very strongly ERP System. But in China, just few people know few knowledge about Baan system.<br />
<br />
What's wrong?<br />
<br />
Infor company should think about this situation.<br />
China have a big market in ERP field, but just few customers are using Baan.<br />
Reason I think as below,<br />
a) Price is higher than expect.<br />
b) Sales policy is nor correctly in China.<br />
c) Chinese localization is not enough.<br />
<br />
For a and b, it's the issues of Infor company. But c, many customers have the responsibility. For example, the forums of Baan system will be setup every year. But few Chinese people will join it. Even Chinese people join it, for the Chinese habit, they will just listening, but will not raise up their hands, and said, Chinese people need this function.<br />
<br />
We can see, India, Japan, even Portuguese have their localization, of course, there is a Chinese localization, But it's just for Reports. (Even the Finance reports Chinese localization is not enough for Chinese Finance Goverment).<br />
<br />
An erp system, if lost the market, where is the future of the product?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">30th December 2007, 02:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan ERP is a very minor player in the market now, not only in China, but also in the worldwide market. ERP Ln only get about 100 new customers in the whole world after it launched in 2004. <br />
<br />
Most Baan implementations in China are actually rollout of the system from foreign companies.  After the leaving of Acer and HTC, there is almost no big Chinese manufacturing companies using Baan. The local sales force is very weak and the sales guys like to put their attention on the install base to cross-sell other applications.</div></div><hr />
