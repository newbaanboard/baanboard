I suggest you use a company in stead of a person. Feel free to have a look at our web site (www.triceps-it.com) and see if you think we can do the job for you. You will find the contact info there.<br />
If you have vpn or modem, this will do in the initial reviewing stage, along with phone conversations.<br />
Kind regards<br />

<br />
I have more than 8 years of experience implementing, training and supporting BAAN IV Project, Distribution and Finance and I am available at the moment.<br />
I understand that you are in need of somebody helping you to review your current set up and to get a good assessment with recommendations to move forward. This is based on the posts you placed in the Project forum in the past and as Moderator of that forum I will have a good understanding what is going on with your system.<br />
<br />
I also suggest to go through a customized training so that together with your users we can discuss the basis of BAAN IV Project and its integrations with Finance and Distribution. From there we will optimize your system.<br />
<br />
You will not have to deal with multiple consultants from one company. There are enough experienced BAAN Project consultants out there that know about doing the right thing for your company and that have experience with integrations from Project to Finance and Distribution.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in me helping you with the issues on hand please mail me at evdborg@hotmail.com.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edwin</div></div><hr />
