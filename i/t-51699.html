Please check the IDT 10061038 in your mapping scheme, I think you have not mapped for that.<br />

<br />
Please check in the ACP Parameter(Under Tax Tab), India Localization check box is cleared for &quot;Include Tax component in Invoice Accrual&quot;<br />
Also ensure that after match and Approval, you are getting the <br />
Purchase clearing Ledger for the Non Expensed tax values (Which has been linked for the tax code as Purchase CLearing)  as Debit. <br />
Also confirm that the ledger accounts attached with the Aggregate tax code contains proper tax rates, calculation and contains all the respective relevant ledger.<br />
After then Finalize the Purchase Invoice Batch and then While running the session    tfacp9235m00l, please select &quot;Claimable at receipt&quot; check box only.<br />
Do let me know the outcome, I wish you should get the desired results.<br />

I have gone through your attachment, and prima facie it seems fine. <br />
<br />
My opinion is that in ACP paramater please clear the selection Include tax component in Invoice accrual, by doing so, you will get the Excise clearing account debited after match and approval, and when you will run the session Post non expensed tax, then this account will be credited and Cenvat credit will be debited.<br />
<br />
 Also Please compare the Purchase Ordered items and it's localization (Linked tax Code, Excisable, Cenvatable, RG23A/C) for which the system is allowing to process session tfacp9235m00l.<br />
<br />
 Also confirm from Infor about the latest solution which need to be installed, because we are using this session(tfacp9235m00l) smoothly.<br />
<br />
Do let me know if anything improves.<br />

<br />
Even after removing that check box also it is not coming. <br />
For vat related entries it is posing well. only for excise related entries it is not working. <br />
<br />
 Observation is - For Whatever the order we generate it is giving same order no. ( &quot;pur000080&quot; ) in the error message. <br />
<br />
Is there anything to delete in some table  or anywhere it is hanging ?.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
