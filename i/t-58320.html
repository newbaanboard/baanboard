The feature used for return the inventory from staged location to bulk location in case <br />
<br />
1)	Material has been picked and sales /production order is canceled .<br />
2)	If Material is picked  X pcs but you want to ship only X-Y pcs so for return of Y Pcs from staging location to Bulk location the functionality is used.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1:- Create one sales order for material “0088-0020” for quantity 10 pcs.<br />
Release the order to warehouse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 2:-  In warehouse perform the activity   a) Generate outbound Advice <br />
				b) Release outbound Advice<br />
				c) Generate picking List<br />
Step 3:- generate picking list, System automatically create shipment for that Picking <br />
<br />
Step 4:- While shipment you decided that you are not going to ship all 10 materials , you will only allow to ship 5 material , for this you need to double click on shipment line ( Shipment line shouldn’t be freeze) <br />
<br />
You need to change the shipped quantity.<br />
<br />
Now freeze the shipment line and capture the GPD. And confirm the shipment .<br />
<br />
Once you confirm the shipment system automatically activate the option Return Not shipped goods.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 4:- Click on the option system generates one transfer order from staged location to bulk location ( To generate the transfer order automatically you need to set the order series and order type into “Default order Type by Origin” )<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it will Solve your problem</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have created a Sales order for 30 Units, Shipped 27 Units and COnfirmed the Shipment. For the rest of 3 units, I have used the return not Shipped goods to have a Transfer Order created to move from staging location. <br />
<br />
But when i try to generate and release advice for this transfer order, system is giving me an Error Message &quot;Outbound Shortage&quot;. BUt when i check my inventory, the stock on hand says 3 Units in the staging location. <br />
<br />
Note: This is a serialized item. <br />
<br />
Am i missing any step here? Thanks in advance for you response.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Rama</div></div><hr />
