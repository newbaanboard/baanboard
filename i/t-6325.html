<br />
Can we copy data (lets say Tax Code :tcmcs0137m000 Maintain Tax Code) from one company 800 (VRC1) to 151(VRC2) that have a difference VRC; and from one company 800 to 810 that have same VRC ? <br />

Can you give us some more information? For example: you talk about &quot;data&quot;, yet it seems you want to copy a session (?). What is it you exactly want to copy?<br />

What I mean is data that we allready entry in session Maintain Tax Code (not the session). The purpose is avoid double entry in 2 company (beside avoid error typing).  If this can be done, so it can be done with other data from other session.<br />

Thanks,<br />

It's getting a bit more clear what you mean, although I still have some questions. But let's try to answer yours first.<br />
<br />
1. If I understand you correctly, you want multiple sessions in different companies to update the same table. That is no problem if your companies have the same Package Combination. You just have to create a logical table in BaaN, wich can be done by session ttaad4120m000. Here you define your logical company (for instance, companies 110 and 120), while you create the fysical table in fysical company 100. The following action is to link the tables in the two other companies (for instance 110 and 120) to the fysical table you just created in company 100.<br />
If you do this, users that work in companies 110 and 120 all update the one table in company 100.<br />
Maybe this is not what you mean at this moment. Yet, it is an option after you have copied the data that exists so far. I mean, after you copied the data into one table, you can put this table fysical in company 100, while you have your logical tables in 110 and 120. <br />
Important note: if the Package Combinations are NOT the same, this is NOT an option!<br />
<br />
2. But ok√©, option 1 is for the future perhaps. Right now you want to copy data from one company to the other. That should not be a problem when your tabledefinitions don't differ. AND you need to be shure that you will not get in trouble with your referential integrity. So, as a principal differing VRC's do not have to be a problem, as long as your datadefintion doesn't differ.<br />
<br />
Maybe I understood your intentions the wrong way. In that case, don't hesitate to enlighten me!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">you can create sequential dump of the table from one company and load that dump in another company to create the data. While loding you have the options to append, create, overwrite, etc. the existing data if present. For doing this you have to use tool sessions ttaad4226m000 and ttaad4227m000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">...and then there is also Exchange, or copying the data on a database level (my personal favorite).</div></div><hr />

Actually my knowledge in Baan is just average (close to dummy maybe), so will I try solution that Chandra offer ( :) By the way, name &quot;Chandra&quot; use for both male&amp; female in my country, it mean &quot;the moon&quot;, right ). But  I interest in Francesco say about copy in database level. If we use SQL Server 7.0, how can we do it ? (It difficult to find Baan table in SQL Server for me). Maybe Francesco can explain to me more clearly ? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">21st August 2002, 05:28</div></div><div class="posttext">In SQL 7, database level, you can use three methods:<br />
<br />
1) By use of DTS (Data Transformation Service) - you can schedule how often you want to move data from one table to another.<br />
<br />
2) Stored Procedure - You can write a stored procedure to copy table to another table. You can also create a DTS job that will execute the stored procedure automatically.<br />
<br />
3) Trigger - This is what I would recommend. You can write a trigger that will synchronize two tables real-time without user interaction. Pretty neat.<br />
<br />
On Baan level, I would recommend Exchange. I do not recommend Sequential Dump sessions due to the fact that you have to re-organize tables after the sessions to re-create table objects. Besides the fact that your table is not usable until you finished re-org, SQL 7 is not very friendly to this type of sessions so you have to watch out for your transaction logs and disk space.</div></div><hr />

Benito &amp; Francesco mention about Exchange for copy data. For me that topik are very new, because I never know that modul exist. I try to find something that mention about it, but I can't get it. So can somebody explain to me (in detail I hope) how to do that, because I want to avoid mistake when I try in the first time?<br />
<br />
NB: Sorry if you feel that  I am asking a stupids question<br />

<br />
The module for maintaining Exchange Schemes is present under Utilities. You have to maintain sessions first under master data and then under export and import modules. Read session help for each session and it gives the fair idea how to go about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would use exchange if you need to export / import data WITH text ...<br />
<br />
if there is no text, use bdbpre /bdbpost<br />

<br />
Below is a sample of SQL7 trigger. The two companies exist on different VRCs. What this does is whatever record you insert on company 500 is duplicated automatically into company 400. The code is one way, but you can create another similar trigger on 400 table to get it to work two way - which means whatever you insert on 400, would be duplicated in 500 too.<br />
<br />
I used the table tssma111 (Service Area) as an example and it works great. Real-time updates, no user interaction.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
if exists (select * from sysobjects where id = object_id(N'[dbo].[Service_Area_Insert]') and OBJECTPROPERTY(id, N'IsTrigger') = 1)<br />
drop trigger [dbo].[Service_Area_Insert]<br />
GO<br />
<br />
CREATE TRIGGER Service_Area_Insert ON dbo.ttssma111500     <br />
FOR Insert AS<br />
<br />
if (select count(*) from inserted i, baandb..ttssma111400 em<br />
	where em.t_care = i.t_care) = 0<br />
  begin<br />
	insert into baandb..ttssma111400<br />
	select *<br />
	from inserted i <br />
  end</div></div><hr />
