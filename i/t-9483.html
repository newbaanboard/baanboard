<br />
As per Baan documentation this supposed to replace the original item or transfer.<br />
<br />
Has anybody used this functionality? Thanks a lot in advance.</div></div><hr />

Yes, we've simulated the item transfer procedure before. It's more of an advanced warehouse administration procedure, hence access to it should only be given to the person with highest authority in inventory management. It's supposed to transfer stock from one item code to another, e.g. in cases of receipt against a wrong PO line<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">14th April 2003, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on BIVc4. To accomplish this requirement we are using warehouse orders. First we delete inventory of one part(Wrong one) &amp; then create inventory in other part (correct part). <br />
<br />
This is followed to rectify receipts recorded against wrong purchase order line.<br />
<br />
But the problem in this procedure is While performing actual costing (Indian localization) system doesn't pick up any rates for the inventory created &amp; new inventory is valued at 0.<br />
<br />
Is there any better way to this in BIVc4. Migration is not feasible at this stage.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I happened to use this functionality at one of my client's site.<br />
This basically we use to transfer the stock(inventory) of one item to other item.<br />
Suppose you have 10 pcs of inventory for Item A and 20 pcs for Item B.<br />
If you transfer 10 pcs from A to B, then then inventory of Item A becomes Zero and Item B becomes 30.<br />
<br />
But it doesn't replace the item(delete Item A).<br />
<br />
This feature is just for Inventory transfer.<br />
<br />
Correct me ,if i am wrong..<br />

<br />
We use the PCS warehouse orders functionality for such cases (B4c4), firstly transfer of inventory from one standard item to another standard item. Secondly transfer of inventory of customised item to standard item / vice-versa, in both cases it works perfectly.</div></div><hr />
