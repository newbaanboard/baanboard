I am after a little bit of help please.......not only am I new to baanboards.com, but I need some information on CRP.<br />
We are running BaaN IVc4, with Supply Chain, and we are looking at introducing Capacity Requirements Planning.<br />
<br />
I am looking to obtain some information on/from Companies that are currently using CRP - either successfully or unsuccessfully, and also to find out whether they use the module in BaaN or a separate bolt-on package.<br />
<br />
We have a scenario here where we could have one machine to make many part numbers, or one machine, with many tools to make many part numbers, making it in effect a many to many relationship.<br />
<br />
I would be interested in hearing from you and hearing about your experiences/advice, as well as receiving any other contact details of anyone else that you think may be able to help.<br />
<br />
We are hoping to commence the project in July so would like to hear from you as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />
