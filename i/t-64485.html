We are planning to migrate to FP7. Was just wondering if in=place upgrade is possible or not? Is Fresh implementation of FP 7 and migration of Data the only way out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Standard Migration tools work, and it will be a lot simpler than doing a fresh Implementation, You will still need to migrate the data. Which is what the tool will be doing for you.<br />
