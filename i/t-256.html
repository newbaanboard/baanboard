<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">9th October 2001, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I was a developer in Baan India (Jan 97 - Dec 98). For our Baan training we used VT100 dumb terminals. Once in the development environment (windows 95 machines) we had the option of using an editor of our choice (phew - no more vi!). I started looking around for some good windows based editors and ended up with Textpad and Ultraedit. <br />
<br />
Textpad had a very good pleasing interface but did not have syntax coloring. I wrote the first syntax list of Baan for Ultraedit. With a few modifications done by others over time it is available for download at http://www.ultraedit.com/ . <br />
<br />
I have created an initial version of such a file for Vim. I need to refine it before I submit it. For now cast your vote:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">10th October 2001, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">In my company all of us use Multiedit. Just as Vamsi, I wrote syntax hilight and indent macros. Another advanage is the possibility to open many windows, compare versions, hilight changes etc. Multiedit can undo even great global actions. Of course it is fully customizable.</div></div><hr />

I 've also used wordpad and notepad and they're quite sufficient for those of us who are not not &quot;super programmers&quot; :)  Lemmy is quite good too</div></div><hr />

It combines the functionality of Windows functions (like Copy/Paste) and also has all the functionalities (that I can think of) of Vi<br />

Thanks for pointing WinVi. I meant to put WinVi and I put it up as ViW (too much time spent with ViM :)). This is a no nonsense fast Windows based Vi editor. You can download it at http://www.winvi.de/en/. Most developers within Baan who like Vi, use this.<br />
<br />
Pat, could you edit ViW to WinVi and also point it to the above url?<br />
<br />
For those of you who love Vi, you should check out the various flavors that are available at http://www.thomer.com/thomer/vi/vi.html</div></div><hr />

Some collegues have developed a syntax file for Baan so the standard functions are shown in colour. They even developed some macro that can insert idents, adding a header, comment out lines, document lines in such a way that you can rever to the customisation adminstration module within Baan.<br />
<br />
Since I love vi, it works for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We used VT100 dumb terminals for our Baan 4 training. <br />
<br />
In the development environment (windows 95/NT machines) we had the option of using an editor of our choice, I still continued to use the VIW- the VI for Windows software. <br />
<br />
I  somehow still like to use the good old VI even if it doesnt have any of those jazzy windows/GUI features as color highlighting, etc. I did see and try out some editors downloaded from the net, but still got back with VIW.<br />

I am mostly a vi/vim/gVim user but having to develop in Coldfusion MX7+ made me install this last one - I found more language support for crimson that for vim. Now I rarely use vim (except when working directly in a Linux box).</div></div><hr />
