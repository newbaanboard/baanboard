<br />
One of my client want to implement Baan in China factory But he want to run the same from the exisiting server from Singapore as a seperate factory/office .<br />
<br />
1) Is it possible to implement both english and chinese or Mandrine language in the same server?<br />
2) Can we get the data/report in local language Chinese/Mandrine in China and the same report in English at corporate?<br />
3) Do we require additional software to implement chines/mandrine language? If so what will be the cost.<br />
4)If the client is already having Baan in Singapore and India with Indian localization what will be additional cost for Chines localization and it is possible to implement the same server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)  Yes. Actually installing it in both languages is often the only option, so that a non chinese admin can operate the system.<br />
<br />
2) Yes<br />
<br />
3) You need to install the chinese language on your existing installations and (very important!) you need a multi byte installation. If your currentinstall is not multibyte, then you need to start fresh!<br />
<br />
4) Costs are depending on your support contract, I guess. But even if you need a second installation of baan, then it can reside on the same server, if it is a UNix system. If it is a windows system, then it needs to be a chinese windows, otherwise it will not work.<br />
<br />
Good luck! Implementing Baan in china is a challange for sure.<br />
<br />

Not sure if this has been solved. I may share my experience on Chinese localisation, installation nad implementation of BaaN IV.  Or even I may join the team as I've already finished my assignment in China. <br />
Nice day,</div></div><hr />
