<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">2nd February 2010, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The product support of Infor mainly in ERP LN 6.1 any release has detoriated to such an extent that their development team at Netherlands and Hyderababd - India, doesn't accepts any bug in the system and straight forward comment the same as a PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT. Do these people know what is PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT.<br />
<br />
I have identified such bugs and listed them in ERP LN 6.1 which these guys telling as product enhancement. These guys just don't want to work. I don't what's there problem is, whether they don't understand the business process and business best practices needs or just don't want to work. This type of attitude had lead ERP LN 6.1 a untimely death in India, which was once a very strong clientbase for BaaN.<br />
<br />
I admit that there may be mistakes while development but this guys should be open minded to accept this. Thus the product will become robust. <br />
<br />
I think Infor should look into this instead of revamping its www.infor365.com every now and then. <br />
<br />
When there will be no clientbase, then there will be no use of this www.infor365.com<br />
<br />
I think the support of BAANBOARD is far-far better than that of Infor365. Here in BAANBOARD you can get quality solution or no solution not a piece of crap like &quot;PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since this is your second post with the same text I am wondering if you can give us an example of what you did report as an bug and Infor didn't wanted to fix.<br />
<br />
In my opinion support has been worse before. I have to admit that it sometimes depends on who is handling your inquiry but you can always call your account manager to 'escalate' it.<br />
<br />
I do have some experience with Oracle Apps too and they have their problems as well. They respond very quickly but before something is fixed it takes ages.<br />
<br />
SAP support seems to be pretty good what I have heard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">3rd February 2010, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference between an enhancement request and a defect is whether or not the session is working as designed.<br />
<br />
For example, let's say that when you create your database user, you think that baan should assign the DB user a random password instead of letting the sysadmin enter one. Local law may require it, security experts may say &quot;that's absolutely required&quot;, and it may make absolute sense. However, that's not a DEFECT. The session was designed to allow you to enter the password. It is doing that and doing it well.<br />
<br />
It's important to get fixed - and it will - changes like that are accepted, but they go into the next release.  <br />
<br />
You save the changes in functionality for major releases, you fix the bugs in the code in minor releases for the version you're on.<br />
<br />
That's the standard SDLC, that's what the software industry has been using as it's basis for years and years. Look at any common software product, you don't see oracle releasing a new, better way, to handle datafiles in a point release. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">3rd February 2010, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the knowledge sharing on standard SDLC. For your information, I also belong to a very big software company which has multiple products under its profile. It has got some big companies to prove its satisfied clientbase and hence SDLC is not a new thing to me.<br />
<br />
Check out how SAP handles its support. The question is these Infor guys cannot differentiate between Product Enhancement and Bugs. When the concept in a particular business subject matter is not good you cannot design the system. How can these guys claim a BUGGY system as a standard process????<br />
<br />
The fact is that all these fucntionality are being developed by people who are just fresh from colleges and lacks business knowledge in Infor.<br />
<br />
Just check out why Infor-ERP LN 6.1 met an untimely death in India which was once a very big marketplace of BaaN. The reason is Localization - Indian Statutory which Infor developed was not at all suitable and was hardly matching with the business process.<br />
<br />
This was not in case of earlier BaaN Global Support. Till today the Localozation in BaaN IV is the best. Companies which is in BaaN IV is not taking risk for migrating to ERP LN because of localization. Those companies which have migrated or in the course of migrating either is repenting or thinking of other option though they standard product is good.<br />
<br />
The question is though the product INFOR ERP LN 6.1 is very sound, but the people who supports it is below par. Infor requires some good quality and subject matter experts to be as Support AGent, not novices who cannot understand the difference between PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT and BUG.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">3rd February 2010, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Saikat,<br />
<br />
The reason that changes in functionality, or design issues are considered an enhancement is that it will take serious time, thought, effort and QA to resolve the problem. unlike a bug, they can't locate a flaw in a chunk of code, fix that, unit test, regression test and then release a patch. <br />
<br />
To redesign a process they have to do a macro/micro design, this involves going to SMEs for the particular area (for example indian localization they may need market research, or legal input) followed by extensive coding, unit test, regression test, integration test, etc.<br />
<br />
If you're familiar with the SDLC then you should realize how developers work. You can only create a defect against a piece of code if the code isn't compliant with the requirements. If the requirements don't cover something, than that is a recognized problem - but it's not a bug. It's usually a Change Request or something similar. It requires the Business Analysts to get involved to help determine the solution.<br />
<br />
My experience with Baan support is that if you can clearly articulate the problem, are able to reproduce it, give them the appropriate traces and an actual error is being generated that most support folk will log it as a defect and it will get resolved for your current release (eventually).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">3rd February 2010, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Dave<br />
<br />
I fully understand the process you have mentioned and agree with you. My experience with BaaN Support is also good but the old one i.e. www.baan.support.com<br />
<br />
There are multiple instances when you can see the error or defect in front of you in ERP LN 6.1 processes, even your support agent also admits that a glitch, but the product development guys back in Netherlands and Hyderabad-India just copy paste help information associated with it. They are just adament to accept any glitch or bug. Even that glitch is basiccaly missing one line in code, which I can understand happens when you develop such a big functionality. <br />
<br />
For example you just check &quot;Vendor Rating Functionality&quot; in ERP LN 6.1 FP3. You can come up with the basic and glitch (BUGwhich this guys tells as PRODUCT EHANCEMENT<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">3rd February 2010, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">So are you saying that the website is the issue? I'm having a bit of a difficulty following you. I thought we were discussing product defects in ERP LN.<br />
<br />
If it's the website, then I really don't have a comment. I don't really care for infor365, but i also thought support.baan.com was bad. <br />
<br />
If it's the product, and you have clear errors, abends, etc and the developers are coming back saying that it's an ER. then I'd raise it with your account manager. <br />
<br />
In my experience the Account Managers work more for the customer than for Infor (it's been a few years for me. so that could have changed) but the account manager in the past have been able to turn around those types of issues. To the point of getting mean when they need to.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">3rd February 2010, 22:08</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that you are not my getting point. <br />
<br />
The point is standard of product support during old days and after Infor took over BaaN the support detoriated  like anything. Even during the SSA days it was better. <br />
<br />
Do you know one real fact about Infor - Hyderabad, India ERP LN 6.1 development center??!!! Maximum resources are subcontracted from third party and they are freshers from colleges who god only knows whether have business knowledge.<br />
<br />
One thing I like to mention in this forum that whenever you discuss with these guys they bring the reference of BaaN IV. Infor ERP LN 6.1 being a superior product than BaaN IV why these guys are comparing? If at all they are comparing why don't they develop the localization as same as that in BaaN IV. DOUBLE STANDARDS !!!!<br />
<br />
It's not the website I am talking about. I don't care about the website if the issues, bugs, glitch or defect ( X whatever u call X) are solved.<br />
<br />
Regarding Account manager.....hah!!! better not to discuss.<br />
<br />
I am not using this forum to criticize Infor or there way of doing the things. Why Infor doesn't follow the SAP way of Product Support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">3rd February 2010, 23:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so we're discussing support, not the website. you must have been using the website to mark eras (baan, invensys, ssa, infor), which got me confused.<br />
<br />
Having previously worked for Baan support I do have knowledge of the various support and development centers. I know quite a few very intelligent developers and analysts that came out of the Hyderabad R&amp;D and support offices. I do agree that turnover there is a major issue, however that has been an issue for 10+ years and i don't see it getting better any time soon. Which is why I use the US based support staff at all times.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's useful or fair to compare Infor support with SAP. Baan is just a product in the Infor portfolio, where SAPs entire business revolves around the SAP product. SAP is significantly more successful than Infor and had more resources to put into staffing and keeping good talent.<br />
<br />
That being said, I don't think Infor's support is horrible, they do a good job with very little. As a matter of fact you can frequently get more from the Infor support than you could from an industry leader (they have more to lose than SAP does if you're unhappy, for example).<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a conversation on here one of these days that isn't just support bashing. There are folks at Infor that read these boards, there's no reason why the baanboard community and the BWU community couldn't band together to help infor support it's customers better. <br />
<br />
Baan has a lot of advantages, and not being an industry leader could put Infor/baan into a position to be more flexible and responsive to customers needs. But those discussions never happen at a community level, all you hear is &quot;support sucks&quot; and &quot;be like SAP&quot; which really doesn't help anyone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">4th February 2010, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, after all you agreed to my point. I also know some intelligent developers and analysts that came out of the Hyderabad R&amp;D and support offices, but it's sad that they are no longer associated with Infor.<br />
<br />
I am not comparing Infor with SAP. The discussion is the standard of product support in ERP LN 6.1<br />
<br />
I also agree that BaaN as a product has got lot of advantages, in manufacturing and planning there is no product which can be comparable but SUPPORT??? :D . <br />
<br />
I fully understand that Baan is just a product on Infor's portfolio. One thing I am not clear is that why Infor is not bench marking SAP Support regarding Baan. Why Infor is not aiming higher.<br />
<br />
Baanboard is an independent site if I believe and what we are discussing is in open forum. It will be better if Infor people read this and try to amend there ways before there clientile erodes.. :o Its high time.....<br />
<br />
Just tell me any new famous account win for Infor ERP LN 6.1 globally???</div></div><hr />

The best support centre was Grand Rapids (no I wasn't part of that team, but have spent some time there).<br />
<br />
IVc4 is solid, that's why it still has the biggest footprint out there - V was promising (like all versions, it doesn't really work until they get to dot.three remember IVc2?)<br />

Can't comment on LN. haven't worked with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">4th February 2010, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">The argument about enhancement or bug with Baan Support has been there as long as I can remember.<br />
<br />
There are two key things to remember:<br />
<br />
1)  One man's meat is another man's poison.  You may think that something should be changed - others think it is just fine the way it is.<br />
<br />
2) Changes in design may impact much further than the immediate issue in question.  Therefore they need to be very carefully considered in the context of the whole design.<br />
<br />
That being said, I sympathise with the general point.  There were things in Baan IV that were done in a particular way for reasons that we simply could not understand.  We used to assume that Boeing asked for it that way...............</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">12th February 2010, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a couple of things I'd like to state here.<br />
<br />
I perceive the Infor support from working with it in various roles, namely as a customer myself, as a consultant working for my customers, and also as a subcontractor working for Infor partners.<br />
<br />
The thing with support is, it really depends. It depends on who you get as your first level contact. There are very experienced guys and girls there, but also some, that are really a pain to work with. Unfortunately, those are the ones that stay in memory.<br />
<br />
It also depends on how well you qualify your incident and if you are able to reproduce it.<br />
<br />
And - and that's understandable but questionable - it really depends on how strategic you are as a customer for Infor. The rule is: First the big Infor customers, than the smaller Infor customers, then the big customers of the partners, then the small Infor customers. If you're a small customer of a partner, your chances getting a bugfix for a malfunctioning software functionality that only you are using are close to zero. Paying support fees or not - Infor is BIG ERP here.<br />
<br />
In the percentage of incidents I filed where I knew that I was talking about a bug (and I am a qualified consultant with more than ten years of experience, I don't file an incident withount *knowing* that something's fishy), I'd say (from feeling, I have no metrics) that only in 10% of those cases I got my solution quick and without cumbersome discussions.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had situations, where three different customers reported a situation as a bug, that could be fixed with probably a single line of code (DEM ignoring tools authorizations): &quot;Works as specified, will not be fixed&quot;.<br />
<br />
I had situations, where I could pinpoint a bug indicating the line number of the source where the bug was, and it still took a lot of time to get a solution - a solution that was implemented differently and did not really solve the issue.<br />
<br />
I had situations where I could pinpoint a solution number that made functionality, which was available before, but seldom used, not working any longer. And got long statement back from the supporters, that this wasn't a bug, but intended functionality. They did not even look on my paper.<br />
<br />
I had situations where I needed a couple of hours to explain the software functionality to the supporter.<br />
<br />
I had situations where a bug was admitted to be a bug by Infor, but was not fixed because this would be too complicated and my customer was to small. It was an issue where sales turnover statistics are wrong when using schedules and cross-period deliveries, so, Infor, if you really want to get into the automotive sector, you should better care for that issue...<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way: That was one of the few automotive projects, and an early one, and I had to iron out about five severe bugs in the sales and purchase schedule functionality. It was really a pain to get something through the firewalls and to the guys who could fix it. In such a situation, where Infor is *knowing* they delivered banana software (ripening at the customer's site) that no customer is using yet, I'd really expect the firewalls between customers/consultants and development pretty low, but in particular in this project it was always hours of talking on the phone to get the supporter to file a defect.<br />
<br />
On the other side, my dear customers:<br />
<br />
I've seen customers filing support incidents like &quot;Order 4711 cannot be processed&quot;<br />
<br />
I've seen customers filing support incidents for every missing label to collect ammunition against Infor when fighting about project costs<br />
<br />
I've seen customers on veeery old service packs filing incidents.<br />
<br />
I've heard from Infor that about 80% of the incidents are NOT bugs, but handling problems, enhancement requests etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
In such a situation, dear customers, what do you expect a support consultant is used to: That a filed incident is a bug, or that a filed incident is &quot;just another of those silly RTFMs&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
But again, on the other side, dear Infor: Against what criteria are you measuring your support personel: How fast they close the incidents. Thats ok. But, as far as I've heard, also how often they file a defect. And that's a veeery bad metric. Because it makes filing many defects bad for the supportes. So they don't do it. And that's exactly why the Infor customers perceive the Infor support as lousy: The supporters are not seen as a helping hand, but as bouncers standing between a problem and it's solution.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have to disagree with this a little bit. Or maybe just qualify it.<br />
<br />
In my experience, if you have a solid, reproduce-able bug then it will get fixed regardless of the size, or perceived importance of your company.<br />
<br />
When I worked for support I told Boeing &quot;No&quot; plenty of times. they didn't like it, they raised it to my management, we stood our ground and told them No. <br />
But in the end, wasn't a  bug, it was working as designed.<br />
<br />
Contrarily, I fought tooth and nail to get a bug, that I knew was a bug, could show was a bug, was obviously a bug - fixed for a small 20 user company. <br />
<br />
The difference between the large companies like Boeing is that if support/R&amp;D says &quot;no&quot; they'll just go to Infor's PSO (Professional Services) and pay them make the fix they need - This is available to everyone mind you, but the large companies utilize it more, which is why it may appear that they get whatever fix they want.<br />

Defects get priorities, you need to be able to present a problem to the developers in a way that proves that it merits being worked on. <br />
<br />
The point was that baan support will help you get what you need fixed regardless of the size of your company or the size of the problem.<br />

<br />
You have to do this especially if it is in a Baan VRC.  The minute you fix it and have an issue Infor will not support it.  And yes we have tracked down several errors to the exact line of code and had to wait several service packs to get the fix.  And I think you are correct the larger the user base the quicker they work on it.  As it is we are on A&amp;D and there will probably never be a LN version of this so I figure eventually we will move to Oracle Apps.  It was scheduled to start this year, but has been pushed off again for some studies.<br />
<br />
Plus I do not think we should have to tell support how the software works, they should know.  The support tends to vary - one time good and then one time bad.  I have not had to deal with them in a while - I guess that is good.</div></div><hr />
