I have searched a lot on baanboard and baan support site, but was unable to get any functional documents on Distribution, Inventory, Stores, Purchase,Finance, Manufacturing specific to a Company, particularly Co's in India.<br />
Can someone help me out in getting these documents ?<br />

The only difference is in localisation. The rest are same for all companies. The actual business process mapping is very specific to a company and is proprietary/confidential. Can you please clarify your question again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skamat</div><div class="date">21st September 2005, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. I agree that the actual business process mapping is very specific to a company and is proprietary/confidential, but still I am looking for them- as I said, specific to a typical Indian Company.--just to get a better idea/concept about the functioning of a particular department within a typical manufacturing Company in India who would have implemented all the modules successfully.<br />
Any type of flowcharts about the process - department specific are welcome.<br />
