Just the routing table issue. However, when I used worktop to login, it says invalid username and password. Where else I have no problem accessing it in local LAN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">3rd November 2006, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, first, I am not a systems person.  At all, and I don't have a solution, but I will share my experience.  We need to connect remotely to an LN / Linux setup, and we can VPN into their network but not use Worktop because they need to register every IP address somehow for Baan/Linux, and when you use a VPN, the IP address you are given is dynamic when you are on their network...?   They are good systems people and have not been able to work it out.  Someone mentioned it's the same as it is on AIX, so maybe this is also your problem.<br />
Our solution is to have a PC on site that can run worktop on the network. We VPN into the network, and connect to that PC using VNC (similar to PC Anywhere), and run Worktop that way.   We do this a lot for various reasons.</div></div><hr />

It is working fine. Only problem is Localisation access is slower than Standard Software.<br />
<br />
When we login to the VPN via Internet we get the local IP automatically which have been configured in our Linux VPN Server.</div></div><hr />

As this is in my opinion a different topic I recommend to start a new thread for this.<br />
