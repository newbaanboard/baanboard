 <br />
We are running B40c4 and India Localization is5.  I was trying to introduce Sales Tax Form tracking thru. BaaN.  I think something is missing, and the sessions are not working.  I am neither able to issue Forms nor take a pending report.  Here is the detailed procedure I followed to test out the transactions.<br />
<br />
1.   Maintain Form Type Master (tdind0123m000)<br />
<br />
2.   Link this Type to a Sales tax code (tdind0177m000)<br />
<br />
3.   Attach this code to a supplier in session maintain localized  data for the supplier<br />
<br />
4.   Make a Purchase Order on this supplier with the sales tax applicable flag set to &quot;Yes&quot; both in header and line. <br />
<br />
5.   Make receipt and approve the same.<br />
<br />
6.   Post &amp; Finalize in Finance.<br />
<br />
7.   Register the invoice, match &amp; approve the same, and Finalize.<br />
<br />
8.   Generate Purchase register (tdind0214m000) <br />
<br />
9.   Print Purchase register <br />
<br />
10. Till this point, everything is OK.  I have purchased as well as booked the document, but not yet issued exemption Form (Say, Form 37) <br />
<br />
11. Now if I try to print tax form TO BE issued for Purchase (tdind0477m000), it should show the above invoice pending, but returns &quot;No data within selection&quot; <br />
<br />
12. Anyway I try to issue Form 37 and maintain the same in session tdind0159m000.  Here again there are problems. <br />
<br />
13. I insert new line, maintain Form Number (say 1), and specify Form date. <br />
<br />
14. Then it must allow me to enter the amount, but it skips the field and goes to Supplier Field<br />
<br />
15. I fill up supplier, Sales tax code &amp; PO No. and &quot;save&quot; <br />
<br />
16. Now it allows me to the amount field, but does not take any value other than zero (any other value does not get saved). <br />
<br />
17. If I press &quot;Continue&quot;, it will take to session tdind0160s000 - Maintain Tax Forms Issued for Purchase order lines. <br />
But here, line insert option is disabled, no lines present and header amount field is blank.<br />
<br />
Please tell me if anything is missing above.  Also let me know if any documentation is available in this regard.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Best regards<br />
