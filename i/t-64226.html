<br />
I want to combine two or more billing requests in one invoice. The corresponding sales order has two lines for the same item with different warehouses. The shipment numbers are different &amp; I am creating different billing requests for different shipments. When I am generating the invoice, it is generating two invoices where as I require it to be combined in one invoice only.<br />
<br />
Environment is ERP LN FP7 with India Localization.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to do this?</div></div><hr />

I have already made the settings as given in the thread. But still the issue persists. I can have single invoice for multiple shipments by combining them under one billing request. But I want to combine two or more billing requests to create single invoice.</div></div><hr />
