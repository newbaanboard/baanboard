<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">13th June 2006, 10:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks for clarifying. So basically you want per item, the followinf information:<br />
- item group<br />
- item group descr<br />
- quantity delivered before current month<br />
- quantity delivered during the current month<br />
<br />
Correct?<br />
<br />
So you declare two variables of the same domain as tdsls045.dqua, you name them let's say hist.dqua and curr.dqua. Don't forget to initialize them before your main selection query.<br />
<br />
Also declare another four variables of type long, call them for instance year, month, first.day &amp; dummy. Before the main select (or in the before.program section or whereever you fancy..) you fetch the first day of the current month by using num.to.date(date.num(), year, month, dummy) and then first.day = date.to.num(year, month, 1). <br />
<br />
(Hope these date functions work for Baan IV also, since dates work very different in Baan IV, without utc... However these functions are for number of days, so should work for Baan IV..) <br />
<br />
The selection on tdsls045 has to be of course ordered by item. Now per selected tdsls045-record, you check the delivery date (in Baan V it is field dldt): if tdsls045.dldt &lt; first.day then hist.dqua = hist.dqua + tdsls045.dqua else curr.dqua = curr.dqua + tdsls045.dqua every time an item changes and you send a report line, you will have to of course again initialize the variables hist.dqua and curr.dqua...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know please if you managed...<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
