<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st July 2017, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this a lot controlled item?  Does the inventory have a lot on it?  Those are some of the things I would check and if necessary adjust off and adjust on the inventory to the correct lot. Or maybe just go thru table maintenance to add a lot.  Those were what first popped into my mind.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th July 2017, 04:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure lot control is on for the item.  On our system someone turned off lot control for all items and we had to fix a bunch of stuff.  The table I looked at were tdltc001, tdilc102, tdilc111 - plus tdilc401 and 402 to fix outbound and inbound.  I would start there - but that is based off our system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">14th July 2017, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">You can basically take a look at allocation field in tdilc101. Also try running tdinv0252m000 to check if allocations are mismatch? Are you based in India?</div></div><hr />
