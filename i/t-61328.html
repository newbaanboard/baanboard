Payment of Supplier Invoices are done through Cash Management. We would like to get details of payments for a range of dates, which include information like;<br />
1) Invoice number<br />
2) Vendor code<br />
3) Vendor name<br />
4) Check number<br />
5) Date of payment<br />
6) Amount<br />
7) GL transaction<br />
I checked the system and do not find any reports in Cash management which gives the above details. The detail number 7 is fine and could be a special requirement. The rest should be available as a standard report. Please let me know if there are any standard report that gives the above output or do we need to customise this as a report in Baan ERP LN (FP5).</div></div><hr />
