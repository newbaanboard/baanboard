Migration to  ERP LN FP7 from Any Version of Baan is Possible. The complexity and effort increases if alll trsnsactions are also needed to be migrated.<br />
<br />
As as far as migration of Master Data with Open transactions is concerned, I think most of the INFOR Partners in India can help you out in this with few even good at it.<br />
<br />
If you are planning to migrated all the transactional data of FP2 to FP7 please also ensure that all trasactional data on cut off date (the date on which data in FP2 will be migrated to FP7) should be migrated to FP7 on as is where is condition(i.e if a production order has 7 operations and on cutoff date,  3 operations are carried out in FP2 and few BOM items are also issued to the production order, after migration in FP7 you should be able to carry out the rest of the operations and due cost updations in FP7).<br />
<br />
In Case of any further queries plaese revert back.</div></div><hr />
