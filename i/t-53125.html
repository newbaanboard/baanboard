All Baan Users in India ,<br />
<br />
   This is Amitava from Informix - India Software Lab ( IBM) . This is I want to let all of you know that Informix is again back in India. We have a strong strategy and future goal for current and future years. We are currently organizing our old BAAN ( Infor LN) Informix customers in India and resuming a direct relationship with them . We are currenly doing it on the basis of our old database we had.We are in very much fear that we may miss some of them in this activity. So please come up and shoot me an email at amitacha@in.ibm.com. We are here to guide you against Informix on Baan. We support all versions of Infor Ln. And also we came up with couple of new releases with very good features. Our latest version is 11.50. More we can discuss once you shoot me an email to resume the relationship we had earlier. I will be very much happy if I see your email in my email box and expecting you will flood my inbox. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance <br />
