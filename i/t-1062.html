<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">15th February 2002, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">A very common occurrence on the board is for people to post snippets from the Baan Tools Help. It would be nice if this information was on a website (Baan's own or on Baanboard's). That way we would not be posting the contents of the help file over and over; we could just hyperlink the relevant pages as part of the solution message. We may even see a reduced number of simple queries.<br />
<br />
Is there someone on this board who can get Baan to host that themselves or get permission to let Baanboard to host it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good help Documentation on Baan Tools is few and far between. It would be great to have a web resource covering this. <br />
<br />
It would help if Baan posted their PDF files to the web, if they don't want to spare the resource then they should allow others to do so. (Hey Pat perhaps an opportunity for some official sponsorship?)<br />

<br />
Yes indeed a good point. It would be very useful if Baan made documentation available in a convenient, easily referable format.<br />
<br />
Note that Baan have made some Quick Guides available at ftp://ftp.support.baan.com/documents/tools/ but the format and descriptions are not convenient to be hyperlinked.<br />
<br />
Indeed good Baan Documentation is scarce - and something which Baan/Invensys (and other partners) have not put much effort into.  About 18 months ago Patrick and I were approached by a publisher to write a book on Baan. The lack of decent Baan material was clearly evident and we wanted to help.  Our proposal got accepted, but we could not make time in our work/personal lives to dedicate to such a massive task.  But I think this website is even better than the book - the quality of posts here are as good as any documentation around, and allows for other members ideas, perspectives and solutions as opposed to just our own.<br />
<br />
Having Baanboard host (or link to) official documentation would be very helpful for everyone involved in Baan.  We're looking into this already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">15th February 2002, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Carefull what you post guys.  Baan does not want to share their documentation.  As an Ex-Baan Employee, I know that when I was an employee, I had to contact different managers all around the world to get permission to even read some documentation.  There is a whole site they called the barns102 server.  You wouldn't believe the material there.  Some partners had access to the site, but didn't mean they had access to the documents.<br />
<br />
If Baan is not sharing this information between departments, they will never share it with the outside world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">15th February 2002, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Toolswizard,<br />
<br />
I also worked for Baan and I also know about the barnsxxx servers. And yes, Baan does not share easily but Baan is not Baan anymore from 2,3 years ago. You start with a 'No' and you might get a 'Yes'.<br />
<br />
Mmm, makes me wonder how many members on this board are ex-Baan people? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">30th March 2002, 23:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Good warning!!<br />
Even the baan intranet for baan developers(http://baandev-secure ) is not open to all in the R&amp;D centre. Lots of documents are password protected and special permission has to be obtained from BaaN, NL to access them. <br />
And most BaaN employees, when they quit, they amass as many documents as they can from the intranet. <br />
And take care before u guys post anything in public!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">30th March 2002, 23:47</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a site in the BaaN intranet which houses lots of valuable documents. The URL is http://training<br />
try this link and u may get lots of valuable documents, probably used for training purposes. It will need username/passwd. But then ur NT username/passwd whould work.<br />
<br />
Yes. I was a BaaN employee during mid 1998 and mid 1999, in one of the 'Application Development' team. Later, in 2001, I was associated with one of BaaN's  Sales and Marketing office as a baan admin person.<br />
<br />
Would be thrilled to meet ex-BaaN guys that worked in BaaN's India Development centre at Hyderabad, India</div></div><hr />
