my company is starting a new business, which has nothing to do with what we do now. We want to implement BaaN as well in this new business but we will have to do a new implementation.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is this :<br />
The business is about recycling industrial packaging. What we do is : we go to a company and pickup the packaging they need to get rid of. We charge them for this service. After that, we clean those packaging and sell them to our customers.<br />
<br />
My problem is, how do I implement this in BaaN? I need a stock transaction in my warehouse to book in all those packagings that I will later on sell to my customers after cleaning them, but those pacakgings have no cost to me, instead, I charge my &quot;supplier&quot; for going to pick them up.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I can think of is to do a purchase receipt with price 0 and after that a manual sales invoice for the transportation, but this does not allow me to link both things (unless I customize the system). <br />
<br />
I would like to know if there is something in BaaN standard to manage this kind of process.<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />

<br />
Years ago I did an implementation somewhat simular as this situation, it was about the recycling of waste paper. The solution was to have purchase and sales orders, with a positive quantity and negative purchase price. Your logistics then sees a incoming flow, production, and outgoing flow for sales. From the financial side the purchase order will result in incoming money, as for the sales order. Only one customization had to be done (all other things were checked, not a problem): the domain of the price should allow for negative amounts, which took about 5 minutes to complete.<br />
<br />
If you want to know more, don't hesitate to contact me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">6th October 2009, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the purchase will always be linked to one sales order? How are the items defined? Do you intend to get a new item cide for each pick up? I think this is a simple buy and sales transaction. The purchase price can be zero, but then how do you reflect the cost of pick up in your product ( I am not sure if you need it). <br />
<br />
Apart from costing issues I don't think it is complicated. You may have to customize for linking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">7th October 2009, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">in this case, sales and purchase were linked by using transportation. for purchase price can be negative, costs for picking up are handled in transportation using subcontracting. you can use standard items, or customised, depending on the needs regarding the stock positions. The items you pickup can be used in the production bom, so stock will be clean.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
yout solution seems fine to me, but can you tell me what happens with items cost price. (If purchase price has negative value, is standard cost price negative also?)<br />
And next, if we do something about packaging, we also have some costs about it - is there need for the item to be manufactured then?<br />
<br />
Regards!</div></div><hr />
