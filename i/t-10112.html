<br />
We are going to change our Baan server , We are currently using <br />
Hp-Ux 11on a L2000  and one of our new possible servers is IBM's p650 and p670 with aix.<br />
<br />
Does baan work with Aix ?<br />
Is there anybody already using baan with aix ?<br />
<br />
We are currently using Baan IV c3 and Informix DS 7.31 and want to migrate to Oracle with the new server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">23rd May 2003, 04:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We run BaanIV c on AIX and have done so for 5 years<br />
<br />
We have two IBM pseries 620 machines that each run baan with oracle rdbms.   Previously we had IBM rs6000 J series machines running baan and oracle.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that there are many users with IBM machines and AIX.<br />
<br />
We are very happy with our hardware and are happy with BaanIV subject to Baan's future viability. <br />
<br />
Assuming that Baan will be purchased by someone who wants to keep it going, I expect that will see some change/improvement in their attitude (with a fresh management).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">23rd May 2003, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">We also have customers which run Baan IV on AIX + Oracle. It is working fine. There are also very large installations on this platform (IBM-AIX). <br />
 <br />
 We have a customer which runs BAAN IV c3 on AIX 4.3.3. The database is ORACLE 8.0.4 and the porting set is rather old, 6.1c.02.02. <br />
<br />
 Does anybody know if we can upgrade to AIX 5.1 ??? Did anyone perform this kind of upgrade ? Should we upgrade the porting set, or not ? <br />
<br />
 As far as I know, some patches should also be installed when I upgrade the porting set to the latest version. We have NOT installed patches for a long time. BAAN IV c3 does not have PMC. This is why it is difficult to install patches. There is another choice of upgrading to BAAN IV c4 but this is not an easy task. A lot of software should be changed/rewritten.<br />
<br />
 Is anyone using BAAN IV c3/c4 with AIX 5.1 / 5.2 ? <br />
<br />
 The customer also wants to upgrade to ORACLE 8.1.7.4. For this upgrade it is obvious that the porting set should be upgraded to 6.1c.06.02 or later, if I am not wrong.<br />
<br />
 Any advice regarding this issue is welcome. <br />
 Thank you,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alick Wilson</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a BaaN solution (81837) that allows pmc patches to be imported into BaaN IVc3.  This will then allow you the easier option of 'just' upgrading the porting set version rather than the BaaN version.<br />
<br />
BaaN always recommend upgrading to the latest porting set.  The current version (6.1c.06.07) allegedly has some fixes to known problems with the Oracle 8 drivers / libraries.  As usual, do as full a test as possible to determine what problems you may encounter before installing into production (function server calls spring to mind).</div></div><hr />

What happened to the AS/400 and S390 porting sets for BaanIV?  I remember doing a pilot of an AS/400 installation at DelMonte in the UK, and that was with BaanIV!  At that same time a pilot of BaanIV on S390 was also being tested.<br />

<br />
Baan had never a portingset for BaanIV on the AS400. For the OS390 both versions (BaanIV and BaanERP) exists. <br />
<br />
NvanBeest, how could you do an install on BaanIV for DelMonte?<br />

 <br />
<br />
Like I said, it was a pilot!  And it worked!  We had people from Baan India and IBM Seattle on stand-by, and got it running after two days of struggling.  But it seems that it never made general release.  Too bad...<br />

We are on AIX 5.2 and Baan IVc4 and porting set 6.1c.06.07 and O Boy.... this is fast. I think all the AIX versions are supported by Baan. We were on HP-UX 10.20 before. I like AIX and p650 servers.</div></div><hr />
