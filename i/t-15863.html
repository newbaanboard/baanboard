<br />
We have recently upgraded service pack, following is our current BaaN software configuration<br />
<br />
BaaN Version : BaaN IV c4<br />
Service Pack : 15<br />
Localisation : IN5 ( India Localisation )<br />
Operating System: Win 2000 Advance Server<br />
Database : Ms - SQL Server 2000<br />
Porting Set : 6.1c.07.03<br />
Webtop Version : 3.0<br />
<br />
When i execute session ttadv3130m000 Maintain Reports and on compiling report it gives me standard error. Refer to the enclosed screenshot.<br />
<br />
Same error also comes when i generate a new session using standard session ttadv2290m000.<br />
<br />
This problem was not coming when we were on sp14, after installing sp15 only it has occured. Has anyone faced this sort of problem after upgrading to sp15 ???<br />

<br />
Check to make sure you did not have to install a new version when you installed your service pack or check if any of the other includes needed to be changed as a result of the new service pack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And this is the case, this is a known problem with 3 missing tables and has been discussed already, check the thread: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=15770&amp;page=2&amp;pp=5&amp;highlight=report+problem<br />
<br />
Always make sure that before you install a Service Pack that you carefully  read the installation guide and also look in the Baan knowledge base for the latest &quot;solution&quot; information about the Service Pack to install, the solution nr. is even mentioned in the SP install guide.  Latest found problems are mentioned in that &quot;solution&quot;.  Always plan in advance!</div></div><hr />
