<br />
We are facing a problem while doing Map &amp; Post integration Transactions.<br />
In a group company environment initially problem came for 2 companies.<br />
It is BDB error NO.=0 fatal error is coming.  (Detected Database server Termination). <br />
<br />
We re-organised  tfgld456, tfgld465, tfgld467, tfgld468, tfgld481, tfgld482,  tfgld483, tfgld487 tables also. <br />
<br />
In between we found that it is not working in the entire group. No error log is found in  log.bshell except bdb error 0.<br />
<br />
One observation is ... If I select full range for field &quot;User Group&quot; in tfgld4281m000 (map integration tran)or tfgld4282m000 (post integration tran) system is showing &quot;detected database server termination&quot;. If we select related single user group it is showing no data within selection and Posting completed. But, nothing is happening against that process.<br />
<br />

<br />
I can't give you a specific solution but our experience may help you to narrow the focus before you need to contact Infor Support. What Feature Pack of LN 6.1 are you using? Are your patches/solutions up to date? If you enter from/to ranges for Integration User Group, does the process complete successfully (that is, maps and posts) or does it fail to complete but just does not result in an error message?<br />
<br />
I recently (Jan-March 2009) had a similar situation during initial testing and validation with a client that was implementing LN. <br />
<br />
In our case, the primary difference was that the implementation was Single/Single, not Multisite. We were running LN 6.1 FP3. Patches were presumably up-to-date but I did not personally check to confirm that all relevant solutions had been installed. <br />
<br />
When we ran Map Integration Transactions with &quot;Post&quot; also selected and with all selection options set to wide open defaults, the session errored out. It did not kick us out of LN (i.e. did not end the bshell). I did not save a screen capture (see next paragraph) so I'm not certain that the error message was the same that you have documented. I do recall that if I entered values in any option range (for example, the first and last valid IDTs, not just Integration User Group), the session/process completed successfully. I think that when I ran the &quot;Map&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; sessions separately, I did not get the error but my recollection may be faulty. I did not find any &quot;helpful&quot; entries in the error log.<br />
<br />
At the time, the client was not not yet in production and the error was an inconvience, not a show-stopper. Before I took time to make screen captures and log an incident with Infor, the client upgraded to FP5 and installed all patches. After that, the error condition did not recur.<br />
<br />
I had not previously encountered that error condition in other implementation of LN 6.1, SP1/FP1, FP2 or FP3 (including single/single and multisite) so I assumed it was a bug at some point in FP3. <br />
<br />
It is always possible that a localization for India contributes to your specific error but my experience would suggest otherwise.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Thanks for the inputs. We are ERPln 6.1 - fp2.<br />
<br />
we don't have problem in other  companies. It is in a particular vrc.<br />
one new observation is 'read.element.groups () tfgld4457' error is coming in the bw messages. In Bshell log 'bdb error 0' is coming. <br />
<br />
