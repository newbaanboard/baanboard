Try to open session &quot;Verify Labels by Software Component&quot;(dcstt1470s000), but fail. System gives following errors or fatal errors:<br />
Error: Read row error 506 o dccom100000 (error 506)(dccom.scsm.log() in object odccom100)<br />
Fatal error: Error 506 (Table does not exist) on select<br />
Fatal error: Can not continue in dcstt1470s000 in DLL: odccom100(dccom.scsm.log)[retry.point]<br />
<br />
Table of dccom100 for target company has existed in Database level. <br />
The session also has linked with corresponding forms, and form dumps in English are present in the application folder on the file system.<br />
The same problem is met when try to open session &quot;Verify Components by Language&quot;(dcstt1430s000) and other sessions in DC module. But DC has been in the target Package Combination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its suprising you got this error... I didnt knew that BaaN was delivering the &quot;dc&quot; package which is called as &quot;Internal Tools&quot; to the customers. I was involved with the &quot;dc&quot; package.<br />
<br />
The DC package tables exist is the company-000. You might try to create that table dccom100 in the company 000. This table has only the session log info. <br />
<br />
This table is updated whenever a dc session is used. If you create that table, the problem with both the sessions will be fixed.<br />
<br />
BTW, these utilities/tools have been moved into the standard tools &quot;tt&quot; package, with the latest changes. You might check up with BaaN Support for more details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am so happy to know you!<br />
First of all, I would introduce myself. I am Amy, member of BALTC(Baan Asia Localization and Translation Center). I am a technical support. Now there is a translation project needing our support on Baan5.0b. <br />
<br />
How can I create this table in company000?<br />
1.Login in Baan with superuser linked company000, then use session &quot;Create Table&quot; ?<br />
But I have tried. It gives messages &quot;0 tables created&quot;, and I checked in Database level, no such table for company 000 existing</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess the non-tt tables wouldnt be created using the Create Tables session. Hence you have to use the GTM.<br />
<br />
I dont know if you have the access to common installer program which we developed which creates the tables in company-000 and also puts some setup data for other modules like TCS, FIS and STT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. You have to create the table dccom000 in the company-000 from the GTM session (ttaad4100). The standard tools sessions create company does not create tables for other packages than tt in the Company 000.<br />
<br />
2. If you have the script source-<br />
<br />
Comment these lines -<br />
<br />
if dccomdll0001.set.compnr(0) then<br />
		exit(0)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
and replace with <br />
curr.comp= get.compnr()<br />
e = compnr.check(000)<br />
<br />
and replace <br />
<br />
dccomdll0001.set.compnr(1)<br />
 <br />
with -<br />
e = compnr.check(curr.comp)<br />
<br />
I hope this should help you to fix the problem.</div></div><hr />

During the installation, we haven't installed the Source Scripts.<br />
So what should I do?<br />
<br />
I meet the same problem in our another Server with Baan5.0b + standard SP11+ SP11_k. But I have checked an environment in Baan Korea: Baan5.0b+standard SP11+sp8_k + Oracle 8, and the DC sessions can be opened, but table dccom100000 doesn't exist in the DB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Did you do the Create/convert runtimes for the dc domains and  Tables ? if so, then you can create the tables.<br />
<br />
2. if the problems still persist, I think then you have to contact the IS (information systems, BaaN Administrators) at NL or India to get the correct DC package dumps.</div></div><hr />

I have created RDD, but it still persists. dccom100 is table for &quot;DC Session Log&quot;.<br />
<br />
Which informations will be recorded in this table?</div></div><hr />

As I explained in my previous posting -<br />
<br />
When I open any session in DC module, all give error message about Error506:dccom100 table does not exist.<br />
<br />
This is the solution to that problem -<br />
1. You have to create the table dccom000 in the company-000 from the GTM session (ttaad4100). <br />
The standard tools sessions create company does not create tables for other packages than tt in the Company 000.<br />
<br />
I have created RDD, but it still persists. dccom100 is table for &quot;DC Session Log&quot;.<br />
<br />
You have to create the table as explained above.<br />
<br />
Which informations will be recorded in this table?<br />
<br />
This tables has the log of all the dc sessions which are started by any user and its statistics.</div></div><hr />
