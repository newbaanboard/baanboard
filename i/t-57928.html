<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">4th March 2010, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is rather complicated. You will meet at least three categories of issues:<br />
- functional : you must decide whether your customization is still required; some requirements that needed customizations in Baan IV may be covered by existing LN functionality<br />
- conceptional : there are so many differences between BaaN IV and LN flow of operations; many customizations may have to be redesigned deeply<br />
- technical : moving software components from Baan IV to LN is in common not possible with Export/Import Runtime DD or PMS; there is a lot of manual work.<br />
<br />
Of course, your effort depends on number of customizations you have and how deep they touch standard functionality. There are major table changes in practically all modules - new tables, old tables renamed, domains changed etc.<br />
Many sessions are different than they were in Baan IV, so if you used AFS to perform some tasks, you must redesign your code. Even if you used only your own tables, you still have to redesign your application to make it consistent with LN &quot;look and feel&quot;; there are dynamic forms, no more &quot;choice.user.*&quot; events and many other changes.<br />
<br />
So IMHO its is not impossible to move your customizations to LN, but it is not easy at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
        Well, I think it is possible to migrate all your customizations on baanIV to INFOR ERP LN. <br />
 <br />
        As LN FP2 already has indian localizations. Only thing is a good functional analysis is required on the customizations done in baanIV. All the customizations must be mapped to the LN functionality. <br />
<br />
        Once the functional analysis is done, from the Technical point of view, it is not a big issue to move the customizations from baanIV to LN. <br />
<br />
        LN makes your business to flow more smoothly. Ofcouse, it has extended functionality, more user freindly and good interface.<br />
<br />
        I recommend you to migrate to LN.<br />
<br />
       You can contact INFOR sales office near to your place in DELHI or MUMBAI.<br />
<br />
       All the best.<br />

Hello Baan 1234,<br />
<br />
Sumesh asked if he can transfer the customisation &quot;as it is&quot;, and that´s usually not possible. There are too many technical changes between Baan IV and ERP LN, therefore usually all customisations need to be checked and in most cases redesigned before they can be migrated to ERP LN. But as Grzegorz said, it´s not impossible but not easy at all.<br />
<br />

<br />
     If &quot;as it is&quot; refers to both functional and technical point of view then, you are correct.<br />
<br />
     There must be some changes we need to adjust technically. <br />
<br />
     Note that functionality need not be redeisgned always. Unless, the customizations done in baan5 cannot fit in LN functionality or it is completely changed in LN.<br />
<br />
     If the customizations done in Baan5 fit in LN functionality, then it is even more easy to migrate.<br />
<br />
     In any case, It doesn't mean that we cannot migrate the customizationis from Baan5 to ERP LN. <br />
<br />
      It requires some afford both from functional point of view and once the functional mapping is done, most of the efford required from technical point of view. <br />
<br />
