<br />
BWU Solution Partner Summit<br />
<br />
Time: 10:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. <br />
<br />
The 2003 Solution Partner Summit is an opportunity for executives from our Sponsor companies to interact with select Baan executives in an intimate forum. As a continuation to last years theme, Strength in Alliances, this year the Summit will focus on how to make that strength a reality. Remember that as a BWU member, there are no registration fees for this event; however, the RSVP deadline is January 31.<br />
<br />
To RSVP or for more information please email Amanda George at ageorge@bwu.org.</div></div><hr />

Contact BaaN User Club of India (BUCI) for more information. I am sure the company where you work must be having the contact info. I think BUCI conducts such user meets twice a year.<br />
Good Luck!!</div></div><hr />
