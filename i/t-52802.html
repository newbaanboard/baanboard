When you create Aggregated Tax Code then select Assessable Value for Excise instead of Order line. It solve your all problems</div></div><hr />

In Baan IV C4, there are two sessions, one is related to Basic Price in the Sales Module and other is ASV in the Excise Module. When we make a Sales Order for a particular Item, the Basic &amp; ASV is pick from that item for defined customer.<br />
<br />
I also find this session in the LN6.1. It is located in the India Localisation in the Submodule &quot;Other&quot;. now you see the session tcind1404s000. May be it is the right answer.<br />
<br />
is it correct or not.<br />
<br />
wait for your response.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
I dont know what is the scenario of yours in baan c4. What I understand about your problem. Just try the below mentioned solution. <br />
<br />
My collegue has told you that first of just create a tax code with Ass. Value for excise and Ass. value for VAT lines. And then it will pick up the value for excise from 'Ass. value for excise' and for VAT or local tax or CST it will pick up the value from 'Ass.valur for VAT' lines. <br />
<br />
Now if you are in purchase order then just go to TAX tab in hte purchase order line there you find the 'Ass.value for excise and as well for VAT.<br />
<br />
If you need any further clarifications revert back.</div></div><hr />

Use tcibd9138m00l to note down the ASV values which will be eventually used in Orders.<br />
Here, the assessable value ( ASV ) is defined for an item and a business partner. The value is specific to &quot;Duty/ Tax Type : sales tax, service tax, customs and excise duty&quot; and is defined for orders originating from &quot;sales, purchase, transfer (manual) and production&quot;. The effective &amp; Expiry date can be set here as well.<br />
The remaining things are explained by Krunal &amp; Vinod.<br />

Because in Sales order and in purchase order the entry field is different. <br />

<br />
We want the assessable Price for our Finished Good, which was be sales to our customer. Now the problem is where we maintain that price. So, when we insert the SO line the price related to a particular item is pick from that session. In the present sceniro we insert the Ass. Value manual in every lines.<br />
<br />
Pl suggest is any session is avilable for this process in LN 6.0 (SP0).<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />
