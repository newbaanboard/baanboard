<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keni99</div><div class="date">1st May 2008, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
current we implement SalesPlus, but we use ERP LN 6.1 <br />
Integration to CRM is only in one direction: from ERP to CRM and only read <br />
data. <br />
I'm very interested to get to know other customer/companys which use SalesPlus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">2nd May 2008, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
It's nice to have a contact of somebody else using CRM too.<br />
<br />
How have you found the integration?<br />
<br />
Been a bit of a nightmare to get it working for us, but finally in our test environement I have managed to integate domain data and BP.  <br />
<br />
Have you done any customisations to the CRM screens?<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
SandraP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keni99</div><div class="date">2nd May 2008, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Our Integration is only read via Select-Statement from ERP Database. We read BusinessPartner and also finance Data (invoice data). <br />
<br />
In CRM we entered new BusinessPartners first (in this case BP is not a right BP, we send it only a offer). <br />
I case this BP moved to a right BP and get us a order, we enter it twice in ERP with a new BP number. To have the CRM-BP-Number also in ERP we use a available field in ERP for this and put the CRM number manuel.<br />
For synchonization we have customized that CRM-BP get in a separat field also ERP-BP-number. Based on this ERP-BP-number we can read mkore data from ERP (maybe finance).<br />
<br />
From ERP we read also item and pricebook, but this is only one way - from ERP to CRM.<br />
<br />
Im CRM itself we have many screens custimized, yes. (to much, for my liking).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Baan/Infor get not very many informations about Roadmap for Sales Plus. I ask different Infor Consultants and manager, but nobody get informations.  My idea is to found more SalesPlus-customers in order to get informations, other ideas and help among themself - and to have a &quot;speaking tube&quot; to SalesPlus development.... <br />
Do you know, is there such more ore other forum or user groups for Sales plus? I will found more Customers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">6th May 2008, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have had difficulty finding other CRM Sales Plus users too, you are my first!<br />
<br />
We have spoken with Infor too reference their road map, although not really getting a straight answer, I feel Sales Plus will not get developed anymore and they are pushing the Epiphany product.  They say Sales Plus does not integrate with LN and we should be looking at Epiphany when we move.<br />
<br />
We are using the latest versions of Openworld to integrate.  We have been running CRM stand alone for a number of years and when we came to integrate the two systems, Infor said there was no way of integrating the two databases.  But I have found a way to tie in the BP link through the relevant tables.<br />
<br />
We have made screen changes to nearly all of the screens!, and I think they will be asking for a lot more now our company is pushing CRM.  Our users would prefer to have a tab screen rather than using the explorer type navigation, so this will probably be my next area to work on. <br />
<br />
Kind regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you running Sales Plus on Windows XP as well as Windows Vista? <br />
<br />
Have you had any Vista related issues? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Hari</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">16th October 2008, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hari,<br />
<br />
We are running Sales Plus on XP only.<br />
<br />
But to be honest with all the issues we have had with it and also it's age, we are in the process of looking for another CRM product as SalesPlus can no longer fulfill our needs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Sandra</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ramamurh</div><div class="date">17th October 2008, 05:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sandra,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response. <br />
<br />
We are planning to continue with Salesplus on Vista since it is not feasible to retire the CRM at this point in time considering the costs and the customizations we have already made to the CRM. <br />
<br />
However since you are an existing Salesplus user, we would be keen to know which CRM you select? so that we have a direction when we decide to change. Please keep me informed as to your selection process.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crmadmin</div><div class="date">27th November 2008, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Just came across this thread and glad to hear there are other users out there that can help and give suggestions on the system, we have the full Baan package from Sales Plus 4.3, Baan 5.0C, as well as Configurator Plus and HR Focus. We utilise Open World and an integration recipe for BP Information and sales order generation between CRM to Baan. So I feel for those out there that had to get integration to work and that had to trouble shoot any subsequent problems that occurred. <br />
<br />
The amount of customisations we have on CRM, could make it near impossible to change to another package. But it looks like we will have to because Infor, India will not certify MS Office Suite 2007 for DBsynch with Salesplus and we have a big drive on to get users to diarise etc through Salesplus. <br />
<br />
Do any of you know or heard of using Siebel instead of Epiphany?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">28th November 2008, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I can't believe there is somebody out there using the full functionality of Sales Plus, we have had nothing but problems trying to get Integration working and the majority of the solution I did myself as support had no idea!  But I found just as we knocked one thing down another issue popped up. It has got to a point now where our users give it so much bad press with all the issues we have had they have stopped using it and our sales &amp; marketing/directors have decided it's time to get a more up to date/capable CRM system.<br />
<br />
We are at the moment looking at a product called Goldmine, it has no integration with baan, but with this side of things getting most of the bad press then they are not really bothered anymore.  I have been waiting for months for Infor to come and demo Epiphany and finally have a date in December but it may be too late for them as the CRM project team really like Goldmine (but do miss the point of what integration into back office would offer them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crmadmin</div><div class="date">28th November 2008, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sandra, <br />
<br />
I understand where you are coming from, when integration is working, all is good, but when it falls over, it falls over in a big way, we had nearly 2 weeks down time at a stage, thank goodness for contigency plans thats all I can say.<br />
<br />
Goldmine was the CRM package we utilised prior to the purchase of Baan ERP, its a very good product and easy to maintain. Our original blue print was to integrate Goldmine into Baan, but that fell by the way side. But you might want to check out a product called Gold BoX (if memory serves me correctly) as that was the add on integration\import software for Goldmine that we were going to purchase in order to get financial info into the system if we had not gone the ERP route. But its been a few years since I had any interaction with Goldmine etc so they may have a whole new product range by now. <br />
<br />
If there is anything I can help with regarding Goldmine, please shout as I worked on it extensively before we changed over and may be able to ne of use.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keni99</div><div class="date">29th November 2008, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi crmadmin,<br />
<br />
I have see a short presentation at Informum Germany about Epiphany.<br />
All what we can see was only PowerPoint, none system itself  :-( <br />
<br />
Epiphany itself looks like now as sales plus (with funnel, opportunities and so on). But - a lot of restrictions: you can install it with or without Integration to ERP LN; but this decision you have to do first if you install. You can't reverse this decision. If you work with integration, than all offers entered in Epiphany but saved at ERP LN-tables (offer-tables) direct. <br />
Other point is - Epiphany have a MS Exchange-Integration but not for mails, or - not for mails from individual inboxes, only for inboxes like &quot;info&quot; or &quot;exposition&quot; (means collection).<br />
<br />
You can choose between two Epiphany suites: Enterprise and Business suite.<br />
But - in both cases you install the Enterprise suite. Business suite is allways  a limitation with the licencekey. That meanse you can use it until 100 users and you havn't some functions, that's all. If you need more users or this functions than you pay more money and get a full licence key, none installations are required. <br />
That makes a lot of additional expenditure during implementation phase. You can't say - we implement the small Epiphany solution. It's nothing other than the Enterprise Edition. <br />
<br />
I think, at the moment Epiphany is a big building site, a prototyp. No company with B2B-connection ca realy work with this system, not today and note realy at the future. To mutch limitations at this system.<br />
<br />
<br />
We work further more with Sales Plus 4.3. In Germany we have from a consultant company a new integration to ERP LN, and this works very good.<br />
A lot of customization are done, at the IT-Department we have employees with VisualBasic experience and we maintain the system and develop further with new functions. We don't use local database because we wouldn't have sync-problems. All sales-people can login remote. <br />
Our consultant have test it- SalesPlus can also work with Vista. Office 2007 is for  our company out of scope next 2-3 years. We hope, that we can work with this system next years and that we than look which problems we have, what functions we need and if we should change to other system.</div></div><hr />
