My Name is Mahmood and currently working in Switzerland with EDS, an HP company. I have more than 12 years of experience in IT and around 6 years of Baan experience with customers in Trading, manufaturing, Telco and energy sectors. In addition of Baan, I have good experience of Relational Databases specially Oracel (OCDBA) &amp; MS SQL and development experience with object oriented technology with VC++ &amp; .Net.<br />
<br />
Along with the IT experience as have Master degree in computer science, I have experience with the Construction and property as well as I am qualified Civil Engineer as well. In addition of that, I have experience in project management and team leading, I am a qualified PMP. <br />

The only missing thing in my profile, I do not have much experience with Baan LN, most of experience with Baan 5 c. I am sure that with experience and education in other related fields, I am the right candidate for that position and will cope the missing expertise in short time.<br />
