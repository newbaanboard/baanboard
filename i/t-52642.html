Like this ,,,<br />
<br />
Says the Item is small &quot;Blade&quot; (Shaving Blade) with a code and base unit is &quot;Nos&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now it us packed in a small packet. i.e one packet consists of 10 Blades. So here unit is packet.<br />
<br />
Now these packets are packed in strips. i.e. each strip consist of 10 packet. The unit here is strip.<br />
<br />
Finaly during despatch, the strips are packet in a Big Box. Each box contain 100 strip. The unit here is BOx.<br />
<br />
i.e. 1 box contains= 100 strip<br />
                   = 100 x 10 packet<br />
                   = 1000x 10 blades = 10000 blades.<br />
<br />
The shopfloor is conseren of qty. of blade manufacturing. Inventory is stored in PKts.<br />
<br />
The sales is made as per the requirement of customer Box , Big box, Special container etc.<br />
<br />
Over and above during peak time, we give some special offer like 1 free each 10 blade so now box contains 11 blade and likewise.<br />
<br />
Can anybody give the best methodology:confused: to work a product like this.<br />
<br />
Do we need to use conversion factor or containerised item of Product family (PFC) for this sort of Item.<br />
<br />

You sales unit can be boxes.<br />
For special schemes, create new unit say bx1 (11000 blades) and sell products using this unit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">25th June 2008, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just use BOMs for this?<br />
<br />
The BOM for a Packet would be 10 blades.The BOM for a Strip would be 10 Packets, etc. The indented structure would something like - <br />
<br />
Big Box<br />
.1     Strips        100<br />
..2    Packets       10<br />
...3   Blades         10<br />
<br />
Then you can build, stock and transact each level and the correct number of blades (along with their packaging, etc) would be moved. Appropriate lablor is captured along the way. Levels can be phantomized if that's required and a separate BOM structure would be used for the 11 blade example. This looks to me like a straight functionality solution. Am I missing something?</div></div><hr />
