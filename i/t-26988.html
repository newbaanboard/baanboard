<br />
we have faced problems in EP.  wE LOGGED A PRODUCT ENQUIRY no. 318401.<br />
<br />
New problem faced is:<br />
SFC order DS1000004 is for 10 kms, and 10.1 km has been reported completed with inbound inventory done. BUT in the Item Order Plan, the  qty. against this SFC order is shown as 0.7470!!!!<br />
Perhaps the figure should have been 007   bang bang....  ;-(<br />
<br />
We are seriously thinking of junking the EP.<br />
How can there be so many problems. During simulations we did face some problems, but were confident that we had overcome them. Are these problems faced by us alone or are these widely reported???<br />
<br />
<br />
cheers <br />

<br />
Not only that, an ERP system that suggests that you test your key business<br />
processes prior to go live!<br />
<br />
You're right, scrap it, SAP hasn't had a reported bug in 10 years. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">1st May 2006, 02:44</div></div><div class="posttext">When running EP, the system will refer to planned inventory transactions rather than the original SFC orders.  <br />
The problem may be originated from planned inventory transactions(wininp1500m000). Please check whether you will see the demand in planned inventory transactions.<br />
Run the correction program to correct it. (whinp1200m000)<br />
<br />
LN's quality is not so satisfied. It is nice SSA keep on putting new functions(FP2, FP3) into LN, but still they need to do more testing on it. I can only say LN is nothing worse, comparing with the early stage of BaanIV.  <br />
<br />
ERP system is normally full of bugs.  I knew many other ERP systems has the same problem as Baan. But this is not an excuse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you check the productt inquiry number, you will find that I have enclosed the screenshot of session whinp1500m000. That is where we noticed the problem.<br />
I ran the session whinp1200m000 as suggested by you.<br />
<br />
Now it has removed reference to DS1000004 ALTOGETHER.<br />
<br />
The other descrepancies remain.<br />
The major problem we have is that where more than 1 sales order exist for one item, EP confuses the unit effectivity.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">2nd May 2006, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">This discussion sounds very familiar because when EP was first introduced with BAAN V there were so many problems. <br />
Now in LN6.1 the concept of 'unit effectivity' is introduced and I am sure that when using this new concept LN6.1 EP may cause problems again.<br />
Most likely the same will be true for Warehouse Management as this was also introduced with BAAN V and created many problems in the beginning. Especially with inventory corruptions in BAAN V_b (Grieg version) leading upto the famous correction program ocorwhinh2200.<br />
<br />
I agree with 'tritonbaan' because SSA should spend more time resolving existing problems instead of coming out with new added functionality too quickly. This is the same mistake BAAN Company made in the old days.<br />
Hopefully the new SSA Global management knows where the real priorities are.<br />

<br />
It is a strong perception that SSA Global management has not learnt lessons. We are facing many problems in EP. <br />
Our project faces failure due to hugely defficient module made for tackling India Localisations.<br />
LN 6.1 was launched in India on 16th Nov 2004 with the assurance that India Localisation content will be developed by January 2005. But even now the product is incomplete, and whatever little has been delivered is extremely bug prone and error prone.<br />

<br />
I do not believe BaanBoard is the best place for Indian users to complain about LN6.1 issues as BaanBoard has no relationship with SSA Global.<br />
Normally an official user group has direct contact with SSA Global and that is where you should let SSA know what your concerns are.<br />
I wonder whether such a user group already exists for India.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck!<br />
<br />

<br />
EP confuses unit effectivity?  Maybe the interchangable flag is on.  If the problem mostly come from EP, maybe you can postpone the go-live date of EP. Let other modules live first, that will be easy for you to handle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ln 6.1 FP2 is stable enough to support daily operations, and the performance is nice.</div></div><hr />
