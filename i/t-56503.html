<br />
I need to process payment to multiple vendors/suppliers through a single cheque given to the banker(favouring the bank)with an instruction to issue banker's cheque (Demand Draft/Pay Order) favouring multiple vendors/suppliers.<br />
<br />
Is there any way in Baan IV to process as mentioned above?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">13th August 2009, 07:28</div></div><div class="posttext">In Singapore, we do this by a facility called Giro. Which is nothing but a standing instruction. This is what we do in Baan :<br />
<br />
Attach the payment method to all invoices<br />
Compose the payments<br />
<br />
After transferring payments to tfcmg103, we create a file in the format specified by the Banker (HSBC or Citi)<br />
This will have one debit instruction and mutiple credit instructions.<br />
The debit instruction is to take the amount from our bank - which is equivalent to the one cheque you want to issue to the bank.<br />
<br />
The credit instructions are for the suppliers to whom you are making the payment.<br />
The totals of the debit and credit will be matched by the bank in their e-banking system.<br />
<br />
In addition we can also have the payment details by supplier embedded into the file so that the supplier knows which invoices are being paid.<br />
<br />
Of course, all these are at a cost charged by the bank per transaction.<br />
<br />
A somewhat equivalent facility in India is the ECS instruction.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
