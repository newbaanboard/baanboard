There are two courses organized by Baan (level I and level II). I think they are available only for Baan partners.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">19th August 2002, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Just before the collapse of Baan Education in the summer of 2000, several new classes were written.  These included classes on (bck, itk, connector) Openworld.  Several classes were held testing out the new material.  After Baan shutdown education alot of the material disappeared.  I don't know if Trinet and BSP ended up with the classes or not.  I know that I have been contacted for old material, but I have not been able to help them.  Check with them, they may offer a class.  Otherwise, I have been able to push my way through with just the manuals (and alot of debugging).:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">25th August 2002, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We r in India and I am sure BaaN is not organising any training in INdia, on BOI/OW. <br />
Me and a colleague of mine started exploring ourselves and some unofficial help from friends in BaaN company and also from baanboard friends. We started in February. Today we have delivered 2 projects based on BCK. <br />
<br />
Though we struggled lots and got struck in many places, our company trusted us and let us continue our exploration. And voila, we saw light at end of tunnel. <br />
<br />
I would say Jeyaseelan(moderator here) was of much help too.<br />
<br />
I would say that BaaN's documentation is so bad that self-learning could be difficult. <br />
<br />
But we do not have OW yet... :o <br />
<br />
Maybe if Baan can give a workable demo version, it would be nice<br />

BCK 1.3 docs just gives the overview. but it took a long time for me to learn BOI and to know the insights.<br />
the end is fruitful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bmcfarla</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I learned quite a bit about BOIs, BCBE, BCKit, etc while still at Baan.  No fair huh!!!  We were involved in writing an interface between Baan IV and BaanSCS Scheduler &amp; Baan IV and BaanSCS Planner.  Both Scheduler and Planner are part of Baan's Advance Planning and Scheduling (APS) suite of products.   <br />
<br />
The BCBE (Baan Connect Basic Edition) and BCKit are the predecessors to Open World.   We later moved to Open World (that we know now) as we developed interfaces for those APS applications and BaanERP.   <br />
<br />
I left Baan two years ago and have been working with various versions of Open World ever since.   Unfortunately, there's no experience like hands-on experience. Give e-Emphasis a try.  They came to our organization a while back and trained a handful of people.  Though I was not in the training, I didn't hear any complaints :)<br />

How about coming to an OpenWorld training in the Netherlands? Next one planned is Nov. 12th till Nov. 15th (level 1 course). See http:\\trainings.baan.com for details or mail to bkt@baan.com.<br />
