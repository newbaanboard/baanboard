<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ashish28</div><div class="date">27th August 2010, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Check if you have a transaction type with category Cash where the main session is tfcmg2130s000 and next session is tfcmg2105s000. If no define one.<br />
<br />
Than go to Maintain Transactions (tfgld1101m000) and when you enter that transaction type it should list down all customers and that advance/unallocated receipt transaction (search for your customer (code)<br />
<br />
Once you find the document you want you highlight the document and than using the special option, click on Assign Advance/Unallocated Receipts (1st option) and than pick the invoice or debit memo you want to write this off against. Double click on the link and manually assign the amount. Make sure when you come back to the previous screen you select the special option and process the assignment, with the document being written-off highlighted. Exit, view non-finalized transactions and finalize if satisfied or use the same process to set back the status to original, (choose no and the entries generated are deleted)<br />
<br />
Good Luck. Try this procedure in Test Environment first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfri</div><div class="date">10th September 2010, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">After the assignment record has been finalized there is no way to reverse the same using the application. The only two solutions would be as follows.<br />
<br />
1) Using The Application<br />
Create a batch, using the same bank transaction type which had the adv receipt and having set the value for allow negative amounts set as Yes.<br />
When you are in this transaction type for entry, select the Type of transaction as 'Cust Trax' and then in the invoice field mention the same invoice number which you accidently assigned. You wont be able to zoom for this invoice since its balance amount is zero, hence insert manually. In the amount field key in the amount but with a negative sign. <br />
<br />
Create another document/line now with type of transaction as advance receipt, in the reference make sure you give the reference of the prev doc for future tracking.<br />
<br />
Once the above is done you can check the open entries, the invoice will once again show you this amount as open and a new document will be created which will hold the advance receipt.<br />
GL wise the bank account will knock off as the first line will credit the bank and debit the control account where as the second document will debit the bank and credit the advance account.<br />
Open entries will once again start showing that same sales invoice as open, however for advance receipt you will have a new document.<br />
<br />
2) Using the GTM<br />
Go to table tfacr200 and delete only the assignment document line from the advance receipt document as well as the invoice document.<br />
<br />
Go to table tfgld106 and delete the assignment records completely.<br />
<br />
In table tfgld018 set the assignment doc status to deleted.<br />
<br />
Run session tfgld3206m000 for the period to rebuild GL balances.<br />
Run session tfacr2245m000 for the customer to rebuild customer balances.</div></div><hr />
