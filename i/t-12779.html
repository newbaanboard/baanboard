<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajoy Sharma</div><div class="date">30th August 2003, 09:15</div></div><div class="posttext">We have observed that when we assign a supplier advance in full, the field AMOUNT IN HOME CURRENCY IN THE TABLE  tfacp200 is updated with an negative sign and if the advance is partially assigned the same table is correctly updated,<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE: Advance payment made to XYZ &amp; CO LTDRs. 50,000/=<br />
<br />
(1)Now. if we assign full amount, the position in tfacp200 is as under-<br />
Amount                                      50,000<br />
Amount in Invoice Currency   50,000<br />
Amount in Home Currency    -50,000 (with a negative sign)<br />
<br />
(2)And if we assign only Rs30,000/= i.e partial assignment, we observe the following position in the table tfacp200<br />
Amount                                  30,000<br />
Amount in Invoice Currency   30,000<br />
Amount in Home Currency     30,000 <br />
<br />
Thus position stated at (2) above is correct and at (1) is incorrect.<br />
We are facing problem in preparing Age Wise Analysis of Suppliers (tfacp2420) as this report is based on the Amount of Home Currency thus giving wrong result wherever full assignment is done.<br />
<br />
Kindly advise us the course of action so that the said problem is resolved and our Age Wise Analysis of suppliers is correctly drawn.</div></div><hr />

Run correction programme otfcor0260 for all supplier. I think this problem will be solved. It will take time depend on your tfacp200 records. Use proper input for this correction programe.<br />
<br />
After the above process age Wise Analysis of Suppliers (tfacp2420) you will get correct out put.<br />

We have already run tfcor0260 for one supplier but the problem was not resolved. However, as you suggested..use proper input...may I request you to explain it further as I may be wrong in entering inputs properly. To be explicit, I entered supplier code and the group company no.1 and 2 with same company no.<br />

<br />
Also run correction prog otfcor8099 Choice &quot;Y&quot;<br />
<br />
Input for correction prog.<br />
1.Supplier (Specific suppier or all supplier)<br />
2.Group Company No for Sr.no1 as per your company setup keep all group co Field as it is.<br />
3.Print only &quot;N&quot;<br />
4.Continue &quot;Y&quot;<br />
<br />
If you are trying one supplier and no error found system will populate one message &quot;No Open Entries Updated&quot; that means all correction are over. <br />

<br />
Correction program available in our system is upto tfcor7100m000. But Sharad, I feel correction program will not help in overcoming the problem permanently. Because every time you assign your advance fully and you need to run the correction program. This does not seem to be a correct method. I feel there is some setting problem or a different problem altogether.<br />
<br />
I am working Baan CIV. You test the similar transaction in your system and see if it gives you the correct result. If yes then we may compare our settings<br />
<br />
Thnks in advance<br />

<br />
Are you sure you are working with up to date software?<br />
<br />
From my experience at the Baan Support Centre I recognise this problem. This was solved by a bug fix and I have the feeling that you do not have this bug fix.<br />
<br />
With session ttstpsessinfo you are able to search for the latest compilation date of your session script. If this date is an old one ask Baan Support for the latest solution, or search on the Baan Support Knowledge Base for the latest solution.<br />
<br />
For more information you can always ask me.<br />
