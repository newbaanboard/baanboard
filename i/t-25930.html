 Hi,<br />
Here are the steps:<br />
Creating New Company in BaaN<br />
·Maintain Companies      - Session ttaad1100m000<br />
 Enter new company code, name and package combination. <br />
	-  Convert to RDD<br />
	-  Convert to runtime<br />
·Create tables <br />
<br />
Ensure that package combination of user is same as that of new company. Use session ttaad4230m000 to create tables for packages tc, td, tf, ti, tp, tr, ts, ps.<br />
<br />
·Change company to new company. Run initialize parameters (session tcmcs0295m000). Take down all error codes for each initialize run and create all those tables individually. This is interactive process.<br />
<br />
·Maintain units         - Session tcmcs0101m000<br />
 Maintain basic units of <br />
<br />
-         Length              - mm<br />
-         Weight             - kg<br />
-         Area                 - m2<br />
-         Volume             - m3<br />
-         Pieces              - no<br />
-         Time                 - sec<br />
<br />
·Assign tables to database (ttaad4111m000)  Special - Load mandatory tables    <br />
     Special  - Convert to runtime<br />
·Maintain base units  session tcmcs0100m000<br />
·Maintain signal code  session tcmcs0118m000<br />
<br />
Add one signal code with all blocking status blocked.<br />
Maintain languages  session tcmcs0146m000<br />
Add ENG for English. <br />
·Maintain countries   - session tcmcs0110<br />
IND, India, -, 91, -, -, No (Considering India as a conuntry)<br />
· Maintain currencies  session tcmcs0102m000<br />
· Maintain system configuration parameters  session tisfc0000m000<br />
· Maintain MPS plan codes  session timps1101m000<br />
· Maintain hourly labor types  session tihra1130m000<br />
· Maintain cost price calculation codes  session ticpr1101m000<br />
· Maintain all manufacturing parameters.<br />
<br />
Go on pressing tab keys and enter something wherever cursor stops. <br />
<br />
ITM parameter  prefix  - $$$$$$, Signal code  blocked signal code<br />
BOM parameter  mm, No.<br />
PCF parameter  form2 Production Rate per: Should be pr_rate or production_rate<br />
·After successful company formation you should be able to go to maintain item data.<br />
Session tiitm0101m000. This completes the process.<br />
<br />

<br />
Here is an attached document of Company Managment which may be helpful in your case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arthas</div><div class="date">29th December 2005, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">nmundargi, somebody MUST do this, so it may just as well be me. (Ban me from the board if you like, moderators, but most of you show enough tech knowledge to know that I'm right).<br />
<br />
The only reason you (nmundargi) cannot be described as a clown is that some people sometimes find clowns funny - you are not funny, you are dangerous. <br />
<br />
You remind me of a person who submitted his CV to one of my &quot;pet&quot; customers. This guy had a BSC, a MSC and had project managed 6 full life-cycle implementations of Baan across all platforms and databases (all disciplines, of course). I'm not sure which was the dead-giveaway, the fact that he had implemented Triton 2 against SQL-Server 6.5 running on AS400, or his age - 23.<br />
<br />
Your reply to the &quot;how to create a new company&quot; query shows enough knowledge of session names to prove nothing more than the fact that you may have seen a powerpoint presentation of Baan. YOU are a major part of the reason that the product is failing.<br />
<br />
People, don't listen to this guy. For that matter, don't listen to me either, or George W Bush, Tony Blair, the pope, Mugabe or anyone else.<br />
<br />
If you're going to work in this industry, you're primary function in &quot;TO THINK&quot;, and if you're not seriously saddened by the fact that somebody had to point this fact out, then it unfortunaely is my duty to tell you that you're in the wrong industry.<br />
<br />
nmundargi, go away.<br />
<br />
End of Rant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not getting your point what exactly you want to say.<br />
<br />

Viplov</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arthas</div><div class="date">5th January 2006, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I was having a bad hair day, so went over the top a bit, but my underlying sentiment stands.<br />
<br />
There are genuine newbies out there who turn to Baanboard as one of their sources of knowledge.<br />
<br />
Sometimes they get responses that are incredibly detailed and are delivered with an air of authority - but sometimes these responses are a) incomplete; b) in the wrong order; c) assume that all firms run the same as the author's company, and d) wrong. Written by another newbie.<br />
<br />
In this case, all of the above.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants a detailed dissection of the post that upset me, I suggest we move it to another thread - any takers?</div></div><hr />
