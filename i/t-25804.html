<br />
My requirement is as below, let me know is it possible in BaaN system. The procedure is applicable for India localization.<br />
<br />
1) We are sending KIT material to our Vendor for Subcontracting processing through 57F4 challan (tdind0118m000 and tdind7904m000). Here KIT contains no.of components which we have defined in BOM (tibom1110m000)<br />
<br />
2) Out of above components which defined in BOM, 2-3 components we have ordered to our supplier to supply the components directly to our Vendor. In this case supplier will supply the material to our Vendor and he will send Invoice copy to us. Against Invoice Copy will maintain receipt entry at our end.<br />
<br />
3) As a excise procedure, we have to prepare seperate 57F4 challan for the component which is supplied at our Vendor. For this challan there is no need of production order but warehouse stock of the component must be reduced. This is our main requirement.<br />
<br />
4) After completion of processing done by Vendor we want to make receipt entry against both 57F4 challans. Here in case of second 57F4 challan receipt qty for the component should be updated only in Excise records. Receipt qty should not be updated in Stores Warehouse stock as this component is already consumed in KIT material (against first 57F4 challan)<br />
<br />
5) We are preparing both types of 57F4 without applying Excise Duty.<br />
Required your urgent help.<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />
<br />
<br />
