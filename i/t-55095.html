<br />
Does the Baan Vb have the session Patch Objects After Error Solving?<br />
<br />
Because i tried to find that and i dint find that session. There is no Patch Objects After System Crash, and Patch Objects After Error Solving. I also tried to find the session by Description, but with no success. Is the ottiexpatch is equivalent to Patch Objects Sessions?<br />
<br />
So Am i right by saying these sessions are not there in Baan Vb version. If these are present can you please share the session codes. I found only Validate Tools set (ttiex3220m000) but on windows environment is gives a message asking to run with Root User. IS that correct?<br />
<br />
please let me know more on that.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">23rd February 2009, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">From what i have read in certain documents, these sessions do exist in Baan 5b. Now since you don't have this session in your environment, it might be due to the absence of certain solutions or service packs. If you have a support contract with Infor, i would suggest you check their knowledge base on this regard or even get in touch with them. <br />
Last but not least, i hope this isn't a case of permissions or hidden sessions...<br />
