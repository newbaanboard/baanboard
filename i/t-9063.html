<br />
 The scenario is &quot;Make to Order&quot; and entire production is mapped on PCS. The manufacturing under project is done and completed. The inventory is posted to inventory at factory warehouse. Hence Inventory is as customised item inventory.<br />
<br />
 Problem: Now this customised item inventory needs to be transfered to their stockyard warehouse which is at a distance of 7 days transportation time. Hence RPL order functionality would be ideally suitable. But RPL cannot be used for project (customized) item. Baan Inventory transfer functionality cannot be used as at the generation of warehouse order for inventory transfer will transfer inventory to stockyard warehouse on the same day whereas in practical scene inventory will be available at stockyard warehouse after 7 days and also receipt need to be maintained at stockyard.<br />
<br />
 What can be the solution in this case?<br />
<br />
 Is any workaround available.  How are other customers in Europe using this type of requirement?<br />

  <br />
The only solution that comes me to mind on Baan IV, not using the package trasportation, it is to move the goods in a transfer warehouse and then, when they get to the destination, trasfer them to your distribution warehouses.<br />
The warehouse could be location controlled in order to track how the goods are shipped.<br />
<br />
The main problems I see are that you can not plan the transfers and you can not print any transportation document.<br />
<br />
I hope this can help you.<br />
