I am working in LN6.1 FP2, i am having a problem in posting of material in the specified inventory in the production order, after operation complete, the inventory should be posted in the inventory, but it's not happening.<br />
<br />
All the component materials have been issued and there is no pending issuing of materials, only the posting of finished goods is not happening after the operation complete.<br />
<br />
Waiting for all your advice.<br />

<br />
I hope the above solution is helpful, and I suggest others to check with the altering the parameter and check the simulation.</div></div><hr />

Hi <br />
are you sure If we select actual costing then we cannot take receipt of Manufactued Item before issuing material......?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">priyanko</div><div class="date">16th October 2008, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I am sure about my solution, but your question is irrelevant considering previous discussion in this thread...<br />
Even if you dont issue raw materials , receipt of finshed good will take place, but it will not have the material cost included.</div></div><hr />

Please check status of your inbound. At the bottom if it is showing blocked. If it is showing blocked then your material might have stuck in inspection as your warehouse order procedure may contain inspection<br />
