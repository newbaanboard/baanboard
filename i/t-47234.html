<br />
Presently, TDS on salary (Withholding) functionality cannot be maintained due to reasons :- a) Monthly TDS deductions on Salary of employee  based on Annual projections cannot be mapped &amp; progressive review based on actuals of employee , b) Surcharge, E-Cess &amp; SHE-Cess rates on TDS  on Salary (which Slab wise) cannot be mapped as there are no layers functionality as per Aggregate tax code functionality, however, Basic TDS salary rates can be mapped slab wise and c) payroll of employee functionality is not there.<br />
