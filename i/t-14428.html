<br />
I've an existing table say (xxx) and another table which is a child  of this parent table say (yyy) .<br />
My xxx table which is a parent table has only one index which comprises of 3 fields. My yyy table which is a child table also has only 1 index. The fields of the index of the child table are the same as the fields of the index of the parent table.<br />
The problem here is that I want to delete the child table once the parent table is deleted. But i am not able to do this since the primary index comprises of three fields.<br />
I also don't want to modify the program code of the session who's main table is table xxx.<br />
<br />
Kindly suggest how should I go about this w/o the need to modify the program script.<br />
<br />

That should accomplish the objective u desire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So pls suggest as to how to go about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">11th February 2004, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hitesh's is the only solution outside of modifying the program script.  You need to establish a reference between the combined 3 fields of the child and parent tables.  You can only do this if there's a combined field in both the parent and child containing the same 3 fields.  I am not sure why you're unwilling add a combined field to table xxx.  Adding a combined field does not change the physical structure of table xxx, as far as I know.<br />

The architecture of the localisation is such that certain objects r standard and certain others are localised.<br />
Here the table xxx is a standard table which I did not wanted to be touched upon. I wanted to derive a solution w/o having to change the standard components.<br />
<br />
Anyways now it doesn't seem possible w/o the changes to both the tables.<br />
Thanx for the f/bs<br />
