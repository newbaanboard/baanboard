<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The company which developed open world for Baan is e-Emphasys. They are the only bussiness partners with Baan for Open world. Check out from them. Their web site is www.eemphasys.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trenchard</div><div class="date">11th July 2002, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">e-Emphasys did not develop OpenWorld for Baan. Baan has a development office in Iceland that develops OpenWorld components. e-Emphasys is for sure the partner in OpenWorld but not the development organization. I think they have worked on development of a connector for SAP using OpenWorld product suite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shasbe</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys, <br />
     Let me clarify some stuff here....:):)<br />
<br />
     I am one of the founding members of e-Emphasys technologies. e-Emphasys is the prime partner for OW. <br />
<br />
     e-Emphasys was started by x-Baan employees who were involved in development of OpenWorld product. The development of OW product goes on in Iceland for OW Broker, Netherlands for OW Adapter and OW Gateway and BOIS in India. <br />
<br />
     I was the architect for OW Gateway.<br />
<br />
     Other than that e-Emphasys is also involved in joint development of OW products. We had a team which worked with Baan development in Netherlands in development of OW3.0.<br />
<br />
     Also we develop adapter for OW. Like SAP, Peoplesoft, QAD, Ultipro, I2, Clippership.... :):) We have done a lot of implementation of OW around the globe. That is the main line of business of e-Emphasys.<br />
<br />
    Please let me know if you need any other information about e-Emphasys technologies.<br />

I'm not sure if it is available for everybody or if it is available for just a limited audience.<br />
<br />
It is organized by Baan Development and takes place in the Netherlands.<br />
