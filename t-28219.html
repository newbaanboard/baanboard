<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">22nd September 2006, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
We're creating API-powered remote data collection for a client with multi-logistics single finance environment. We've successfully created API script for one of the logistics company which only uses hours backflushing. No problem there. However, the other logistics company here uses material backflush on top of hours backflush.<br />
<br />
The problem with trying to automate the material backflush is that whether through the Report Operations Completed (tisfc0102m000), Report Orders Completed (tisfc0202m000), or Backflush Materials and Hours (tisfc0220m000), they run Issue Inventory (tisfc0208s000) in the background. tisfc0208m000 shares one program script with tisfc0207m000 and tisfc0207s000. They are 3 sessions with the same name. And when successfully executing them, somehow a report must be printed.<br />
<br />
For now, I see 2 options:<br />
 Don't run backflush under API if Backflush Materials flag is set to Yes in production order (eg stpapi.enum.answer(&quot;tisfc0102m000&quot;,&quot;tisfc02023&quot;,&quot;2&quot;) )<br />
 Modify the tisfc0207 script so that it automatically send that rather unnecessary report to a text file without even bothering to ask for printer (using brp.open(spool.report, spool.device, 0) )<br />
<br />
I looked through this API forum and only saw threads discussing hours backflush. Anyone can help me with the material backflush, please? <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />

I know it had to do with those back flushing reports - and I know that if at that time we owned source I would have used your second option.  I would have modified the source in a heart beat.  So if you do not need the reports then I would use that option.</div></div><hr />
