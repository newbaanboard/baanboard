<br />
I'd tried to install your program, but the error status isn't cleared (I used compile flag -b ottdllbw) :<br />
When script type = 4:<br />
tuddcconv20:<br />
std_gen6.1 -b ottdllbw -s ptuddcconv20 -pacc B40CUS03 -qe /baanprog/bse/tmp/tmp059325143<br />
bic6.1  -Pvariant=0 -b ottdllbw ptuddcconv2g -u -d ottstpstandard -o otuddcconv2<br />
 -f /baanprog/bse/tmp/tmp059325142 -pacc B40CUS03 -qe /baanprog/bse/tmp/tmp05932<br />
5144<br />
<br />
So no error message is shown, but it doesn't work.  What 's wrong ?<br />
<br />
Now we are using a device &quot;EXCELIT&quot; using  as 4GL-program: ttstpconv and argument: ASCII:excel.  This works good, but it is annoying that always a new excel application starts, also when excel is already running.  Is this resolved with your script, and/or are there other advantages ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Thomas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd February 2002, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the -d ottdllbw option on the compile. I am sorry to say that it will not solve the problem of launching multiple copies of excel.  I have never really thought about that.  I am not really sure how you stop that.  Now that I think about the way that I use it I would prefer it to start multiple copies of excel.  Usually (not always) when I down load to excel I kick off a macro.  This way I can run the same report(different parameters) multiple times and have multiple macros running at once.  See below.<br />
<br />
This program was mainly just a sample of what you could do on your own.  The way we use it hear at this site actually involves a couple of tables. One to hold the application to start and one to hold the macro that gets kicked off at the start of the app.  <br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
table 1<br />
report name(key) : rtisfc960001000<br />
site (key)       : lou<br />
download filename: c:\baan\tmp\somefile.txt<br />
macro name       : somemacro.xls<br />
macro location   : f:\common\macro<br />
<br />
table 2<br />
site(key)        : lou<br />
appl             : c:\somedir\excel.exe<br />
<br />
I designed this for excel, but others discovered you could set up other applications.  To get this to work the user selects the device PCEXCEL and puts the site key in the output file.  Not elegant , but it is functional.<br />

<br />
i read your post on how you use excel together with a macro.<br />
<br />
we plan to do the same, but until now i could not find the way to start excel with a special macro.<br />
<br />
can you please tell me the syntax how to start excel with a specific file AND launch a macro after opening this file.<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />
jochen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">To launch excel with a macro just do:<br />
<br />
excel somepath\macrofile.xls<br />
<br />
Please note that Excel must be in your path or you have to include the path with excel.  The way I do this is the macrofile.xls contains the macro code. It uses the auto_open() subroutine to start processing.  This macro knows where the data file is located and pulls it in to process it.<br />
<br />
So I have a table that has report name and download file location and macro. My ttstpconv program looks up the report name and gets the download location. It the uses server2client to download the file to that location.  Next my ttstpconv launches Excel with the macro from the table.  <br />

<br />
How can Your ttstpconv replacement know about the report that it was called by?<br />
<br />
Is there a magic variable to import?<br />
Or do You just parse the report data for a heading (which is the least best I'd like)<br />
<br />
I'd be interested in the technical report name, same as in Your &quot;table 1&quot; mentioned earlier in this thread, because in my ttstpconv replacement (or wrapper actually) I want to do some processing dependig on the report name<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

  long spool.fontnumber            number of font, 1=LARGE, 2=SMALL,<br />
                                   3=MIDDLE<br />
  long spool.id                    identification of spooler<br />
  long spool.left.mrg              left margin<br />
  long spool.pr.copies             number of copies<br />
  long spool.pg.length             length of page<br />
  long spool.pg.width              width of page, incl left margin<br />
  long spool.time                  time to print<br />
  long spool.view.rtl              report in bidirectional language,<br />
                                   true = yes, false = no<br />
  string spool.device(14)          name of spooler device<br />
  string spool.fileout(100)        path name of spooler output file<br />
  string spool.paper.type(6)       type of paper<br />
  string spool.pr.line(300)        line to print<br />
  string spool.report(20)          report to be printed<br />
<br />

<br />
assume You have a bwclient, just got this idea (untested):<br />
<br />
string	dest(1024)	| Temporary file name holds full client-side file path (i.e. C:\temp\foo.txt)<br />
<br />
| do the server2client(src, dest, 0) stuff here<br />
...<br />
| now set dest to r/o on BW Client<br />
app_start(&quot;ATTRIB +R &quot; &amp; dest ,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<br />

Of course, errorchecking should be done on app_start, but this shoud work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mclime</div><div class="date">14th November 2003, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait a minute,<br />
what are You trying to achieve?<br />
With the piece of code I just posted, the next server2client() will run on an error if the destination file is write-protected (as it does if it's currently opened, btw)<br />
<br />
What You'd need additionally is probably a code that checks the returncode of server2client() and then changes the filename (or lets the user do it).<br />
<br />
Or You should probably generate a unique filename in the form of prefix+timestamp or something in the firstplace.<br />
<br />

So I thought of using an extension .000 - .999 so if server2client would fail it would mean .000 had to be increased to .001.<br />
But since server2client overwrites the file I was trying to make it read-only...<br />
Since I couldn't get this to work I used a date&amp;time stamp instead ;)<br />
So now the name of the file is like YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.txt that was a lot easier, since now I don't have to set read-only to the files.<br />
So now my program works :)<br />

Thanx 4 the effort anyway!</div></div><hr />

Anyway you can use argc$() to see how many parameters are passed.  Then you can set variables to the argv$() and check them.  For example if your first argument was project, you could set a variable project=argv$(1).  Then use tt.align.according.domain to get the correct justification and then check against a table.  I am not sure if the variables are all passed as strings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th September 2004, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">The code and thread were just an example of how you could write your own device driver. There are actually several ways to accomplish this - use the tool ~Vamsi posted, NAZDAQ program, etc. Or you could modify a report to put the data in a comma delimited format, download and run it.  Or as you see at the beggining of the thread a method where we created a table to hold macro information by report.  When our device is selected it downloads the file to the PC and launches an excel macro to format the report according to our users wishes.  The macros are stored by site and report name - this way we could format the same report differently for each of our sites.<br />
<br />
Our simple excel device does not use a custom &quot;ottstpconv&quot; program. It downloads it and launches excel.  The data is in the format you mentioned - all in one row.  Our users know to use the text to columns option under data on the menu.<br />

Try making it(your conversion session) a 4gl program - the form can just be blank.  I believe the argv params will still be the same. Then in the init.form section you can do something like this:<br />

I just want a version that does not launch excel at all. But I want it to save the file in excel format. I will email this file to user and the user can just open it with excel without needing to go to Open file wizard to set the delimiter.<br />
ie. it should already be in xls format.<br />

I am getting two different text files.<br />

When I use the normal ASCIF device, i get the textfile zz208437. This is correct.<br />

But when I use your script in this thread, the output file is like zok208437. I do not wish to have the special characters in this file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th April 2013, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically what this script does is take the baan created report in the tmp directory(this should be file 1 with the special characters), convert it ascii(into a temp file), then download this file to some destination(in spool.fileout).  Then launch excel to pull in the ascii test file.  The final step is to remove the tmp file it creates.  So you should end up with 1 normal baan report on the baan server and 1 ascii text file on the client. Bottom line - you end up with 2 reports, excel only launches against the plain text file that was created and downloaded to the client.<br />
<br />
The normal baan report left on the server should be handled by whatever is setup on your system.  We are on 4c4 and I think we set it to remove using the delete delay time(1 hr) on the user setup.  This prevents the tmp directory from filling up.</div></div><hr />

It sounds like one of the filles cannot be opened.  So the question is - which file?  So in this code:<br />
<br />

	tmp.file = creat.tmp.file$( bse.tmp.dir$() )<br />
	wait.and.activate(&quot;ttstpconv&quot;, argv$(1), tmp.file, argv$(3),argv$(4))<br />
<br />
In debug mode I would make sure that the tmp.file is created under the baan tmp directory.  Then make sure that argv$(1) points to the report that was created. Make sure the report is there and has data in it for the conversion.  Then right after the ttstpconv you should be able to more the tmp.file and see the ASCII or whatever report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its the path you see when system pops up device selection form(ttstpsplopen). If you are on latest TIV, the path will have a check if the folder exists on server. In that case, you can allow the user to put only file name in device path and then make a little change in the script - <br />
<br />
| Set the path on the client's pc and send the file down. Let the user<br />
| enter the path and filename to be downloaded.<br />
	local.path = &quot;${BSE_TMP}\&quot; &amp; strip$(spool.fileout)<br />
<br />
This will make sure the file is transferred from the temp file to users tmp folder and the file name is taken as the user entered in the Device selection form.</div></div><hr />
