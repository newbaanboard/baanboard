As a result of testing after development, it was found that the session falls prematurely.<br />
When you see the processed data when an error occurs, warehousing receipt header has been created, line is not linked.<br />
It is believed to have fallen in the &quot;suspend&quot; around the program.<br />
Cause I do not know.</div></div><hr />

I would say search this forum for the sessions you are using.  I do not know enough about LN to be helpful in this case.  I do know in LN they recommend the use of DAL2 over AFS so you might want to investigate that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best way to create Warehouse Receipts in LN is to use DAL. It's simple and gives you proper error messages using dal functions.<br />
<br />
But for this issue, I will suggest you to raise the suspend() duration as the link lines to receipt takes a long time and suspend(10) is too short.<br />
<br />
Check this (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=64539)<br />
<br />
Again, I will prefer to go with DAL rather than AFS.</div></div><hr />

I will try it.<br />
By the way, could you give me sample program which creates receipt<br />
number and links purchase orders?<br />
<br />
<br />
If it works well and faster than AFS, I will try to use it.<br />
(It is hard to know to map table for receiving.)</div></div><hr />
