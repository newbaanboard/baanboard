I ask forgiveness for my level of English.<br />
We have a problem with an AFS process in sessions tdsls4101m000 and tdsls4100m900.<br />
Radom an error occurs and terminates the process. This error doesn't have a patron, sometimes appears at init of the process, and another cases, it appear at middle or end of process. In many cases the process finalize successfully.<br />
<br />
The error message is:<br />
1 : process 89 - Fatal error : Error base_extern baanapi_input_fields not found in proces 91<br />
2 : process 89 - Fatal error : Can not continue in anintc201m000 in DLL: ottstpapihand (searchfield)[at.base]<br />
3 : process 89 - Error : anintc201m000: A not terminated transaction is aborted (searchfield() in object ottstpapihand)<br />
<br />
We search the error in baanboard and another sites of internet, but we don’t found any solutions.<br />
<br />
In the last error (11390 records), 11300 were processed and the process failed again.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Simón.</div></div><hr />

I know at one point in time I had several API sessions which aborted with errors like this - usually after a certain number of transactions, but it would vary.  At one point we could only process about 500 inventory transactions - we broke our files up and processed each one individually.  Currently at this point we no longer receive the error - so I assume thru tools patches, portingset updates and API patches the problem was resolved.  I recommend checking with infor.</div></div><hr />
