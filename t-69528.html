Now i want this document to be shown in the list of Documents in ION while creating a Monitor or a Workflow.<br />
<br />
What needs to be done? Rest of the things are set up in ION, like Connection Point and Document Flow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done this long back. If my memory goes right, you need to do the following activity to let the custom BOD visible in the Documents List.<br />
<br />
1 - Go to ION Folder (Ex: C:\Program Files\Infor\ION\Desk\bin\RegistryData\BODMetaData)<br />
<br />
2 - Go to Custom Folder<br />
<br />
3 - Register your BOD (xsd) in the BODs\Developer folder (You also need to place the xsd of Noun in the Resources Folder<br />
<br />
I have taken Infor Support to do this activity as it was bit confusing. I would suggest to go for Infor support to get it done.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />

Note that path described differs between major ION releases. So probably good to check the documentation.<br />
Thereafter the connection point need to be updated, the new added BOD need to be added there. Now the monitor can be created and activated.<br />
