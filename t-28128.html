<br />
Does anyone know of any third party systems out there which would allow users to fill out a Travel Expense Report and which would integrate with the Baan GL?<br />
<br />
We're on Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
I'd be interested in learning about what products are out there and how you would rate them.<br />
<br />
Thanks,  -Chris-</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a product for mobile workers called RMCfield. RMCfield allows for communication between your field personnel and your Baan back-end system. <br />
<br />
Through the use of RMCfield, your mobile workers can receive job assignments, report start and stops of jobs, record travel expenses, track truck inventory, manage replenishments, process payments on demand and more.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in additional information, please contact Joyce Keane at jkeane@rmcis.com.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Kathy Barthelt</div></div><hr />

That generates a file which we use with the voucher import sessions to get it into the GL.</div></div><hr />
