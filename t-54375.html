<br />
I am running a session with an AFS for Item-Lot whltc1100m000.<br />
<br />
I use the following code snippet.<br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;whltc1100m000&quot;,&quot;whltc100.item.segment.1&quot;,item(1;9))<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;whltc1100m000&quot;,&quot;whltc100.item.segment.2&quot;,item(10;21))<br />
ret = stpapi.change.view(&quot;whltc1100m000&quot;,error.msg)<br />
<br />
Here, the return value is &quot;2&quot;, which according to the AFS documentation is that the item is not selected due to permissions, but, the AFS selects another view that is available.<br />
<br />
The only discordant note here, is that the Same code snippet works for a super user and not for a normal user.<br />
<br />
I am only a developer and have absolutely no idea about roles, DEM or thereabouts. So, I am not even sure of putting the query here.<br />
<br />
My query is is there a way to circumvent all the authorisations via a programming construct. If not, then can someone point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />

If so then the users will need the same permissions to run the session through AFS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have spent the entire day checking the authorisations and the DEM/Roles. No luck as yet. The most astonishing part is even with Full DB and Session authorisations, it is not working.<br />
<br />
Finally, I have changed the session code to first find the item and on sucess set the view for the item, then I get a success. Now, I start the synchronize dialog in the &quot;add&quot; mode and it fails with &quot;Command Disabled&quot;.<br />
<br />
The user can run the session from the Menu Browser and maintain the Lot. so, I am not able to understand the details of how, when and where.<br />
<br />
Any help will be grateful. <br />
<br />

Your profile says 4c4 are you trying this on something different?  Second thing - the user can run the AFS session from the menu browser and it works?  I have heard that the AFS programs do not work from the DEM on certain versions of Baan.  I am not positive of this, but would check with Baan on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am concurrently working on 4c4 and LN as well. I am a developer working on different versions of Baan as per current requirements.<br />
<br />
I had set the version on my first post, that doesnt seem to be reflected anywhere. Is there a way to change my profile?<br />
<br />
As of now your reply seems to hit the nail on the head. As the AFS on whltc1100m00 works through run command, custom menu or if configured via the  BW options. Only the Process Browser gives me an error on synchronise dialog command as &quot;Comdand disabled&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the inputs<br />

<br />
The problem we were facing has been solved. This was due to a faulty configuratrion of the DEM authorisations.<br />
<br />
This has been sorted out. The bigger problem I noticed was the change of three variables on the JV form that came up probably because of the retro fitting.<br />
<br />
The Excise Invoice Document Number fiedl was renamed from &quot;docu.number&quot; to &quot;docu.number.l&quot;, Excise Date Field was renamed from &quot;docu.date&quot; to &quot;docu.date.l&quot; and Assesable Value was changed from &quot;asv.valu&quot; to &quot;asv.valu.l&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the assistance.<br />
<br />
