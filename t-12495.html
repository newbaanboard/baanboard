<br />
We currently use Merkur for faxing our Baan reports.  Do you know any other software that does enterprise faxing that has an interface with Baan?</div></div><hr />

Normally you can specify in the printer device layout etc, and Baan can take automatically the correct fax number from the customer/ supplier data (and is also capable to email)</div></div><hr />

They can have different layouts for each as well.  That stuff costs some $$ though.</div></div><hr />

Can you expand on that?  I can't find any documents about this.. all the fax solutions for Baan that I have seen require an outside fax server solution to send that fax.  The device is used to send a properly formatted request to that fax server then the fax server does the work.  Are you saying in Baan V that there is some way to avoid the fax server all together?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">25th June 2004, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">The NAZDAQ product is also tied to an outside fax server software - an ASP Fax Server of some sort.  With NAZDAQ though you can have a much smaller  fax server product, something like FaxMaker and have the NAZDAQ perform the Baan work, just use the fax server to send the faxes and track the status.  With Merkur I think they can perform all of the Baan integration on their own, and probably more robust fax services, but for more $$.</div></div><hr />
