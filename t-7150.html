I got a letter from Vertex couple of months ago regarding to the retirement of their product v.1.3 in December of this year, which we are using right now. After upgrading our porting set, we must also upgrade to the version of vertex that they still support and compatible with our db/os (v2.0.20).  We are running on Nt40 with Oracle 7.3.  We tried to installed Vertex 2.0.20 today and everything seems to work on the vertex side (according to their manual).  But unfortuntely when we logged into BaaN and tried to print out any sales invoice, it just hang there forever.... finally we changed an enviroment variable on the server (path), it seems to get us further (we think)..... and Dr. Watson came for a visit with some error exception to the api.exe.  Anyone out there encounter the same problem? or if anyone have any idea what exactly is going wrong here.... we are guessing it is the porting set at this point.... any help will be appreciated.. Thank You very much in advance. :(</div></div><hr />

It needs to match the version on Vertex that you have.  You'll need to follow the instructions that Baan and Vertex have to re-link it with Oracle.<br />

P.S.<br />
They have a Baan / Vertex 2.0 version compatible with Oracle 8i. I suppose you know that 7.3 is in de-support and that 8i is slated for de-support at the end of this year.</div></div><hr />
