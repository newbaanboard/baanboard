  <br />
I would like to know the programs calls through AFS they follow the same sequence of entrance of the events of the fields. I am making an AFS for cadaster of suppliers and him this making her criticizes of a field that I am valuing and he is clean when the program executes. oh he falls in the check.input of the field and as the field this emptiness he is criticized. What am making wrong? Is it necessary to ignore the first event?? I already made that but he/she didn't give right also..  <br />
  <br />
Example:  <br />
  <br />
stpapi.put.field (tccom2101m000 &quot;, &quot; tccom020.gipi.l&quot;,value)  <br />
| the value this filled out, but the check.input is executed and the value at this time this emptiness</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th July 2004, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the answer is that sometimes you do have to repeat field inputs twice.  Not all field events get executed.  After putting all the fields the save/continue/insert/update cause the field events to happen - so sometimes not all events happen correctly.  Yes - sometimes you may have to update fields twice to get a field populated.  In a couple of cases I could not get fields updated and just went and updated the table directly.<br />

  <br />
you excuses me only to come back today, my wife suffered a surgery and i was accompanying.   <br />
  <br />
Because it is, I imagined that perhaps had to do quite so. I already tried twice popular the field and it didn't give right also. Unhappily, but it is not a great problem, I will update the field directly as suggested him.  <br />

Thank you very much for the answers,  <br />
