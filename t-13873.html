<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhill5</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a function server process that adds and updates activities using function server on the session tppss2120m000.  Until recently, this has been working OK.  However, we are now getting the following error after the script has processed something in the region of 200 activities: <br />
<br />
Log_mesg: Fatal error: Error base_extern api.messages not found in proces 1602<br />
<br />
There is nothing peculiar about the activity which the script is processing when it crashes - when the script is re-started, the activity is processed successfully, only to crash again after another 200 activities or so.<br />
<br />
The session tppss2120m000 does have some local customisations made to it, but these should have been switched off when the session is called through function server, by examining the api.mode flag.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea what could be causing this error?</div></div><hr />

Now we can only process around 400 or so in our 4c3 environment.  I have not really tested it in our new 4c4 upgrade.  It looks like there is something not getting release when you end a function server, but I have never been able to trace it down.  There are other posts in this forum on this topic - no time to look for them, but I do not recall a solution.<br />
