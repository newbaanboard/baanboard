<br />
This session prints two reports (tipcs5260010002 - generated product structure and tipcfl999010002 - tax provider error report).<br />
<br />
Apparently the API cannot handle two reports in one session. When I use the set.report command on both reports, I receive an error message saying that there is no such report. When I omit the second set.report, my API session hangs.<br />
<br />
Here is the relevant part of my code:<br />
| 3. Create Product Variant Structure<br />
stpapi.handle.subproc(api.session, &quot;tipcf5260s000&quot;, &quot;add&quot;)<br />
stpapi.zoom.option(api.session, 1, &quot;tipcf5260s000&quot;, error.message)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tipcf5260s000&quot;, &quot;spool.fileout&quot;,  generated.product.variant.structure&quot;)<br />
stpapi.set.report(&quot;tipcf5260s000&quot;, &quot;rtipcf526001000&quot;, &quot;ASCIT&quot;, error.message)<br />
stpapi.continue.process(&quot;tipcf5260s000&quot;, error.message)<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;tipcf5260s000&quot;, error.message)<br />

Does anybody know of a solution/workaround for this issue?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Were you able to resolve the single report limitation using FS ?<br />
<br />
I'm facing the same problem when trying to call the session<br />
whinp1200m000 in BaanVc. This session has 3 reports. All the 3 open up one after the other when I run this session manually.<br />
When I try to call this session through FS.... nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Has anyone been able to call the whinp1200m000 through FS ? Thanks<br />
<br />
LittleJohn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I brought the case to Baan support and they were unable to solve it too.<br />
The single report is a known limitation and there was no way to suppress the second report without customizing the session.<br />
<br />
My workaround was to start over and take a different route to the same goal (Sometimes in Baan there is more than one way to can a skit).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply. <br />
<br />
The problem is, I dont have the code to customize this session or the report calls. Is there something you can suggest on how to go about this.<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />
<br />
LittleJohn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">So no, I have no suggestions on this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried sending the reports to a file - using something like device ASCIF?  Seems to me there was a recent post about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Only one report can be set, so sessions that print more than one report in one execution cannot be executed with the AFS.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that's the problem. It doesn't matter if you print it to file or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 21:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Several options, none of them as good as having the AFS work as is.  I do have the source to look.<br />
<br />
1. Request Baan modify the AFS calls to support multi reports, they just don't right now.<br />
2.  Request the most current source of whinh1200 from Baan and see if they have fixed to be api friendly, or if they will do that for you.  <br />
3.  Request a 3rd party source code provider make the change for you and deliver an api friendly version.  This is pretty common around here these days (we are a 3rd party provider).<br />
4.  Find an alternative to the session whinh1200m000.  I don't see one for yours..is there ANY other way to do this?<br />
5.  Create a job for this and run that way instead.<br />
6.  Use the wrapper programs like RMCgen and QKEY, 'rush' on these boards even, to create a library.  We make RMCgen, so I can't speak for the others,  but it looks like this would be fairly easily done...<br />
7.  In Baan V you sometimes have the option of using the DAL instead of AFS.  That's only if they have written the actual logic for the 'cont process' action in a DAL somewhere instead of all in the session (UI) script.  Unfortunately this has not been done either, all the logic for whinh1200 is in the UI (unless a newer service pack has changed this, so request the most recent source!).<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of, but as mentioned, many ways to ...what...can the skit???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">As I think about it, how about combining the Job with AFS?  Create a job, put in the printers in a job way, then call the job using AFS?  Never tried, but seems like a possible around for the multi report problems with AFS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">17th April 2005, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies....<br />
I'll try the &quot;rush&quot; option.... <br />
<br />
The setting up of JOB option by Lisa.... sounds very interesting. Never thought of that... let me see if we can make that work</div></div><hr />
