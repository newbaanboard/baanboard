  <br />
I am working with Baan Vc.  <br />
  <br />
I want to know:  <br />
  <br />
Which values are they possible in api.mode variable?.   <br />
  <br />
What does it means each one?.  <br />
  <br />
The question is for that I have been to looking in the BaanBoard, but only find some values 0 and 1, but in the program that I am doing, I found that variable can take a value 2.   <br />
  <br />
Greetings,</div></div><hr />

I had this discussion with Baan Support.  I can not remember the exact answer, but you should not check it for values.  I believe they(but don't hold me to this) said in Baan that 0 is always false and everything else is always true.  I could have that backwards, but I have since then treated boolean variables differently - I always use &quot;if api.mode then&quot; or &quot;if not api.mode then&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Then I have a serious problem, because I am trying a AFS function to Sales Ordres when the order type is collect order, then the process of warehousing or invoicing in this case the variable take a value 2. Then I needed to know in what other cases could pass this?</div></div><hr />

Yes - you might have to do mutliple checks for order types. What I am thinking is that you would do something like this:<br />
<br />
if api.mode then<br />
   if order.type = &quot;collect order&quot; then<br />
       ..... do some stuff....<br />
   else<br />
       ..... do some other stuff .....<br />
   endif<br />
endif</div></div><hr />
