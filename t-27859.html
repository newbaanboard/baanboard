<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">10th August 2006, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Had some fun with the above today, so I thought I'd share my experience.<br />
<br />
The problem: In an update to tfacr4401s000, the first line in a series would not get updated. API log looks fine. Ran it through the debugger and sure enough the first line did get its values this time.<br />
<br />
Faulty objects? Possible, but upgrades are not an option.<br />
<br />
Mark's sleep method didn't work either because of the terminal settings on the system. Tried some other means of slowing down the process but without success.<br />
<br />
So what is a boy to do?<br />
<br />
Well, if at first you don't succeed...(no, do NOT destroy all evidence that you tried!)...try again.<br />
<br />
The problem was fixed with a try-again. If first line, then do it twice. <br />
<br />
I know, I should be ashamed instead of posting it here. But this great solution cost me an entire day (and then some). Would hate to see any of you go through the same struggle.<br />
<br />
So for future reference here it is. And no, I will NOT post the code :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th August 2006, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to say it but when I have problems getting something to update I just duplicate the code and try it twice.  And yes it has worked in a couple of cases - I believe you will actually see some posts where I said &quot;try the put and save twice&quot;.  So it is a valid solution and no reason to feel ashamed. :) I can think of worse example that I have done.</div></div><hr />
