<br />
I have sales order approval work flow in place and it is working fine through ION-Ming.le. My current setting sends all sales order to DA_sales_order workflow.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if it is possible to move my order to next step manually in LN itself even though response has not been received from workflow.<br />
<br />
We are using LN 10.4.<br />
 <br />
Please let me know your thought.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Thanks for your response!!!<br />
<br />
What will happen lets say if ION/Ming.le is down because of any reason? There should be some work around, may be from IT admin side, through which orders can be checked in even though response has not been received from ION workflow? What do you think?<br />
<br />

Set the status to 'Approval received'. Secondly via the menu option in ttocm9599m000 you can process the received approval, Check in step.<br />
