<br />
We are using Ion as for Alert management,and integrated ION with our multiple site domestic as well as overseas.<br />
<br />
Since we have a requirement of Creating Purchase order through Sales order and want to know if we can use ION to create Sales order and Purchase order through ION application. Also if the same flow can be achieved within company or within two different companies.<br />
<br />
For example if in one company their is purchase order through that purchase order a sales order should be generated in other company through ION. <br />
<br />
Please suggest me how we can do it through ION.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

With a conversion in the document flow the BOD can be transformed into a LoadPurchaseOrder BOD. The receiving LN company will create a purchase order out of this. So have a look into this ION feature of conversion.<br />

<br />
Is there a way to get the SyncSalesOrder BOD to publish before the sales order is approved? Like when it's in status &quot;Free&quot;?</div></div><hr />
