   After I issued stpapi.put.field to every single field in type 4 form, I issued an stpapi.form.command. The outcome seems OK, meaning the session being controlled by API really does what I want it to do. Funny thing is that the stpapi.form.command still returns a &quot;not allowed&quot; error message although the processing was done completely and satisfactorily. This &quot;not allowed&quot; message is result of not filling up a mandatory form field. But I've issued stpapi.put.field to every field. Should I then just ignore such message whenever it comes because the processing was completed well anyway?<br />
<br />
   Thanks very much<br />

So I do ignore the errors.  I would suggest that you verify that the record did get inserted appropriately and everything works with it.  So verify that everything does work and then decide if you want to skip the error.<br />
<br />
I actually do this check in FS:<br />
<br />
	f4107s000.insert(1,fserr)<br />
	if(strip$(fserr)&lt;&gt;&quot;&quot; and strip$(fserr)&lt;&gt;&quot;Command cancelled&quot; and <br />
	fserr(1;5)&lt;&gt; &quot;Note:&quot;) then<br />
<br />
<br />
So as long as I get a &quot;Command cancelled&quot; or &quot;Note:&quot; error everything is fine.<br />
