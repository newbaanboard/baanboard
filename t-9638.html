<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">15th April 2003, 06:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for a Baan using company, that is interested in testing a program that automates archive planning and data assessment, in exchange for a data analysis and detailed archive plan.<br />
<br />
The programm:<br />
- generates a forecast of the data that is eligible for archiving per year by checking on data status and  dependencies between archive sessions and data (e.g. a purchase order is processed, but it might belong to a project, might be a subcontracting order or it hasn't been matched to a supplier invoice in finance yet); <br />
<br />
- evaluates the pre-conditions for more than 50 archive, delete and correction sessions, and generates lists with records, which still need some work (e.g. open sales orders, projects not closed, supplier invoices with balances, errors in inventory history, etc.); <br />
<br />
- generates the sequence of sessions and correction activities that have to be executed per archive year, based on the specific data in a Baan company;<br />
<br />
- gives information about the dependencies of sessions and activities to be executed, specific to system and data;<br />
<br />
- generates files with project, budget and production order numbers to be archived per year, to support archiving by year<br />
<br />
- can be used to generate lists of data that might have to be reviewed before archiving is done, (e.g. a list of product variants that are eligible for archiving);<br />
<br />
- can be used to check the archived data after archiving has been executed; <br />
<br />
- can be easily modified to include customized sessions;<br />
<br />
The program run successfully on a system of a company with about 3 Million records in tfgld410. I'm looking for a test partner with a significantly higher volume of data and ideally the modules acr, acp, cmg, gld, fas, pur, sls, edi, cms, rpl, inv, ilc, sfc, cst, edm, hra, pcs (projects and budgets) and pcf implemented (the more functionality you use, the better, but please also contact  me if you're interested and don't use all of these modules...). The program can run in one step or can be scheduled to run in up to 35 parts.<br />
<br />
I need the possibility to test if the runtime is acceptable on a system with high data volume and to make improvements if necessary. In exchange you'll get a thorough data assessment and a &quot;clean up&quot; and archive plan, that goes far beyond the usual and will make &quot;housekeeping&quot; much easier.<br />
<br />
If anybody is interested, please contact me at karin@espelage.com<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from someone, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">15th April 2003, 20:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently Baan IV. Baan V version to come. The program utilizes the Baan Enterprise Performance Manager, which is the same for Baan IV and Baan V but there are some adjustments necessary, which I have yet to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">29th April 2003, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">My apologies to anyone who might have send me an email and didn't receive an answer. A day after I posted this, I started having trouble with my email and have since changed webhosts. Now it seems as if some email got lost. I answered to all emails that I got and I found a company to partner with. If anyone still likes to contact me: now my email should be stable again ....<br />
 <br />
Again: Sorry!<br />
