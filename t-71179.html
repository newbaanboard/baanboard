I have one query on the XI Workflows. You will find a snapshot of a Workflow task in the attached document. As you would notice:-<br />
<br />
1. Certain captions are not fully visible. For example, &quot;Purchase Order&quot; shows up as &quot;Purchase ...&quot;<br />
2. Similar is the case with the value. &quot;A N P Trucking Inc&quot; appears as &quot;A N P TRUCK...&quot;. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to control the above display?<br />
<br />
3. I have added an input field on this Workflow which is of type &quot;String&quot;. Is it possible to resize this box?<br />
<br />
XI Version: 12.0.15.22<br />
LN : 10.4<br />
<br />

But it needs input from someone with Infor OS/Ming.le knowledge. Maybe there is someone on this board, However I would advise to raise this as an incident to Infor.</div></div><hr />

Hi Viral,<br />
<br />
The task structure so basic right now. Because of that as far as know it cant be resizeable. On the other hand ,When you click the 3 dots , is it appear whole text?<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<br />
Yes, if I click on the 3 dots or hover the mouse pointer over the required field, the entire value is displayed.<br />

Suppose any big amount is present , it is shown as truncated ..For example, 15,00,00,000 was shown as 1.5E8.
