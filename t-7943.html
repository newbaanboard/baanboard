<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th December 2002, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">What I would like is a session(s) which would allow me to change data through out all Baan tables.  So for example if I wanted to change part number 1 to part number 2 - this wonderful session would move through all the tables and change them appropriately.  It would allow the user to make multiple changes maybe using a file containing the changes.  <br />
<br />
Sounds easy(:)) and would be a good product for a third party solution.  Yes I realize it may run for days based on the amount of data on the system, but if a user really wanted the change they would make the time.  Maybe this already exists and I just do not know about it.<br />
<br />
The reason for this request is that we are getting ready to upgrade to 4C4, A&amp;D 1.0(I no longer know what they calling it) and implementing Baan Finance.  Because of this I have developed a program which will redo &quot;PROJECTS&quot; in all of the tables.  Still in the testing phase, but it looks feasible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th December 2002, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually think Baan should include something along these lines.  I was thinking of something so generic it would run on any system and not require any modifications.  I am actually doing it the way the third post suggested.  I find everywhere a domain is used, verify it is in the most recent VRC, export the table, process it using sed, then import the table. It is not as complicated as I thought it would be and thats why I think Baan should include something like it and if not them then some third party add-on.<br />
