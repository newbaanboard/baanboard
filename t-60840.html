<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kdhagemann</div><div class="date">13th July 2011, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi baanboard.com folks,<br />
<br />
our Baan System (Baan IVc4 SP25) was migrated from Linux to a Windows 2008 R2 Server.<br />
We are using CrystalReports9 plus &quot;Crystal Enterprise Solution Kit for Baan&quot; to run various scheduled reports (mission critical).<br />
<br />
While it is no problem to connect with CR9 to BaanIV on the Linux machine, it refuses connection to the Windows server. Error message is &quot;Logon failed. Details: Unable to logon to server. The server environment or user/password combination may be invalid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
- We are logging on to Baan on the Windows server by our ActiveDirectory system users.<br />
- Following settings are triple-checked with the BECS configuration file and definetly equal:<br />
- Server IP: ww.xx.yy.zz<br />
- Login Protocol: Rexec<br />
- BSE: C:\infor\baan\bse<br />
- Username / password (tried username and DOMAIN\username)<br />
<br />
Note: At another location we are running BaanIV on a Windows 2003 server and have no problem to connect to this server with our CR9 Reports.<br />
<br />
Is there anything to be considered during installation on the Windows 2008 R2 Server to enable connection for CR9 Reports? As we do not experience problems to a BaanIVc4 on Windows 2003 Server I assume the problem to be related with the setup on Windows 2008R2 ?<br />
<br />
Portingset Version on both servers (Linux and Windows) is 6.1c.11, which is supposed to work fine with CR9...<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your ideas and best regards,<br />

- Go back to your Linux OS<br />
<br />
--&gt; I am not sure, if &quot;Crystal Enterprise Solution Kit For Baan&quot; is available for Business Objects XI.<br />
Does anyone of you know?<br />
<br />
Is there no other way to get things going?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your kind input,<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your response. I'll give it a try - need to restart the server. Will post further findings here.<br />
