<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francoisp</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a (pre-defined) time-limit when connecting to Baan using the CreateObject function?<br />
<br />
When fetching records from the employee table I am only getting between 30 to 35 records and it takes around 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
I tried several timeout values (60, 300, 3000) but I am not getting more records.<br />
<br />
One more question: I found that fetching the records using the ParseExecFunction is a slow process. Is it me or is it really that slow?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 20:55</div></div><div class="posttext">What I use is  BaanObj.Timeout = 10.  It does work. I read a spreadsheet of production orders and go do a select for each one. I have not tried to return 100's of records in one select.<br />
<br />
Define slow?  I do believe it is slower that using a baan session and it fits my definition of slow. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francoisp</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">What I mean by slow is that it took 30 seconds to: connect to Baan, parse the query, fetch roughly 30 records and display 2 fields for each fetched record. Is this the kind of response time I have to expect?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 22:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a quick test and looks like I connect in under 5 seconds.  Once connected I start running select statements.  The first select returns the prod. order status(just one field) and each query runs less than a second - I get about three status per second.  This does running the excel code to process the data.  The second query returns 3  fields and is a little slower, but not much. So yours does sound slow and I am not sure why - it could be the client, the porting set, tools version, or even the network.<br />
<br />
I have to process about 2000 records a month using this method and from start to finish it is slow to me.  If only they would let me change one of our custom sessions. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gfasbender</div><div class="date">28th March 2003, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found that the Timeout setting is only used when  submitting a query request with ParseExecFunction. <br />
<br />
Once, Baan responds by returning data from the request, I have never timed out. And I've requested tens of thousands of rows. <br />
<br />
You probably have something wrong with your sql, or the coding loop you have to get the data.<br />
<br />
If it's taking 30 seconds to get 30 rows of data, you probably have a slow network. I've found it should take only a couple of seconds to get that kind of volumn of data, and I've worked at many different installations.<br />
<br />
I would have to see your code to help out any further.</div></div><hr />

You might be able to improve the performance by adding a &quot;DoEvents&quot; command in the fetch-get loop.<br />
<br />
In fact, using OLE on earlier versions of the Baan client would lock-up Win95/98 computers without a DoEvents in the code. Win Nt4 units would work but would be extremely slow.<br />
<br />
I've gotten away from using OLE-AFS to retrieve data from Baan and now use ADO to query the databases directly. (Oracle) I'm now using OLE-AFS to enter data into Baan.<br />

At the moment, you're about the only one with some sort of explanation what the property Timeout of Baan4.Application class does. I've tried to find documentations about it in many places, but couldn't find any. In thread $BBSE/bin files, Victor gave extensive list of Baan documentations. Based on that, I logged on to Baan Support web site and tried to find some documents that might give explanation about this namely:<br />
 Application Function Server IVc	D0072A US<br />
 UI OLE Automation Server	D0120C US<br />
 OLE Automation Extensions	D0393A US<br />
 Baan Generic Automation Server	D1055A US<br />
 UI OLE Automation Server	D1332A US<br />
but can't find any of them. Probably to be able to access these &quot;developer documents&quot; I need to have developer access right or something. Does any of you happen to have document that explain this Timeout property? If yes, could you please pass the information on this property to me, please? Thank you. Personally, I've also observed that this Timeout property doesn't seem to affect anything<br />
