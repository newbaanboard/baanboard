I found a way of doing this without custom dll's.Sub Main()<br />
Set BaanObj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;)<br />
BaanObj.ParseExecFunction &quot;ottstpstandard&quot;, &quot;zoom.to.menu(&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;tiitm0101m000&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;,2,&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;,0,0)&quot;<br />
BaanObj.Quit<br />
Set BaanObj = Nothing<br />
End SubAlso, did you know that you can get away from all of the Chr(34)'s?<br />
VB6 will let to put quotes in quotes.BaanObj.ParseExecFunction &quot;ottstpstandard&quot;, &quot;zoom.to.menu(&quot;&quot;tiitm0101m000&quot;&quot;,2,&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;,0,0)&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am a complete BAAN newbie but need your help.  I am writing batch drawing printing software using windows forms (.net) that accesses BAAN item data directly from sql server.<br />
<br />
Using the COM interface I would like to launch the BAAN session tcibd0101s000 with the fields populated for a given item from my app.  I have been experimenting with the techniques described on these forums for setting fields and finding records as well as the technique described above for launching the gui for a given session.  I cannot for the life of me combine the two!<br />
<br />
Am I missing the obvious?  I was hoping it would be as easy as doing a put, a find, maybe mark the record and then do a zoom.to.menu to display the dialog with the populated data.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have documentation on the zoom.to.menu call?  What are the other parameters used for?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
<br />

If you use AFS to access a session you can not then pop it up for interaction with the user.  There are two options (1) pop-up the session and let the user run the session and fill out the data or (2) Let the user give you the data then you run the session for them and provide them with whatever results they want to see.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps launching and sending key presses to the BAAN client might be a solution...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssabaan</div><div class="date">6th March 2006, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't do this thru AFS but you can do it thru Sendkeys functions in VB.<br />
<br />
You have to Send Keys.<br />
<br />
First Make the Baan Menu Browser as Active window<br />
<br />
then Send Key &quot;ALT&quot;, Then &quot;F&quot; then &quot;R&quot; then the session No. you want to run.<br />
Send &lt;TAB&gt; then &lt;ENTER&gt;<br />
<br />
Now if u want to work on that Session. like want to find some wthing send &lt;CTRL+ F&gt;, Send Value as &lt;First Search key&gt;, etc.<br />
<br />
VB have Send Keys function, But you hav eto be sure that in between sending Keys, you have to put delay also. Next important thing is the Speed of Baan &amp; VB Application. It is not 100% good way, but still u can use it as you will not able to do it thru AFS. yes you can call AFS session thru this.</div></div><hr />
