    We are implementing Baan CRM and we have to load items into Baan CRM database.  The whole process is going thru baan open world and it is taking hours to process few thousand records.  Rought estimate is 2-3 hours for 3000 records.  I dont know is this the way we need to load items.  We have around 80000 records.  <br />
