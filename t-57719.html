If it is a coding problem maybe if you post the code maybe someone can help - plus let us know where in the code the problem is. If a process problem maybe this needs to be moved to a different form.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freeppy</div><div class="date">1st February 2010, 05:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,mark and all<br />
thanks advance.<br />
   but I there is no error happened .Just is that we cannot find the Purchase Invoice of APE 20100255 in the session (tfcmg2106s000),so we cannot do the write off about the Advance Payment(BAG 20091515).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st February 2010, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if the record is there then a stpapi.find should work.  If the record is not there then that means you could not do it manually.</div></div><hr />
