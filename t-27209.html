Hi every bory,<br />
 I make a program that run a tisfc0102m000. My problem is when I have to backflush ths hours, because my real spent hours dont appears in the tisfc0102m000, but this occur when I run with a session that I customized, but when I run with a standard tisfc0102m000 this do not occur, the hours stay ok.<br />
I already debugued the programs and see that when the program is run the tihra1210s000, when is executed by customized program, in the cont.process is executed command print.data that dont is executed correct. Exemple:<br />
choice.cont.process:<br />
on.choice:<br />
 execute( print.data )<br />
<br />
choice.print.data:<br />
before.choice:<br />
 ||When I execute by standard tisfc0102m000 this function heve been executed correctly, but when I use my customizes program, this function do not be executing and go to after choice.<br />
 backflushing.my.hours()<br />
<br />
after.choice:<br />
 do.something()<br />
<br />
ps.: My baan version is c4 and SP8<br />
 <br />
Sorry for my English.<br />
Best regards.</div></div><hr />

Best regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure I understand - which session did you modify tisfc0102m000 or tihra1210s000?  Did you modify anything other than the scripts?  Did you add the before.choice section on print.data?  When you the session you modified manually does it execute this section?  On fishing expedition to see if something clicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goesflavio</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a program that invoque the tisfc0102m000, I did nothing in the tisfc0102m000, but when I try to call my program (customized), the tihra1210s000 dont work the before choice of print.data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm - so you added the before.choice to tihra1210s000?   I ran a test on my system which had a before.choice and on.choice sections.  All of the sections worked fine when calling with the stpapi commands.  I am beginning to think you are correct that it is in the environment - one of the sessions or your stpapi libraries.  <br />
<br />
Of course you can always try using the api.mode variable in the on.choice section of print.data.  Example:<br />
<br />
choice.print.data:<br />
on.choice:<br />
     if api.mode then<br />
          .....customized code here.......<br />
     endif<br />
<br />
But I really do think it should work as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goesflavio</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark, its funny, because when check every variables of environment its ok. I wouldnt like to use this api.mode because there are very program that can use this program now or in the future.<br />
Thants a lot Mark for your advise.<br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually what I was thinking was using this as a temporary work around. I have had to do this before while waiting for Baan to fix things.  So as a temporary work around you might be able to do this:<br />
<br />
choice.print.data:<br />
before.choice:<br />
      if not api.mode then<br />
          ....run your code.....<br />
      endif<br />
on.choice:<br />
      if api.mode then<br />
          ....run same code as above.....<br />
      endif<br />
<br />
As bad as that looks it should always work - until you find a permanent solution.  We have actually used something like that in work arounds - not in those session or sections, but in other parts of code.</div></div><hr />
