<br />
Which technology are you using ?<br />
<br />
We currently use symbol handguns running wavelink software in combination with concordia (EXL).<br />
The system runs more or less allright exept for the performance. <br />
The concordia software is all customisation and does a lot of checking of the data that is inputted. In fact all this checking has the bad impact in the performance.<br />
<br />
Please share your experiences with these kind of systems.<br />

<br />
performance!<br />
<br />
I think its more the fact that in this kind of system you have a mismatch of technology that never helps. When technology all matched up, no problems like that.<br />
<br />
I always say that you have to accept performance problems as part of the solution at the moment.</div></div><hr />
